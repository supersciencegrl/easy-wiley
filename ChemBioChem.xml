         <title>Reactivity Analysis of New Multivalent Electrophilic Probes for Affinity Labeling of Carbohydrate Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of gold nanoparticle&#8208;based affinity labeling probes multivalently presenting different electrophilic groups and a carbohydrate ligand was synthesized to evaluate their reactivity against lectins. The p&#8208; and m&#8208;isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together are promising alternatives to photoreactive groups as protein&#8208;reactive affinity labels for target identification studies.







Abstract
We have designed and synthesized six different multivalent electrophiles as carbohydrate affinity labeling probes. Evaluation of the reactivity of the electrophiles against peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) showed that p&#8208; and m&#8208;aryl sulfonyl fluoride are effective protein reactive groups that label carbohydrate binding lectins in a ligand&#8208;dependent fashion at a nanomolar probe concentration. Analysis of the selectivity of affinity labeling in the presence of excess BSA as a nonspecific protein indicated that m&#8208;arylsulfonyl fluoride is a more selective protein&#8208;reactive group, albeit with attenuated reactivity. Further analysis showed that the labeling efficiency of the multivalent electrophilic probes can be improved by employing reaction conditions involving 25&#8201;&#176;C instead of typically employed 4&#8201;&#176;C. Both isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together represent promising affinity labels for target identification studies that could serve as more efficient alternatives to photoreactive groups.

         <title>The role of spike protein mutations in the infectious power of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 variants: A molecular interaction perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific S477N, N501Y, K417N, K417T, E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein in the wild type SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus have resulted, among others, in the following variants: B.1.160 (20A or EU2, first reported in continental Europe), B1.1.7 (&#945; or 20I501Y.V1, first reported in the United Kingdom), B.1.351 (&#946; or 20H/501Y.V2, first reported in South Africa), B.1.1.28.1&#160; (&#947;&#160; or&#160; P.1&#160; or&#160; 20J/501Y.V3,&#160; first&#160; reported&#160; in&#160; Brazil),&#160; and&#160; B.1.1.28.2&#160; (&#950;,&#160; or&#160; P.2&#160; or 20B/S484K, also first reported in Brazil).&#160; From the analysis of a set of&#160; bonding descriptors firmly rooted in the formalism of quantum mechanics, including Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO), Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and highly correlated energies within the Domain Based Local Pair Natural Orbital Coupled Cluster Method (DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)), and from a set of computed electronic spectral patterns with environmental effects, we show that the new variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells. This results in significantly improved initial virus [[EQUATION]] cell molecular recognition and attachment at the microscopic level, which trigger the infectious cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Mesophilic CTP&#8208;Dependent Riboflavin Kinase and Rational Engineering to Create Its Thermostable Homologues**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinases typically use ATP to phosphorylate their substrates. But not this one! Archaeal riboflavin kinases (RibK), characterized by a unique structural fold, select CTP over all other nucleotides for phosphorylating riboflavin (Vitamin B2) to produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we report the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal RibK from Methanococcus maripaludis. Further, using structural bioinformatics and computational studies, we determined the molecular determinants that confer thermostability to MmpRibK, making this class of enzymes amenable to bioengineering applications.







Abstract
Flavins play a central role in metabolism as molecules that catalyze a wide range of redox reactions in living organisms. Several variations in flavin biosynthesis exist among the domains of life, and their analysis has revealed many new structural and mechanistic insights till date. The cytidine triphosphate (CTP)&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase in archaea is one such example. Unlike most kinases that use adenosine triphosphate, archaeal riboflavin kinases utilize CTP to phosphorylate riboflavin and produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we present the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal CTP&#8208;utilizing riboflavin kinase homologue from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmpRibK), which is linked closely in sequence to the previously characterized thermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii homologue. We reconstitute the activity of MmpRibK, determine its kinetic parameters and molecular factors that contribute to its unique properties, and finally establish the residues that improve its thermostability using computation and a series of experiments. Our work advances the molecular understanding of flavin biosynthesis in archaea by the characterization of the first mesophilic CTP&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase. Finally, it validates the role of salt bridges and rigidifying amino acid residues in imparting thermostability to this unique structural fold that characterizes archaeal riboflavin kinase enzymes, with implications in enzyme engineering and biotechnological applications.

         <title>Discovery, biocatalytic exploration and structural analysis of a 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vanillyl&#8208;alcohol oxidase (VAO) family is a rich source of biocatalysts for the oxidative bioconversion of phenolic compounds. Through genome mining and sequence comparisons, we found that several family members lack a generally conserved catalytic aspartate. This finding led us to study a VAO&#8208;homolog featuring a glutamate residue in place of the common aspartate. This 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from  Gulosibacter chungangensis  (Gc4EO) shares 42% sequence identity with VAO, contains the same 8&#945;&#8208;N3&#8208;histidyl&#8208;bound FAD and uses oxygen as electron acceptor. However, Gc4EO features a distinct substrate scope and product specificity as it is primarily effective in the dehydrogenation of  para  &#8208;substituted phenols with little generation of hydroxylated products. The three&#8208;dimensional structure shows that the characteristic glutamate side chain creates a closely packed environment that may limit water accessibility and thereby protect from hydroxylation. With its high thermal stability, well defined structural properties and high expression yields, Gc4EO may become a catalyst of choice for the specific dehydrogenation of phenolic compounds bearing small substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Gly&#8208;His&#8208;tagged Proteins with Azidogluconolactone.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific protein modifications are vital for biopharmaceutical drug development. Gluconoylation is a non&#8208;enzymatic, post&#8208;translational modification of N&#8208;terminal HisTags. We report high&#8208;yield, site&#8208;selective in vitro &#945;&#8208;aminoacylation of peptides, glycoproteins, antibodies, and Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) with azidogluconolactone at pH 7.5 in 1 h. Conjugates slowly hydrolyse, but diol&#8208;masking with borate esters inhibits reversibility. In an example, we multimerise azidogluconoylated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) onto VLPs via click&#8208;chemistry, to give a COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. Compared to yeast antigen, HEK&#8208;derived RBD was immunologically superior, likely due to observed differences in glycosylation. We show the benefits of ordered over randomly oriented multimeric antigen display, by demonstrating single&#8208;shot seroconversion and best virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies. Azidogluconoylation is simple, fast and robust chemistry, and should accelerate research and development.</dc:description>

Compared to yeast antigen, HEK-derived RBD was immunologically superior, likely due to observed differences in glycosylation. We show the benefits of ordered over randomly oriented multimeric antigen display, by demonstrating single-shot seroconversion and best virus-neutralizing antibodies. Azidogluconoylation is simple, fast and robust chemistry, and should accelerate research and development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Inclusion in cells: Supramolecular porphyrin/per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin complexation is highly specific. Per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin bearing cell&#8208;penetrating peptide and BODIPY is efficiently taken up by cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways and delivers porphyrin into the cells. The supramolecular complexation in cells was directly detected by FRET between porphyrin and BODIPY.







Abstract
Artificial supramolecular systems capable of self&#8208;assembly and that precisely function in biological media are in high demand. Herein, we demonstrate a highly specific host&#8208;guest&#8208;pair system that functions in living cells. A per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative (R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe) bearing both an octaarginine peptide chain and a BODIPY dye was synthesized as a fluorescent intracellular delivery tool. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe was efficiently taken up by HeLa cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) as a guest molecule in water, from which fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe to TPPS was observed. The FRET phenomenon was clearly detected in living cells using confocal microscopy techniques, which revealed that the formed supramolecular R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe/TPPS complex was maintained within the cells. The R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe cytotoxicity assay revealed that the addition of TPPS counteracts the strong cytotoxicity (IC50=16&#8197;&#956;M) of the CD cavity due to complexation within the cells. A series of experiments demonstrated the bio&#8208;orthogonality of the supramolecular per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD/tetraarylporphyrin host&#8208;guest pair in living cells.

         <title>Red&#8208;Blood&#8208;Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Metal&#8208;Drug Nanoparticles for Enhanced Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) were designed and synthesized that self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. The obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell membranes to improve their stability and dispersity.







Abstract
To overcome high toxicity, low bioavailability and poor water solubility of chemotherapeutics, a variety of drug carriers have been designed. However, most carriers are severely limited by low drug loading capacity and adverse side e&#64256;ects. Here, a new type of metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) was designed and synthesized. The MDNs self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. To assist systemic delivery and prolong circulation time, the obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell (RBCs) membranes (RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs) to improve their stability and dispersity. The RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs presented pH&#8208;responsive release functionalities, resulting in drug release accelerated in acidic tumor microenvironments. The outstanding in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor therapeutic outcome was realized by RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs. This study provides an innovative design guideline for chemotherapy and demonstrates the great capacity of nanomaterials in anticancer treatments.

         <title>Structural Basis for The Recognition of Deaminated Nucleobases by An Archaeal DNA Polymerase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their life in hot environments, archaea are increasingly affected by deamination of the bases cytosine and adenine. To prevent mutations, archaeal DNA polymerases seem to recognize these base changes by a so&#8208;called &#8220;read&#8208;ahead&#8221; mechanism and react accordingly. Here we show by means of crystal structures how Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase binds uracil and hypoxanthine in a special binding pocket and thus can recognize these bases on the single stranded template overhang already six nucleotides before the active site.







Abstract
With increasing temperature, nucleobases in DNA become increasingly damaged by hydrolysis of exocyclic amines. The most prominent damage includes the conversion of cytosine to uracil and adenine to hypoxanthine. These damages are mutagenic and put the integrity of the genome at risk if not repaired appropriately. Several archaea live at elevated temperatures and thus, are exposed to a higher risk of deamination. Earlier studies have shown that DNA polymerases of archaea have the property of sensing deaminated nucleobases in the DNA template and thereby stalling the DNA synthesis during DNA replication providing another layer of DNA damage recognition and repair. However, the structural basis of uracil and hypoxanthine sensing by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases is sparse. Here we report on three new crystal structures of the archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase in complex with primer and template strands that have extended single stranded DNA template 5&#8217;&#8208;overhangs. These overhangs contain either the canonical nucleobases as well as uracil or hypoxanthine, respectively, and provide unprecedented structural insights into their recognition by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases.

         <title>B4GALNT2 Controls Sda and SLex Antigen Biosynthesis in Healthy and Cancer Human Colon</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the progress made in understanding the various regulatory mechanisms underpinning Sda and SLex expression in the human gastrointestinal tract.







Abstract
The Sda carbohydrate antigen and the corresponding biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 are primarily expressed in human normal colonic mucosa and are down&#8208;regulated to variable degrees in colon cancer. On the other hand, the tumor associated antigen SLex is not detected in the healthy colon and is upregulated in colon cancer. High level of B4GALNT2 gene expression appears to be a good marker of prognosis in colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating these carbohydrate antigens&#8217; expression are still poorly understood. We review here the most recent progress made towards understanding this balanced expression of blood group carbohydrate epitopes Sda and SLex. In particular in recent years, we have attained a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of the B4GALNT2 gene and of the subcellular fate of B4GALNT2 isoforms.

         <dc:description>
Nanorobots are considered an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming option for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. We classified nanorobots into two types: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. One is equipped with self&#8208;propulsion and dynamic control ability while the other can detect the biological signal and perform controlled drug release. Moreover, prospects and challenges of nanorobots are discussed, intending to promote their clinical translation.







Abstract
Nanotechnology has been widely applied to the fabrication of drug delivery systems in the past decades. Recently, with the progress made in microfabrication approaches, nanorobots are steadily becoming a promising means for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. In general, nanorobots can be divided into two categories: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. Nanomotors are nanoscale systems with the ability to convert surrounding energies into mechanical motion, whereas stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are featured with activatable capacity in response to various endogenous and exogenous stimulations. In this minireview, the dynamic control of nanomotors and the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are overviewed, with particular emphasis on their contribution to tumor&#8208;targeting therapy. Moreover, challenges and perspectives associated with the future development of nanorobots are presented.

         <title>The Innate Immune Glycoprotein Lactoferrin Represses the Helicobacter pylori cag Type IV Secretion System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2783-2790, September 14, 2021. </description>

Helicobacter pylori infection results in enhanced host production of lactoferrin which participates in nutritional immunity and can also serve as a source of nutrient iron for this pathogen, which can repress a major oncogenic virulence factor, the cag T4SS.







Abstract
Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric diseases including gastric cancer. Despite development of a robust immune response, H.&#8197;pylori persists in the gastric niche. Progression of gastric inflammation to serious disease outcomes is associated with infection with H.&#8197;pylori strains which encode the cag Type&#8197;IV Secretion System (cag&#8197;T4SS). The cag T4SS is responsible for translocating the oncogenic protein CagA into host cells and inducing pro&#8208;inflammatory and carcinogenic signaling cascades. Our previous work demonstrated that nutrient iron modulates the activity of the T4SS and biogenesis of T4SS pili. In response to H.&#8197;pylori infection, the host produces a variety of antimicrobial molecules, including the iron&#8208;binding glycoprotein, lactoferrin. Our work shows that apo&#8208;lactoferrin exerts antimicrobial activity against H.&#8197;pylori under iron&#8208;limited conditions, while holo&#8208;lactoferrin enhances bacterial growth. Culturing H.&#8197;pylori in the presence of holo&#8208;lactoferrin prior to co&#8208;culture with gastric epithelial cells, results in repression of the cag&#8197;T4SS activity. Concomitantly, a decrease in biogenesis of cag&#8197;T4SS pili at the host&#8208;pathogen interface was observed under these culture conditions by high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy analyses. Taken together, these results indicate that acquisition of alternate sources of nutrient iron plays a role in regulating the pro&#8208;inflammatory activity of a bacterial secretion system and present novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of H.&#8197;pylori&#8208;related disease.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2777-2782, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmolyte synthesis at elevated temperatures: 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is produced on industrial scale using the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of sucrose phosphorylase. We engineered the catalytic efficiency and regioselectivity of a sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable than the one currently used in industry.







Abstract
2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by various bacteria and plants in response to environmental stress. It is widely applied as a bioactive moisturising ingredient in skin care products, for which it is manufactured via enzymatic glucosylation of glycerol by the sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This industrial process is operated at room temperature due to the mediocre stability of the biocatalyst, often leading to microbial contamination. The highly thermostable sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis could be a better alternative in that regard, but this enzyme is not fit for production of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol due to its low regioselectivity and poor affinity for glycerol. In this work, the thermostable phosphorylase was engineered to alleviate these problems. Several engineering approaches were explored, ranging from site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to conventional, binary, iterative or combinatorial randomisation of the active site, resulting in the screening of &#8764;3,900 variants. Variant P134Q displayed a 21&#8208;fold increase in catalytic efficiency for glycerol, as well as a threefold improvement in regioselectivity towards the 2&#8208;position of the substrate, while retaining its activity for several days at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Evaluation of an E. coli Cell Extract Prepared by Lysozyme&#8208;Assisted Sonication via Gene Expression, Phage Assembly and Proteomics</title>

E. coli extracts can be prepared using a simple combination of lysozyme incubation and ultrasonication. We evaluate their performance in cell&#8208;free protein expression via the expression of reporter proteins, the assembly of bacteriophages, and using proteomics. Our results show a synergistic effect of both lysis methods.







Abstract
Over the past decades, starting from crude cell extracts, a variety of successful preparation protocols and optimized reaction conditions have been established for the production of cell&#8208;free gene expression systems. One of the crucial steps during the preparation of cell extract&#8208;based expression systems is the cell lysis procedure itself, which largely determines the quality of the active components of the extract. Here we evaluate the utility of an E. coli cell extract, which was prepared using a combination of lysozyme incubation and a gentle sonication step. As quality measure, we demonstrate the cell&#8208;free expression of YFP at concentrations up to 0.6&#8197;mg/mL. In addition, we produced and assembled T7 bacteriophages up to a titer of 108&#8197;PFU/mL. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantitative proteomics was used to compare the produced extracts with each other and with a commercial extract. The differences in protein composition were surprisingly small between lysozyme&#8208;assisted sonication (LAS) extracts, but we observed an increase in the release of DNA&#8208;binding proteins for increasing numbers of sonication cycles. Proteins taking part in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, amino acid and nucleotide related pathways were found to be more abundant in the LAS extract, while proteins related to RNA modification and processing, DNA modification and replication, transcription regulation, initiation, termination and the TCA cycle were found enriched in the commercial extract.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Solid&#8208;Phase Assay for Substrate Profiling and Directed Evolution of Transketolase</title>

A pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (wild type or variants) in combination with donor (&#945;&#8208;ketoacids) and acceptor substrates (aldehydes), obviating enzyme extraction.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes, and specifically transketolases, form one of the most important families of biocatalytic tools for enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation yielding various hydroxyketones of biological interest. To enable substrate profiling of transketolases for acceptance of different donors and acceptors, a&#8197;simple, direct colorimetric assay based on pH reaction variation was developed to establish a&#8197;high&#8208;throughput solid&#8208;phase assay. This assay reduces the screening effort in the directed evolution of transketolases, as only active variants are selected for further analysis. Transketolase activity is detected as bicarbonate anions released from the &#945;&#8208;ketoacid donor substrate, which causes the pH to rise. A&#8197;pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase variants, obviating enzyme extraction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A pH indicator&lt;/b&gt;, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase from &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; (wild type or variants) in combination with donor (&#945;-ketoacids) and acceptor substrates (aldehydes), obviating enzyme extraction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes, and specifically transketolases, form one of the most important families of biocatalytic tools for enantioselective carbon-carbon bond formation yielding various hydroxyketones of biological interest. To enable substrate profiling of transketolases for acceptance of different donors and acceptors, a&#8197;simple, direct colorimetric assay based on pH reaction variation was developed to establish a&#8197;high-throughput solid-phase assay. This assay reduces the screening effort in the directed evolution of transketolases, as only active variants are selected for further analysis. Transketolase activity is detected as bicarbonate anions released from the &#945;-ketoacid donor substrate, which causes the pH to rise. A&#8197;pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase variants, obviating enzyme extraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evaluation of Naturally Occurring HIF&#8208;1 Inhibitors for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>

Activation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1) leads to expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Six naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified using the developed cell&#8208;based assay. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors are thus effective in decreasing PDK1, which causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.







Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe progressive disorder characterized by high pulmonary artery pressure. Chronic hypoxia causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) is a key enzyme in Warburg effect increased by hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1). We constructed a cell&#8208;based luciferase assay system for HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors. Using this system, six HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified. Among these inhibitors, the effect of tagitinin&#8197;C (1) on PASMC was investigated. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. This result indicates that HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors effectively decrease PDK1 activity, which is a cause of the metabolic disorder and Warburg effect observed in PASMCs. Identifying naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors could provide novel insights into the development of PAH medications.

         <title>Engineered RebH Halogenase Variants Demonstrating a Specificity Switch from Tryptophan towards Novel Indole Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2791-2798, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two engineered halogenase enzymes were developed by switching substrate specificity of the parental enzyme from tryptophan to indole compounds. They can halogenate several industrially important indole derivatives more efficiently than the parental enzyme; this includes enzymatic chlorination/bromination of novel substrates that were not reported previously. The engineered enzymes could be useful in regioselective synthesis of drug intermediates.







Abstract
Activating industrially important aromatic hydrocarbons by installing halogen atoms is extremely important in organic synthesis and often improves the pharmacological properties of drug molecules. To this end, tryptophan halogenase enzymes are potentially valuable tools for regioselective halogenation of arenes, including various industrially important indole derivatives and similar scaffolds. Although endogenous enzymes show reasonable substrate scope towards indole compounds, their efficacy can often be improved by engineering. Using a structure&#8208;guided semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis approach, we have developed two RebH variants with expanded biocatalytic repertoires that can efficiently halogenate several novel indole substrates and produce important pharmaceutical intermediates. Interestingly, the engineered enzymes are completely inactive towards their natural substrate tryptophan in spite of their high tolerance to various functional groups in the indole ring. Computational modelling and molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic insights into the role of gatekeeper residues in the substrate binding site and the dramatic switch in substrate specificity when these are mutated.

H. pylori is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial pathogen that infects the stomach and causes ulcers and gastric cancer. The host innate immune system produces the glycoprotein lactoferrin as part of the antimicrobial response to bacterial infection, and this molecule can repress the oncogenic activity of the H. pylori cag T4SS in an iron&#8208;dependent manner.

Enzyme engineering for the synthesis of a cosmetic ingredient: The osmolyte 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol is widely applied as a bioactive moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and personal&#8208;care products. It is produced on an industrial scale by exploiting the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of a sucrose phosphorylase, but the enzyme currently used suffers from poor thermostability. A homologous sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable was engineered to drastically improve its catalytic performance for the synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol, enabling the production of this compound at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Recent Advances in Late&#8208;Stage Construction of Stapled Peptides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2762-2771, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation stapling strategies of peptides catalyzed by transition metals, such as palladium, rhodium, and manganese, are discussed. These strategies which rely on directing groups (DGs) in the reaction can be classified into three categories: (1)&#8197;directly constructing stapled peptides without DGs; (2)&#8197;those using peptide backbones as DGs; (3)&#8197;those that install additional DGs to generate stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides have been widely applied in many fields, including pharmaceutical chemistry, diagnostic reagents, and materials science. However, most traditional stapled peptide preparation methods rely on prefunctionalizations, which limit the diversity of stapled peptides. Recently, the emergence of late&#8208;stage transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation in amino acids and peptides has attracted wide interest due to its robustness and applicability for peptide stapling. In this review, we summarize the methods for late&#8208;stage construction of stapled peptides via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Inhibitors of CA IX Enzyme Based on Polyhedral Boron Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2741-2761, September 14, 2021. </description>

The review covers several classes of inhibitors specific for carbonic anhydrase IX enzyme that emerged recently from a non&#8208;traditional concept. This is characterized by combination of space&#8208;filing inorganic (metalla)carborane cluster with sulfamide and sulfonamide binding motif for Zn2+ in the active site. The structural factors essential for attaining high activity and selectivity for the CA IX isoform are discussed. Results from preclinical studies show relevance of these compounds for development of anticancer drugs.







Abstract
This review describes recent progress in the design and development of inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) based on space&#8208;filling carborane and cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters. CA IX enzyme is known to play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and metastases. The new class of potent and selective CA IX inhibitors combines the structural motif of a bulky inorganic cluster with an alkylsulfamido or alkylsulfonamido anchor group for Zn2+ ion in the enzyme active site. Detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of a large series containing 50 compounds uncovered structural features of the cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors that are important for efficient and selective inhibition of CA IX activity. Preclinical evaluation of selected compounds revealed low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics and ability to reduce tumor growth. Cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors of CA IX can thus be considered as promising candidates for drug development and/or for combination therapy in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).

         <title>Comparisons of &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Propensity Among Peptides with Homochiral or Heterochiral Strands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2772-2776, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As predicted by Pauling and Corey, pairing of homochiral (all&#8208;L) peptide strands leads to pleated &#946;&#8208;sheets, while pairing of L and D strands leads to rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets. Our evidence indicates that heterochiral strand pairing in aqueous solution is less favorable than homochiral strand pairing.







Abstract
Assemblies of racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides have attracted attention for biomedical applications because racemic forms of peptides can self&#8208;associate more avidly than do single enantiomers. In 1953, Pauling and Corey proposed &#8220;rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; modes of H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated interstrand assembly for alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;peptide strands; this structural hypothesis was complementary to their proposal of &#8220;pleated &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; assembly for L&#8208;peptides. Although no high&#8208;resolution structure has been reported for a rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet, there is strong evidence for the occurrence of rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets in some racemic peptide assemblies. Here we compare propensities of peptide diastereomers in aqueous solution to form a minimum increment of &#946;&#8208;sheet in which two antiparallel strands associate. &#946;&#8208;Hairpin folding is observed for homochiral peptides with aligned nonpolar side chains, but no &#946;&#8208;hairpin population can be detected for diastereomers in which one strand contains L residues and the other contains D residues. These observations suggest that rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are stabilized by interactions between &#946;&#8208;sheet layers rather than interactions within these layers.

         <dc:description>Endosomal escape continues to be a limiting factor in the therapeutic use of nanomaterials. Assays to visualize endosomal escape often do not decouple the endosomal/lysosomal disruption from the release of payload into the cytosol. Here, we discuss three approaches to directly probe endosomal/lysosomal rupture: calcein dye dilution, lysosome size quantification and endosome/lysosome membrane integrity visualized with a genetically engineered cell line. We apply the three assays to endosomes/lysosomes ruptured via osmotic pressure and photochemical internalization.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical ligation reaction of DNA is useful for the construction of long functional DNA using oligonucleotide fragments that are prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis. However, the unnatural linkage structure formed by ligation reaction generally impairs the biological function of the resulting ligated DNA. We achieved the complete chemical synthesis of 78 and 258 bp synthetic DNAs via multiple chemical ligation reactions with phosphorothioate and haloacyl&#8208;modified DNA fragments. The latter synthetic DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a designed truncated SV promoter sequence, did successfully induce the expected gene silencing effect in HeLa cells.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoro&#8208;substituted and heteroaromatic compounds are valuable intermediates for a variety of applications in pharma&#8208; and agrochemistry and synthetic chemistry. This study investigates the chemoenzymatic preparation of chiral alcohols bearing a heteroaromatic ring with an increasing degree of fluorination in &#945;&#8208;position. Starting from readily available picoline derivatives prochiral &#945;&#8208;halogenated acyl moieties were introduced with excellent selectivity and 64&#8208;95% yield.

This study investigates the chemoenzymatic preparation of chiral alcohols bearing a heteroaromatic ring with an increasing degree of fluorination in &#945;-position. Starting from readily available picoline derivatives prochiral &#945;-halogenated acyl moieties were introduced with excellent selectivity and 64-95% yield. The formed carbonyl group was subsequently reduced to the corresponding alcohols using the alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir yielding an enantiomeric excess of 95 - &amp;gt;99% and up to 98% yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs allows efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The method will make existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies to probe and manipulate proteins in live cells accessible in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models.







Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized studies on human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac&#8208;mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to an amber stop codon. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA&#8208;bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site&#8208;directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC&#8208;derived cell types and complex tissue models.

         <title>Xylose&#8208;Configured Cyclophellitols as Selective Inhibitors for Glucocerebrosidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New selective GBA inhibitor: We show that the &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylose configured epoxide and aziridine are potent selective inhibitors towards GBA in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and their selectivity and inhibitory effect towards GBA are superior to the widely used GBA inhibitor Conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE).







Abstract
Glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidase, has recently been shown to hydrolyze &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides and to transxylosylate cholesterol. Genetic defects in GBA cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD), and also constitute a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. GBA and other retaining glycosidases can be selectively visualized by activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) using fluorescent probes composed of a cyclophellitol scaffold having a configuration tailored to the targeted glycosidase family. GBA processes &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides in addition to &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosides, this in contrast to the other two mammalian cellular retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidases, GBA2 and GBA3. Here we show that the xylopyranose preference also holds up for covalent inhibitors: xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridines selectively react with GBA over GBA2 and GBA3 in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and that the xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol is more potent and more selective for GBA than the classical GBA inhibitor, conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE). Both xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridine cause accumulation of glucosylsphingosine in zebrafish embryo, a characteristic hallmark of GD, and we conclude that these compounds are well suited for creating such chemically induced GD models.

         <title>S&#8208;Denitrosylase&#8208;Like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Conjugated with Xaa&#8208;His Dipeptide: Role of Proline Spacer as a Key Activity Booster</title>

         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine conjugated with Pro&#8208;His dipeptide, a novel S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic, effectively promoted the cysteinyl S&#8208;denitrosylation and prevented protein misfolding caused by the S&#8208;nitrosylation. Structural analyses of the compound suggested that the diselenol form, which is produced as a key reactive species during the catalytic reaction, is thermodynamically stabilized by forming a &#947;&#8208;turn, dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity.







Abstract
This study developed dipeptide&#8208;conjugated 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine (1), i.&#8201;e., 1&#8208;Xaa&#8208;His, as a new class of S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic. The synthesized compounds, especially 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His, remarkably promoted S&#8208;denitrosylation of nitrosothiols (RSNO) via a catalytic cycle involving the reversible redox reaction between the diselenide and its corresponding diselenol ([SeH,SeH]) form with coexisting reductant thiols (R&#8242;SH), during which the [SeH,SeH] form as a key reactive species reduces RSNO to the corresponding thiol (RSH). Structural analyses of 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His suggested that the peptide backbone of [SeH,SeH] is rigidly bent to form a &#947;&#8208;turn, possibly including an NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se hydrogen bond between the imidazole ring of His and selenol group, thus stabilizing the [SeH,SeH] form thermodynamically, and dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the synthetic compounds were found to prohibit S&#8208;nitrosylation&#8208;induced protein misfolding in the presence of RSNO, eventually implying their potential as a drug seed for misfolding diseases caused by the dysregulation of the S&#8208;denitrosylation system.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Enzymology for Diagnostics: Profiling Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule enzymology can be used to profile heterogeneous enzyme activity in clinical samples. A diluted sample is mixed with a substrate, and the mixture is loaded to a microwell array. The change in fluorescence over time in wells containing an enzyme is used to quantify the enzyme activity, resulting in a distinct fingerprint for the target enzyme. This fingerprint is used for the quantification of multiple enzyme isotypes in the sample.







Abstract
Enzymes can be used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, profiling enzyme activity in clinical samples is challenging due to the heterogeneity in enzyme activity, and the low abundance of the target enzyme in biofluids. Single&#8208;molecule methods can overcome these challenges by providing information on the distribution of enzyme activities in a sample. Here, we describe the concept of using the single&#8208;molecule enzymology (SME) method to analyze enzymatic activity in clinical samples. We present recent work focused on measuring alkaline phosphatase isotypes in serum samples using SME. Future work will involve improving and simplifying this technology, and applying it to other enzymes for diagnostics.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL were identified and validated in this study. It was demonstrated how each of these residues is crucial for the formation of the methyllanthionine &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks from Cys thiols and dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine residues in the modified globisporin precursor peptide SgbA(S20T).







Abstract
Lanthipeptides belong to the family of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and are subdivided into different classes based on their processing enzymes. The three&#8208;domain class IV lanthipeptide synthetases (LanL enzymes) consist of N&#8208;terminal lyase, central kinase, and C&#8208;terminal cyclase domains. While the catalytic residues of the kinase domains (mediating ATP&#8208;dependent Ser/Thr phosphorylations) and the lyase domains (carrying out subsequent phosphoserine/phosphothreonine (pSer/pThr) eliminations to yield dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine (Dha/Dhb) residues) have been characterized previously, such studies are missing for LanL cyclase domains. To close this gap of knowledge, this study reports on the identification and validation of the catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL, which facilitate the nucleophilic attacks by Cys thiols on Dha/Dhb residues for the formation of &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks.

         <title>Potent Tau Aggregation Inhibitor D&#8208;Peptides Selected against Tau&#8208;Repeat 2 Using Mirror Image Phage Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. We employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify Tau binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides prevent the formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich Tau fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. They might be interesting for AD therapy.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Therefore, inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. Two hexapeptides within Tau, designated PHF6* (275&#8208;VQIINK&#8208;280) and PHF6 (306&#8208;VQIVYK&#8208;311), are known to promote Tau aggregation. Recently, the PHF6* segment has been described as the more potent driver of Tau aggregation. We therefore employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptide MMD3 and its retro&#8208;inverso form, designated MMD3rev, inhibited in&#8197;vitro fibrillization of the PHF6* peptide, the repeat domain of Tau as well as full&#8208;length Tau. Dynamic light scattering, pelleting assays and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that MMD3 prevents the formation of tau &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. NMR data suggest that the D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides bound to Tau monomers with rather low affinity, but ELISA (enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) data demonstrated binding to PHF6* and full length Tau fibrils. In addition, molecular insight into the binding mode of MMD3 to PHF6* fibrils were gained by in silico modelling. The identified PHF6*&#8208;targeting peptides were able to penetrate cells. The study establishes PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids as potential molecules for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in AD research.

         <title>Exosomes as Targeted Delivery Platform of CRISPR/Cas9 for Therapeutic Genome Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Granting CRISPR/Cas9 molecules a protecting shield and a guiding &#8220;GPS&#8221;, engineered exosomes enable genome editing selectively in targeted cells or tissues. These natural vehicles also encompass rich functional molecules which their synthetic counterparts do not have, making them an appealing tool for both basic research and translational medicine.







Abstract
Therapeutic genome editing harnesses the power of genome editing tools to correct erroneous genes associated with disease pathology. To bring the CRISPR/Cas9 tool from the bench to the bedside, a critical hurdle is the safe and efficient delivery of this nucleic acid tool to the desired type of cells in patients. This review discusses the use of natural carriers, extracellular vesicles (EVs), in particular exosomes, to fill the gap. Exosomes are lipid&#8208;containing nanovesicle released by various types of cells to mediate cell&#8208;cell communications. Their inherent long&#8208;distance transportation capability, biocompatibility, and engineerability have made EVs potential vehicles for delivering therapeutic drugs. We summarize the recent progress of harnessing exosomes as delivery vehicles for the CRISPR/Cas system to achieve therapeutic gene editing for disease treatment, with a focus on various strategies to achieve selective delivery to a particular type of cell and efficient packaging of the genome editing tools in the vesicles. Critical issues and possible solutions in the design and engineering of the targeting vehicles are highlighted. Taken together, we demonstrate EV/exosome&#8208;mediated packaging of the nucleic acid/protein tools and the cell/tissue&#8208;targeted delivery to be a viable way towards the clinical translation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

         <title>Development of Tyrphostin Analogues to Study Inhibition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pup Proteasome System**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like (pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development. In this study a screen was performed identifying Tyrphostins as low micromolar inhibitors of the Mtb protease Dop. To gain insight in the important functional aspects of these inhibitors, 25 new analogues were prepared and validated, in&#8197;vitro. Several new compounds were able to inhibit both the depupylating activity of Dop as well as the pupylating activity of de pup ligase PafA.







Abstract
Tuberculosis is a global health problem caused by infection with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacteria. Although antibiotic treatment has dramatically reduced the impact of tuberculosis on the population, the existence and spreading of drug resistant strains urgently demands the development of new drugs that target Mtb in a different manner than currently used antibiotics. The prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (Pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development as it is unique to Mtb and related bacterial genera. Using a Pup&#8208;based fluorogenic substrate, we screened for inhibitors of Dop, the Mtb depupylating protease, and identified I&#8208;OMe&#8208;Tyrphostin AG538 (1) and Tyrphostin AG538 (2). The hits were validated and determined to be fast&#8208;reversible, non&#8208;ATP competitive inhibitors. We synthesized &gt;25 analogs of 1 and 2 and show that several of the synthesized compounds also inhibit the depupylation actions of Dop on native substrate, FabD&#8208;Pup. Importantly, the pupylation activity of PafA, the sole Pup ligase in Mtb, was also inhibited by some of these compounds.

         <title>Chimeric Flaviviral RNA&#8722;siRNA Molecules Resist Degradation by The Exoribonuclease Xrn1 and Trigger Gene Silencing in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules comprising an Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA motif (xrRNA) and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex were engineered. The molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in mammalian cells. This work sets the stage for further investigations into using xrRNA motifs as building blocks in RNA&#8208;based nanotechnology.







Abstract
RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery, but the susceptibility of RNA to nuclease degradation remains a major barrier to its implementation in&#8197;vivo. Here, we engineered flaviviral Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA (xrRNA) motifs to host small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. The xrRNA&#8208;siRNA molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in 293T cells. The resistance of the molecules to Xrn1 does not translate to stability in blood serum. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that flavivirus&#8208;derived xrRNA motifs can confer Xrn1 resistance on a model therapeutic payload and set the stage for further investigations into using the motifs as building blocks in RNA nanotechnology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chimeric molecules&lt;/b&gt; comprising an Xrn1-resistant RNA motif (xrRNA) and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex were engineered. The molecules self-assemble &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in mammalian cells. This work sets the stage for further investigations into using xrRNA motifs as building blocks in RNA-based nanotechnology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery, but the susceptibility of RNA to nuclease degradation remains a major barrier to its implementation &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we engineered flaviviral Xrn1-resistant RNA (xrRNA) motifs to host small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. The xrRNA-siRNA molecules self-assemble &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in 293T cells. The resistance of the molecules to Xrn1 does not translate to stability in blood serum. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that flavivirus-derived xrRNA motifs can confer Xrn1 resistance on a model therapeutic payload and set the stage for further investigations into using the motifs as building blocks in RNA nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP): A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate (DAP) is a dinitrogenous derivative of orthophosphate with demonstrated prebiotic phosphorylation capabilities in aqueous medium. The ability of DAP to facilitate phosphorylation&#8208;mediated transformation of a range of abiotic and biotic molecules warrants a deeper scrutiny of: (a)&#8197;its plausible geochemical provenance on the early Earth, (b)&#8197;its prospects for synthetic and bioorganic chemistry applications, and (c)&#8197;its potential role in transforming various classes of molecules leading to systems with emergent properties capable of exhibiting life&#8208;like behavior (synthetic biology). The graphic was designed by Dr. Eddy&#8197;I. Jim&#233;nez (Scripps Research). More information can be found in the Review by A. Osumah and R. Krishnamurthy.

         <title>Modular Design of Supramolecular Ionic Peptides with Cell&#8208;Selective Membrane Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of materials that show cell selective membrane activity is an effective strategy for the development of targeted molecular imaging and therapy. Here we report a new class of cationic multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated molecular transformation and supramolecular assembly to form nanofibers in which cationic clusters are presented on a rigid &#946;&#8208;sheet backbone. This structural transformation, which is induced by cells overexpressing the specific enzymes, led to a shift in the membrane perturbation potential of the MDPs, and consequently enhanced cell uptake and drug delivery efficacy. We envision the directed self&#8208;assembly based on modularly designed MDPs is a highly promising approach to generate dynamic supramolecular nanomaterials with emerging membrane activity for a range of disease targeted molecular imaging and therapy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>TET&#8208;like oxidation in 5&#8208;methylcytosine and derivatives: A computational and experimental study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) is an important factor in DNA modification and epigenetics. It can be modified through a three&#8208;step oxidation performed by ten&#8208;eleven&#8208;translocation (TET) enzymes and we have previously reported that the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [Fe(O)(Py  5  Me  2  H)]  2+  (  1  ) can oxidize 5mC. Here, we report the reactivity of this iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex towards a wider scope of methylated cytosine and uracil derivatives relevant for synthetic DNA applications, such as 1&#8208;methylcytosine (1mC), 5&#8208;methyl  iso  cytosine (5m  i  C) and thymine (T/5mU). The observed kinetic parameters are corroborated by calculation of the C&#8208;H bond energies at the reactive sites which was found to be an efficient tool for reaction rate prediction of  1  towards methylated DNA bases. We identified oxidation products of methylated cytosine derivatives using HPLC&#8208;MS and GC&#8208;MS. Thereby, we shed light on the impact of the methyl group position and resulting C&#8208;H bond dissociation energies on reactivity towards TET&#8208;like oxidation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiamine (vitamin B  1  ) is crucial for life and plays a central role in metabolism. It contains thiazole and pyrimidine moieties that are constructed independently and then assembled together to generate thiamine phosphate. The study of the thiazole moiety is relatively clear, but deciphering the mechanistic enzymology of thiamine pyrimidine is more difficult. This review aims to summarize the recent research progress on ThiC rearrangement, mainly including the mechanism, related enzymes, and genes involved in the rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in PROTAC&#8208;mediated Protein Degradation: From Bench to Clinic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), an emerging paradigm&#8208;shifting technology, hijacks the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. PROTACs induce ternary complexes between an E3 ligase and protein of interest (POI), and this induced proximity leads to poly&#8208;ubiquitin chain formation on substrate proteins and eventual proteasomal&#8208;mediated POI degradation. PROTACs have shown therapeutic potential by degrading many disease&#8208;causing proteins, such as the androgen receptor and BRD4. The PROTAC technology has advanced significantly in the last two decades, targeting an expanding repertoire of POIs. Herein, we describe recent PROTAC technology developments, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic studies, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>What is the Sugar Code?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A code is defined by the nature of the symbols, which generate information&#8208;storing combinations (e.g. oligo&#8208; and polymers). Like nucleic acids and proteins, oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides are an ubiquitous platform for establishing molecular messages. An unsurpassed coding capacity is possible by variability in anomery and linkage positions of the glycosidic bond, in ring size and branching. The enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis (writers) builds a large vocabulary. Dynamic editing/erasing occur as known from nucleic acids and proteins. Matching glycome diversity, a large panel of sugar receptors (lectins) has developed. Lectins &#8216;read&#8217; the glycan&#8208;encoded information. Modular design of lectins together with various types of glycan display and the nature of the cognate glycoconjugate account for the large number of post&#8208;binding events. They give an entry to the glycan vocabulary its functional, often context&#8208;dependent meaning(s), hereby building the dictionary of the sugar code.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;rays Actuate Anticancer Drugs: Opening New Vistas in Prodrug Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prodrug approach has emerged as a promising strategy for alleviating important limitations of small&#8208;molecule blockbuster chemotherapeutic drugs. Efficient and precise activation of a prodrug is the key for achieving the full potential of this strategy. Herein, we highlight the potential of X&#8208;rays for activating a prodrug locally in deep&#8208;seated tumors and point out its advantage over other activation triggers such as light.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality employed in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. Despite proven clinical success, adverse side effects are one of the drawbacks of this approach. The prodrug strategy has emerged as an alternative approach with the aim of alleviating these drawbacks. Prodrug activation is typically achieved by either endogenous or exogenous triggers. Exogenous triggers like light are appealing as they are independent of inherent patient and/or cancer&#8208;type variations. However, tissue penetration depth remains the Achilles&#8217; heel of this approach. In this context, usage of X&#8208;rays as the external trigger with infinite tissue penetration depth opens up exciting prospects in prodrug activation strategies.

         <title>Differential Effect of Azetidine Substitution in Firefly Luciferin Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assemble the puzzle: Replacing the N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in classical fluorophores with a four membered azetidine ring provides improved quantum yields. This strategy was extended to four types of bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and its differential effect was evaluated. Among them, the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from azetidine substitution and showed improvements of in fluorescence and bioluminescence emission.







Abstract
Replacing an N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in a classical fluorophore with a four membered azetidine ring provides an improved luminescence quantum yield. Herein, we extended this strategy to bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and evaluated its general validity. For this purpose, four types of luciferin cores were employed, and a total of eight analogues were evaluated. Among these analogues, unexpectedly, only the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from an azetidine substitution and showed enhanced bioluminescence. In addition, fluorescence measurements revealed that an azetidine substitution improved the fluorescence quantum yield by 2.3&#8208;times compared to a N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group. These findings clarify the differential effects of azetidine substituents in luciferins and present one possible strategy for enhancing photon output in benzothiazole type luciferins through a synthetic approach.

         <title>Forward Chemical Genetic Screen for Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxins Uncovers New Covalent Fragments that Target GPX4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen is a central player in most aspects of life &#8211; without it, many life&#8208;giving processes will drag to a halt. Remarkably, some cell death mechanisms also require the presence of oxygen. In their study, Cordon et&#8197;al. show how oxygen&#8208;deprivation impedes the execution of ferroptosis in cancer cells. Ferroptosis is an oxidative cell death process that ultimately leads to oxidation and destruction of lipid membranes. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of oxygen when developing anticancer treatments. The graphic was created with assistance from Lise Balsby and Astrid Friis Reitzel (Aarhus University). More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;B. Poulsen et&#8197;al.

         <title>Surface Density of Ligands Controls In&#8208;Plane and Aggregative Modes of Multivalent Glycovesicle&#8208;Lectin Recognitions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of inter&#8208; and intracellular carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions that determine an inhibitory or productive biological function was investigated using glycovesicles as a synthetic membrane system. The ligand densities hold the key to the interactions occurring through either intramolecular or aggregative modes of binding. Nanomolar binding affinities govern these modes, within which the in&#8208;plane mode is more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.







Abstract
Glycovesicles are ideal tools to delineate finer mechanisms of the interactions at the biological cell membranes. Multivalency forms the basis which, in turn, should surpass more than one mechanism in order to maintain multiple roles that the ligand&#8208;lectin interactions encounter. Ligand densities hold a prime control to attenuate the interactions. In the present study, mannose trisaccharide interacting with a cognate receptor, namely, Con A, is assessed at the vesicle surface. Synthetic (1&#8594;3)(1&#8594;6)&#8208;branched mannose trisaccharides tethered with a diacetylene monomer and glycovesicles of varying sugar densities were prepared. The polydiacetylene vesicles were prepared by maintaining uniform lipid concentrations. The interactions of the glycovesicles with the lectin were probed through dynamic light scattering and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy techniques. Binding efficacies were assessed by surface plasmon resonance. Aggregative and in&#8208;plane modes of interactions show ligand&#8208;density dependence at the vesicle surface. Vesicles with sparsely populated ligands engage lectin in an aggregative mode (trans&#8208;), leading to a cross&#8208;linked complex formation. Whereas glycovesicles embedded with dense ligands engage lectin interaction in an in&#8208;plane mode intramolecularly (cis&#8208;). Sub&#8208;nanomolar dissociation constants govern the intramolecular interaction occurring within the plane of the vesicle, and are more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Photoactivation of Innate Immunity Receptor TLR8 in Live Mammalian Cells by Genetic Encoding of Photocaged Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;controllable TLR8 system was developed by site&#8208;specific genetic encoding of photocaged tyrosine to ensure spatiotemporal control of receptor function. The activity of TLR8 is masked in caged forms but can be restored upon decaging by exposure to UV light, making it a suitable tool for TLR8 function and regulatory mechanism studies.







Abstract
The effectiveness of innate immune responses relies on an intricate balance between activation and regulation. TLR8, a member of the Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) family, plays a fundamental role in host defense by sensing viral single&#8208;stranded RNAs (ssRNAs). However, the molecular recognition and regulatory mechanism of TLR8 is not fully understood, especially in a whole&#8208;cell environment. Here, we engineer the first light&#8208;controllable TLR8 model by genetically encoding a photocaged tyrosine, NBY, into specific sites of TLR8. In the caged forms, the activity of TLR8 is masked but can be restored upon decaging by exposure to UV light. To explain the mechanism clearly, we divide the sites with light responsiveness into three groups. They can separately block the ligands that bind to the pockets of TLR8, change the interaction modes between two TLR8 protomers, and interfere with the interactions between TLR8 cytosolic domains with its downstream adaptor. Specifically, we use this chemical caging strategy to probe and evaluate the function of several tyrosine sites located at the interface of TLR8 homodimers with a previously unknown regulatory mode, which may provide a new strategy for TLR8 modulator development. Effects on downstream signaling pathways are monitored at the transcriptional and translational levels in various cell lines. By photoactivating specific cells within a larger population, this powerful tool can provide novel mechanistic insights, with potential in biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.

         <dc:description>
Protein targeting through host&#8208;guest recognition is an exciting area but is limited by the lack of specific recognition element on protein. Chemical biology methods for site&#8208;specific protein modification provide powerful tools for introducing guest molecules into proteins and will greatly expand the scope of protein targeting using supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins is of great interest for the development of novel approaches to recognize, isolate and control proteins. Taking advantage of chemical biology approaches, such as genetic&#8208;code expansion and enzyme&#8208;mediated ligation, guest recognition elements can be built into proteins of interest, allowing supramolecular control of protein function and regulation. In this viewpoint article, we will discuss the methods, applications, limitations, and future perspectives of supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins in a site&#8208;specific manner.

         <title>Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy Enables to Quantify the Affinity Between DNA and Proteins in Cell Lysate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research targets on the quantitative determination of protein&#8208;to&#8208;ligand binding in complex cellular environments. Fluorine protein labelling has been utilized enabling to analyze signal height, line width and chemical shift upon DNA binding in great detail employing high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and simulations. This approach can be easily applied to studies generally interested in interaction processes taking place in cellular environments.







Abstract
The determination of the binding affinity quantifying the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is of crucial interest in biological and chemical research. Here, we have made use of site&#8208;specific fluorine labeling of the cold shock protein from Bacillus subtilis, BsCspB, enabling to directly monitor the interaction with single stranded DNA molecules in cell lysate. High&#8208;resolution 19F NMR spectroscopy has been applied to exclusively report on resonance signals arising from the protein under study. We have found that this experimental approach advances the reliable determination of the binding affinity between single stranded DNA molecules and its target protein in this complex biological environment by intertwining analyses based on NMR chemical shifts, signal heights, line shapes and simulations. We propose that the developed experimental platform offers a potent approach for the identification of binding affinities characterizing intermolecular interactions in native surroundings covering the nano&#8208;to&#8208;micromolar range that can be even expanded to in cell applications in future studies.

         <title>Construction of Synthetic Nanobody Library in Mammalian Cells by dsDNA&#8208;Based Strategies**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells: Two novel methods for the construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells, called dsDNA&#8208;HR and in&#8197;vitro ligation, were developed. Both methods generated over a million unique nanobody sequences as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing.







Abstract
A nanobody is an antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antigen&#8208;binding domain. Mammalian cells are ideal platforms for identifying nanobodies targeting hard&#8208;to&#8208;display transmembrane proteins and nanobodies that function as modulators of cellular phenotypes. However, the introduction of a high&#8208;diversity nanobody library into mammalian cells is challenging. We have developed two novel methods for constructing a nanobody library in mammalian cells. Complementarity&#8208;determining region (CDR) random sequences were first incorporated into upstream and downstream dsDNAs by PCR. In the first method, named dsDNA&#8208;HR, upstream and downstream dsDNAs containing an identical overlapping sequence were co&#8208;transfected into cultured mammalian cells for intracellular homologous recombination that resulted in the formation of an intact nanobody library expression cassette. In the second method, named in&#8197;vitro ligation, we generated full&#8208;length nanobody expression dsDNAs via ligation of restriction digested upstream and downstream dsDNAs. The obtained full&#8208;length dsDNAs were transfected into mammalian cells for nanobody library expression. Using both methods, we generated over a million unique nanobody sequences, as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Single&#8208;cell sequencing was employed to resolve the diversity of the dsDNA&#8208;HR nanobody library. We also identified a small molecule, Nocodazole, which could enhance the efficacy of dsDNA&#8208;HR.

         <title>NAD(H)&#8208;PEG Swing Arms Improve Both the Activities and Stabilities of Modularly&#8208;Assembled Transhydrogenases Designed with Predictable Selectivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using synthetic PEG&#8208;NAD(H) cofactor swing arms, we demonstrate the modular assembly of dehydrogenases to produce a series of novel, self&#8208;contained synthetic transhydrogenases. We also show that the stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites.







Abstract
Protein engineering has been used to enhance the activities, selectivities, and stabilities of enzymes. Frequently tradeoffs are observed, where improvements in some features can come at the expense of others. Nature uses modular assembly of active sites for complex, multi&#8208;step reactions, and natural &#8220;swing arm&#8221; mechanisms have evolved to transfer intermediates between active sites. Biomimetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) swing arms modified with NAD(H) have been explored to introduce synthetic swing arms into fused oxidoreductases. Here we report that increasing NAD(H)&#8208;PEG swing arms can improve the activity of synthetic formate:malate oxidoreductases as well as the thermal and operational stabilities of the biocatalysts. The modular assembly approach enables the KM values of new enzymes to be predictable, based on the parental enzymes. We describe four unique synthetic transhydrogenases that have no native homologs, and this platform could be easily extended for the predictive design of additional synthetic cofactor&#8208;independent transhydrogenases.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of 3&#8208;Sulfopropionaldehyde Reductase HpfD</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfoquinovose is a globally abundant organosulfur compound. Degradation by communities of anaerobic bacteria produce 3&#8208;hydroxypropanesulfonate, catalysed by sulfopropionaldehyde reductase HpfD. Biochemical investigation of HpfD revealed dehydrogenase activity for a range of alcohols, including 3&#8208;hydroxypropanesulfonate, 4&#8208;hydroxybutanesulfonate and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. Bioinformatics investigations suggest involvement of HpfD homologs in 3&#8208;HPS and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyrate degradation.







Abstract
Sulfoquinovose is the polar headgroup of plant sulfolipids and is a globally abundant organosulfur compound, and its degradation by bacteria is an important component of the sulfur cycle. Sulfoquinovose degradation by certain bacteria, including Escherichia coli, produces dihydroxypropanesulfonate (DHPS), which is further converted by anaerobic bacteria into 3&#8208;hydroxypropanesulfonate (3&#8208;HPS), through the catalytic action of DHPS dehydratase (a member of the glycyl radical enzyme family), and sulfopropionaldehyde reductase HpfD (a member of the metal&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family). Here we report biochemical investigation of Hungatella hathewayi HpfD. In addition to 3&#8208;HPS, HpfD also displayed high catalytic activities for NAD+&#8208;dependent oxidation of 4&#8208;hydroxybutanesulfonate (4&#8208;HBS) and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The highest activity was obtained with Fe2+ or Mn2+ as the divalent metal cofactor. Bioinformatics studies suggest that, in addition to DHPS degradation, 3&#8208;HPS and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyrate (GABA) degradations also involve HpfD homologs.

Acyl group migration is a fundamental phenomenon in carbohydrate chemistry, recently shown to take place also between two non&#8208;adjacent hydroxyl groups, across the glycosidic bond, in a &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked mannan trisaccharide model compound. With the central mannoside unit containing acetyl groups at the O2 and O3 positions, the O2&#8208;acetyl was in the earlier study shown to migrate to O6 of the reducing end. Potential implications of the general acyl migration process on cell signaling events and plant growth in nature are intriguing open questions. In the present work, migration kinetics in this original trisaccharide model system were studied in more detail together with potential interactions of the model compound and the migration products with DC&#8208;SIGN lectin. Furthermore, we demonstrate here for the first time that similar migration may also take place in native polysaccharides, here represented by galactoglucomannan from Norway spruce.

&lt;p&gt;Acyl group migration is a fundamental phenomenon in carbohydrate chemistry, recently shown to take place also between two non-adjacent hydroxyl groups, across the glycosidic bond, in a &#946;-(1&#8594;4)-linked mannan trisaccharide model compound. With the central mannoside unit containing acetyl groups at the O2 and O3 positions, the O2-acetyl was in the earlier study shown to migrate to O6 of the reducing end. Potential implications of the general acyl migration process on cell signaling events and plant growth in nature are intriguing open questions. In the present work, migration kinetics in this original trisaccharide model system were studied in more detail together with potential interactions of the model compound and the migration products with DC-SIGN lectin. Furthermore, we demonstrate here for the first time that similar migration may also take place in native polysaccharides, here represented by galactoglucomannan from Norway spruce.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Functional protein nanotechnology: The cover feature illustrates the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of redox&#8208;sensitive artificial proteins. The disulfide functionality is placed strategically in between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of the artificial protein. The hydrophobic domain drives the self&#8208;assembly of artificial proteins to form monodisperse protein nanoparticles. Treatment of protein nanoparticles with dithiothreitol (DTT) results in cleavage of disulfide bonds and subsequent disassembly of protein nanoparticles due to cleavage of the hydrophobic domain. This work lays the foundation for pushing the boundaries of functional protein nanotechnology. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;J. Bhandari and B.&#8197;S.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;PAINT Enables Investigation of Endogenous Talin with Molecular Scale Resolution in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new single&#8208;molecule microscopy technique allows the analysis of a central cell adhesion protein with molecular resolution in cells. Using a direct peptide&#8208;PAINT approach, endogenously expressed talin molecules can be detected and quantified, enabling nanoscale analysis even in genetically unmodified cells and tissue sections. The image illustrates raw data from individual talin localization signals (upper left) that are processed to identify distinct cell&#8208;adhesion clusters (lower right) and individual talin molecules (zoom&#8208;in, center).

         <title>Alpha Synuclein only Forms Fibrils In Vitro when Larger than its Critical Size of 70 Monomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical size for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to form a stable fibrils, which can then replicate by monomer addition and fragmentation, has been found to be 70 monomers. Preventing aggregates from reaching this critical size would be a key cellular protective mechanism.







Abstract
The aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into small soluble aggregates and then fibrils is important in the development and spreading of aggregates through the brain in Parkinson's disease. Fibrillar aggregates can grow by monomer addition and then break into fragments that could spread into neighboring cells. The rate constants for fibril elongation and fragmentation have been measured but it is not known how large an aggregate needs to be before fibril formation is thermodynamically favorable. This critical size is an important parameter controlling at what stage in an aggregation reaction fibrils can form and replicate. We determined this value to be approximately 70 monomers using super&#8208;resolution and atomic force microscopy imaging of individual &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates formed in solution over long time periods. This represents the minimum size for a stable &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril and we hypothesis the formation of aggregates of this size in a cell represents a tipping point at which rapid replication occurs.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this comprehensive review, I focus on the twenty  E. coli  aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases and their ability to charge non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) onto tRNAs. The promiscuity of these enzymes has been harnessed for diverse applications including understanding and engineering of protein function, creation of organisms with an expanded genetic code, and the synthesis of diverse peptide libraries for drug discovery. The review catalogs the structures of all known ncAA substrates for each of the 20  E. coli  aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including ncAA substrates for engineered versions of these enzymes. Drawing from the structures in the list, I highlight trends and novel opportunities for further exploitation of these ncAAs in the engineering of protein function, synthetic biology, and in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>An Advanced &#8216;clickECM&#8217; That Can be Modified by the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic glycoengineering was employed to incorporate dienophiles (terminal alkenes and a cyclopropene) into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ASCs). A subsequent inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction allowed the equipment of the ECM with bioactive molecules, opening numerous applications.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the natural environment of cells in tissue and therefore is a promising biomaterial in a variety of applications. Depending on the purpose, it is necessary to equip the ECM with specific addressable functional groups for further modification with bioactive molecules, for controllable cross&#8208;linking and/or covalent binding to surfaces. Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) enables the specific modification of the ECM with such functional groups without affecting the native structure of the ECM. In a previous approach (S.&#8197;M. Ruff, S. Keller, D.&#8197;E. Wieland, V. Wittmann, G.&#8197;E.&#8197;M. Tovar, M. Bach, P.&#8197;J. Kluger, Acta Biomater. 2017, 52, 159&#8211;170), we demonstrated the modification of an ECM with azido groups, which can be addressed by bioorthogonal copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Here, we demonstrate the modification of an ECM with dienophiles (terminal alkenes, cyclopropene), which can be addressed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. This reaction is cell friendly as there are no cytotoxic catalysts needed. We show the equipment of the ECM with a bioactive molecule (enzyme) and prove that the functional groups do not influence cellular behavior. Thus, this new material has great potential for use as a biomaterial, which can be individually modified in a wide range of applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metabolic glycoengineering&lt;/b&gt; was employed to incorporate dienophiles (terminal alkenes and a cyclopropene) into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). A subsequent inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction allowed the equipment of the ECM with bioactive molecules, opening numerous applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the natural environment of cells in tissue and therefore is a promising biomaterial in a variety of applications. Depending on the purpose, it is necessary to equip the ECM with specific addressable functional groups for further modification with bioactive molecules, for controllable cross-linking and/or covalent binding to surfaces. Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) enables the specific modification of the ECM with such functional groups without affecting the native structure of the ECM. In a previous approach (S.&#8197;M. Ruff, S. Keller, D.&#8197;E. Wieland, V. Wittmann, G.&#8197;E.&#8197;M. Tovar, M. Bach, P.&#8197;J. Kluger, &lt;i&gt;Acta Biomater&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;2017&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;52&lt;/i&gt;, 159&#8211;170), we demonstrated the modification of an ECM with azido groups, which can be addressed by bioorthogonal copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Here, we demonstrate the modification of an ECM with dienophiles (terminal alkenes, cyclopropene), which can be addressed by an inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction. This reaction is cell friendly as there are no cytotoxic catalysts needed. We show the equipment of the ECM with a bioactive molecule (enzyme) and prove that the functional groups do not influence cellular behavior. Thus, this new material has great potential for use as a biomaterial, which can be individually modified in a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogen  M. tuberculosis  , affects millions of people world&#8208;wide. Several TB drugs have lost efficacy due to emerging drug resistance and new anti&#8208;TB targets are needed. Recent research suggests that indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) in  M. tuberculosis  (  Mt  IGPS) could be such a target. IGPS is an (&#946;/&#945;)  8  &#8208;barrel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1&#8208;(o&#8208;carboxyphenylamino)&#8208;1&#8208;deoxyribulose 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (CdRP) into indole&#8208;glycerol&#8208;phosphate (IGP) in the bacterial tryptophan biosynthetic pathway.  M. tuberculosis  over expresses the tryptophan pathway genes during an immune response and inhibition of  Mt  IGPS allows CD4 T&#8208;cells to more effectively fight against  M. tuberculosis  . Here we review the published data on  Mt  IGPS expression, purification, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition. We also discuss  Mt  IGPS crystal structures and compare them to other IGPS structures to reveal potential structure&#8208;function relationships of interest for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Building siRNAs with Cubes: Synthesis and Evaluation of Cubane&#8208;Modified siRNAs</title>

siRNA lego: Cubane&#8208;functionalized siRNAs lead to potent RNAi&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;silencing activity, and improved strand selection.







Abstract
Cubane molecules hold great potential for medicinal chemistry applications due to their inherent stability and low toxicity. In this study, we report the synthesis of a cubane derivative phosphoramidite for the incorporation of cubane into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Synthetic siRNAs rely on chemical modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profiles. However, they are still able to mediate sequence&#8208;specific gene silencing via the endogenous RNA interference pathway. We designed a library of siRNAs bearing cubane at different positions within the sense and antisense strands. All siRNAs showed excellent gene&#8208;silencing activity, with IC50 values ranging from 45.4 to 305&#8197;pM. Incorporating the cubane modification in both the sense and antisense strand led to viable duplexes with good biological activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of siRNAs bearing a cubane derivative within the backbone.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fungal metabolite Fosfonochlorin features a chloroacetyl moiety that is unusual within known phosphonate natural product biochemistry. Putative biosynthetic genes encoding Fosfonochlorin in  Fusarium  and  Talaromyces  spp. were investigated through reactions of encoded enzymes with synthetic substrates and isotope labelling studies. We show that early biosynthetic steps for Fosfonochlorin involves the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to form 2&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, followed by oxidative intramolecular cyclization of the resulting alcohol to form (  S  )&#8208;epoxyethylphosphonic acid. The latter reaction is catalyzed by FfnD, a rare example of a non&#8208;heme iron / 2&#8208;(oxo)glutarate dependent oxacyclase. In contrast, FfnD behaves as a more typical oxygenase with ethylphosphonic acid, producing (  S  )&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid. FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.</dc:description>

Functional protein nanotechnology: We have combined in&#8208;house developed micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology with N&#8208;terminal protein bioconjugation to synthesize diverse protein nanoparticles with advanced functions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric protease to form a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex &#8220;proteasome&#8221; enables targeted protein degradation in living cells. Naturally occurring proteasomes serve as an inspiration and blueprint for the design of artificial protein&#8208;based nanoreactors. Here we disclose a general chemical strategy for the design of proteasome&#8208;like nanoreactors. Micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology along with the N&#8208;terminal bioconjugation strategy is utilized for the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined monodisperse self&#8208;assembling semi&#8208;synthetic protease. The designed protein is programmed to self&#8208;assemble into a proteasome&#8208;like nanostructure which preserves the functional properties of native protease.

         <title>An Autophagy&#8208;Disrupting Small Molecule Promotes Cancer Cell Death via Caspase Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz), identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library, is reported. Autophazole is mainly internalized into lysosomes and disrupts their function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces LMP&#8208;mediated caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. We anticipate that Atz will be a useful chemical probe for elucidating details about the autophagic process and understanding the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I. Shin et&#8197;al.

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP): A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate (DAP), a di&#8208;nitrogenous analogue of orthophosphate, is a versatile phosphorylating&#8208;activating reagent and amine source in the context of aqueous prebiotic chemistry compatible with both prebiotic&#8208; and bio&#8208;molecules. The promising potential of this reagent, enabling a continuous transition from abiotic&#8208;to&#8208;biotic needs to be investigated both from its geochemical provenance and its applicability to (bio)organic transformations.







Abstract
Known since the 1890s, diamidophosphate (DAP) has been investigated within the context of its inorganic chemistry. In 1999 &#8211; with the demonstration of DAP's potential as a&#8197;phosphorylating agent of sugars in aqueous medium &#8211; began the exciting phase of research about DAP's role as a&#8197;plausible prebiotic phosphorylating agent. More recently, in the last five years, there has been a steady increase in the publications that have documented the surprising versatility of DAP enabling the emergence of many classes of biomolecules of life, such as nucleic acids, peptides and protocells. Thus, though in its infancy, DAP seems to be uniquely positioned to play a central role in modelling abiotic&#8208; to prebiotic&#8208;chemical evolution. In this context, there is a need for systematic investigations for: (a)&#8197;establishing DAP's likely availability on the early Earth, and (b)&#8197;developing DAP's potential as a tool for use in synthetic and bioorganic chemistry.

         <title>Probing the Role of Chirality in Phospholipid Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular handedness, or chirality, can determine the nature of molecular interactions. A key feature of life is the homochirality of biological molecules, including phospholipids. Chemical probes have been used to understand stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes, which has been applied to the development of safer therapeutics and selective chemical tools.







Abstract
Nucleotides, amino acids, sugars, and lipids are almost ubiquitously homochiral within individual cells on Earth. While oligonucleotides and proteins exist as one natural chirality throughout the tree of life, two stereoisomers of phospholipids have separately emerged in archaea and bacteria, an evolutionary divergence known as &#8220;the lipid divide&#8221;. Within this review, we focus on the emergence of phospholipid homochirality and compare the stability of synthetic homochiral and heterochiral membranes in&#8197;vitro. We discuss chemical probes designed to study the stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes in&#8197;vitro. Overall, we aim to highlight studies that help elucidate the determinants of stereospecific interactions between lipids, peptides, and small molecule ligands. Continued work in understanding the drivers of favorable interactions between chiral molecules and biological membranes will lead to the design of increasingly selective chemical tools for bioorthogonal labeling of lipid membranes and safer membrane&#8208;associating pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Complex&#8208;Based G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Selective Luminescent &#8216;Light&#8208;up&#8217; Probe for RNase H Activity Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex&#8208;based, highly selective photoluminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; probe for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA has been developed and utilized for selective RNase H activity detection. The PL light&#8208;up is solely due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide sidearm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was supported by molecular docking analysis.







Abstract
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex, 1[PF6]2 of benzothiazole amide substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (bmbbipy) has been synthesized for the selective detection of G&#8208;quadruplex (GQ) DNA and luminescence&#8208;assay&#8208;based RNase H activity monitoring. Compound 1[PF6]2 exhibited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in water. Aggregate formation was supported by DLS, UV&#8208;vis, and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy results, and the morphology of aggregated particles was witnessed by SEM and TEM. 1[PF6]2 acted as an efficient GQ DNA&#8208;selective luminescent light&#8208;up probe over single&#8208;stranded and double&#8208;stranded DNA. The competency of 1[PF6]2 for selective GQ structure detection was established by PL and CD spectroscopy. For 1[PF6]2, the PL light&#8208;up is exclusively due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide side arm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was analyzed by molecular docking analysis. The GQ structure detection capability of 1[PF6]2 was further applied in the luminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; RNase H activity detection. The assay utilized an RNA:DNA hybrid, obtained from 22AG2&#8208;RNA and 22AG2&#8208;DNA sequences. RNase H solely hydrolyzed the RNA of the RNA:DNA duplex and released G&#8208;rich 22AG2&#8208;DNA, which was detected via the PL enhancement of 1[PF6]2. The selectivity of RNase H activity detection over various other restriction enzymes was also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
A chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates is reported. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain.







Abstract
The reversible nature of disulfide functionality has been exploited to design intelligent materials such as nanocapsules, micelles, vesicles, inorganic nanoparticles, peptide and nucleic acid nanodevices. Herein, we report a new chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The disulfide functionality is strategically placed between the dendron and protein domains. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the protein assemblies is demonstrated using a suitable redox trigger.

         <title>The Chemical Biology&#8208;Medicinal Chemistry Continuum: EFMC&#8242;s Vision</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scientific continuum? EFMC covers the field of chemical biology to medicinal chemistry. What are these disciplines, and how do they differentiate, if at all? This article discusses EFMC's current understanding of chemical biology, and its relation to medicinal chemistry, biology and biochemistry. Chemical biology includes many activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools, and their use to probe, characterize or influence biological systems.







Abstract
The European Federation for Medicinal chemistry and Chemical biology (EFMC) is a federation of learned societies. It groups organizations of European scientists working in a dynamic field spanning chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. New ideas, tools, and technologies emerging from a wide array of scientific disciplines continuously energize this rapidly evolving area. Medicinal chemistry is the design, synthesis, and optimization of biologically active molecules aimed at discovering new drug candidates &#8211; a mission that in many ways overlaps with the scope of chemical biology. Chemical biology is by now a mature field of science for which a more precise definition of what it encompasses, in the frame of EFMC, is timely. This article discusses chemical biology as currently understood by EFMC, including all activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools and their use to probe, characterize, or influence biological systems.

         <title>Enzymatic Assays to Explore Viral mRNA Capping Machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To escape recognition by the host innate immune system, viruses often incorporate 5&#8242; caps into their mRNAs. The differences in mRNA capping make this process an interesting therapeutic target. Here, we review methods to explore the enzymes involved in cap biosynthesis. Such methods allow inhibitor selection, facilitating antiviral drug discovery, which is especially important considering the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks.







Abstract
In eukaryotes, mRNA is modified by the addition of the 7&#8208;methylguanosine (m7G) 5&#8242; cap to protect mRNA from premature degradation, thereby enhancing translation and enabling differentiation between self (endogenous) and non&#8208;self RNAs (e.&#8201;g., viral ones). Viruses often develop their own mRNA capping pathways to augment the expression of their proteins and escape host innate immune response. Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and facilitate drug discovery, e.&#8201;g., against viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks, such as beta&#8208;coronaviruses SARS&#8208;CoV (2002), MARS&#8208;CoV (2012), and the most recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, proper methods for the screening of large compound libraries are required to identify lead structures that could serve as a basis for rational antiviral drug design. This review summarizes the methods that allow the monitoring of the activity and inhibition of enzymes involved in mRNA capping.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;PAINT Enables Investigation of Endogenous Talin with Molecular Scale Resolution in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PIPKI&#947;&#8208;peptide&#8208;PAINT approach is introduced in this study to enable quantitative investigation of the cell adhesion protein talin with single&#8208;molecule resolution in cells. The technique does not require genetic modifications and allows the analysis of endogenously expressed molecules. The first application reveals atypical adhesion structures in differentiating mesenchymal stem cells.







Abstract
Talin is a cell adhesion molecule that is indispensable for the development and function of multicellular organisms. Despite its central role for many cell biological processes, suitable methods to investigate the nanoscale organization of talin in its native environment are missing. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining single&#8208;molecule resolved PAINT (points accumulation in nanoscale topography) imaging with the IRIS (image reconstruction by integrating exchangeable single&#8208;molecule localization) approach, enabling the quantitative analysis of genetically unmodified talin molecules in cells. We demonstrate that a previously reported peptide can be utilized to specifically label the two major talin isoforms expressed in mammalian tissues with a localization precision of &lt;10&#8197;nm. Our experiments show that the methodology performs equally well as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;molecule localization techniques, and the first applications reveal a thus far undescribed cell adhesion structure in differentiating stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this peptide&#8208;PAINT technique to mouse tissues paving the way to single&#8208;protein imaging of endogenous talin proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Imaging and Identification of Bacterial Toxins Causing Mushroom Soft Rot and Cavity Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of genome mining, metabolic profiling, and imaging techniques (MALDI and UV Raman spectroscopy) provided insight into the arsenal of antifungals produced by the mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola. Targeted gene knockouts and bioassays link these antifungals to prevalent symptoms of mushroom soft rot, browning, and impaired mycelium growth.







Abstract
Soft rot disease of edible mushrooms leads to rapid degeneration of fungal tissue and thus severely affects farming productivity worldwide. The bacterial mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola has been identified as the cause. Yet, little is known about the molecular basis of the infection, the spatial distribution and the biological role of antifungal agents and toxins involved in this infectious disease. We combine genome mining, metabolic profiling, MALDI&#8208;Imaging and UV Raman spectroscopy, to detect, identify and visualize a complex of chemical mediators and toxins produced by the pathogen during the infection process, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin, and sinapigladioside. Furthermore, targeted gene knockouts and in&#8197;vitro assays link antifungal agents to prevalent symptoms of soft rot, mushroom browning, and impaired mycelium growth. Comparisons of related pathogenic, mutualistic and environmental Burkholderia spp. indicate that the arsenal of antifungal agents may have paved the way for ancestral bacteria to colonize niches where frequent, antagonistic interactions with fungi occur. Our findings not only demonstrate the power of label&#8208;free, in&#8197;vivo detection of polyyne virulence factors by Raman imaging, but may also inspire new approaches to disease control.

         <title>Synthesis of KUE&#8208;siRNA Conjugates for Prostate Cancer Cell&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates were constructed based on propargyl&#8208;terminated siRNAs and lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE) ligands. These siRNA conjugates could selectively enter prostate cancer cells expressing prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to mediate the specific gene knockdown.







Abstract
The delivery of siRNAs to selectively target cells poses a great challenge in RNAi&#8208;based cancer therapy. The lack of suitable cell&#8208;targeting methods seriously restricts the advance in delivering siRNAs to extrahepatic tissues. Based on prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting ligands, we have synthesized a series of lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE)&#8208;siRNA conjugates and verified their effective cell uptake and gene silencing properties in prostate cancers. The results indicated that the KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates could selectively enter PSMA+ LNCaP cells, eventually down&#8208;regulating STAT3 expression. Based on post&#8208;synthesis modification and receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, this strategy of constructing ligand&#8208;siRNA conjugates might provide a general method of siRNA delivery for cell&#8208;targeted gene silencing.

         <title>Sphaeropsidin A: a Pimarane Diterpene with Interesting Biological Activities and Promising Practical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fungal pimarane diterpene sphaeropsidin A (SphA) has shown promising application in agriculture and medicine. This article reviews its biosynthetic origins, fungal sources, preparation of semisynthetic derivatives and biological activities as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies.







Abstract
Sphaeropsidin A (SphA) is a tetracyclic pimarane diterpene, first isolated as the main phytotoxin produced by Diplodia cupressi the causal agent of a severe canker disease of Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens&#8197;L.). It was also produced, together with several analogues, by different pathogenic Diplodia species and other fungi and showed a broad array of biological activities suggesting its promising application in agriculture and medicine. The anticancer activity of SphA is very potent and cell specific. Recent studies have revealed its unique mode of action. This minireview reports the structures of SphA and its family of natural analogues, their biosynthetic origins, their fungal sources, and biological activities. The preparation of various SphA derivatives is also described as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies and on their potential practical applications.

         <title>Recent Developments and Strategies for Mutually Orthogonal Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of mutually exclusive &#8216;orthogonal bioorthogonal&#8217; reaction pairs has received increasing attention over the past decade. This minireview discusses strategies that have been employed to achieve successful dual and triple ligation systems that display both good kinetics and minimal cross&#8208;reactivities. These tools have potential applications for the observation of simultaneous biological processes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Over the past decade, several different metal&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions have been developed to enable simultaneous double&#8208;click labeling with minimal&#8208;to&#8208;no competing cross&#8208;reactivities; such transformations are termed &#8216;mutually orthogonal&#8217;. More recently, several examples of successful triple ligation strategies have also been described. In this minireview, we discuss selected aspects of the development of orthogonal bioorthogonal reactions over the past decade, including general strategies to drive future innovations to achieve simultaneous, mutually orthogonal click reactions in one pot.

         <title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Natural Products of Commensal Microbiota as an Environmental Selection Pressure for the Rise of New Variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico studies suggest that NPs like bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) produced by bacteria residing in the respiratory tract can interfere with the binding of the original strain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to the ACE2 receptor but not with the binding of the emerging variants having the N501Y mutation. Thus, it is hypothesized that NPs of respiratory tract bacteria are an environmental selection pressure for the rise of new variants of the virus with higher infectivity rate.







Abstract
Since the emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, little attention has been paid to the interplay between the interaction of virus and commensal microbiota. Here, we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations to study the interaction of some of the known metabolites and natural products (NPs) produced by commensal microbiota with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The results predict that NPs of commensal microbiota such as bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs), of which some are siderophores, bind to the wild&#8208;type RBD and interfere with its binding to the ACE2 receptor. N501Y mutation, which is present in many of the emerging variants of the virus, abolishes the predicted binding pocket of bile acids and NRPs. Based on these findings, available experimental data showing that bile acids reduce the binding affinity of wild&#8208;type RBD to the ACE2 receptor, and the data suggesting that the respiratory tract microbiota affect viral infection we put forward the following proposal: mutations such as N501Y enable the RBD to bind to the ACE2 receptor more effectively in the presence of NPs produced by the respiratory tract bacteria thereby, increasing the infectivity rate of the virus. We hope our data stimulate future works to better understand the interactions of NPs produced by commensal microbiota with respiratory viruses like SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>An Autophagy&#8208;Disrupting Small Molecule Promotes Cancer Cell Death via Caspase Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz) is reported which was identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. Autophazole was found to disrupt lysosomal function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization&#8208;associated apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
A novel autophagy inhibitor, autophazole (Atz), which promoted cancer cell death via caspase activation, is described. This compound was identified from cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. The results showed that Atz was internalized into lysosomes of cells where it induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). This process generated nonfunctional autolysosomes, thereby inhibiting autophagy. In addition, Atz was found to promote LMP&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Specifically, LMP induced by Atz caused release of cathepsins from lysosomes into the cytosol. Cathepsins in the cytosol cleaved Bid to generate tBid, which subsequently activated Bax to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This event led to cancer cell death via caspase activation. Overall, the findings suggest that Atz will serve as a new chemical probe in efforts aimed at gaining a better understanding of the autophagic process.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Hydroxylated Vitamin D3 Derivatives and Their Metabolism by CYP27B1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of CYP27B1 in C1 hydroxylation of a series of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated D3 derivatives was explored. We found that the 24R and 26R metabolites were more effectively hydroxylated at C1 by CYP27B1 compared to the corresponding S diastereomers. However, CYP27B1 showed almost no activity towards either of the diastereomers of the 23&#8208;hydroxylated derivative. This is the first report to show that CYP27B1 metabolizes 26&#8208;hydroxylated D3, converting 25,26D3 to the corresponding 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated compound, 1,25,26D3.







Abstract
1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (abbreviated here as 1,25D3) is a hormonally active form of vitamin D3 (D3), and is produced from D3 by CYP27&#8197;A1&#8208;mediated hydroxylation at C25, followed by CYP27B1&#8208;mediated hydroxylation at C1. Further hydroxylation of 25D3 and 1,25D3 occurs at C23, C24 and C26 to generate corresponding metabolites, except for 1,25R,26D3. Since the capability of CYP27B1 to hydroxylate C1 of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated metabolites other than 23S,25D3 and 24R,25D3 has not been examined, we have here explored the role of CYP27B1 in the C1 hydroxylation of a series of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated D3 derivatives. We found that CYP27B1 hydroxylates the R diastereomers of 24,25D3 and 25,26D3 more effectively than the S diastereomers, but shows almost no activity towards either diastereomer of 23,25D3. This is the first report to show that CYP27B1 metabolizes 25,26D3 to the corresponding 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivative, 1,25,26D3. It will be interesting to examine the physiological relevance of this finding.

It will be interesting to examine the physiological relevance of this finding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Potential of Single&#8208;Molecule Live&#8208;Cell Imaging for Chemical Translational Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the dynamics of the cell&#8216;s molecular systems. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging of biomolecules in living cells, especially for G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, are introduced. The potential of a single&#8208;molecule imaging approach for chemical translational biology is discussed based on the recent progress in single&#8208;molecule imaging methods.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the motility of molecules in living cells. Considering the relationship between the motility of molecules and their function, information obtained from single&#8208;molecule imaging involves essential clues for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the processes of target molecules, and translation to applied sciences such as drug discovery. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging studies on G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are mainly introduced, and recent techniques of single&#8208;molecule imaging for overcoming the limitation of single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging are discussed. Based on these studies, the prospects of single&#8208;molecule imaging will be outlined.

         <title>Forward Chemical Genetic Screen for Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxins Uncovers New Covalent Fragments that Target GPX4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of propiolamide&#8208;based GPX4 inhibitors was discovered in an unbiased screen of 930 electrophilic fragments under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We show that the novel GPX4 inhibitors displayed normoxia&#8208;selective toxicity, which can be expanded to canonical ferroptosis inducers in three different cell lines. This underscores the importance of tumor oxygenation when developing GPX4 inhibitors for therapeutic use.







Abstract
The identification of growth inhibitory compounds with the ability to selectively target the cellular oxygenation state may be of therapeutic interest. Here, a phenotypic screen of a&#8197;covalent fragment library revealed diverse compounds containing propiolamide warheads with selective toxicity for liver cancer cells in normoxic conditions. Target identification and validation through CETSA and direct pulldown experiments demonstrated that several compounds target glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) and induce ferroptotic cell death. Although being an oxidative cell death mechanism, ferroptosis can be induced also under hypoxic conditions. Prompted by the selective toxicity discovered in the screen, we mapped the oxygen&#8208;dependence of several ferroptosis&#8208;inducing compounds across three different cell lines. These studies revealed combinations with notable reductions in sensitivity under hypoxic conditions. These observations are mechanistically interesting and may be relevant for the use of ferroptosis&#8208;inducers as anti&#8208;cancer agents.

         <title>Characterization of Fluorescent Proteins with Intramolecular Photostabilization**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental strategy is introduced to characterize the effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. &#945;&#8208;GFP variant A206C/L221C allowed attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides (trolox, nitrophenyl, cyclooctatetraene and azobenzene) on the &#946;&#8208;barrel in proximity to the chromophore. Increases of photostability were found upon conjugation of azobenzene with a photostability mechanism to be elucidated.







Abstract
Genetically encodable fluorescent proteins have revolutionized biological imaging in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. Despite their importance, their photophysical properties, i.&#8201;e., brightness, count&#8208;rate and photostability, are relatively poor compared to synthetic organic fluorophores or quantum dots. Intramolecular photostabilizers were recently rediscovered as an effective approach to improve photophysical properties of organic fluorophores. Here, direct conjugation of triplet&#8208;state quenchers or redox&#8208;active substances creates high local concentrations of photostabilizer around the fluorophore. In this paper, we screen for effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. We produced a double cysteine mutant (A206C/L221C) of &#945;&#8208;GFP for attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides on the &#946;&#8208;barrel near the chromophore. Whereas labelling with photostabilizers such as trolox, a&#8197;nitrophenyl group, and cyclooctatetraene, which are often used for organic fluorophores, had no effect on &#945;&#8208;GFP&#8208;photostability, a substantial increase of photostability was found upon conjugation to azobenzene. Although the mechanism of the photostabilizing effects remains to be elucidated, we speculate that the higher triplet&#8208;energy of azobenzene might be crucial for triplet&#8208;quenching of fluorophores in the blue spectral range. Our study paves the way for the development of fluorescent proteins with photostabilizers in the protein barrel by methods such as unnatural amino acid incorporation.

         <dc:description>
This picture shows the 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) motif which chelates the zinc ion of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). To identify non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases, the TFMAL motif was discovered by screening a metal chelator chemical library. Subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design led to the discovery of compounds that exhibit sufficient HDAC6 inhibitory activity and selectivity in both in vitro and in cellulo experiments. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Suzuki et&#8197;al.

         <title>Recent Advances in Light Energy Conversion with Biomimetic Vesicle Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicles can be used for the compartmentalization of chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembly of reaction partners. This minireview highlights recent advances in biomimetic and light&#8208;induced energy conversions with liposomes and polymersomes, relevant in the context of energy transfer, electron transfer, photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable self&#8208;assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane&#8208;facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer. The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer&#8208;membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light&#8208;driven reactions.

Non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors: We identified isoindoline compounds bearing 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel zinc binding group by screening a compound library and the subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design (SBDD). The identified inhibitor exhibited potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced Treg cell differentiation.







Abstract
Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer and immunological diseases. Most of the previously reported HDAC6 inhibitors have a hydroxamate group as a zinc binding group (ZBG), which coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion of HDAC6. The hydroxamate group is liable to metabolically generate mutagenetic hydroxylamine; therefore, non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors would be advantageous. In this study, to identify novel non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors, screening of a chemical library and the subsequent structural optimization were performed, which led to the identification of HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel ZBG. The identified inhibitor showed potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Few methods exist to site&#8208;specifically label loops of globular proteins without interfering with the function of the protein. A modular &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive perfluoro&#8208;aromatic probe was synthesized in only two&#8208;steps and used to selectively modify an internal, surface exposed loop of the major capsid protein of JC polyomavirus (VP1). The perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl probe reacts selectively with the cysteine in the &#960;&#8208;clamp (Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe) over 6 native cysteines present in VP1. Using microscopy, fluorescently labeled &#960;&#8208;clamp VP1 can be observed binding and entering human glial cells. More information can be found in the Communication by F.&#8197;M. Rossi, C.&#8197;D.&#8197;S. Nelson et&#8197;al.

         <title>Core Steps to the Azaphilone Family of Fungal Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azaphilones are a polyketide&#8208;based family of fungal natural products with a highly oxygenated bicyclic pyrone&#8208;quinone structure, many of which have useful and interesting bioactivities. This minireview reveals the common steps in azaphilone biosynthetic pathways to aid the use of genome mining to identify orphan azaphilone biosynthetic gene clusters.







Abstract
Azaphilones are a family of polyketide&#8208;based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This minireview explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome&#8208;mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor can occur naturally as a constituent of essential oils of several plants, including Cinnamomum camphora, or it can be obtained chemically from optically pure &#945;&#8208;pinene, which itself must be isolated from plants. Camphor is well known for its characteristic pungent odor and health benefits. While (+)&#8208;camphor can be isolated from various natural sources, (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor is more difficult to obtain. In our work, we demonstrate facile enantioselective kinetic resolution of renewable isobornyl esters for the synthesis of the valuable (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hofer, R. Kourist et&#8197;al.
