         <title>Probing Peptidoglycan Synthesis in the Gut Commensal Akkermansia muciniphila with Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our gut microbiota directly influences human physiology in health and disease. The myriad of surface glycoconjugates in both the bacterial cell envelope and our gut cells dominate the microbiota&#8208;host interface and play a critical role in host response and microbiota homeostasis. Among these, peptidoglycan is the basic glycan polymer offering the cell rigidity and a basis on which many other glycoconjugates are anchored. To directly study peptidoglycan in gut commensals and obtain the molecular insight required to understand their functional activities we need effective techniques like chemical probes to label peptidoglycan in live bacteria. Here we report a chemically guided approach to study peptidoglycan in a key mucin&#8208;degrading gut microbiota member of the Verrucomicrobia phylum, Akkermansia muciniphila. Two novel non&#8208;toxic tetrazine click&#8208;compatible peptidoglycan probes with either a cyclopropene or isonitrile handle allowed for the detection and imaging of peptidoglycan synthesis in this intestinal species.</dc:description>

         <title>Biophysical Investigation of RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA Triple Helix and RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA Heteroduplex Formation by the lncRNAs MEG3 and Fendrr</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that lncRNAs can not only form RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplexes, but above all RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triplexes to perform regulatory functions. For a better understanding of the structure and function, this review gives an overview of different biophysical methods to distinguish between the different structural motifs and characterize them.







Abstract
Long non&#8208;coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and can associate with DNA as RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplexes or RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triple helix structures. Here, we review in&#8197;vitro biochemical and biophysical experiments including electromobility shift assays (EMSA), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, thermal melting analysis, microscale thermophoresis (MST), single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triple helix and RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplex formation. We present the investigations of the antiparallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA MEG3 targeting the gene TGFB2 and the parallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA Fendrr with its target gene Emp2. The thermodynamic properties of these oligonucleotides lead to concentration&#8208;dependent heterogeneous mixtures, where a DNA duplex, an RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplex and an RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triplex coexist and their relative populations are modulated in a temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The in&#8197;vitro data provide a reliable readout of triplex structures, as RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triplexes show distinct features compared to DNA duplexes and RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplexes. Our experimental results can be used to validate computationally predicted triple helix formation between novel disease&#8208;relevant lncRNAs and their DNA target genes.

         <title>In&#8208;vitro Clinical Diagnostics using RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We review the use of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes (RCDs) as molecular tools for the development of clinical diagnostics, covering both the selection of RCDs and the development of RCD&#8208;based assays and sensors, and provide several examples of the use of such tests for evaluation of spiked biological samples or patient samples related to both chronic and infectious diseases.







Abstract
Over the last three decades, significant advancements have been made in the development of biosensors and bioassays that use RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes (RCDs) as molecular recognition elements. While early examples of RCDs were primarily responsive to metal ions, the past decade has seen numerous RCDs reported for more clinically relevant targets such as bacteria, cancer cells, small metabolites, and protein biomarkers. Over the past 5&#8197;years several RCD&#8208;based biosensors have also been evaluated using either spiked biological matrixes or patient samples, including blood, serum, saliva, nasal mucus, sputum, urine, and faeces, which is a critical step toward regulatory approval and commercialization of such sensors. In this review, an overview of the methods used to generate RCDs and the properties of key RCDs that have been utilized for in&#8197;vitro testing is first provided. Examples of RCD&#8208;based assays and sensors that have been used to test either spiked biological samples or patient samples are then presented, highlighting assay performance in different biological matrixes. A summary of current prospects and challenges for development of in&#8197;vitro diagnostic tests incorporating RCDs and an overview of future directions of the field is also provided.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impacts of dimethylation of 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;
Naphthalimide (ANI) on its photophysical properties are reported. The
resulting 4&#8208;DiMe&#8208;ANI displays completely different fluorescence
properties, conferring it ability to selectively label lipid droplets in living
cells. A comprehensive photophysical study revealed that this
selectivity arises from an Internal Charge Transfer favored in lipophilic
media to the detriment of a non&#8208;emissive TICT in more polar media.
This results in a very high "LDs/Cytosol" signal ratio, enabling LDs to
be imaged with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and positioning its
performance above that of the BODIPY 493/503 commonly used to
image LDs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Machine learning models support computer&#8208;aided molecular design and compound optimization. However, the initial phases of drug discovery often face a scarcity of training data for these models. Meta&#8208;learning has emerged as a potentially promising strategy, harnessing the wealth of structure&#8208;activity data available for known targets to facilitate efficient few&#8208;shot model training for the specific target of interest. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of two different meta&#8208;learning methods, namely model&#8208;agnostic meta&#8208;learning (MAML) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF), specifically in the regression setting. We investigated how factors such as dataset size and the similarity of training tasks impact predictability. The results indicate that ADKF significantly outperformed both MAML and a single&#8208;task baseline model on the inhibition data. However, the performance of ADKF varied across different test tasks. Our findings suggest that considerable enhancements in performance can be anticipated primarily when the task of interest is similar to the tasks incorporated in the meta&#8208;learning process.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding and Stabilization of a Semiquinone Radical by an artificial Metalloenzyme containing a Binuclear copper (II) cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A binuclear Cu(II) cofactor was covalently bound to a lauric acid anchor. The resulting conjugate was characterized then combined with beta&#8208;lactoglobulin (&#946;LG) to generate a new biohybrid following the so&#8208;called &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; strategy. This biohybrid was examined for its effectiveness in the oxidation of a catechol derivative to the corresponding quinone. The resulting biohybrid did not exhibit the sought after catecholase activity, likely due to its ability to bind and stabilize the semiquinone radical intermediate DTB&#8208;SQ. This semi&#8208;quinone radical was stabilized only in the presence of the protein and was characterized using optical and magnetic spectroscopic techniques, demonstrating stability for over 16 hours. Molecular docking studies revealed that this stabilization could occur owing to interactions of the semi&#8208;quinone with hydrophobic amino acid residues of &#946;LG</dc:description>

         <title>Protein engineering of lipase A from Candida antarctica to improve esterification of tertiary alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral tertiary alcohols are important organic compounds in science as well as in industry. However, their preparation in enantiomerically pure form is still a challenge due to their complex structure and steric hindrances compared with primary and secondary alcohols, so kinetic resolution could be an attractive approach. &#160;Lipase A from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8208;A) has been shown to catalyze the enantioselective esterification of various tertiary alcohols with excellent enantioselectivity but low activity. Here we report a mutagenesis study by rational design to improve CAL&#8208;A activity against tertiary alcohols. Single mutants of CAL&#8208;A were selected, expressed, immobilized and screened for esterification of the tertiary alcohol 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;ol. A double mutant V278S+S429G showed a 1.5&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than that of the wild type CAL&#8208;A, while maintaining excellent enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Amyloidogenic and Non&#8208;Amyloidogenic Protein Spaces in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Their Mitigation Using Theranostic Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) refer to a complex heterogeneous group of diseases which are associated with the accumulation of amyloid fibrils or plaques in the brain leading to progressive loss of neuronal functions. Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is one of the major NDD responsible for 60&#8208;80% of all dementia cases. Currently, there are no curative or disease&#8208;reversing/modifying molecules for NDDs except a few such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, carbidopa and levodopa which treat the disease&#8208;associated&#8208;symptoms. Similarly, there are&#160;few FDA&#8208;approved tracers such as flortaucipir&#160;for tau fibril&#8208;imaging and florbetaben, flutemetamol, and florbetapir&#160;for amyloid&#8208;imaging available for diagnosis. Recent advances in the cryo&#8208;EM&#160;reported distinctly different microstructures for tau fibrils associated with different tauopathies&#160;highlighting the possibility to&#160;develop tauopathy&#8208;specific imaging agents and therapeutics. In addition, it is important to identify the proteins that are associated with disease development and progression to know about their 3D structure to develop various diagnostics, therapeutics and theranostic agents. The current article discusses in detail the disease&#8208;associated amyloid and non&#8208;amyloid proteins along with their structural insights. We discuss various proteins associated with NDDs and their implications in NDD. In addition, we document &#160;chemical compounds developed for diagnosis and therapy of different NDDs with special emphasis on theranostic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Basis for Chemoselectivity Control in Oxidations of Internal Aryl&#8208;Alkenes Catalyzed by Laboratory Evolved P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational modelling involving density functional theory (DFT) calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, are used to investigate and decipher the mechanism for chemoselectivity control achieved by a set of laboratory evolved P450s for selective allylic C&#8722;H hydroxylation vs. epoxidation and carbonyl formation of internal aryl&#8208;alkenes.







Abstract
P450 enzymes naturally perform selective hydroxylations and epoxidations of unfunctionalized hydrocarbon substrates, among other reactions. The adaptation of P450 enzymes to a particular oxidative reaction involving alkenes is of great interest for the design of new synthetically useful biocatalysts. However, the mechanism that these enzymes utilize to precisely modulate the chemoselectivity and distinguishing between competing alkene double bond epoxidations and allylic C&#8722;H hydroxylations is sometimes not clear, which hampers the rational design of specific biocatalysts. In a previous work, a P450 from Labrenzia aggregata (P450LA1) was engineered in the laboratory using directed evolution to catalyze the direct oxidation of trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylstyrene to phenylacetone. The final variant, KS, was able to overcome the intrinsic preference for alkene epoxidation to directly generate a ketone product via the formation of a highly reactive carbocation intermediate. Here, additional library screening along this evolutionary lineage permitted to serendipitously detect a mutation that overcomes epoxidation and carbonyl formation by exhibiting a large selectivity of 94&#8201;% towards allylic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. A multiscalar computational methodology was applied to reveal the molecular basis towards this hydroxylation preference. Enzyme modelling suggests that introduction of a bulky substitution dramatically changes the accessible conformations of the substrate in the active site, thus modifying the enzymatic selectivity towards terminal hydroxylation and avoiding the competing epoxidation pathway, which is sterically hindered.

         <title>Amodiaquine Nonspecifically Binds Double Stranded and Three&#8208;Way Junction DNA Structures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;aminoquinoline class of compounds includes the important antimalarial compounds amodiaquine and chloroquine. Despite their medicinal importance, the mode of action of these compounds is poorly understood. In a previous study we observed these compounds,&#160;as well as quinine and mefloquine, tightly bind the DNA cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer. Here, we further explore the range of nucleic acid structures bound by these compounds.&#160;To gauge a wide range of binding affinities, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to explore high affinity binding (nM to tens of&#160;mM) and NMR spectroscopy to assay weak binding biding in the hundreds of micromolar range.&#160;&#160;&#160;We find that amodiaquine tightly binds all double stranded DNA structures explored. Mefloquine binds double stranded DNA duplex molecules tightly&#160;and weakly associates&#160;with a three&#8208;way junction DNA construct.&#160;Quinine and chloroquine only weakly bind duplex DNA but do not tightly bind any of the DNA constructs&#160;explored.&#160;A simulation of the free energy of binding of these ligands to the Dickerson&#8208;Drew dodecamer resulted in an excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental free energy.These results provide new insight into the DNA binding of&#160;clinically important antimalarial compounds&#160;and may play a role in future development of new antimalarials.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysosomes are membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles that play key roles in degrading and recycling cellular debris, cellular signaling, and energy metabolism processes. Confinement of amphiphilic peptides in the lysosome to construct functional nanostructures through noncovalent interactions is an emerging approach to tune the homeostasis of lysosome. After briefly introducing the importance of lysosome and its functions, we discuss the advantages of lysosomal nanostructure formation for disease therapy. We next discuss the strategy for triggering the self&#8208;assembly of peptides in the lysosome, followed by a concise outlook of the future perspective about this emerging research direction.</dc:description>

         <title>Bile Salt Hydrolase Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Monitoring Gut Microbial Bile Acid Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) is an important microbial enzyme expressed by the gut microbiota that controls secondary bile acid metabolism in the gut. A panel of activity&#8208;based probes and a click chemistry&#8208;based, fluorescent activity assay reveals that BSH activity exhibits diurnal rhythmicity, and its substrate preferences are regulated by circadian rhythms.







Abstract
Bile acids are bioactive metabolites that are biotransformed into secondary bile acids by the gut microbiota, a vast consortium of microbes that inhabit the intestines. The first step in intestinal secondary bile acid metabolism is carried out by a critical enzyme, bile salt hydrolase (BSH), that catalyzes the gateway reaction that precedes all subsequent microbial metabolism of these important metabolites. As gut microbial metabolic activity is difficult to probe due to the complex nature of the gut microbiome, approaches are needed to profile gut microbiota&#8208;associated enzymes such as BSH. Here, we develop a panel of BSH activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) to determine how changes in diurnal rhythmicity of gut microbiota&#8208;associated metabolism affects BSH activity and substrate preference. This panel of covalent probes enables determination of BSH activity and substrate specificity from multiple gut anerobic bacteria derived from the human and mouse gut microbiome. We found that both gut microbiota&#8208;associated BSH activity and substrate preference is rhythmic, likely due to feeding patterns of the mice. These results indicate that this ABP&#8208;based approach can be used to profile changes in BSH activity in physiological and disease states that are regulated by circadian rhythms.

         <title>Biological Demands and Toxicity of Isoprenoid Precursors in Bacillus Subtilis Through Cell&#8208;Permeant Analogs of Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate and Dimethylallyl Pyrophosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) are the five&#8208;carbon precursors for all terpenes and are cell impermeant due to the negatively charged pyrophosphate. We report the delivery of cell permeant IPP and DMAPP into Bacillus subtilis and demonstrate growth rescue after inhibition with fosmidomycin. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalent toxicity of IPP and DMAPP.







Abstract
Bacterial isoprenoids are necessary for many biological processes, including maintaining membrane integrity, facilitating intercellular communication, and preventing oxidative damage. All bacterial isoprenoids are biosynthesized from two five carbon structural isomers, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are cell impermeant. Herein, we demonstrate exogenous delivery of IPP and DMAPP into Bacillus subtilis by utilizing a self&#8208;immolative ester (SIE)&#8208;caging approach. We initially evaluated native B. subtilis esterase activity, which revealed a preference for short straight chain esters. We then examined the viability of the SIE&#8208;caging approach in B. subtilis and demonstrate that the released caging groups are well tolerated and the released IPP and DMAPP are bioavailable, such that isoprenoid biosynthesis can be rescued in the presence of pathway inhibitors. We further show that IPP and DMAPP are both toxic and inhibit growth of B. subtilis at the same concentration. Lastly, we establish the optimal ratio of IPP to DMAPP (5&#8201;:&#8201;1) for B. subtilis growth and find that, surprisingly, DMAPP alone is insufficient to rescue isoprenoid biosynthesis under high concentrations of fosmidomycin. These findings showcase the potential of the SIE&#8208;caging approach in B. subtilis and promise to both aid in novel isoprenoid discovery and to inform metabolic engineering efforts in bacteria.

         <title>Endogenous Antimicrobial&#8208;Immunomodulatory Molecules: Networking Biomolecules of Innate Immunity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endogenous antimicrobial&#8208;immunomodulatory molecules (EAIMs) are essential to immune&#8208;mediated human health and evolution. Conventionally, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been regarded as the dominant endogenous antimicrobial molecule; however, AMPs are not sufficient to account for the full spectrum of antimicrobial&#8208;immunomodulatory duality occurring within the human body. The threat posed by pathogenic microbes is pervasive with the capacity for widespread impact across many organ systems and multiple biochemical pathways; accordingly, the host needs the capacity to react with an equally diverse response. This can be attained by having EAIMs that traverse the full range of molecular size (small to large molecules) and structural diversity (including molecules other than peptides). This review identifies multiple molecules (peptide/protein, lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, small organic molecule, and metallic cation) as EAIMs and discusses the possibility of cooperative, additive effects amongst the various EAIM classes during the host response to a microbial assault. This comprehensive consideration of the full molecular diversity of EAIMs enables the conclusion that EAIMs constitute a previously uncatalogued structurally diverse and collectively underappreciated immuno&#8208;active group of integrated molecular responders within the innate immune system&#8217;s first line of defence.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are emerging scaffolds with a wide range of applications in the Life Science. In this review, we explore the synthesis, the functionalization, and the applications of halo&#8208;triazole derivatives in biologically relevant molecules including nucleosides, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;triazole is an important building block in organic chemistry. It is now well known as a bioisostere for various functions, such as the amide or the ester bond, positioning it as a key pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry and it has found applications in various fields including life sciences. Attention was first focused on the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole molecules however 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have now emerged as valuable molecules due to the possibility to expand the structural modularity. In the last decade, methods mainly derived from the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction have been developed to access halo&#8208;triazole compounds and have been applied to nucleosides, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins. In addition, late&#8208;stage modification of halo&#8208;triazole derivatives by metal&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling or halo&#8208;exchange reactions offer the possibility to access highly functionalized molecules that can be used as tools for chemical biology. This review summarizes the synthesis, the functionalization, and the applications of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in biologically relevant molecules.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;conjugated Nanoparticle Platforms for Targeted Delivery, Imaging, and Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) are promising platforms for biomedical applications such as drug/gene delivery, targeting, sensing, and imaging. These NPs can offer high specificity, lower toxicity, biocompatibility, and stimuli responsive behavior as therapeutic and diagnostic tools. They can provide non&#8208;invasive detection and monitoring of diseases including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders.







Abstract
Peptides have become an indispensable tool in engineering of multifunctional nanostructure platforms for biomedical applications such as targeted drug and gene delivery, imaging and biosensing. They can be covalently incorporated into a variety of nanoparticles (NPs) including polymers, metallic nanoparticles, and others. Using different bioconjugation techniques, multifunctional peptide&#8208;modified NPs can be formulated to produce therapeutical and diagnostic platforms offering high specificity, lower toxicity, biocompatibility, and stimuli responsive behavior. Targeting peptides can direct the nanoparticles into specific tissues for targeted drug and gene delivery and imaging applications due to their specificity towards certain receptors. Furthermore, due to their stimuli&#8208;responsive features, they can offer controlled release of therapeutics into desired sites of disease. In addition, peptide&#8208;based biosensors and imaging agents can provide non&#8208;invasive detection and monitoring of diseases including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders. In this review, we covered the design and formulation of recent peptide&#8208;based NP platforms, as well as their utilization in in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo applications such as targeted drug and gene delivery, targeting, sensing, and imaging applications. In the end, we provided the future outlook to design new peptide conjugated nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

         <title>Enterolyin S, a Polythiazole&#8208;containing Hemolytic Peptide from Enterococcus caccae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;hemolytic factor streptolysin S (SLS) is an important linear azol(in)e&#8208;containing peptide (LAP) that contributes significantly to the virulence of Streptococcus pyogenes. Despite its discovery 85 years ago, SLS has evaded structural characterizing owing to its notoriously problematic physicochemical properties. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a structurally analogous hemolytic peptide from Enterococcus caccae, termed enterolysin S (ELS). Through heterologous expression, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, chemoselective modification, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, we found that ELS contains an intriguing contiguous octathiazole moiety.

         <title>Interactions of phenylalanine derivatives with human tyrosinase: lessons from experimental and theoretical studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pigmentation of the skin, modulated by different actors in melanogenesis, is mainly due to the melanins (protective pigments). In humans, these pigments&#8217; precursors are synthetized by an enzyme known as tyrosinase (TyH). The regulation of the enzyme activity by specific modulators (inhibitors or activators) can offer a means to fight hypo&#8208; and hyper&#8208;pigmentations responsible for medical, psychological and societal handicaps. Herein, we report the investigation of phenylalanine derivatives as TyH modulators. Interacting with the binuclear copper active site of the enzyme, phenylalanine derivatives combine effects induced by combination with known resorcinol inhibitors and natural substrate/intermediate (amino acid part). Computational studies including docking, molecular dynamics and free energy calculations combined with biological activity assays on isolated TyH and in human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cells, and X&#8208;ray crystallography analyses with the TyH analogue Tyrp1, provide conclusive evidence of the interactions of phenylalanine derivatives with human tyrosinase. In particular, our findings indicate that an analogue of L&#8208;DOPA, namely (S)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;tyrosine, stands out as an amino phenol derivative with inhibitory properties against TyH.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant Arylamines Enabled by a Nitroreductase from Bacillus tequilensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitroreductase from Bacillus tequilensis, named BtNR, enabled the synthesis of arylamines from bulky nitroarenes with good conversions and isolated yields. These enzymatically prepared arylamines are valuable synthons for the production of pharmaceutically active compounds, such as the antibiotic linezolid and the anticancer drugs vismodegib and sonidegib.







Abstract
Arylamines are essential building blocks for the manufacture of valuable pharmaceuticals, pigments and dyes. However, their current industrial production involves the use of chemocatalytic procedures with a significant environmental impact. As a result, flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductases (NRs) have received increasing attention as sustainable catalysts for more ecofriendly synthesis of arylamines. In this study, we assessed a novel NR from Bacillus tequilensis, named BtNR, for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant arylamines, including valuable synthons used in the manufacture of blockbuster drugs such as vismodegib, sonidegib, linezolid and sildenafil. After optimizing the enzymatic reaction conditions, high conversion of nitroaromatics to arylamines (up to 97&#8201;%) and good product yields (up to 56&#8201;%) were achieved. Our results indicate that BtNR has a broad substrate scope, including bulky nitro benzenes, nitro pyrazoles and nitro pyridines. Hence, BtNR is an interesting biocatalyst for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant amine&#8208;functionalized aromatics, providing an attractive alternative to traditional chemical synthesis methodologies.

         <title>Proteomic Profiling of Antimalarial Plasmodione Using 3&#8208;Benz(o)ylmenadione Affinity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanisms of drug action in malarial parasites is crucial for the development of new drugs to combat infection and to counteract drug resistance. Proteomics is a widely used approach to study host&#8208;pathogen systems and to identify drug protein targets. Plasmodione is an antiplasmodial early&#8208;lead drug exerting potent activities against young asexual and sexual blood stages in vitro with low toxicity to host cells. To elucidate its molecular mechanisms, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) approach was applied to yeast and P. falciparum proteomes. New (pro&#8208;)AfBPP probes based on the 3&#8208;benz(o)yl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;menadione scaffold were synthesized. With optimized conditions of both photoaffinity labeling and click reaction steps, the AfBPP protocol was then applied to a yeast proteome, yielding 11 putative drug&#8208;protein targets. Among these, we found four proteins associated with oxidoreductase activities, the hypothesized type of targets for plasmodione and its metabolites, and other proteins associated with the mitochondria. In Plasmodium parasites, the MS analysis revealed 44 potential plasmodione targets that need to be validated in further studies. Finally, the localization of a 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoromenadione AfBPP probe was studied in the subcellular structures of the parasite at the trophozoite stage.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platinum&#8208;Aluminum Bimetallic Salen Complex for Pro&#8208;senescence Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell senescence is defined as irreversible cell cycle arrest, which can be triggered by telomere shortening or by various types of genotoxic stress. Induction of senescence is emerging as a new strategy for the treatment of cancer, especially when sequentially combined with a second senolytic drug capable of killing the resulting senescent cells, however severely suffering from the undesired off&#8208;target side effects from the senolytic drugs. Here, we prepare a bimetalic platinum&#8208;aluminum salen complex (Alumiplatin) for cancer therapy&#8208;a combination of pro&#8208;senesence chemotherapy with in situ senotherapy to avoid the side effects. The aluminum salen moiety, as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer, enhances the salen&#8217;s ability to induce cancer cell senescence and this phenotype is in turn sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of the monofunctional platinum moiety. It exhibits an excellent capability for inducing senescence, a potent cytotoxic activity against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and an improved safety profile compared to cisplatin. Therefore, Alumiplatin may be a good candidate to be further developed into safe and effective anticancer agents. This novel combination of cell senescence inducers with genotoxic drugs revolutionizes the therapy options of designing multi&#8208;targeting anticancer agents to improve the efficacy of anticancer therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;independent CRISPR&#8208;Associated Protein Labeling for Presentation and Co&#8208;delivery of Molecules Toward Genetic and Epigenetic Regulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic method for non&#8208;covalently labeling CRISPR enzymes with small molecules and oligonucleotides. Labeling with a reporter small molecule enables probing bacterial protein expression in realtime. CRISPR enzyme's DNA targeting activity helps deliver small molecules to the mammalian cell nucleus for prospective epigenetic applications. The new oligonucleotide labeling method is crucial for CRISPR&#8208;mediated DNA repair applications.







Abstract
Labeling of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) associated proteins (Cas) remains an immense challenge for their genome engineering applications. To date, cysteine&#8208;mediated bioconjugation is the most efficient strategy for labeling Cas proteins. However, introducing a cysteine residue in the protein at the right place might be challenging without perturbing the enzymatic activity. We report a method that does not require cysteine residues for small molecule presentation on the CRISPR&#8208;associated protein SpCas9 for in&#8197;vitro protein detection, probing cellular protein expression, and nuclear co&#8208;delivery of molecules in mammalian cells. We repurposed a simple protein purification tag His6 peptide for non&#8208;covalent labeling of molecules on the CRISPR enzyme SpCas9. The small molecule labeling enabled us to rapidly detect SpCas9 in a biochemical assay. We demonstrate that small molecule labeling can be utilized for probing bacterial protein expression in realtime. Furthermore, we coupled SpCas9&#8217;s nuclear&#8208;targeting ability in co&#8208;delivering the presenting small molecules to the mammalian cell nucleus for prospective genome engineering applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the method can be generalized to label oligonucleotides for multiplexing CRISPR&#8208;based genome editing and template&#8208;mediated DNA repair applications. This work paves the way for genomic loci&#8208;specific bioactive small molecule and oligonucleotide co&#8208;delivery toward genetic and epigenetic regulations.

         <title>Overcoming Solubility Challenges: Liposomal isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole as a Promising Anti&#8208;Tumor Agent for Inoperable and Radiation&#8208;Insensitive cancers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
IsoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole, an analog of isoCA&#8208;4 anti&#8208;tumor agent, is encapsulated into liposomes to overcome its low solubility. In vitro experiments show that loaded liposomes exhibit similar activity to the free form on several human tumor cell lines. In vivo experiments using a palliative intratumoral injection chemotherapy approach demonstrate that isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole loaded liposomes significantly reduce tumor growth in a CA&#8208;4&#8208;resistant HT29 model.







Abstract
This study evaluated the potential of isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole, a diheterocyclic analog of isoCA&#8208;4, as an anti&#8208;tumor agent. To overcome its low aqueous solubility, liposomes were developed as a delivery system for the compound. In vitro experiments showed that loaded liposomes exhibited similar activity to the free form on multiple human tumor cell lines. In vivo experiments using a palliative intratumoral injection chemotherapy approach further demonstrated that isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole loaded liposomes significantly reduced tumor growth in a CA&#8208;4&#8208;resistant HT29&#8197;cell model, without inducing any observable toxicity or weight loss in the treated mice. These findings suggest that liposomal isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole may hold promise as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of inoperable, radiation&#8208;insensitive cancers.

         <title>Bacterial Glycolipid Acting on Protein Transport Across Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Escherichia coli inner membranes, diacylglycerol (DAG) and a glycolipid, named membrane protein integrase (MPIase), particularly influence membrane protein transport. This review explores the mechanisms of membrane protein integration mediated by these factors, and the methods and results of physicochemical analysis are presented.







Abstract
The process of protein transport across membranes involves a variety of factors and has been extensively investigated. Traditionally, proteinaceous translocons and chaperones have been recognized as crucial factors in this process. However, recent studies have highlighted the significant roles played by lipids and a glycolipid present in biological membranes in membrane protein transport. Membrane lipids can influence transport efficiency by altering the physicochemical properties of membranes. Notably, our studies have revealed that diacylglycerol (DAG) attenuates mobility in the membrane core region, leading to a dramatic suppression of membrane protein integration. Conversely, a glycolipid in Escherichia coli inner membranes, named membrane protein integrase (MPIase), enhances integration not only through the alteration of membrane properties but also via direct interactions with membrane proteins. This review explores the mechanisms of membrane protein integration mediated by membrane lipids, specifically DAG, and MPIase. Our results, along with the employed physicochemical analysis methods such as fluorescence measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance, surface plasmon resonance, and docking simulation, are presented to elucidate these mechanisms.

         <title>Click, Compute, Create: A Review of Web&#8208;based Tools for Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme engineering, though pivotal across various biotechnological domains, is often plagued by its time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive nature. This review aims to offer an overview of supportive in silico methodologies for this demanding endeavor. Starting from methods to predict protein structures, to classification of their activity and even the discovery of new enzymes we continue with describing tools used to increase thermostability and production yields of selected targets. Subsequently, we discuss computational methods to modulate both, the activity as well as selectivity of enzymes. Last, we present recent approaches based on cutting&#8208;edge machine learning methods to redesign enzymes. With exception of the last chapter, there is a strong focus on methods easily accessible via web&#8208;interfaces or simple Python&#8208;scripts, therefore readily useable for a diverse and broad community.</dc:description>

         <title>Glutamic Acid Modified Gold Nanorod Sensor for the Detection of Calcium ions in Neuronal Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of GA&#8208;GNR as a probe for selective detection of calcium ions is investigated in neuron cell lysate and a novel portable calcium sensor prototype is devised.







Abstract
Calcium (Ca2+) ions play a crucial role in the functioning of neurons, governing various aspects of neuronal activity such as rapid modulation and alterations in gene expression. Ca2+ signaling has a significant impact on the development of diseases and the impairment of neuronal functions. Herein, the study reports a Ca2+ ion sensor in neuronal cells using a gold nanorod. The gold nanorod (GA&#8208;GNR) conjugated glutamic acid developed in the study was used as a nano&#8208;bio probe for the experimental and in&#8197;vitro detection of calcium. The nanosensor is colloidally stable, preserves plasmonic properties, and shows good viability in neuronal cells, as well as promoting neuron cell line growth. The cytotoxicity and cell penetration of the nanosensor are studied using Raman spectroscopy, brightfield and darkfield microscopy imaging, and MTT assays. The quantification of Ca2+ ions in neuronal cells is determined by monitoring the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the GA&#8208;GNR. The change in the intensity profile in the presence of Ca2+ incubated neurons was effectively used to develop a portable prototype of an optical Ca2+ sensor, proposing it as a tool for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and neuromodulation evaluation.

         <title>Co&#8208;Immobilization of ADH and GDH on Metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework: An Effective Biocatalyst for Asymmetric Reduction of Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral alcohols are not only important building blocks of various bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, but can serve as synthetic precursors for other valuable organic chemicals, thus the synthesis of these products is of great importance. Bio&#8208;catalysis represents one effective way to obtain these molecules, however, the weak stability and high cost of enzymes often hinder its broad application. In this work, we designed a biological nanoreactor by embedding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework ZIF&#8208;8. The biocatalyst ADH&amp;GDH@ZIF&#8208;8 could be applied to the asymmetric reduction of a series of ketones to give chiral alcohols in high yields (up to 99%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;99%). In addition, the heterogeneous biocatalyst could be recycled and reused at least four times with slight activity decline. Moreover, E. coli containing ADH and GDH was immobilized by ZIF&#8208;8 to form biocatalyst E. coli@ZIF&#8208;8, which also exhibits good catalytic behaviours. Finally, the chiral alcohols are further converted to marketed drugs (R)&#8208;Fendiline, (S)&#8208;Rivastigmine and NPS R&#8208;568 respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>USING F&#214;RSTER RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER (FRET) TO UNDERSTAND THE UBIQUITINATION LANDSCAPE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a fluorescence technique that allows quantitative measurement of protein interactions, kinetics and dynamics. This review covers the use of FRET to study the structures and mechanisms of ubiquitination and related proteins. We survey FRET assays that have been developed where donor and acceptor fluorophores are placed on E1, E2 or E3 enzymes and ubiquitin (Ub) to monitor&#160;steady&#8208;state&#160;and real&#8208;time transfer of Ub through the ubiquitination cascade. Specialized FRET probes&#160;placed on&#160;Ub and&#160;Ub&#8208;like&#160;proteins have been developed to monitor Ub removal by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)&#160;that result in a loss of a&#160;FRET signal upon cleavage of the FRET probes. FRET has also been used to understand conformational changes in large complexes such as multimeric E3 ligases and the&#160;proteasome,&#160;frequently using sophisticated single molecule methods. Overall, FRET is a powerful tool to help unravel the intricacies of the complex ubiquitination system.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of Protein Containing Thiotyrosine as an Active Site Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Native chemical ligation is a key reaction in the toolbox of chemical methods for the synthesis of native and modified proteins. The catalysis of ligation is commonly performed by using small aryl&#8208;thiol molecules added at high concentrations. In this work, we incorporated thiotyrosine, a non&#8208;canonical amino acid containing an aryl&#8208;thiol moiety, into a designed cyclic protein&#160;&#171; sans queue ni t&#234;te &#187;. Importantly, the protein environment reduced the pKa&#160;of the thiol group to 5.8&#8208;5.9, which is significantly lower than the previously reported value for thiotyrosine in a short peptide (pKa6.4). Furthermore, we demonstrated the catalytic activity of this protein both as hydrolase and in native chemical ligation of peptides. These results will be useful for the development of efficient protein catalysts (enzymes) for protein synthesis and modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Aldehyde Reductase Activity of Carboxylic Acid Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids is a challenge that the enzyme carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) is mastering. The R&#8208;domains of CARs, however, can additionally catalyze carbonyl reduction. This activity is a minor side reaction for many substrate/enzyme pairs but may be significant for others.







Abstract
Carboxylic acid reductase enzymes (CARs) are well known for the reduction of a wide range of carboxylic acids to the respective aldehydes. One of the essential CAR domains &#8208; the reductase domain (R&#8208;domain) &#8208; was recently shown to catalyze the standalone reduction of carbonyls, including aldehydes, which are typically considered to be the final product of carboxylic acid reduction by CAR. We discovered that the respective full&#8208;length CARs were equally able to reduce aldehydes. Herein we aimed to shed light on the impact of this activity on aldehyde production and acid reduction in general. Our data explains previously inexplicable results and a new CAR from Mycolicibacterium wolinskyi is presented.

         <title>Bifunctional Sildenafil Diazeniumdiolates Acting as Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors and Nitric Oxide Donors&#8722; Towards Wound Healing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NONO to wounds! Inadequate wound healing is a worldwide concern with limited remedies. Low levels of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) worsen wounds and controlling NO release from compounds poses challenges. Sildenafil&#8208;derived PDE5 inhibitors facilitate healing. This research combines NO&#8208;releasing diazeniumdiolates with sildenafil derivatives, resulting in a compound that triggers NO release and effectively inhibits PDE5, showing promise for wound treatments.







Abstract
Inefficient wound healing poses a global health challenge with a lack of efficient treatments. Wound healing issues often correlate with low endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels. While exogenous delivery with NO&#8208;releasing compounds represents a promising therapeutic strategy, controlling the release of the highly reactive NO remains challenging. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, like sildenafil, have also been shown to promote wound healing. This study explores hybrid compounds, combining NO&#8208;releasing diazeniumdiolates with a sildenafil&#8208;derived PDE5 inhibitor. One compound demonstrated a favorable NO&#8208;release profile, triggered by an esterase (prodrug), and displayed in&#8197;vitro nanomolar inhibition potency against PDE5 and thrombin&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. Both factors are known to promote blood flow and oxygenation. Thus, our findings unveil promising prospects for effective wound healing treatments.

         <title>Exploring a Solvent Dependent Strategy to Control Self&#8208;Assembling Behavior and Cellular Interaction in Laminin&#8208;Mimetic Short Peptide based Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The minimalist laminin&#8208;mimetic peptide hydrogels are being designed utilizing a co&#8208;solvent approach with varying concentrations of DMSO in aqueous medium. Higher concentration of DMSO enhanced the solubility of the hydrophobic peptide and promoted gelator&#8208;gelator interactions, thus forming hydrogels with a higher&#8208;order entangled network with improved mechanical properties. These solvent&#8208;triggered biomimetic self&#8208;assembled hydrogels act as cell&#8208;supportive bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled hydrogels, fabricated through diverse non&#8208;covalent interactions, have been extensively studied in regenerative medicines. Inspired from bioactive functional motifs of ECM protein, short peptide sequences have shown remarkable abilities to replicate the intrinsic features of the natural extracellular milieu. In this direction, we have fabricated two short hydrophobic bioactive sequences derived from the laminin protein i.&#8201;e., IKVAV and YIGSR. Based on the substantial hydrophobicity of these peptides, we selected a co&#8208;solvent approach as a suitable gelation technique that included different concentrations of DMSO as an organic phase along with an aqueous solution containing 0.1&#8201;% TFA. These hydrophobic laminin&#8208;based bioactive peptides with limited solubility in aqueous physiological environment showed significantly enhanced solubility with higher DMSO content in water. The enhanced solubility resulted in extensive intermolecular interactions that led to the formation of hydrogels with a higher&#8208;order entangled network along with improved mechanical properties. Interestingly, by simply modulating DMSO content, highly tunable gels were accessed in the same gelator domain that displayed differential physicochemical properties. Further, the cellular studies substantiated the potential of these laminin&#8208;derived hydrogels in enhancing cell&#8208;matrix interactions, thereby reinforcing their applications in tissue engineering.

         <title>Photoisomerization and Light&#8208;Controlled Antibacterial Activity of Fluoroquinolone&#8208;Azoisoxazole Hybrids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable antibiotic hybrids: Potentials for creating phtoswitchable antibiotic hybrids using norfloxacin/ciproflocacin and azoisoxazole (photoswitch) pharmacophores have been explored. Against Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, all hybrids in their trans states exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to the parent drugs. Notably, the potency of the irradiated state (cis isomer) of a hybrid was found to be 2&#8208;fold lower than the nonirradiated state (trans isomer).







Abstract
Photopharmacology holds a huge untapped potential to locally treat diseases involving photoswitchable drugs via the elimination of drugs&#8217; off&#8208;target effects. The growth of this field has created a pressing demand to develop such light&#8208;active drugs. We explored the potential for creating photoswitchable antibiotic hybrids by attaching pharmacophores norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin and azoisoxazole (photoswitch). All compounds exhibited a moderate to a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, long thermal cis half&#8208;lives, and impressive photoresistance. Gram&#8208;negative pathogens were found to be insensitive to these hybrids, while against Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, all hybrids in their trans states exhibited antibacterial activity that is comparable to that of the parent drugs. Notably, the toxicity of the irradiated hybrid 6 was found to be 2&#8208;fold lower than the nonirradiated trans isomer, indicating that the pre&#8208;inactivated cis&#8208;enriched drug can be employed for the site&#8208;specific treatment of bacterial infection using light, which could potentially eliminate the unwanted exposure of toxic antibiotics to both beneficial and untargeted harmful microbes in our body. Molecular docking revealed different binding affinity of the cis and trans isomers with the topoisomerase IV enzyme, due to their different shapes.

&lt;p&gt;Photoswitchable antibiotic hybrids: Potentials for creating phtoswitchable antibiotic hybrids using norfloxacin/ciproflocacin and azoisoxazole (photoswitch) pharmacophores have been explored. Against Gram-positive pathogens, all hybrids in their &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; states exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to the parent drugs. Notably, the potency of the irradiated state (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomer) of a hybrid was found to be 2-fold lower than the nonirradiated state (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photopharmacology holds a huge untapped potential to locally treat diseases involving photoswitchable drugs via the elimination of drugs&#8217; off-target effects. The growth of this field has created a pressing demand to develop such light-active drugs. We explored the potential for creating photoswitchable antibiotic hybrids by attaching pharmacophores norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin and azoisoxazole (photoswitch). All compounds exhibited a moderate to a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, long thermal &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; half-lives, and impressive photoresistance. Gram-negative pathogens were found to be insensitive to these hybrids, while against Gram-positive pathogens, all hybrids in their &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; states exhibited antibacterial activity that is comparable to that of the parent drugs. Notably, the toxicity of the irradiated hybrid &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; was found to be 2-fold lower than the nonirradiated &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer, indicating that the pre-inactivated &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-enriched drug can be employed for the site-specific treatment of bacterial infection using light, which could potentially eliminate the unwanted exposure of toxic antibiotics to both beneficial and untargeted harmful microbes in our body.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activatable Photocaged UNC2025 for Triggering TAM Kinase Inhibition in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photopharmacology: three photoactivatable small molecules based on the UNC2025 scaffold were developed for controlling TAM kinase activity in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo assays. The dicaged compound 3 proved to be the most striking with a complete loss of inhibition while recovering full activity upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Photopharmacology is an emerging field that utilizes photo&#8208;responsive molecules to enable control over the activity of a drug using light. The aim is to limit the therapeutic action of a drug at the level of diseased tissues and organs. Considering the well&#8208;known implications of protein kinases in cancer and the therapeutic issues associated with protein kinase inhibitors, the photopharmacology is seen as an innovative and alternative solution with great potential in oncology. In this context, we developed the first photocaged TAM kinase inhibitors based on UNC2025, a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule kinase inhibitor. These prodrugs showed good stability in biologically relevant buffer and rapid photorelease of the photoremovable protecting group upon UV&#8208;light irradiation (&lt;10&#8197;min.). These light&#8208;activatable prodrugs led to a 16&#8208;fold decrease to a complete loss of kinase inhibition, depending on the protein and the position at which the coumarin&#8208;type phototrigger was introduced. The most promising candidate was the N,O&#8208;dicaged compound, showing the superiority of having two photolabile protecting groups on UNC2025 for being entirely inactive on TAM kinases. Under UV&#8208;light irradiation, the N,O&#8208;dicaged compound recovered its inhibitory potency in enzymatic assays and displayed excellent antiproliferative activity in RT112&#8197;cell lines.

         <title>A Facile Access to Green Fluorescent Albumin Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adduct derivative bearing a triphenylamine moiety is capable of reacting with human serum albumin shifting its emission from the blue to the green&#8208;yellow, leading to green fluorescent albumin (GFA) derivatives, and enlarging the platform of probes for fluorescent&#8208;based detection techniques. The results of investigations on the biological properties suggest that GFA retains the ability of binding drug molecules.







Abstract
A Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adduct (MBHA) derivative bearing a triphenylamine moiety was found to react with human serum albumin (HSA) shifting its emission from the blue to the green&#8208;yellow thus leading to green fluorescent albumin (GFA) derivatives and enlarging the platform of probes for aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescent&#8208;based detection techniques. A possible interaction of MBHA derivative 7 with a lipophilic pocket within the HSA structure was suggested by docking studies. DLS experiments showed that the reaction with HSA induce a conformational change of the protein contributing to the aggregation process of GFA derivatives. The results of investigations on the biological properties suggested that GFA retained the ability of binding drug molecules such as warfarin and diazepam. Finally, cytotoxicity evaluation studies suggested that, although the MBHA derivative 7 at 0.1&#8197;&#956;g/mL affected the percentage of cell viability in comparison to the negative control, it cannot be considered cytotoxic, whereas at all the other concentrations&#8805;0.5&#8197;&#956;g/mL resulted cytotoxic at different extent.

         <title>Synthesis and Macrodomain Binding of Gln&#8208;carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ADP&#8208;ribosylation of glutamic acid in proteins is key for cell signalling. A stabilized mimic containing carba&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamine is accessible via solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Isothermal calorimetry studies with macrodomain proteins demonstrate that carba&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose is an accurate mimic of the native ADP&#8208;riboside moiety connected to the side chain of glutamine in the same peptide sequence







Abstract
Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a dynamic post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) with important roles in cell signalling. This modification occurs on a wide variety of amino acids, and one of the canonical modification sites within proteins is the side chain of glutamic acid. Given the transient nature of this modification (acylal linkage) and the high sensitivity of ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamic acid, stabilized isosteres are required for structural and biochemical studies. Here, we report the synthesis of a mimic of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide derived from histone H2B that contains carba&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamine as a potential mimic for Glu&#8208;ADPr. We synthesized a cyclopentitol&#8208;ribofuranosyl derivative of 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphoribosylated Fmoc&#8208;glutamine and used this in the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of the carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide mimicking the ADP&#8208;ribosylated N&#8208;terminal tail of histone H2B. Binding studies with isothermal calorimetry demonstrate that the macrodomains of human MacroD2 and TARG1 bind to carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide in the same way as ADPr&#8208;peptides containing the native ADP&#8208;riboside moiety connected to the side chain of glutamine in the same peptide sequence.

         <title>Conversion of &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;Glucans to Gentiobiose using an endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;Glucanase PsGly30A from Paenibacillus sp. GKG</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tasty conversion: PsGly30A is an endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase capable of hydrolysing &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucans: yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and pustulan from Lasallia pustulata. The main hydrolysis product is the valuable disaccharide gentiobiose. Gentiobiose is used as a flavour enhancer due to its refreshing bitter taste, similar to chocolate and coffee.







Abstract
A plethora of di&#8208; and oligosaccharides isolated from the natural sources are used in food and pharmaceutical industry. An enzymatic hydrolysis of fungal cell wall &#946;&#8208;glucans is a good alternative to produce the desired oligosaccharides with different functionalities, such as the flavour enhancer gentiobiose. We have previously identified PsGly30A as a potential yeast cell wall degrading &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glycosidase. The aim of this study is to characterise the PsGly30A enzyme, a member of the GH30 family, and to evaluate its suitability for the production of gentiobiose from &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucans. An endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase PsGly30A encoding gene from Paenibacillus sp. GKG has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme has been active towards pustulan and yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan, but not on laminarin from the Laminaria digitata, confirming the endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase mode of action. The PsGly30A shows the highest activity at pH&#8197;5.5 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. The specific activity of PsGly30A on pustulan (1262&#177;82&#8197;U/mg) is among the highest reported for GH30 &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glycosidases. Moreover, gentiobiose is the major reaction product when pustulan, yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan or yeast cell walls have been used as a substrate. Therefore, PsGly30A is a promising catalyst for valorisation of the yeast&#8208;related by&#8208;products.

     alt="Conversion of &#946;-1,6-Glucans to Gentiobiose using an endo-&#946;-1,6-Glucanase PsGly30A from Paenibacillus sp. GKG"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tasty conversion&lt;/b&gt;: PsGly30A is an endo-&#946;-1,6-glucanase capable of hydrolysing &#946;-1,6-glucans: yeast &#946;-glucan from &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; and pustulan from &lt;i&gt;Lasallia pustulata&lt;/i&gt;. The main hydrolysis product is the valuable disaccharide gentiobiose. Gentiobiose is used as a flavour enhancer due to its refreshing bitter taste, similar to chocolate and coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plethora of di- and oligosaccharides isolated from the natural sources are used in food and pharmaceutical industry. An enzymatic hydrolysis of fungal cell wall &#946;-glucans is a good alternative to produce the desired oligosaccharides with different functionalities, such as the flavour enhancer gentiobiose. We have previously identified PsGly30A as a potential yeast cell wall degrading &#946;-1,6-glycosidase. The aim of this study is to characterise the PsGly30A enzyme, a member of the GH30 family, and to evaluate its suitability for the production of gentiobiose from &#946;-1,6-glucans. An endo-&#946;-1,6-glucanase PsGly30A encoding gene from &lt;i&gt;Paenibacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. GKG has been cloned and overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. The recombinant enzyme has been active towards pustulan and yeast &#946;-glucan, but not on laminarin from the &lt;i&gt;Laminaria digitata&lt;/i&gt;, confirming the endo-&#946;-1,6-glucanase mode of action. The PsGly30A shows the highest activity at pH&#8197;5.5 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. The specific activity of PsGly30A on pustulan (1262&#177;82&#8197;U/mg) is among the highest reported for GH30 &#946;-1,6-glycosidases. Moreover, gentiobiose is the major reaction product when pustulan, yeast &#946;-glucan or yeast cell walls have been used as a substrate. Therefore, PsGly30A is a promising catalyst for valorisation of the yeast-related by-products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Activation in Aromatic Ring Cleaving Salicylate Dioxygenase: Detection of Reaction Intermediates with a Nitro&#8208;substituted Substrate Analog</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylate dioxygenase performs aromatic C&#8722;C bond scission of its substrates, salicylate and gentisate, with the aid of iron cofactor tethered to a 3&#8208;His binding motif. By utilizing a nitro substituted substrate analog, which attenuates the enzymatic kcat by 500&#8208;fold, detection and kinetics characterization two reaction intermediates was performed with stopped&#8208;flow optical absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cupin dioxygenases such as salicylate 1,2&#8208;dioxygense (SDO) perform aromatic C&#8722;C bond scission via a 3&#8208;His motif tethered iron cofactor. Here, transient kinetics measurements are used to monitor the catalytic cycle of SDO by using a nitro&#8208;substituted substrate analog, 3&#8208;nitrogentisate. Compared to the natural substrate, the nitro group reduces the enzymatic kcat by 500&#8208;fold, thereby facilitating the detection and kinetic characterization of reaction intermediates. Sums and products of reciprocal relaxation times derived from kinetic measurements were found to be linearly dependent on O2 concentration, suggesting reversible formation of two distinct intermediates. Dioxygen binding to the metal cofactor takes place with a forward rate of 5.9&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1: two orders of magnitude slower than other comparable ring&#8208;cleaving dioxygenses. Optical chromophore of the first intermediate is distinct from the in&#8197;situ generated SDO Fe(III)&#8722;O2&#8901;&#8722; complex but closer to the enzyme&#8208;substrate precursor.

         <title>Development of an Enzyme Cascade System for the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure D&#8208;Amino Acids Utilizing Ancestral L&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8208;Amino acids (D&#8208;AAs) are increasingly recognized as valuable precursors for the synthesis of fine chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and pesticides. This study reports the construction of an enzyme cascade system specifically designed for the synthesis of D&#8208;AAs from their corresponding racemates and L&#8208;isomers. Employing this system, we successfully synthesized seven enantiomerically pure D&#8208;AAs at a preparative scale.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure D&#8208;amino acids hold significant potential as precursors for synthesizing various fine chemicals, including peptide&#8208;based drugs and other pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on establishing an enzymatic cascade system capable of converting various L&#8208;amino acids into their D&#8208;isomers. The system integrates four enzymes: ancestral L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (AncLAAO&#8208;N4), D&#8208;amino acid dehydrogenase (DAADH), D&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and catalase. AncLAAO&#8208;N4 initiates the process by converting L&#8208;amino acids to corresponding keto acids, which are then stereo&#8208;selectively aminated to D&#8208;amino acids by DAADH using NADPH and NH4Cl. Concurrently, any generated H2O2 is decomposed into O2 and H2O by catalase, while GDH regenerates NADPH from D&#8208;glucose. Optimization of reaction conditions and substrate concentrations enabled the successful synthesis of five D&#8208;amino acids, including a D&#8208;Phe derivative, three D&#8208;Trp derivatives, and D&#8208;phenylglycine, all with high enantiopurity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) at a preparative scale (&gt;100&#8197;mg). This system demonstrates a versatile approach for producing a diverse array of D&#8208;amino acids.

         <dc:description>
The microbial type and multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase RlMTPSL4 from the liverwort Radula lindenbergiana produces the new sesquiterpene hydrocarbon 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane as the main product, besides the known compounds germacrene A, &#945;&#8208;selinene, eremophilene and 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;aristolochene. The enzyme mechanism for the formation of the main product and its absolute configuration were determined through isotopic labeling experiments.







Abstract
The microbial type sesquiterpene synthase RlMTPSL4 from the liverwort Radula lindenbergiana was investigated for its products, showing the formation of several sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The main product was structurally characterized as the new compound 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane, while the side products included the known hydrocarbons germacrene A, &#945;&#8208;selinene, eremophilene and 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;aristolochene. The cyclization mechanism towards 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane catalyzed by RlMTPSL4 was investigated through isotopic labeling experiments, revealing the stereochemical course for the deprotonation step to the neutral intermediate germacrene A, a reprotonation for its further cyclization, and a 1,2&#8208;hydride shift along the cascade. The absolute configuration of 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane was determined using a stereoselective deuteration approach, revealing an absolute configuration typically observed for a microbial type sesquiterpene.

         <title>Identification of a 2&#8208;Aminobenzimidazole Scaffold that Potentiates Gram&#8208;Positive Selective Antibiotics Against Gram&#8208;Negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule adjuvants have the potential to expand the spectrum of gram&#8208;positive selective antibiotics to encompass gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We identifiy a series of 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazole (2&#8208;ABI) macrolide adjuvants with activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Preliminary mechanism of action studies suggests that adjuvants bind to lipopolysaccharide in K.&#8197;pneumoniae, and modulate lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, assembly, or transport in A.&#8197;baumannii.







Abstract
The development of novel therapeutic approaches is crucial in the fight against multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, particularly gram&#8208;negative species. Small molecule adjuvants that enhance the activity of otherwise gram&#8208;positive selective antibiotics against gram&#8208;negative bacteria have the potential to expand current treatment options. We have previously reported adjuvants based upon a 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (2&#8208;AI) scaffold that potentiate macrolide antibiotics against several gram&#8208;negative pathogens. Herein, we report the discovery and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) investigation of an additional class of macrolide adjuvants based upon a 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazole (2&#8208;ABI) scaffold. The lead compound lowers the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clarithromycin (CLR) from 512 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/mL at 30&#8197;&#956;M against Klebsiella pneumoniae 2146, and from 32 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/mL at 5&#8197;&#956;M, against Acinetobacter baumannii 5075. Preliminary investigation into the mechanism of action suggests that the compounds are binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in K.&#8197;pneumoniae, and modulating lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis, assembly, or transport in A.&#8197;baumannii.

     alt="Identification of a 2-Aminobenzimidazole Scaffold that Potentiates Gram-Positive Selective Antibiotics Against Gram-Negative Bacteria"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small molecule adjuvants have the potential to expand the spectrum of gram-positive selective antibiotics to encompass gram-negative bacteria. We identifiy a series of 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-ABI) macrolide adjuvants with activity against &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. Preliminary mechanism of action studies suggests that adjuvants bind to lipopolysaccharide in &lt;i&gt;K.&#8197;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, and modulate lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, assembly, or transport in &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of novel therapeutic approaches is crucial in the fight against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, particularly gram-negative species. Small molecule adjuvants that enhance the activity of otherwise gram-positive selective antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria have the potential to expand current treatment options. We have previously reported adjuvants based upon a 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) scaffold that potentiate macrolide antibiotics against several gram-negative pathogens. Herein, we report the discovery and structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation of an additional class of macrolide adjuvants based upon a 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-ABI) scaffold. The lead compound lowers the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clarithromycin (CLR) from 512 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/mL at 30&#8197;&#956;M against &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; 2146, and from 32 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/mL at 5&#8197;&#956;M, against &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; 5075. Preliminary investigation into the mechanism of action suggests that the compounds are binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in &lt;i&gt;K.&#8197;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, and modulating lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis, assembly, or transport in &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ether Bond Cleavage of a Phenylcoumaran &#946;&#8208;5 Lignin Model Compound and Polymeric Lignin Catalysed by a LigE&#8208;type Etherase from Agrobacterium sp.</title>

A LigE&#8208;type beta&#8208;etherase enzyme from lignin&#8208;degrading Agrobacterium sp. Is found to convert a phenylcoumaran &#946;&#8208;5 lignin dimer into a cis&#8208;stilbene, alkene and ketone products, via reaction of glutathione at the &#945; position, the first example of an etherase enzyme attacking the &#945; position of a &#946;&#8208;5 unit.







Abstract
A LigE&#8208;type beta&#8208;etherase enzyme from lignin&#8208;degrading Agrobacterium sp. has been identified, which assists degradation of polymeric lignins. Testing against lignin dimer model compounds revealed that it does not catalyse the previously reported reaction of Sphingobium SYK&#8208;6 LigE, but instead shows activity for a &#946;&#8208;5 phenylcoumaran lignin dimer. The reaction products did not contain glutathione, indicating a catalytic role for reduced glutathione in this enzyme. Three reaction products were identified: the major product was a cis&#8208;stilbene arising from C&#8722;C fragmentation involving loss of formaldehyde; two minor products were an alkene arising from elimination of glutathione, and an oxidised ketone, proposed to arise from reaction of an intermediate with molecular oxygen. Testing of the recombinant enzyme against a soda lignin revealed the formation of new signals by two&#8208;dimensional NMR analysis, whose chemical shifts are consistent with the formation of a stilbene unit in polymeric lignin.

         <title>Reversible Influence of Hemipiperazine Photochromism on the Early Development of Zebrafish Embryo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch me, if you can! Plinabulin is a potent photoswitchable inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. Applied to zebrafish embryos, it can reversibly inhibit their early developmental phase called epiboly. Prolonged exposure to the active Z&#8208;isomer results in abnormal development or death. However, the embryos can be rescued by its light&#8208;driven inactivation to the E&#8208;form. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time a bidirectionally photocontrolled physiological effect inside of a living organism.







Abstract
This study explores the potential of controlling organismal development with light by using reversible photomodulation of activity in bioactive compounds. Specifically, our research focuses on plinabulin 1, an inhibitor of tubulin dynamics that contains a photochromic motif called hemipiperazine. The two isomeric forms, Z&#8208;1 and E&#8208;1, can partially interconvert with light, yet show remarkable thermal stability in darkness. The Z&#8208;isomer exhibits higher cytotoxicity due to stronger binding to &#945;&#8208;tubulin's colchicine site. The less toxic E&#8208;1 form, considered a &#8220;pro&#8208;drug&#8221;, can be isolated in&#8197;vitro and stored. Upon activation by blue or cyan light, it predominantly generates the more toxic Z&#8208;1 form. Here we demonstrate that 1 can effectively photomodulate epiboly, a critical microtubule&#8208;dependent cell movement during gastrulation in zebrafish embryos. This research highlights the potential of photomodulation for precise and reversible control of cellular activities and organismal development.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Carbamate Self&#8208;Immolative Spacers Counterintuitively Release 3&#176; Alcohol at Much Faster Rates than 1&#176; Alcohol Payloads</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxy groups of structurally&#8208;similar imidazoquinoline payloads are released with different rates from amine&#8208;carbamate self&#8208;immolative (SI) spacers, depending on the extent of C&#8208;&#945; substitution. Unexpectedly, the 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol payloads are released with much faster rates than the 1&#176; alcohol, which can be uncaged only by a hyper&#8208;reactive SI spacer.







Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative (SI) spacers are degradable chemical connectors widely used in prodrugs and drug conjugates to release pharmaceutical ingredients in response to specific stimuli. Amine&#8208;carbamate SI spacers are particularly versatile, as they have been used to release different hydroxy cargos, ranging from 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohols to phenols and oximes. In this work, we describe the ability of three amine&#8208;carbamate SI spacers to release three structurally similar imidazoquinoline payloads, bearing either a 1&#176;, a 2&#176; or a 3&#176; alcohol as the leaving group. While the spacers showed comparable efficacy at releasing the 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohols, the liberation of the 1&#176; alcohol was much slower, unveiling a counterintuitive trend in nucleophilic acyl substitutions. The release of the 1&#176; alcohol payload was only possible using a SI spacer bearing a pyrrolidine ring and a tertiary amine handle, which opens the way to future applications in drug delivery systems.

         <title>Climbing into their Skin to Understand Contextual Protein&#8211;Protein Associations and Localizations: Functional Investigations in Transgenic Live Model Organisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
What Stirs Beneath. Understanding protein&#8211;specific interactomes, or localization, is crucial for decoding protein function. New biotinylation methods can do just that even in live organisms. However, these methods have some limitations as they are intrinsically unable to directly probe function. Here new methods that can investigate locale&#8211;specific reactivity, are discussed, opening routes to locale&#8211;specific perturbation of function.







Abstract
Borrowing some quotes from Harper Lee's novel &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird&#8221; to help frame our manuscript, we discuss methods to profile local proteomes. We initially focus on chemical biology regimens that function in live organisms and use reactive biotin species for this purpose. We then consider ways to add new dimensions to these experimental regimens, principally by releasing less reactive (i.&#8201;e., more selective) (preter)natural electrophiles. Although electrophile release methods may have lower resolution and label fewer proteins than biotinylation methods, their ability to probe simultaneously protein function and locale raises new and interesting possibilities for the field.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA assembly serves as the fundamental technology in the field of synthetic biology. This paper briefly reviews the recent advancements in the assembly of large DNA fragments. We spotlight on in&#8197;vivo methods using E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. cerevisiae as hosts, and highlight the various applications that can be explored after the assembly of large DNA fragments.







Abstract
Synthetic biology, a newly and rapidly developing interdisciplinary field, has demonstrated increasing potential for extensive applications in the wide areas of biomedicine, biofuels, and novel materials. DNA assembly is a key enabling technology of synthetic biology and a central point for realizing fully synthetic artificial life. While the assembly of small DNA fragments has been successfully commercialized, the assembly of large DNA fragments remains a challenge due to their high molecular weight and susceptibility to breakage. This article provides an overview of the development and current state of DNA assembly technology, with a focus on recent advancements in the assembly of large DNA fragments in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, the methods and challenges associated with the assembly of large DNA fragment in different hosts are highlighted. The advancements in DNA assembly have the potential to facilitate the construction of customized genomes, giving us the ability to modify cellular functions and even create artificial life. It is also contributing to our ability to understand, predict, and manipulate living organisms.

         <title>Modifications of Protein&#8208;Bound Substrates by Trans&#8208;Acting Enzymes in Natural Products Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 8, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In polyketide biosynthesis, modifications commonly occur after the completion of the polyketide backbone assembly and the mature products are released from the acyl&#8208;carrier protein (ACP). However, exceptions to this rule are widespread, and some are modified on&#8208;line by discrete enzymes. This review article highlights more recently reported trans&#8208;acting proteins that catalyze modifications of ACP&#8208;bound substrates in natural product biosynthesis.







Abstract
Enzymatic modifications of small molecules are a common phenomenon in natural product biosynthesis, leading to the production of diverse bioactive compounds. In polyketide biosynthesis, modifications commonly take place after the completion of the polyketide backbone assembly by the polyketide synthases and the mature products are released from the acyl&#8208;carrier protein (ACP). However, exceptions to this rule appear to be widespread, as on&#8208;line hydroxylation, methyl transfer, and cyclization during polyketide assembly process are common, particularly in trans&#8208;AT PKS systems. Many of these modifications are catalyzed by specific domains within the modular PKS systems. However, several of the on&#8208;line modifications are catalyzed by stand&#8208;alone proteins. Those include the on&#8208;line Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, halogenation, epoxidation, and methyl esterification during polyketide assembly, dehydrogenation of ACP&#8208;bound short fatty acids by acyl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase&#8208;like enzymes, and glycosylation of ACP&#8208;bound intermediates by discrete glycosyltransferase enzymes. This review article highlights some of these trans&#8208;acting proteins that catalyze enzymatic modifications of ACP&#8208;bound small molecules in natural product biosynthesis.

A new generation of DNA computers is evolving to solve biological and medical problems. DNA logic gates are used to create integrated circuits with biocompatibility and programmability. This minireview highlights the efforts in the development of DNA circuits by integration of DNA logic gates into long chains localized on DNA substrates. This approach of all&#8208;DNA integrated circuits (DNA ICs) has the advantage of biocompatibility, increased circuit response due to precise gate localization, increased circuit density, reduced unit concentration, and facilitated cell uptake.







Abstract
Due to nucleic acid's programmability, it is possible to realize DNA structures with computing functions, and thus a new generation of molecular computers is evolving to solve biological and medical problems. Pioneered by Milan Stojanovic, Boolean DNA logic gates created the foundation for the development of DNA computers. Similar to electronic computers, the field is evolving towards integrating DNA logic gates and circuits by positioning them on substrates to increase circuit density and minimize gate distance and undesired crosstalk. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the integration of DNA logic gates into circuits localized on DNA substrates. This approach of all&#8208;DNA integrated circuits (DNA ICs) offers the advantages of biocompatibility, increased circuit response, increased circuit density, reduced unit concentration, facilitated circuit isolation, and facilitated cell uptake. DNA ICs can face similar challenges as their equivalent circuits operating in bulk solution (bulk circuits), and new physical challenges inherent in spatial localization. We discuss possible avenues to overcome these obstacles.

         <title>Measuring Ligand&#8208;bound Protein Complexes with Proximity Labeling: A Practical Guide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying the drug&#8208;target interactome of small molecule therapeutics is essential for understanding the full pharmacological effects of a compound. Here we provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of current methods to measure drug interactomes, and a practical step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol for using the BioTAC system to assist with drug target and interactome ID.







Abstract
Identifying the drug&#8208;target interactome of small molecule therapeutics is essential for understanding the full pharmacological effects of a compound. These therapies often induce changes within the cellular proteome, leading to unexpected consequences such as changes in the targets complexation state or off&#8208;target interactions between the compound and additional proteins. Currently, unbiased target&#8208;ID approaches are being used to embark on this task. Here we provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of these methods, and a practical step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol for using the BioTAC system to assist with drug target and interactome ID.

Hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) from the cyanogenic millipede Oxidus gracillis (OgraHNL) showed high specific activity and enantioselectivity a toward the synthesis of (R)&#8208;2&#8208;chloromandelonitrile ((R)&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8722;Man), an important intermediate in pharmaceuticals, and (R)&#8208;2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol in Henry reactions. We showed that the crystal structural properties of OgraHNL complexed with various substrates and an engineering strategy based on the protein structure serve as useful approaches for millipede HNLs.

Abstract
Hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) from the cyanogenic millipede Oxidus gracillis (OgraHNL) is a crucial enzyme in the cyanogenesis pathway. Here, the crystal structures of OgraHNL complexed with sulfate, benzaldehyde (BA), (R)&#8208;mandelonitrile ((R)&#8208;Man), (R)&#8208;2&#8208;chloromandelonitrile ((R)&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8722;Man), and acetone cyanohydrin (ACN) were solved at 1.6, 1.7, 2.3, 2.1, and 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolutions, respectively. The structure of OgraHNL revealed that it belonged to the lipocalin superfamily. Based on this structure, positive variants were designed to further improve the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity of the enzyme for asymmetric hydrocyanation and Henry reactions.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Delivery of Glut1 siRNA Facilitates Glucose Starvation Therapy in Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose transporter protein&#8208;1 (Glut1), is highly expressed in many cancer types and plays a crucial role in cancer progression through enhanced glucose transport. Its overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Herein, the nucleic acids modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was synthesized to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Glut1 by microRNA 21 (miR&#8208;21) triggers toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction for lung cancer starvation therapy. Overexpression of miR&#8208;21 triggers toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, releasing the siRNA to knockdown of Glut1 in cancer cell instead of normal cell. Furthermore, the glucose oxidase&#8208;like activity of the AuNPs accelerates intracellular glucose consumption, promoting cancer cell starvation. The engineered AuNPs@anti&#8208;miR&#8208;21/siGlut1 complex inhibits cancer cell proliferation, xenograft tumor growth and promotes apoptosis through glucose starvation and ROS cascade signaling, underscoring its potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomeric far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent biliproteins of ultrahigh brightness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins have regions of maximum transmission in most tissues and can be widely used as fluorescent biomarkers. We report that fluorescent phycobiliproteins originating from the phycobilisome core subunit ApcF2 can covalently bind biliverdin, named BDFPs. To further improve BDFPs, we conducted a series of studies. Firstly, we mutated K53Q and T144A of BDFPs to increase their effective brightness up to 190% in vivo. Secondly, by homochromatic tandem fusion of high&#8208;brightness BDFPs to achieve monomerization, which increases the effective brightness by up to 180% in vivo, and can effectively improve the labeling effect. By combining the above two approaches, the brightness of the tandem BDFPs was much improved compared with that of the previously reported fluorescent proteins in a similar spectral range. The tandem BDFPs were expressed stably while maintaining fluorescence in mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans. They were also photostable and resistant to high temperature, low pH, and chemical denaturation. The tandem BDFPs advantages were proved in applications as biomarkers for imaging in super&#8208;resolution microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Potential SOS1 Inhibitors via Virtual Screening of Multiple Small Molecule Libraries against KRAS&#8208;SOS1 Interface</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The RAS&#8208;MAPK signaling pathway, crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation, involves key proteins KRAS and SOS1. Mutations in the KRAS and SOS1 genes are implicated in various cancer types, including pancreatic, lung, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. There is considerable interest in identifying inhibitors targeting KRAS and SOS1 to explore potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. In this study, advanced in silico techniques were employed to screen small molecule libraries at this interface, leading to the identification of promising lead compounds as potential SOS1 inhibitors. Comparative analysis of the average binding free energies of these predicted potent compounds with known SOS1 small molecule inhibitors revealed that the identified compounds display similar or even superior predicted binding affinities compared to the known inhibitors. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of these compounds as candidates for further development as effective anti&#8208;cancer agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Transferase Engineering for SAM Analog Synthesis from Iodoalkanes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient enzyme engineering generates transferases with orders of magnitude higher activity for various substrates in just one round of engineering. The engineered enzymes are highly stereoselective and enable SAM analog (re)generation with iodoalkanes. The enzymes and methods reported might further advance the field of biocatalytic alkylation chemistry with &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; alkylating reagents.







Abstract
S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) is an important cosubstrate in various biochemical processes, including selective methyl transfer reactions. Simple methods for the (re)generation of SAM analogs could expand the chemistry accessible with SAM&#8208;dependent transferases and go beyond methylation reactions. Here we present an efficient enzyme engineering strategy to synthesize different SAM analogs from &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; iodoalkanes through enzymatic alkylation of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH). This was achieved by mutating multiple hydrophobic and structurally dynamic amino acids simultaneously. Combinatorial mutagenesis was guided by the natural amino acid diversity and generated a highly functional mutant library. This approach increased the speed as well as the scale of enzyme engineering by providing a panel of optimized enzymes with orders of magnitude higher activities for multiple substrates in just one round of enzyme engineering. The optimized enzymes exhibit catalytic efficiencies up to 31&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, convert various iodoalkanes, including substrates bearing cyclopropyl or aromatic moieties, and catalyze S&#8208;alkylation of SAH with very high stereoselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;de). We further report a high throughput chromatographic screening system for reliable and rapid SAM analog analysis. We believe that the methods and enzymes described herein will further advance the field of selective biocatalytic alkylation chemistry by enabling SAM analog regeneration with &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; reagents.

         <title>WALL&#8208;IMMOBILIZED BIOCATALYST VS. PACKED BED IN MINIATURIZED CONTINUOUS REACTORS: PERFORMANCES AND SCALE&#8208;UP</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable biocatalysis syntheses have gained considerable popularity over the years. However, further optimizations &#8211; notably to reduce costs &#8211; are required if the methods are to be successfully deployed in a range of areas. As part of this drive, various enzyme immobilization strategies have been studied, alongside process intensification from batch to continuous production. The flow bioreactor portfolio mainly ranges between packed bed reactors and wall&#8208;immobilized enzyme miniaturized reactors. Because of their simplicity, packed bed reactors are the most frequently encountered at lab&#8208;scale. However, at industrial scale, the growing pressure drop induced by the increase in equipment size hampers their implementation for some applications. Wall&#8208;immobilized miniaturized reactors require less pumping power, but a new problem arises due to their reduced enzyme&#8208;loading capacity. This review starts with a presentation of the current technology portfolio and a reminder of the metrics to be applied with flow bioreactors. Then, a benchmarking of the most recent relevant works is presented. The scale&#8208;up perspectives of the various options are presented in detail, highlighting key features of industrial requirements. One of the main objectives of this review is to clarify the strategies on which future study should center to maximize the performance of wall&#8208;immobilized enzyme reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic evaluation of benchmark G4 probes and G4 clinical drugs using three biophysical methods: A guideline to evaluate rapidly G4&#8208;binding affinity.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures (G4) are proven to interfere with most genetic and epigenetic processes. Small molecules binding these structures (G4 ligands) are invaluable tools to probe G4&#8208;biology and address G4&#8208;druggability in various diseases (cancer, viral infections). However, the large number of reported G4 ligands (&gt; 1000) could lead to confusion while selecting one for a given application. Herein we conducted a systematic affinity ranking of 11 popular G4 ligands vs 5 classical G4 sequences using FRET&#8208;melting, G4&#8208;FID assays and SPR. Interestingly SPR data globally align with the rankings obtained from the two semi&#8208;quantitative assays despite discrepancies due to limits and characteristics of each assay. In the whole, PhenDC3 emerges as the most potent binder irrespective of the G4 sequence. Immediately below PDS, PDC&#8208;360A, BRACO19, TMPyP4 and RHPS4 feature strong to medium binding again with poor G4 topology discrimination. More strikingly, the G4 drugs Quarfloxin, CX5461 and c&#8208;PDS exhibit weak affinity with all G4s studied. Finally, NMM and Cu&#8208;ttpy showed heterogeneous behaviors due, in part, to their physicochemical particularities poorly compatible with screening conditions. The remarkable properties of PhenDC3 led us to propose its use for benchmarking FRET&#8208;melting and G4&#8208;FID assays for rapid G4&#8208;affinity evaluation of newly developed ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Recognition Agents of Histamine: A Biopanning Approach with Enhanced Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Histamine is a biogenic amine that poses a potential threat to public health due to its toxicological effects. In this study, we identified histamine&#8208;binding peptides by screening a random 12&#8208;mer peptide library, employing a novel biopanning approach that excluded histidine&#8208;binding sequences in the final round. This additional step enhanced the selectivity of the peptides and prevented interference from histidine during detection. The binding affinities of synthesized peptides to histamine were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Among the identified peptides, HBF10 (SGFRDGIEDFLW) and HBF26 (IPLENQHKIYST) showed significant affinity to histamine, with Kavalues of 2.56&#215;104 (M&#8208;1) and 8.94&#215;104 (M&#8208;1), respectively. Notably, the identified peptides did not demonstrate binding affinity towards histidine, despite its structural similarity to histamine. Subsequently, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface was prepared by immobilizing the peptide HBF26 to investigate the potential of the peptide as a recognition agent for histamine detection. The findings suggest that the identified peptides have an affinity to histamine specifically, showcasing their potential applications as diagnostic agents with specific targeting capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic analysis of the effect of genomic knock&#8208;out of non&#8208;essential promiscuous HAD&#8208;like phosphatases YcsE, YitU and YwtE on flavin and adenylate content in Bacillus subtilis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studying the metabolic role of non&#8208;essential promiscuous enzymes is a challenging task, as genetic manipulations usually do not reveal at which point(s) of the metabolic network the enzymatic activity of such protein is beneficial for the organism. Each of the HAD&#8208;like phosphatases YcsE, YitU and YwtE of Bacillus subtilis catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;ribitylamino&#8208;uracil 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate, which is essential in the biosynthesis of riboflavin. Using CRISPR technology, we have found that the deletion of these genes, individually or in all possible combinations failed to cause riboflavin auxotrophy and did not result in significant growth changes. Analysis of flavin and adenylate content in B. subtilis knockout mutants showed that (i) there must be one or several still unidentified phosphatases that can replace the deleted proteins; (ii) such replacements, however, cannot fully restore the intracellular content of any of three flavins studied (riboflavin, FMN, FAD); (iii) whereas bacterial fitness was not significantly compromised by mutations, the intracellular balance of flavins and adenylates did show some significant changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilization of Free and Dipeptide&#8208;Bound Formyline and Pyrraline by Saccharomyces Yeasts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of the glycated amino acids formyline and pyrraline and their peptide&#8208;bound derivatives by 14 Saccharomyces yeasts, including 6 beer yeasts (bottom and top fermenting), one wine yeast, 6 strains isolated from natural habitats and one laboratory reference yeast strain (wild type) was investigated. All yeasts were able to metabolize glycated amino acids via the Ehrlich pathway to the corresponding Ehrlich metabolites. While formyline and small amounts of pyrraline entered the yeast cells via passive diffusion, the amounts of dipeptide&#8208;bound MRPs, especially the dipeptides glycated at the C&#8208;terminus, decreased much faster, indicating an uptake into the yeast cells. Furthermore, the glycation&#8208;mediated hydrophobization in general leads to an faster degradation rate compared to the native lysine dipeptides. While the utilization of free formyline is yeast&#8208;specific, the amounts of (glycated) dipeptides decreased faster in the presence of brewer's yeasts, which also showed a higher formation rate of Ehrlich metabolites compared to naturally isolated strains. Due to rapid uptake of alanyl dipeptides, it can be assumed that the Ehrlich enzyme system of naturally isolated yeasts is overloaded and the intracellularly released MRP is primarily excreted from the cell. This indicates adaptation of technologically used yeasts to (glycated) dipeptides as a nitrogen source.</dc:description>

         <title>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein&#8208;Derived Cyclic Peptides as Modulators of Spike Interaction with GRP78</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human glucose&#8208;regulated protein GRP78 is a human chaperone that translocactes to the cell surface when cells are under stress. Theoretical studies suggested it could be involved in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus entry to cells. In this work, we used in vitro surface plasmon resonance&#8208;based assays to show that human GRP78 indeed binds to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. We have designed and synthesised cyclic peptides based on the loop structure of amino acids 480&#8208;488 of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein S1 domain from the Wuhan and Omicron variants and showed that both peptides bind to GRP78. Consistent with the greater infectiousness of the Omicron variant, the Omicron&#8208;derived peptide displays slower dissociation from the target protein. Both peptides significantly inhibit the binding of wild&#8208;type S1 protein to the human protein GRP78 suggesting that further development of these cyclic peptide motifs may provide a viable route to novel anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agents.</dc:description>

         <title>AM404 Analogs as Activators of the 20S Isoform of the Human Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The proteasome is a multisubunit protease system responsible for the majority of the protein turnover in eukaryotic organisms. Dysregulation of this enzymatic complex leads to protein accumulation, subsequent aggregation, and ultimately diseased states; for that reason, positive modulation of its activity has been recently investigated as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative and age&#8208;related diseases. The small molecule AM404 was recently identified as an activator of the 20S isoform of the proteasome and further exploration of the scaffold revealed the importance of the polyunsaturated fatty acid chain to elicit activity. Herein, we report the investigation of the aromatic region of the scaffold and the evaluation of the small molecules in a variety of proteasome activity and protein degradation assays. We found that derivatives A22 and A23, compared to AM404, exhibit enhanced proteasome activity in biochemical and cellular proteasome assays and more favorable cellular viability profiles. Additionally, these compounds demonstrate the ability to degrade intrinsically disordered proteins, regardless of their molecular weight, and the ability to restore the proteasome activity in the presence of toxic oligomeric &#945;&#8208;Syn species in a biochemical setting.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry of Strigolactones, Key Players in Plant Communication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Today, the use of artificial pesticides is questionable and the adaptation to global warming is a necessity. The promotion of favorable natural interactions in the rhizosphere offers interesting perspectives for changing the type of agriculture. Strigolactones (SLs), the latest class of phytohormones to be discovered, are also chemical mediators in the rhizosphere. We present in this review the diversity of natural SLs, their analogs, mimics, and probes essential for the biological studies of this class of compounds. Their biosynthesis and access by organic synthesis are highlighted especially concerning noncanonical SLs, the more recently discovered natural SLs. Organic synthesis of analogs, stable isotope&#8208;labeled standards, mimics, and probes are also reviewed here. In the last part, the knowledge about the SL perception is described as well as the different inhibitors of SL receptors that have been developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Does Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Catalyze the Oxidation of Some Tetrahydropyridines?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unifying hypothesis for the mechanism of monoamine oxidize (MAO) catalyzed oxidations is presented. Most 1&#176; and 2&#176; amines are oxidized by MAO via a polar pathway; 3&#176; amines are generally not substrates. However, for tetrahydropyridines (and similarly structured amines), an otherwise unfavorable electron transfer pathway is driven by a facile deprotonation (Le Chatelier's principle) because the resulting neutral radicals are exceptionally stable.







Abstract
Results pertaining to the mechanism of the oxidation of the tertiary amine 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MMTP, a close analog of the Parkinsonism inducing compound MPTP) by 3&#8208;methyllumiflavin (3MLF), a chemical model for the FAD cofactor of monoamine oxidase, are reported. MMTP and related compounds are among the few tertiary amines that are monoamine oxidase B (MAO&#8722;B) substrates. The MMTP/3MLF reaction is catalytic in the presence of O2 and the results under anaerobic conditions strongly suggest the involvement of radical intermediates, consistent with a single electron transfer mechanism. These observations support a new hypothesis to explain the MAO&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amines. In general, electron transfer is thermodynamically unfavorable, and as a result, most 1&#176; and 2&#176; amines react via one of the currently accepted polar pathways. Steric constraints prevent 3&#176; amines from reacting via a polar pathway. Those select 3&#176; amines that are MAO substrates possess certain structural features (e.&#8201;g., a C&#8722;H bond that is &#945;&#8208; both to nitrogen and a C=C) that dramatically lower the pKa of the corresponding radical cation. Consequently, the thermodynamically unfavorable electron transfer equilibrium is driven towards products by an extremely favorable deprotonation step in the context of Le Chatelier's principle.

         <dc:description>Pathogenesis&#8208;related class 10 (PR&#8208;10) proteins play a crucial role in plant defense by acting as ribonucleases. The specific mechanism of action and substrate specificity of these proteins have remained largely unexplored so far. In this study, we elucidate the enzymatic activity of Pru p 1, a PR&#8208;10 protein from peach. We demonstrate that this protein catalyzes the endonucleolytic backbone cleavage of RNA substrates into&#160;short oligonucleotides.&#160;Initial cleavage products, identified through kinetic analysis, can bind again, priming them for further degradation.&#160;NMR binding site mapping reveals that&#160;the large&#160;internal cavity of Pru p 1, which is characteristic for PR&#8208;10 proteins, serves as an anchoring site for single&#8208;stranded ribonucleotide chains. We propose a structure&#8208;based mechanistic model that accounts for the observed cleavage patterns and the inhibitory effect of zeatin, a nucleoside analog, on the ribonuclease activity of Pru p 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Activity of a Newly Identified Arylalkylamine N&#8208;Acetyltransferase in the Acetylation of 5&#8208;Hydroxytryptamine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase (AANAT) was identified and rationally engineered to improve the catalytic activity. The resultant mutant was then utilized in the transformation of 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine (5&#8208;HT) to N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine (NAS), enabling a 99&#8201;% conversion and an 80&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase (AANAT) serves as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of melatonin by transforming 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine (5&#8208;HT) to N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine (NAS), while its low activity may hinder melatonin yield. In this study, a novel AANAT derived from Sus scrofa (SsAANAT) was identified through data mining using 5&#8208;HT as a model substrate, and a rational design of SsAANAT was conducted in the quest to improving its activity. After four rounds of mutagenesis procedures, a triple combinatorial dominant mutant M3 was successfully obtained. Compared to the parent enzyme, the conversion of the whole&#8208;cell reaction bearing the best variant M3 exhibted an increase from 50&#8201;% to 99&#8201;% in the transformation of 5&#8208;HT into NAS. Additionally, its catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was enhanced by 2&#8208;fold while retaining the thermostability (Tm&gt;45&#8201;&#176;C). In the up&#8208;scaled reaction with a substrate loading of 50&#8197;mM, the whole&#8208;cell system incorporating variant M3 achieved a 99&#8201;% conversion of 5&#8208;HT in 30&#8197;h with an 80&#8201;% yield. Molecular dynamics simulations were ultilized to shed light on the origin of improved activity. This study broadens the repertoire of AANAT for the efficient biosynthesis of melatonin.

In the up-scaled reaction with a substrate loading of 50&#8197;mM, the whole-cell system incorporating variant M3 achieved a 99&#8201;% conversion of 5-HT in 30&#8197;h with an 80&#8201;% yield. Molecular dynamics simulations were ultilized to shed light on the origin of improved activity.

         <title>A Rhodanese&#8208;Like Enzyme that Catalyzes Desulfination of Ergothioneine Sulfinic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many actinobacteria and some acidobacteria contain genes coding for a rhodanese&#8208;like enzyme that catalyzes the elimination of sulfur dioxide from ergothioneine sulfinic acid as an essential step in the oxygen&#8208;dependent degradation of ergothioneine. This is the rhodanese&#8208;like enzyme known to catalyze a lyase reaction.







Abstract
Many actinobacterial species contain structural genes for iron&#8208;dependent enzymes that consume ergothioneine by way of O2&#8208;dependent dioxygenation. The resulting product ergothioneine sulfinic acid is stable under physiological conditions unless cleavage to sulfur dioxide and trimethyl histidine is catalyzed by a dedicated desulfinase. This report documents that two types of ergothioneine sulfinic desulfinases have evolved by convergent evolution. One type is related to metal&#8208;dependent decarboxylases while the other belongs to the superfamily of rhodanese&#8208;like enzymes. Pairs of ergothioneine dioxygenases (ETDO) and ergothioneine sulfinic acid desulfinase (ETSD) occur in thousands of sequenced actinobacteria, suggesting that oxidative ergothioneine degradation is a common activity in this phylum.

         <title>Effects of PNA Sequence and Target Site Selection on Function of a 4.5S Non&#8208;coding RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) based antisense strategy is a promising therapeutic approach to specifically inhibit target gene expression. However, unlike protein coding genes, identification of an ideal PNA binding site for non&#8208;coding RNA is not straightforward. Here, we compare the inhibitory activities of PNA molecules that bind a non&#8208;coding 4.5S RNA called SRP RNA, a key component of the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP). A 9&#8208;mer PNA (PNA9) complementary to the tetraloop region of the RNA was more potent in inhibiting its interaction with the SRP protein, compared to an 8&#8208;mer PNA (PNA8) targeting a stem&#8208;loop. PNA9, which contained a homo&#8208;pyrimidine sequence could form a triplex with the complementary stretch of RNA in vitro as confirmed using a fluorescent derivative of PNA9 (F&#8208;PNA13). The RNA&#8208;PNA complex formation resulted in inhibition of SRP function with PNA9 and F&#8208;PNA13, but not PNA8 highlighting the importance of target site selection. Surprisingly, F&#8208;PNA13 which was more potent in inhibiting SRP function in vitro, showed weaker antibacterial activity compared to PNA9 likely due to poor cell penetration of the longer PNA. Our results underscore the importance of suitable target site selection and optimum PNA length to develop better antisense molecules against non&#8208;coding RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Products That Contain Higher Homologated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid homologation is the insertion of a methylene group into the side chain, which is not a very common modification found in peptide natural products. Natural products that contain homologated amino acid observed in bacteria, fungi, and animals as well as the proposed biosyntheses of these molecules are summarized.







Abstract
This review focuses on discussing natural products (NPs) that contain higher homologated amino acids (homoAAs) in the structure as well as the proposed and characterized biosynthesis of these non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids. Homologation of amino acids includes the insertion of a methylene group into its side chain. It is not a very common modification found in NP biosynthesis as approximately 450 homoAA&#8208;containing NPs have been isolated from four bacterial phyla (Cyanobacteria, Actinomycetota, Myxococcota, and Pseudomonadota), two fungal phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), and one animal phylum (Porifera), except for a few examples. Amino acids that are found to be homologated and incorporated in the NP structures include the following ten amino acids: alanine, arginine, cysteine, isoleucine, glutamic acid, leucine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, where isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine share the comparable enzymatic pathway. Other amino acids have their individual homologation pathway (arginine, proline, and glutamic acid for bacteria), likely utilize the primary metabolic pathway (alanine and glutamic acid for fungi), or have not been reported (cysteine and serine). Despite its possible high potential in the drug discovery field, the biosynthesis of homologated amino acids has a large room to explore for future combinatorial biosynthesis and metabolic engineering purpose.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Emissive Iridium(III) Complexes and Their Applications in Biological Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We summarize the iridium(III) complexes that display uncommon dual emission in fluid solutions at room temperature. Serving as biological probes, these complexes exhibit emission spectral response with sharp emission color alternation upon analyte binding. The utilization of dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes in cellular sensing and imaging allows for ratiometric quantification and multiplexed detection.







Abstract
Phosphorescent iridium(III) complexes are widely recognized for their unique properties in the excited triplet state, making them crucial for various applications including biological sensing and imaging. Most of these complexes display single phosphorescence emission from the lowest&#8208;lying triplet state after undergoing highly efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and ultrafast internal conversion (IC) processes. However, in cases where these excited&#8208;state processes are restricted, the less common phenomenon of dual emission has been observed. This dual emission phenomenon presents an opportunity for developing biological probes and imaging agents with multiple emission bands of different wavelengths. Compared to intensity&#8208;based biosensing, where the existence and concentration of an analyte are indicated by the brightness of the probe, the emission profile response involves modifications in emission color. This enables quantification by utilizing the intensity ratio of different wavelengths, which is self&#8208;calibrating and unaffected by the probe concentration and excitation laser power. Moreover, dual&#8208;emissive probes have the potential to demonstrate distinct responses to multiple analytes at separate wavelengths, providing orthogonal detection capabilities. In this concept, we focus on iridium(III) complexes displaying fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence or phosphorescence&#8208;phosphorescence dual emission, along with their applications as biological probes for sensing and imaging.

         <title>The Biocatalytic Potential of Aromatic Ammonia&#8211;Lyase from Loktanella atrilutea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic ammonia&#8211;lyase from Loktanella atrilutea (LaAAL) displays a high activity towards 3,4&#8208;dimethoxy trans&#8211;cinnamic acid, with a surprisingly diminished activity towards natural AAL substrates. Under the optimal reaction conditions LaAAL exhibited versatility for the transformation of various cinnamic acids. While LaAAL might be classified as a tyrosine ammonia&#8208;lyase (TAL, E.C. 4.3.1.23), its strongly distinctive attributes argue for an elemental role in the transformation of non&#8208;natural phenylalanines.







Abstract
Characterization of the aromatic ammonia&#8211;lyase from Loktanella atrilutea (LaAAL) revealed reduced activity towards canonical AAL substrates: l&#8208;Phe, l&#8208;Tyr, and l&#8208;His, contrasted by its pronounced efficiency towards 3,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine. Assessing the optimal conditions, LaAAL exhibited maximal activity at pH&#8197;9.5 in the ammonia elimination reaction route, distinct from the typical pH ranges of most PALs and TALs. Within the exploration of the ammonia source for the opposite, synthetically valuable ammonia addition reaction, the stability of LaAAL exhibited a positive correlation with the ammonia concentration, with the highest stability in 4&#8197;M ammonium carbamate of unadjusted pH of ~9.5. While the enzyme activity increased with rising temperatures yet, the highest operational stability and highest stationary conversions of LaAAL were observed at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The substrate scope analysis highlighted the catalytic adaptability of LaAAL in the hydroamination of diverse cinnamic acids, especially of meta&#8208;substituted and di&#8208;/multi&#8211;substituted analogues, with structural modelling exposing steric clashes between the substrates&#8217; ortho&#8211;substituents and catalytic site residues. LaAAL showed a predilection for ammonia elimination, while classifying as a tyrosine ammonia&#8211;lyase (TAL) among the natural AAL classes. However, its distinctive attributes, such as genomic context, unique substrate specificity and catalytic fingerprint, suggest a potential natural role beyond those of known AAL classes.

The substrate scope analysis highlighted the catalytic adaptability of &lt;i&gt;La&lt;/i&gt;AAL in the hydroamination of diverse cinnamic acids, especially of &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-substituted and di-/multi&#8211;substituted analogues, with structural modelling exposing steric clashes between the substrates&#8217; &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;substituents and catalytic site residues. &lt;i&gt;La&lt;/i&gt;AAL showed a predilection for ammonia elimination, while classifying as a tyrosine ammonia&#8211;lyase (TAL) among the natural AAL classes. However, its distinctive attributes, such as genomic context, unique substrate specificity and catalytic fingerprint, suggest a potential natural role beyond those of known AAL classes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterizing the Conformational Dynamics of Human SUMO2: Insights into its Interaction with Metal Ions and SIMs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SUMO (Small Ubiquitin&#8208;like Modifiers) proteins are involved in a crucial post&#8208;translational modification commonly termed as SUMOylation. In this work, we have investigated the native&#8208;state conformational flexibility of human SUMO2 and its interaction with Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions using 15N/1H based 2D NMR spectroscopy. After SUMO1, SUMO2 is the most studied SUMO isoform in humans which shares 45% and ~80% similarity with SUMO1 in terms of sequence and structure, respectively. We show that compared to SUMO1, several amino acids in SUMO2 around &#945;1&#8208;helix region access energetically similar near&#8208;native conformations. This could play a crucial role in its non&#8208;covalent interactions with SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs). A strong binding with Cu2+ ions in the C&#8208;terminal and resulting aggregation into timers as shown by gel&#8208;electrophoresis studies seem to interefere in it&#8217;s non&#8208;covalent interaction with a V/I&#8208;x&#8208;V/I&#8208;V/I based SIM in Daxx protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Detoxification of V&#8208;nerve agents assisted by a microperoxidase: new pathway revealed by the use of a relevant VX simulant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biocatalyzed oxidative detoxification of the V&#8208;series simulant PhX, by mean of the microperoxidase AcMP11, affords the corresponding phosphonothioate as the prominent product instead of the classical P&#8208;S and P&#8208;O bond cleavage. While PhX is structurally very close to the live agent VX (the methyl group is replaced by a phenyl), assessment with other surrogates missing the nucleophilic amino function displayed more resistance under the same conditions with no phosphonothioate observed. These encouraging results highlight 1) the efficacy of AcMP11 microperoxidase to efficiently detoxify V&#8208;series organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA), and 2) the necessity to use representative alkyl or aryl phosphonothioates simulants such as PhX bearing the appropriate side chain as well as the P&#8208;O and P&#8208;S cleavable bond to mimic accurately the V&#8208;series OPNA to prevent false positive or false negative results.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioluminescence &#8211; The Vibrant Glow of Nature and its Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature's beautiful glow: An exploration into the world of bioluminescence is provided, covering diverse habitats from fireflies in Central Europe to deep&#8211;sea jellyfish. The chemical mechanisms behind this process and their ecological significance are uncovered with the aim of sparking curiosity in the reader and students new to thetopic.







Abstract
Bioluminescence, the mesmerizing natural phenomenon where living organisms produce light through chemical reactions, has long captivated scientists and laypersons alike, offering a rich tapestry of insights into biological function, ecology, evolution as well as the underlying chemistry.
This comprehensive introductory review systematically explores the phenomenon of bioluminescence, addressing its historical context, geographic dispersion, and ecological significance with a focus on their chemical mechanisms.
Our examination begins with terrestrial bioluminescence, discussing organisms from different habitats. We analyze thefireflies of Central Europe's meadows and the fungi in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil. Additionally, we inspect bioluminescent species in New Zealand, specifically river&#8211;dwelling snails and mosquito larvae found in Waitomo Caves. Our exploration concludes in the Siberian Steppes, highlighting the area&#8216;s luminescent insects and annelids.
Transitioning to the marine realm, the second part of this review examines marine bioluminescent organisms. We explore this phenomenon in deep&#8211;sea jellyfish and their role in the ecosystem. We then move to Toyama Bay, Japan, where seasonal bioluminescence of dinoflagellates and ostracods present a unique case study. We also delve into the bacterial world, discussing how bioluminescent bacteria contribute to symbiotic relationships.
For each organism, we contextualize its bioluminescence, providing details about its discovery, ecological function, and geographical distribution. A special focus lies on the examination of the underlying chemical mechanisms that enables these biological light displays. Concluding this review, we present a series of practical bioluminescence and chemiluminescence experiments, providing a resource for educational demonstrations and student research projects.
Our goal with this review is to provide a summary of bioluminescence across the diverse ecological contexts, contributing to the broader understanding of this unique biological phenomenon and its chemical mechanisms serving researchers new to the field, educators and students alike.

         <title>Engineering A&#8208;type Dye&#8208;Decolorizing Peroxidases by Modification of a Conserved Glutamate Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of experimental methods and molecular dynamics simulations reveals that modifying a glutamate residue in a loop close to the active site in A&#8208;type Dye&#8208;decolorizing peroxidases influences the architecture of the distal heme cavity, and also the long&#8208;range electron channeling of these enzymes. This suggests that the glutamate acts as a pH switch.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) are recently identified microbial enzymes that have been used in several Biotechnology applications from wastewater treatment to lignin valorization. However, their properties and mechanism of action still have many open questions. Their heme&#8208;containing active site is buried by three conserved flexible loops with a putative role in modulating substrate access and enzyme catalysis. Here, we investigated the role of a conserved glutamate residue in stabilizing interactions in loop 2 of A&#8208;type DyPs. First, we did site saturation mutagenesis of this residue, replacing it with all possible amino acids in bacterial DyPs from Bacillus subtilis (BsDyP) and from Kitasatospora aureofaciens (KaDyP1), the latter being characterized here for the first time. We screened the resulting libraries of variants for activity towards ABTS and identified variants with increased catalytic efficiency. The selected variants were purified and characterized for activity and stability. We furthermore used Molecular Dynamics simulations to rationalize the increased catalytic efficiency and found that the main reason is the electron channeling becoming easier from surface&#8208;exposed tryptophans. Based on our findings, we also propose that this glutamate could work as a pH switch in the wild&#8208;type enzyme, preventing intracellular damage.

         <dc:description>
The identification and synthesis of a new ligand for two C&#8208;type lectin receptors, i.&#8201;e. dendritic cell activating receptor (DCAR) and macrophage&#8208;inducible C&#8208;type lectin (Mincle), are described.







Abstract
In this work, we have discovered that the Gal&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;Gal&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;GlcNAc trisaccharide, a fragment of the B antigen Type&#8208;1, is a new ligand of two C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs) i.&#8201;e. DCAR and Mincle which are key players in different types of autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, we report here on a straightforward methodology to access pure Gal&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;Gal&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;GlcNAc trisaccharide. A spacer with a terminal primary amine group was included at the reducing end of the GlcNAc residue thus ensuring the further functionalization of the trisaccharide Gal&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;Gal&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;GlcNAc.

         <title>Reading and Writing the Ubiquitin Code Using Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deciphering ubiquitin proteoform signaling and its role in disease has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in the field. The effects of ubiquitin modifications, its relation to ubiquitin&#8208;related machineries, and its signaling output has been particularly limited by its reconstitution and means of characterization. Advances in genetic code expansion have contributed towards addressing these challenges by precision incorporation of unnatural amino acids through site selective codon suppression. This review discusses recent advances in studying the &#8216;writers&#8217;, &#8216;readers&#8217;, and &#8216;erasers&#8217; of the ubiquitin code using genetic code expansion. Highlighting strategies towards genetically encoded protein ubiquitination, ubiquitin phosphorylation, acylation, and finally surveying ubiquitin interactions, we strive to bring attention to this unique approach towards addressing a widespread proteoform problem.</dc:description>

         <title>A QUANTITATIVE METHOD TO DISTINGUISH CYTOSOLIC FROM ENDOSOME&#8208;TRAPPED CELL&#8208;PENETRATING PEPTIDES</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are known to penetrate cells through endocytosis and translocation. The two pathways are hardly distinguished in current cell assays. We developed a reliable, simple and robust method to distinguish and quantify independently the two routes. The assay requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides. When the labeled peptide is intact, the fluorescence signal is weak thanks to the dark quenching property of DABCYL. A 10&#8208;fold higher fluorescence signal is measured when the labeled peptide is degraded. By referring to a standard fluorescent curve according to the concentration of the hydrolyzed peptide, we have access to the internalized peptide quantity. Therefore, cell lysis after internalization permits to determine the total quantity of intracellular peptide. The molecular state of the internalized peptide (intact or degraded), depends on its location in cells (cytosol vs endo&#8208;lysosomes), and can be blocked by boiling cells. This boiling step results indeed in denaturation and inhibition of the cellular enzymes. The advantage of this method is the possibility to quantify translocation at 37&#176;C and to compare it to the 4&#176;C condition, where all endocytosis processes are inhibited. We found that ranking of the translocation efficacy is DABCYL&#8208;R6&#8208;(&#949;CF)K &gt;&gt; DABCYL&#8208;R4&#8208;(&#949;CF)K &#8805; CF&#8208;R9.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing PET Degrading Enzymes: A Combinatory Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic waste has become a substantial environmental issue. A potential strategy to mitigate this problem is to use enzymatic hydrolysis of plastics to depolymerize post&#8208;consumer waste and allow it to be reused. Over the last few decades, the use of enzymatic PET&#8208;degrading enzymes has shown promise as a great solution for creating a circular plastic waste economy. PsPETase from Piscinibacter sakaiensis has been identified as an enzyme with tremendous potential for such applications. But to improve its efficiency, enzyme engineering has been applied aiming at enhancing its thermal stability, enzymatic activity, and ease of production.&#160; Here, we combine different strategies such as structure&#8208;based rational design, ancestral sequence reconstruction and machine learning to engineer more highly active Combi&#8208;PETase variants with a melting temperature of 70&#176;C and optimal performance at 60&#176;C. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that these approaches, commonly used in other works of enzyme engineering, are most effective when utilized in combination, enabling the improvement of enzymes for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>In Silico Study of the Early Stages of Aggregation of &#946; Sheet&#8208;forming Antimicrobial Peptide GL13K</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are of growing interest as potential candidates that may offer more resilience against antimicrobial resistance than traditional antibiotic agents. In this article, we perform the first in silico study of the synthetic&#160;&#223; sheet&#8208;forming AMP GL13K. Through atomistic simulations of single and multi&#8208;peptide systems under different conditions, we are able to shine a light on the short timescales of early aggregation. We find that isolated peptide conformations are primarily dictated by sequence rather than charge, whereas changing charge has a significant impact on the conformational free energy landscape of multi&#8208;peptide systems. We demonstrate that the loss of charge&#8208;charge repulsion is a sufficient minimal model for experimentally observed aggregation. Overall, our work explores the molecular biophysical underpinnings of the first stages of aggregation of a unique AMP, laying necessary groundwork for its further development as an antibiotic candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalamins function as allosteric activators of an Angelman syndrome&#8208;associated UBE3A/E6AP variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genetic aberrations of the maternal UBE3A allele, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP, are the cause of Angelman syndrome (AS), an imprinting disorder. In most cases, the maternal UBE3A allele is not expressed. Yet, approximately 10 percent of AS individuals harbor distinct point mutations in the maternal allele resulting in the expression of full&#8208;length E6AP variants that frequently display compromised ligase activity. In a high&#8208;throughput screen, we identified cyanocobalamin, a vitamin B12&#8208;derivative, and several alloxazine derivatives as activators of the AS&#8208;linked E6AP&#8208;F583S variant. Furthermore, we show by cross&#8208;linking coupled to mass spectrometry that cobalamins affect the structural dynamics of E6AP&#8208;F583S and apply limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry to obtain information about the regions of E6AP that are involved in, or are affected by binding cobalamins and alloxazine derivatives. Our data suggest that dietary supplementation with vitamin B12 can be beneficial for AS individuals.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for the Construction of Multicyclic Phage Display Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicyclic peptides are appealing for drug discovery due to their increased potency in inhibiting protein&#8208;protein interactions. This review summarizes the heretofore&#8208;reported strategies used for the construction of multicyclic phage display libraries. The multicyclization methods applicable to phage include disulfide bond formation, multi&#8208;cysteine crosslinking, and crosslinking of cysteine and non&#8208;cysteine residues. We also highlight herein the exemplary ligands for therapeutically important proteins discovered through the use of multicyclic phage libraries.







Abstract
Peptide therapeutics have gained great interest due to their multiple advantages over small molecule and antibody&#8208;based drugs. Peptide drugs are easier to synthesize, have the potential for oral bioavailability, and are large enough to target protein&#8208;protein interactions that are undruggable by small molecules. However, two major limitations have made it difficult to develop novel peptide therapeutics not derived from natural products, including the metabolic instability of peptides and the difficulty of reaching antibody&#8208;like potencies and specificities. Compared to linear and disulfide&#8208;monocyclized peptides, multicyclic peptides can provide increased conformational rigidity, enhanced metabolic stability, and higher potency in inhibiting protein&#8208;protein interactions. The identification of novel multicyclic peptide binders can be difficult, however, recent advancements in the construction of multicyclic phage libraries have greatly advanced the process of identifying novel multicyclic peptide binders for therapeutically relevant protein targets. This review will describe the current approaches used to create multicyclic peptide libraries, highlighting the novel chemistries developed and the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work done on validating these libraries against different protein targets.

         <title>Using Capillary Electrophoresis to Investigate Protein Conformational and Compositional Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detailed insights into protein structure/function relationships require robust characterization methodologies. Free&#8208;solution capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a unique separation technique which is sensitive to the conformation and/or composition of proteins, and therefore provides information on the heterogeneity of these properties. Three unrelated, conformationally/compositionally&#8208;altered proteins were separated by CE. An electrophoretic mobility distribution was determined for each protein along with its conformational and/or compositional heterogeneity. CE results were compared with molar mass distributions obtained from size&#8208;exclusion chromatography coupled to light scattering (SEC&#8208;MALS). Bovine serum albumin oligomers and two monomeric species were separated, highlighting variations in conformational/compositional heterogeneity among the oligomers. Analysis of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase resolved two monomeric conformers and various tetrameric species, illustrating the impact of zinc ion removal and disulfide bond reduction on the protein&#8217;s heterogeneity. The apo (calcium&#8208;free) and holo forms of bovine &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin were separated and differences in the species&#8217; heterogeneity was measured; by contrast, the SEC&#8208;MALS profiles were identical. Comparative analysis of these structurally unrelated proteins provided novel insights into the interplay between molar mass and conformational/compositional heterogeneity. Overall, this study expands the utility of CE by demonstrating its capacity to discern protein species and their heterogeneity, properties which are not readily accessible by other analytical techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin&#8722;BODIPY Dyad: Enhancing Photodynamic Inactivation via Antenna Effect</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic inactivation: A porphyrin&#8722;BODIPY dyad was synthesized to improve the photodynamic activity against microorganisms. In this structure, BODIPY acts as a visible light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while porphyrin is a spin converter to produce reactive oxygen species. This photosensitizer was effective to eliminate Staphylococcus aureus cell suspensions and bacteria adhered to surfaces.







Abstract
A porphyrin&#8722;BODIPY dyad (P&#8722;BDP) was obtained through covalent bonding, featuring a two&#8208;segment design comprising a light&#8208;harvesting antenna system connected to an energy acceptor unit. The absorption spectrum of P&#8722;BDP resulted from an overlap of the individual spectra of its constituent parts, with the fluorescence emission of the BODIPY unit experiencing significant quenching (96&#8201;%) due to the presence of the porphyrin unit. Spectroscopic, computational, and redox investigations revealed a competition between photoinduced energy and electron transfer processes. The dyad demonstrated the capability to sensitize both singlet molecular oxygen and superoxide radical anions. Additionally, P&#8722;BDP effectively induced the photooxidation of L&#8208;tryptophan. In suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus cells, the dyad led to a reduction of over 3.5&#8197;log (99.99&#8201;%) in cell survival following 30&#8197;min of irradiation with green light. Photodynamic inactivation caused by P&#8722;BDP was also extended to the individual bacterium level, focusing on bacterial cells adhered to a surface. This dyad successfully achieved the total elimination of the bacteria upon 20&#8197;min of irradiation. Therefore, P&#8722;BDP presents an interesting photosensitizing structure that takes advantage of the light&#8208;harvesting antenna properties of the BODIPY unit combined with porphyrin, offering potential to enhance photoinactivation of bacteria.

         <title>Binding Dynamics of a Stapled Peptide Targeting the Transcription Factor NF&#8722;Y</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truncated version of a stapled peptide maintains moderate affinity for the for transcription factor complex NF&#8722;Y. Interestingly, the peptide's C&#8208;terminal region shows considerable flexibility as confirmed by crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations pointing, towards the importance of ligand flexibility in the bound state.







Abstract
Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in gene regulation, and their malfunction can result in a plethora of severe diseases. TFs are therefore interesting therapeutic targets, but their involvement in protein&#8211;protein interaction networks and the frequent lack of well&#8211;defined binding pockets render them challenging targets for classical small molecules. As an alternative, peptide&#8211;based scaffolds have proven useful, in particular with an &#945;&#8208;helical active conformation. Peptide&#8211;based strategies often require extensive structural optimization efforts, which could benefit from a more detailed understanding of the dynamics in inhibitor/protein interactions. In this study, we investigate how truncated stapled &#945;&#8208;helical peptides interact with the transcription factor Nuclear Factor&#8208;Y (NF&#8722;Y). We identified a 13&#8208;mer minimal binding core region, for which two crystal structures with an altered C&#8208;terminal peptide conformation when bound to NF&#8722;Y were obtained. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the C&#8208;terminal part of the stapled peptide is indeed relatively flexible while still showing defined interactions with NF&#8722;Y. Our findings highlight the importance of flexibility in the bound state of peptides, which can contribute to overall binding affinity.

         <title>Rational Design of a Circularly Permuted Flavin&#8208;Based Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the rational design and biochemical characterization of a circularly permuted flavin&#8208;binding fluorescent reporter, which is optimized for high fluorescence. Additionally, this work demonstrates the application of this reporter as a genetically encoded sensor for detecting viral protease activity in mammalian cells.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;based fluorescent proteins are oxygen&#8208;independent reporters that hold great promise for imaging anaerobic and hypoxic biological systems. In this study, we explored the feasibility of applying circular permutation, a valuable method for the creation of fluorescent sensors, to flavin&#8208;based fluorescent proteins. We used rational design and structural data to identify a suitable location for circular permutation in iLOV, a flavin&#8208;based reporter derived from A. thaliana. However, relocating the N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini to this position resulted in a significant reduction in fluorescence. This loss of fluorescence was reversible, however, by fusing dimerizing coiled coils at the new N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini to compensate for the increase in local chain entropy. Additionally, by inserting protease cleavage sites in circularly permuted iLOV, we developed two protease sensors and demonstrated their application in mammalian cells. In summary, our work establishes the first approach to engineer circularly permuted FbFPs optimized for high fluorescence and further showcases the utility of circularly permuted FbFPs to serve as a scaffold for sensor engineering.

         <title>Monitoring Anthracycline Cancer Drug&#8208;Nucleosome Interaction by NMR Using a Specific Isotope Labeling Approach for Nucleosomal DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specific isotope&#8208;labeling strategy for nucleosomal DNA is used to monitor the binding of anthracycline cancer drug aclarubicin by NMR. The data highlight intrinsic flexibility in the 601 DNA sequence and indicate that aclarubicin binds first the terminal DNA ends including an exposed AT&#8208;rich segment to then progressively bind inward.







Abstract
Chromatinized DNA is targeted by proteins and small molecules to regulate chromatin function. For example, anthracycline cancer drugs evict nucleosomes in a mechanism that is still poorly understood. We here developed a flexible method for specific isotope labeling of nucleosomal DNA enabling NMR studies of such nucleosome interactions. We describe the synthesis of segmental one&#8208;strand 13C&#8208;thymidine labeled 601&#8208;DNA, the assignment of the methyl signals, and demonstrate its use to observe site&#8208;specific binding to the nucleosome by aclarubicin, an anthracycline cancer drug that intercalates into the DNA minor grooves. Our results highlight intrinsic conformational heterogeneity in the 601 DNA sequence and show that aclarubicin binds an exposed AT&#8208;rich region near the DNA end. Overall, our data point to a model where the drug invades the nucleosome from the terminal ends inward, eventually resulting in histone eviction and nucleosome disruption.

         <title>OptoProfilin: A Single Component Biosensor of Applied Cellular Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor that couples Profilin 1 with blue light responsive Cry2 from Arabidopsis. Upon light activation in HeLa cells, OptoProfilin recruits to focal adhesions when under non&#8208;stress conditions and to condensates under various applied cellular stress conditions. In both cases, Profilin&#8722;VASP interactions are the basis for OptoProfilin recruitment.







Abstract
The actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to ageing, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and viral infection. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin (&#8216;OptoProfilin&#8217;) can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of preexisting work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress&#8208;induced changes in the cytoskeleton.

&lt;p&gt;OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor that couples Profilin 1 with blue light responsive Cry2 from Arabidopsis. Upon light activation in HeLa cells, OptoProfilin recruits to focal adhesions when under non-stress conditions and to condensates under various applied cellular stress conditions. In both cases, Profilin&#8722;VASP interactions are the basis for OptoProfilin recruitment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to ageing, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and viral infection. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin (&#8216;OptoProfilin&#8217;) can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of preexisting work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Cell Density Cultivation Combined with high Specific Enzyme Activity: Cultivation Protocol for the Production of an Amine Transaminase from Bacillus megaterium in E. coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fed&#8208;batch protocol is established for the production of an amine transaminase of Bacillus megaterium. Hereby, the main goal is to reach high cell densities accompanied by high titers of active enzyme. Feed rate, inducer concentration, and post&#8208;induction temperature were key parameters of the investigation.







Abstract
High cell density cultivation is an established method for the production of various industrially important products such as recombinant proteins. However, these protocols are not always suitable for biocatalytic processes as the focus often lies on biomass production rather than high specific activities of the enzyme inside the cells. In contrast, a range of shake flask protocols are well known with high specific activities but rather low cell densities. To overcome this gap, we established a tailor&#8208;made fed&#8208;batch protocol combining both aspects: high cell density and high specific activities of heterologously produced enzyme. Using the example of an industrially relevant amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium, we describe a strategy to optimize the cultivation yield based on the feed rate, IPTG concentration, and post&#8208;induction temperature. By adjusting these key parameters, we were able to increase the specific activity by 2.6&#8208;fold and the wet cell weight by even 17&#8208;fold compared to shake flasks. Finally, we were able to verify our established protocol by transferring it to another experimenter. With that, our optimization strategy can serve as a template for the production of high titers of heterologously produced, active enzymes and might enable the availability of these catalysts for upscaling biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Novel Triazole&#8208;Containing &#8220;Dipeptides&#8221;: Synthesis, Molecular Docking and Analgesic Activity Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dipeptides&#8221; of a new structure have been synthesized. Molecular docking has established possible intermolecular interactions of dipeptides with potential targets. The analgesic properties of some synthesized dipeptides were studied and it was found that some compounds have identified antinociceptive activity in the tail flick test, compared with the control group.







Abstract
Dipeptides of a new structure based on &#946;&#8208;triazolalanines and (L)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids were synthesized and optimal conditions were developed that ensure both chemical and optical purity of the final products. Molecular docking was carried out and possible intermolecular interactions of dipeptides with potential targets were established. Based on these studies, the analgesic property of chosen dipeptides was studied and it was found that some compounds possess revealed antinociceptive activity in the tail&#8208;flick test.

         <title>Investigating the Potential of Phenolic Compounds and Carbohydrates as Acceptor Substrates for Levansucrasse&#8208;Catalyzed Transfructosylation Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study characterizes the acceptor specificity of levansucrases (LSs) from Gluconobacter oxydans (LS1), Vibrio natriegens (LS2), Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (LS3), and Paraburkholderia graminis (LS4) using sucrose as&#160;fructosyl donor and selected phenolic compounds and carbohydrates as acceptors. Overall, V. natriegens LS2 proved to be the best biocatalyst for the transfructosylation of phenolic compounds. More than one fructosyl unit could be attached to fructosylated phenolic compounds. The transfructosylation of epicatechin by P. graminis LS4 resulted in the most diversified products, with up to five fructosyl units transferred. The acceptor specificity of LS towards phenolic compounds and their transfructosylation products were found to greatly depend on their chemical structure: number of phenolic rings,&#160; reactivity of hydroxyl groups and&#160; presence of aliphatic chains or methoxy groups. As for carbohydrates, the transfructosylation yield was more dependent on the acceptor type than LS source. The highest yield of fructosylated&#8208;trisaccharides&#160; was Erlose from the transfructosylation of maltose catalyzed by LS2, with production reaching 200 g/L. LS2 was more selective towards the transfructosylation of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates, while reactions catalyzed by LS1, LS3 and LS4 also produced&#160; fructooligosaccharides. This study shows the high potential for the application of&#160;LSs in the glycosylation of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates.</dc:description>

         <title>PSL Chemical Biology Symposia: Recent Progress in Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not initially planned: While waiting for the large upcoming Ferroptosis event in late 2024 (CSHA,China), this 5th PSL Chemical Biology Symposium, was held at the Institut Curie in Paris on 26th January. This event showed the state of the art in Ferroptosis, an iron&#8208;dependent form of cell death. World&#8208;leading scientists featured the latest innovations and future trends in this innovative and dynamic field related to cancer and degenerative diseases.







Abstract
This symposium is the 5th PSL (Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres) Chemical Biology meeting (2015, 2016, 2019, 2023, 2024) held at Institut Curie. This initiative originally started at Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles (ICSN) in Gif&#8208;sur&#8208;Yvette, with a strong focus on chemistry. It was then continued at the Institut Curie (2015) covering a larger scope, before becoming the official PSL Chemical Biology meeting. This latest edition hosted around 150 participants and was focused on the burgeoning field of ferroptosis, its mechanism and implications in health and disease. While not initially planned, it was felt that the next large Ferroptosis venue (CSHA, China) would not happen before late 2024. A discussion involving Conrad, Birsoy, Ubellacker, Brabletz and Rodriguez next to lake Como in Italy sponsored by the DKFZ, prompted us to fill in this gap and to organize a Ferroptosis meeting in Paris beforehand.

         <title>Bacterial Hydrazine Biosynthetic Pathways Featuring Cupin/Methionyl tRNA Synthetase&#8208;like Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like didomain enzymes, also known as hydrazine synthetases, generate amino acid&#8208;based hydrazines, which serve as key biosynthetic precursors of several different N&#8722;N functional groups in natural products. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on hydrazine synthetases, including their reaction mechanisms and divergent pathways occurring after N&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;Nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bond&#8208;containing functional groups in natural products and synthetic drugs play significant roles in exerting biological activities. The mechanisms of N&#8722;N bond formation in natural organic molecules have garnered increasing attention over the decades. Recent advances have illuminated various enzymatic and nonenzymatic strategies, and our understanding of natural N&#8722;N bond construction is rapidly expanding. A group of didomain proteins with zinc&#8208;binding cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like domains, also known as hydrazine synthetases, generates amino acid&#8208;based hydrazines, which serve as key biosynthetic precursors of diverse N&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing functionalities such as hydrazone, diazo, triazene, pyrazole, and pyridazinone groups. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on hydrazine synthetase mechanisms and the various pathways employing this unique bond&#8208;forming machinery.

Recent advances have illuminated various enzymatic and nonenzymatic strategies, and our understanding of natural N&#8722;N bond construction is rapidly expanding. A group of didomain proteins with zinc-binding cupin/methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS)-like domains, also known as hydrazine synthetases, generates amino acid-based hydrazines, which serve as key biosynthetic precursors of diverse N&#8722;N bond-containing functionalities such as hydrazone, diazo, triazene, pyrazole, and pyridazinone groups. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on hydrazine synthetase mechanisms and the various pathways employing this unique bond-forming machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>U1 snRNP Biogenesis Defects in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism. In several neurodegenerative diseases (SMA, PCH7 and FUS&#8208;ALS), U1 snRNP biogenesis pathway is impaired, reducing U1 snRNP nuclear concentration and triggering changes in neuronal RNA metabolism and activity. There are lines of evidences suggesting that a similar phenomenon could occur in other neurodegenerative diseases like FTLD or AD.







Abstract
The U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) plays a pivotal role in the intricate process of gene expression, specifically within nuclear RNA processing. By initiating the splicing reaction and modulating 3&#8217;&#8208;end processing, U1 snRNP exerts precise control over RNA metabolism and gene expression. This ribonucleoparticle is abundantly present, and its complex biogenesis necessitates shuttling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Over the past three decades, extensive research has illuminated the crucial connection between disrupted U snRNP biogenesis and several prominent human diseases, notably various neurodegenerative conditions. The perturbation of U1 snRNP homeostasis has been firmly established in diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and FUS&#8208;mediated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Intriguingly, compelling evidence suggests a potential correlation in Fronto&#8208;temporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease as well. Although the U snRNP biogenesis pathway is conserved across all eukaryotic cells, neurons, in particular, appear to be highly susceptible to alterations in spliceosome homeostasis. In contrast, other cell types exhibit a greater resilience to such disturbances. This vulnerability underscores the intricate relationship between U1 snRNP dynamics and the health of neuronal cells, shedding light on potential avenues for understanding and addressing neurodegenerative disorders.

         <title>Molecular Driving Forces in the Self&#8208;Association of Silaffin Peptide R5 from MD Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 19&#8208;residue silaffin&#8208;R5 peptide has been widely studied for its ability to precipitate uniform SiO2 particles through mild temperature and pH pathways, in the absence of any organic solvents. There is consensus that post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of side chains has a large impact on the biomineralization process. Thus, it is imperative to understand the precise mechanisms that dictate the formation of SiO2 from R5 peptide, including the effects of PTM on peptide aggregation and peptide&#8208;surface adsorption. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the aggregation of R5 dimer with multiple PTMs, with the presence of different ions in solution. Since this system has strong interactions with deep metastable states, we use parallel bias metadynamics with partitioned families to efficiently sample the different states of the system. We find that peptide aggregation is a prerequisite for biomineralization. We observe that the electrostatic interactions are essential in the R5 dimer aggregation; for wild type R5 that only has positively charged residues, phosphate ions HPO42&#8208; in the solution form a bridge between two peptides and are essential for peptide aggregation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;gene Reporter&#8208;amplifier Architecture for Enhancing the Sensitivity of Molecular MRI by Water Exchange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of genetic reporters for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for investigating biological functions in vivo. However, current MRI reporters have low sensitivity, making it challenging to create significant contrast against the tissue background, especially when only a small fraction of cells express the reporter. To overcome this limitation, we developed an approach for amplifying the sensitivity of molecular MRI by combining a chemogenetic contrast mechanism with a biophysical approach to increase water diffusion through the co&#8208;expression of a dual&#8208;gene construct comprising an organic anion transporting polypeptide, Oatp1b3, and a water channel, Aqp1. We first show that the expression of Aqp1 amplifies MRI contrast in cultured cells engineered to express Oatp1b3. We demonstrate that the contrast amplification is caused by Aqp1&#8208;driven increase in water exchange, which provides the gadolinium ions internalized by Oatp1b3&#8208;expressing cells with access to a larger water pool compared with exchange&#8208;limited conditions. We further show that our methodology allows cells to be detected using approximately 10&#8208;fold lower concentrations of gadolinium than that in the Aqp1&#8208;free scenario. Finally, we show that our approach enables the imaging of mixed&#8208;cell cultures containing a low fraction of Oatp1b3labeled cells that are undetectable on the basis of Oatp1b3 expression alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonlinear impact of electrolyte solutions on protein dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halophilic organisms have adapted to multi&#8208;molar salt concentrations, their cytoplasmic proteins functioning despite stronger attraction between hydrophobic groups. These proteins, of interest in biotechnology because of decreasing fresh&#8208;water resources, have excess acidic amino acids.&#160; &#160;It has been suggested that conformational fluctuations &#8208;&#8208; critical for protein function &#8208;&#8208; decrease in the presence of a stronger hydrophobic effect, and that an acidic proteome would counteract this decrease. However, our understanding of the salt&#8208; and acidic amino acid dependency of enzymatic activity is limited. Here, using solution NMR relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations for in total 14 proteins, we show that salt concentration has a limited and moreover non&#8208;monotonic impact on protein dynamics. The results speak against the conformational&#8208;fluctuations model, instead indicating that maintaining protein dynamics to ensure protein function is not an evolutionary driving force behind the acidic proteome of halophilic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Mushroom Tyrosinase: Six Isoenzymes Catalyzing Distinct&#160;Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;Mushroom tyrosinase&#8221; from the common button mushroom is the most frequently used source of tyrosinase activity, both for basic and applied research. Here, the complete tyrosinase family from Agaricus bisporus var. bisporus (abPPO1&#8208;6) was cloned from mRNA and expressed heterologously using a single protocol. All six isoenzymes accept a wide range of phenolic and catecholic substrates, but display pronounced differences in their specificity and enzymatic reaction rate. AbPPO3 ignores &#947;&#8208;l&#8208;glutaminyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzene (GHB), a natural phenol present in mM concentrations in A. bisporus, while AbPPO4 processes 100 &#181;M GHB at 4&#8208;times the rate of the catechol l&#8208;DOPA. All six AbPPOs are biochemically distinct enzymes fit for different roles in the fungal life cycle, which challenges the traditional concept of isoenzymes as catalyzing the same chemical reaction and varying only in secondary properties. Transferring this approach to other enzymes and organisms will greatly stimulate both the study of the in vivo function(s) of enzymes and the application of these highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>
