         <title>The position of indole methylation controls the structure, DNA binding and cellular functions of mithramycin SA&#8208;Trp analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mithramycin (MTM) is a polyketide anti&#8208;cancer natural product, which functions by noncovalent binding to DNA in the minor groove without intercalation, resulting in inhibiting transcription at G/C&#8208;rich promoters. MTM is a potent inhibitor of cancer cells, such as Ewing sarcoma, driven by abnormal fusions involving ETS family transcription factors FLI1 and ERG. However, MTM is rather toxic and non&#8208;selective; therefore, safer, selective analogues of MTM are required for use in clinic as anti&#8208;cancer drugs. In this study by using a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic, biophysical, cell and molecular biological techniques, we explored structural and functional consequences of 3&#8208;side chain methylation at positions 5, 6 and 7 of the indole ring of the potent analogue MTM SA&#8208;Trp. We showed that the conformation of the analogues in complexes with DNA, their DNA binding function, cytotoxicity, selectivity and potency as transcription antagonists depended on the position of the methylation. MTM SA&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;Trp emerged as the most selective analogue, presumably due to the right balance of the DNA binding and the solvent exposure of the 3&#8208;side chain. This study demonstrates that minor chemical changes can have strong effects in analogue development and paves a way to further development of next generation MTM analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of key active site positions controlling the chemoselectivity of Aspergillus brasiliensis unspecific peroxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme&#8208;containing unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have catched significant attention as biocatalysts for oxidation reactions due to their ability to function without expensive nicotinamide cofactors. In our recent study, the UPO from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbrUPO) was found to catalyze the aromatic hydroxylation of substituted benzenes, a feature that distinguishes AbrUPO from other reported wild&#8208;type UPOs. To elucidate the underlying factors, we examined the active site and substrate access channel of AbrUPO, which contain fewer phenylalanine residues compared to other UPOs that primarily catalyze benzylic hydroxylation. We constructed twenty two AbrUPO variants with single, double, triple and quadruple amino acid substitutions to mimic the active sites or substrate access channels of other UPOs. A number of mutated variants exhibited altered activity and selectivity, and several positions were identified that influence enzyme chemoselectivity. Among them, substitution of alanine at position 186 with bulkier residues such as phenylalanine or leucine led to a shift in chemoselectivity toward alkyl chain hydroxylation of substituted benzenes. Molecular docking studies indicated that the A186F mutation restricts the flexibility and reorientation of ethylbenzene in the active site of AbrUPO, thereby preventing oxidation at the aromatic ring while promoting benzylic hydroxylation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Recognition Tag of Human Origin for Bioorthogonal Generation of Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates using Microbial Biotin Ligase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of enzymes such as microbial transglutaminase, lipoate protein ligase A or sortase A for the generation of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) has proven to be a powerful tool for the site&#8208;specific payload conjugation to tumor&#8208;specific antibodies. Here we report the extension of this enzymatic toolbox by Pyrococcus horikoshii biotin ligase (PhBL). To this end, the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab was equipped with p67, the 67 amino acid carboxyl&#8208;terminal domain of human propionyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase &#945; subunit, at the C&#8208;terminus of either the light or heavy chain (Trz&#8208;LC:p67 and Trz&#8208;HC:p67). Upon incubation with PhBL, the azide&#8208;bearing linker desthiobiotin azide was site&#8208;specifically coupled to the p67 domains at the antibody. Subsequent strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) with DBCO&#8208;AF488 and DBCO&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PAB&#8208;MMAE yielded conjugates near to full conversion. In cellular assays, these constructs exhibited single&#8208;digit nanomolar EC50 values in cellular proliferation assays on SK&#8208;BR&#8208;3 and A431 cells, where no significant difference in the performance between the two variants Trz&#8208;LC:p67&#8208;MMAE and Trz&#8208;HC:p67&#8208;MMAE was observed. On high Fc&#8208;&#947;IIIa receptor expressing Jurkat cells, Trz&#8208;HC:p67&#8208;MMAE exhibited higher potency than Trz&#8208;LC:p67&#8208;MMAE, indicating an Fc&#8208;blocking effect of p67 when fused to the light chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Induction and Manipulation of Biomolecular Condensates Through Spatially Heterogeneous Solution Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article, it is discussed how spatial control over the formation and movement of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) can be achieved and how this type of control can help in the reliable generation and study of BMCs. Spatial control over BMCs is crucial in&#8201;vivo and therefore also desirable for in&#8201;vitro studies in order to approach relevant scenarios.

The study of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) is of great current interest because of the proposed roles of these types of assemblies in biological function and disease. In living cells, BMCs form in a highly heterogeneous environment and are influenced by concentration gradients of various relevant species. Furthermore, the biological functionality of the BMCs requires precise spatial control of their formation in some cases. In recent years, a number of in&#8201;vitro experimental approaches have emerged that allow the generation, study, and manipulation of BMCs through the creation of well&#8208;defined spatially heterogeneous solution conditions relevant for BMC formation. In this concept article, it is presented in what way such methods can contribute to improved understanding and control of BMCs.

         <title>Inhibition of Surfactin Biosynthesis in Bacillus Subtilis Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Adenylation Domain Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;based adenylation domain inhibitors with the modification of 2&#8242;&#8208;OH in the adenosine skeleton are synthesized. Coupled with affinity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), their activities toward surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in Bacillus subtilis are evaluated. Finally, the ability of inhibiting the production of surfactin in the bacterial cells is confirmed.

Several natural bacterial virulence factors are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, NRPSs producing such natural products have emerged as attractive antibiotic targets. N&#8208;(aminoacyl)sulfamoyladenosine (aminoacyl&#8208;AMS) derivatives with chemical modifications at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group of the adenosine skeleton are previously reported that inhibit NRPS amino acid adenylation (A) domains in recombinant enzyme systems, cellular lysates, and bacterial cells. The introduction of a couple of functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group preserves the binding affinity toward NRPS amino acid A&#8208;domains and improves cell permeability of the AMS scaffold. However, the effects of these compounds on secondary metabolism have not yet been explored. In this study, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) probe, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne, is validated for in&#8208;cell applications, including imaging of NRPS activities in bacteria. Next, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives incorporating methyl, benzyl, and cyanomethyl functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group are synthesized and their inhibitory activity toward intracellular surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in the surfactin&#8208;producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 are investigated using the AfBPP probe. Finally, the attenuation of surfactin production using a Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne probe and L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives in B. subtilis is demonstrated. These results indicate that chemical modifications at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group provide a way to develop cell&#8208;permeable and functional NRPS A&#8208;domain inhibitors.

         <title>Structure&#8208;affinity relationship analysis and affinity maturation of a calprotectin&#8208;binding peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide 3 is an 18&#8208;amino acid linear peptide binding with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity to the inflammation marker calprotectin. Its application in point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic assays has shown promising results, yet improving its affinity for calprotectin could facilitate the development of sensitive and robust assays. Herein we report a detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship analysis of Peptide 3 to better understand the importance of each individual amino acid for the binding to calprotectin. Moreover, we have followed two different approaches, one based on prolonging the peptide with random sequences and phage display selection, and one on screening chemically synthesized peptide variants containing non&#8208;canonical amino acids, to increase its binding affinity. Combining several mutations that enhance affinity by small factors yielded Peptide 4 binding human calprotectin with a KD of 39 &#177; 5 nM measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, which is a 5&#8208;fold improvement compared to the previously reported Peptide 3.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipid Metabolism and Immune Function: Chemical Tools for Insights into T&#8208;Cell Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores how lipids regulate immune responses, particularly in T&#8208;cell function. Advances in metabolomics and proteomics provide insights into lipid&#8208;mediated immunity. Fluorescent lipids enable single&#8208;cell analysis of lipid uptake and metabolism. Click chemistry offers a precise method to track lipid dynamics, overcoming traditional limitations and expanding therapeutic possibilities for immune&#8208;related diseases.

Lipids are essential biomolecules playing critical roles in cellular processes, including energy storage, membrane structure, and signaling. This review highlights the chemical tools that have been developed to study the role of lipid metabolism in immune function, focusing on T&#8208;cell biology. Fatty acids (FAs), as core lipid components, influence immune responses through structural, signaling, and metabolic roles. Recent studies reveal how specific FAs modulate T&#8208;cell activation, proliferation, and function, with implications for regulatory and effector subsets. Emerging tools, such as fluorescence&#8208;based lipids and click chemistry, enable precise tracking of lipid uptake and metabolism at the single&#8208;cell level, addressing limitations of traditional bulk methods. Advances in metabolomics and proteomics offer further insights into lipid&#8208;mediated immune regulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides opportunities to target lipid metabolism in therapeutic strategies for cancer and other immune&#8208;related diseases. The integration of lipidomic technologies into immunology uncovers novel perspectives on how lipids shape immune responses at cellular and molecular scales.

         <title>Harnessing from Nature &#8211; Evolving Potential of Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial peptides are recognized as the first line of the host immune defensive system to combat bacterial infection and regulate the healthy balance of host&#8208;microbe interactions. Benefited from their bactericidal capabilities and efficacy of modulating microbial homeostasis, emerging developments are trying to maximize AMP's biomedical applications for next&#8208;generation antimicrobial agents, peptide therapeutics, advanced biosensing and bioimaging.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are recognized as one of the most ancient components of innate immunity, playing a pivotal role as the first line of host defense systems. These evolutionarily conserved molecules have been identified in various organisms, from prokaryotes to humans. AMPs establish a delicate balanced relationship between host and microbes, by simultaneously regulating the biological activities of pathogens and commensal microbes. Given the escalating global concern over antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to explore alternative strategies to combat challenging infectious diseases. AMPs have emerged as promising candidates employed in clinical practice due to their sustainable bactericidal properties. Witnessed by deep understanding of AMPs actions toward host and bacteria, the potential applications of AMPs extend far beyond infection control. Emerging developments harnessed natural capabilities of AMPs to optimize their roles in modulating host signaling, treating diverse diseases, advancing biosensing and bioimaging technologies. In this Concept paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the diversity and properties of AMPs. Additionally, we elaborate on the mechanisms underlying AMP activity and bacterial responses counteracting AMPs&#8217; functions. Most importantly, we discuss potential biomedical applications of AMPs and offer perspectives on their future development.

         <title>A Silicon Rhodamine&#8208;fused Glibenclamide to Label and Detect Malaria&#8208;infected Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red fluorescent silicon rhodamine&#8208;conjugated glibenclamide (SiR&#8208;glib) is synthesized. Labeling experiments in cells reveal the endoplasmic reticulum as the primary target of SiR&#8208;glib, and is applicable to detect malaria&#8208;infected red blood cells. The latter is possible via a portable smartphone&#8208;based microscope, with the potential for usage in malaria endemic areas.







Abstract
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum affects the lives of millions of people worldwide every year. The detection of replicating parasites within human red blood cells is of paramount importance, requiring appropriate diagnostic tools. Herein, we design and apply a silicon rhodamine&#8208;fused glibenclamide (SiR&#8208;glib). We first test this far&#8208;red fluorescent, fluorogenic and endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting sulfonylurea in mammalian cells and pancreatic islets, before characterizing its labeling performance in red blood cells infected with the asexual developmental stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We further combine SiR&#8208;glib with a portable smartphone&#8208;based microscope to easily and rapidly identify parasitized red blood cells, providing proof of principle for diagnostic use in rural endemic areas without major healthcare facilities.

         <title>Apparent Reversal of Allosteric Response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis MenD Reveals Links to Half&#8208;of&#8208;Sites Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of computational, biochemical and structural studies on allostery mutants of Mtb&#8208;MenD, a menaquinone (vitamin K2) biosynthesis enzyme from a human pathogen, yields insight into the interrelationship between allosteric and half&#8208;of&#8208;sites reactivity mechanisms. As Mtb&#8208;MenD is a promiscuous ThDP&#8208;dependent enzyme from a core bacterial biosynthetic pathway, our findings have potential biocatalysis and drug discovery applications.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active molecules play critical roles in various biological functions, including cellular respiration. In bacterial electron transport chains, menaquinones serve as key electron carriers. The first committed enzyme in the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), MenD, is allosterically inhibited by 1,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic acid (DHNA), the first redox&#8208;active metabolite in the pathway. Structural asymmetries in Mtb&#8208;MenD suggest that this enzyme operates via a half&#8208;of&#8208;sites mechanism for catalysis. Here, we investigate the interplay between its catalytic and allosteric mechanisms. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, mutagenesis, kinetic and binding assays, and structural analyses, we identified and characterised mutants of two residues, D141 and D306, involved in stabilising asymmetric conformations associated with allostery. These mutations had complex effects on Mtb&#8208;MenD's reaction kinetics, with the D306 mutants showing an apparent reversal of the allosteric response to DHNA. Our findings indicate that asymmetric active site conformations may facilitate optimal binding of cofactors and substrates, while the transition between alternating active site conformations is essential for the catalytic cycle. DHNA binding stabilises asymmetry in the tetramer, likely promoting the binding of cofactors, substrates, or reaction intermediates. However, DHNA interferes with the transition between alternating conformations, ultimately impairing turnover and catalytic cycling in Mtb&#8208;MenD.

         <title>Cleavage of Structured RNAs Is Accelerated by High Affinity DNAzyme Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept paper, we argue that the efficiency of RNA cleavage by DNAzymes might be limited by accessibility of cleaving sites in folded RNA and propose several strategies to solve the problem. The concept article is compelemented with a multiple&#8208;choice quiz on DNAzymes as therapeutic agens, which can be used for educational purposes.







Abstract
DNAzymes (Dz) have been suggested as sequence&#8208;specific agents for cleaving RNA for therapeutic purposes. This concept paper discusses the challenges of Dz 10&#8208;23 design to effciently cleave folded RNA substrates. Dz with traditionally designed RNA binding arms (Tm~37&#8201;&#176;C) have low affinity to the folded RNA substrates, which limits the overall cleavage rate. The RNA cleavage can be facilitated using Dz with high&#8208;affinity arms. However, this strategy is efficient only for cleaving RNA into folded RNA products. The unfolded products inhibit multiple substrate turnover. In a more general approach, Dz should be equipped with additional RNA binding arms to achieve tight RNA binding. This can be accomplished by bivalent and multivalent Dz constructs that have multiple catalytic cores. In all cases, high selectivity toward single nucleotide variations can be achieved in addition to multiple turnovers. The presence of RNase H, which plays a role in the antisense effect of oligonucleotide gene therapy agents, stabilizes the Dz:RNA complex and reduces its selectivity but significantly increases RNA cleavage efficiency. This work proposes changes in the algorithms of Dz design, which can help in constructing potent Dz agents for RNA inhibition both in cell cultures and in&#8197;vivo. The concept article is supplemented with a quiz, which tests knowledge of the main concepts discussed in this work.

         <title>NMR Solution Structure of the N&#8208;Terminal GSPII Domain from the Thermus Thermophilus Traffic ATPase PilF and Reconstruction of its c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP Binding Capability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
GSPII&#8208;A is the first of three consecutive GSPII domains of PilF from Thermus thermophilus and the only one that does not bind c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP. In this study we solve the structure of GSPII&#8208;A and show the key factors hindering c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding. Through mutagenesis, we elucidate the minimal motif conservation needed for c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP recognition.







Abstract
The cyclic dinucleotide c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP is an important second messenger molecule in bacteria and interacts with a variety of receptor molecules including RNA and protein domains. An important class of c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding protein domains are the general secretory pathway type II (GSPII) domains as exemplified by the N&#8208;terminal domain of the ATPase MshE from Vibrio cholerae (MshEN). MshEN binds monomeric c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP via two consecutive copies of a 24&#8208;residue sequence motif, which form a compact 4&#8208;&#945;&#8208;helical bundle. The ATPase PilF from Thermus thermophilus regulates pilus formation, motility and DNA&#8208;uptake. Its N&#8208;terminal section contains three consecutive GSPII domains (GSPII&#8208;A&#8208;GSPII&#8208;C) all with considerable sequence homology to MshEN. While the GSPII&#8208;B and the GSPII&#8208;C domains bind c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP, the GSPII&#8208;A domain does not. To determine why it is incapable of c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding we determined the NMR&#8208;solution structure of this domain. Our structure shows how small deviations in the consensus motif sequence, a stabilizing N&#8208;terminal helical capping motif and intersubdomain interactions absent in MshEN cooperate to prevent c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding. By combining point mutations and truncations, we re&#8208;established the c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding capability. Our findings shed new light on the evolution and functional diversification of GSPII domains and the importance of sequence variations for protein activity in this domain family.

         <title>A Diazaborine Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorescent Probe Reports Endogenously Produced Mitochondrial Peroxynitrite in Live Macrophages</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first diazaborine activity&#8208;based sensing probe for selective imaging of endogenously produced peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) is presented. Peroxynitrite Probe&#8208;1 (PNP&#8208;1) selectivity is enabled with a novel pendant&#8208;tuning strategy to specify detection of ONOO&#8208; over other oxidative metabolites, including over H2O2 and HOCl, which interfere with other organoboron&#8208;based probes. Notably, PNP&#8208;1 preferentially localizes to mitochondria, enabling the detection of endogenous mitochondrial peroxynitrite.







Abstract
We present the synthesis, properties, and imaging applications of a new class of diazaborine&#8208;based probes (Peroxynitrite Probe&#8208;1, PNP&#8208;1) for selective peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) imaging in live cells. PNP&#8208;1 features a diazaborine&#8208;based reaction motif that provides excellent discrimination between H2O2 and ONOO&#8722;, solving a persistent challenge of organoboron&#8208;based fluorescent probes for oxidative metabolite imaging. We demonstrate the utility of PNP&#8208;1 to detect endogenously produced ONOO&#8722; in live RAW 264.7 macrophages by fluorescence microscopy, with probe selectivity confirmed with inhibition of NADPH oxidases and nitric oxide synthase, the requisite enzymatic machinery for ONOO&#8722; production. Co&#8208;localization studies unexpectedly reveal preferential mitochondrial localization, which we show is dependent on the naphthalimide scaffold. Taken together, our results show that diazaborines are a novel motif for selective ONOO&#8722; reactivity, positioning them for incorporation into other ONOO&#8722;&#8208;specific chemical biology tools.

         <title>Quantification of Propargylated RNA Nucleosides After Metabolic Labeling Via the Methylation Pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation is the most prevalent RNA modification, facilitated by S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) and various methyltransferases (MTases). This work uses a clickable SAM analog to investigate nucleoside modifications in HEK293T cells by mass spectrometric analysis after metabolic labeling with propargylselenohomocysteine (PSH). It reveals higher cell viability and differences in several nucleoside methylation levels compared to HeLa cells.







Abstract
RNA modifications are involved in numerous biological processes and vary in different cell types. Methylation is the most widespread type of RNA modification and occurs via S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM). We recently developed a metabolic labeling approach based on intracellular formation of a clickable SAM analog (SeAdoYn) and demonstrated its use in mapping methyltransferase (MTase) target sites in mRNA from HeLa cells. Here we investigate how metabolic labeling via the clickable SAM analog modifies four different nucleosides in RNA of HEK293T in comparison to HeLa cells. We find that HEK293T cells retain higher cell viability upon feeding the clickable metabolic SAM precursor. In poly(A)+ RNA we find high Aprop/A levels (0.04&#8201;%) and in total RNA (but not poly(A)+ RNA) we detect prop3C, which had not been detected previously in HeLa cells. We discuss the findings in the context of data from the literature with respect to mRNA half&#8208;lives in cancer and non&#8208;cancer cell lines and suggest that CMTr2 is most likely responsible for the high Aprop level in poly(A)+ RNA.

         <dc:description>
This study explores the catalytic potential of novel ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from Penicillium steckii, a fungal species known for valuable metabolites. Through the recombinant production and purification of six ERs, we identified diverse substrate profiles and moderate stability. Elucidation of the crystal structure of one ER (PsOYE2) revealed unique active site features. This set of recombinant Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE)&#8208;type ERs can be explored for future biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Fungi, known for their adaptability, are valuable sources of enzymes, making them promising for biocatalyst discovery. This study explored Penicillium steckii, primarily recognized for secondary metabolite production, as a source of ene&#8208;reductases (ERs), which reduce &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds. Eleven ER&#8208;encoding genes were identified, and plasmids for Escherichia coli expression were generated. Six ERs (PsOYE1&#8208;6) were successfully produced and purified as soluble FMN&#8208;containing proteins. Sequence analysis classified them into Class II (PsOYE1, PsOYE4, PsOYE6), Class III (PsOYE2, PsOYE3), and Class V (PsOYE5) OYEs. All were active on p&#8208;benzoquinone and maleimide, with varying activity on other substrates. Their pH optima ranged from 6 to 7, and they exhibited moderate thermostability (35&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C). PsOYE2 was crystallized, and its 2.3&#8197;&#197; structure revealed a stable dimer with a unique active site. PsOYE3, PsOYE4, and PsOYE5 were tested for R&#8208;carvone conversion and stereoselectivity, all favouring one diastereomer. These fungal ERs expand the enzymatic toolbox for biocatalysis, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies based on specific applications.

         <title>Design of Zn&#8208;Binding Peptide(s) from Protein Fragments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a short zinc&#8208;binding peptide by taking fragments from proteins with known structure. We have measured the binding affinity with isothermal calorimetry and the structure of the peptide using CD and NMR spectroscopies. These results were computationally supported by molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
We designed a minimalistic zinc(II)&#8208;binding peptide featuring the Cys2His2 zinc&#8208;finger motif. To this aim, several tens of thousands of (His/Cys)&#8208;Xn&#8208;(His/Cys) protein fragments (n=2&#8211;20) were first extracted from the 3D protein structures deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB). Based on geometrical constraints positioning two Cys (C) and two His (H) side chains at the vertices of a tetrahedron, approximately 22 000 sequences of the (H/C)&#8208;Xi&#8208;(H/C)&#8208;Xj&#8208;(H/C)&#8208;Xk&#8208;(H/C) type, satisfying Nmetal&#8211;binding H=Nmetal&#8208;binding C=2, were processed. Several other criteria, such as the secondary structure content and predicted fold stability, were then used to select the best candidates. To prove the viability of the computational design experimentally, three peptides were synthesized and subjected to isothermal calorimetry (ITC) measurements to determine the binding constants with Zn2+, including the entropy and enthalpy terms. For the strongest Zn2+ ions binding peptide, P1, the dissociation constant was shown to be in the nanomolar range (KD=~220&#8197;nM; corresponding to &#916;Gbind=&#8722;9.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). In addition, ITC showed that the [P1&#8201;:&#8201;Zn2+] complex forms in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry and two protons are released upon binding, which suggests that the zinc coordination involves both cysteines. NMR experiments also indicated that the structure of the [P1&#8201;:&#8201;Zn2+] complex might be quite similar to the computationally predicted one. In summary, our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study highlights the usefulness of our computational protocol for designing novel metal&#8208;binding peptides.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor (Perylenethienyl)Ethylenes as Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Photogenerating Viral Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and evaluation of electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG)&#8208;containing (perylenethienyl)ethylenes with an extended &#960;&#8208;system reveal a promising approach towards red&#8208;shifted, broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral photosensitizers.







Abstract
The development of broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral drugs effective against a wide range of viruses is of significant practical importance. Derivatives of perylene, a pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, demonstrate pronounced antiviral activity. These compounds act primarily as membrane&#8208;active singlet oxygen photogenerators, disrupting virions and inhibiting their fusion with the host cell membrane. Modification of the perylene core allows for chemical diversification of antiviral photosensitizers. Additionally, achieving a bathochromic shift of the absorption band is crucial for effective treatment of superficial lesions, as it facilitates deeper tissue penetration of therapeutic light. In this work, donor&#8208;acceptor perylenylethylenes and (perylenethienyl)ethylenes were synthesized and evaluated for their spectral properties, singlet oxygen photogeneration, and inhibitory activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a representative enveloped virus. Incorporation of a thiophene moiety into the molecule significantly enhanced both the singlet oxygen generation ability and the antiviral activity. These findings provide useful insights into the relationship between the structure, spectral/photochemical properties, and biological activity of perylene&#8208;based photosensitizers.

         <title>From Genes to Molecules: The Fusarium PKS16 Gene Cluster Facilitates the Biosynthesis of Proliferapyrones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genus Fusarium is notoriously known for infecting important crops worldwide. During infection, fusaria may produce natural products with noxious properties, thereby threatening global food security. Here, we show that the previously cryptic PKS16 biosynthetic gene cluster consists of eight to nine co&#8208;regulated genes, depending on the Fusarium species, which are responsible for the production of proliferapyrone E.







Abstract
Ascomycete fungi of the genus Fusarium are found in manifold ecological niches and thus pursue several lifestyles. On average, individual Fusarium species have the genetic capability to produce 50 natural products (NPs), which are in general thought to improve the fungus&#8216;s fitness in defined environments. This also includes NPs with toxic potential (mycotoxins) contaminating food and feed sources. Recent research has shown that the production of NPs is tightly regulated on the transcriptional level and depends on the delicate balance between the deposition and removal of histone marks. Within this study, we show that the expression of the prior cryptic Fusarium PKS16 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) greatly depends on modifications at histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). By combining molecular&#8208;, chemical&#8208;, and bioinformatic analyses we show that the PKS16 BGC from F. fujikuroi B14 (FfB14) consists of nine genes, including a positively acting pathway&#8208;specific transcription factor, which although absent in some fusaria, functions in activating other PKS16 cluster genes. Moreover, we linked the PKS16 BGC to the biosynthesis of proliferapyrone (PRO) E, an isomer of the recently isolated PRO A.

         <dc:description>
A minor modification to the side arm of a traditionally non&#8208;cell penetrating peptide, zinc finger protein, utilizing boronic acid, has transformed its characteristics into those of a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, as evidenced by the delivery of the protein Ubiquitin in live A549 cells.







Abstract
Delivering cargo into live cells has extensive applications in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) provide an ideal solution for cellular delivery. Enhancing CPPs with additional functional units can improve delivery efficiency. We investigate the conjugation of boronic acid modules to enhance internalization through interactions with cell surface glycans. The aim of this study is to determine whether adding boronic acid can transform a peptide that typically lacks CPP properties into one that functions as a CPP, enabling the delivery of crucial biological cargo like ubiquitin (Ub). The zinc finger protein in its apo state was selected as a &#8220;boronate&#8208;enabled&#8221; CPP. Results indicate that skeletal point mutations and post&#8208;synthetic modifications, combined with conjugated benzoboroxole derivatives, enable the apo&#8208;ZFP the ability to transport Ub within A549 cells, confirmed through microscopy and flow cytometry. This effective internalization of cargo offers valuable insights for advancing the development of boronic acid&#8208;mediated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.

         <title>Glyoxalase 2 Coordinates de Novo Serine Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and rate&#8208;limiting enzyme of de novo Ser biosynthesis, 3&#8208;phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), is modified by the non&#8208;enzymatically derived post&#8208;translational modification (PTM), lactoylLys.







Abstract
Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is the first enzyme in de novo Ser biosynthesis. Numerous metabolic pathways rely on Ser as a precursor, most notably one&#8208;carbon metabolism, glutathione biosynthesis, and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. To facilitate proliferation, many cancer cells shunt glycolytic flux through this pathway, placing PHGDH as a metabolic liability and feasible therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. Herein, we demonstrate the post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of PHGDH by lactoylLys. These PTMs are generated through a non&#8208;enzymatic acyl transfer from the glyoxalase cycle intermediate, lactoylglutathione (LGSH). Knockout of the primary LGSH regulatory enzyme, glyoxalase 2 (GLO2), results in increased LGSH and resulting lactoylLys modification of PHGDH. These PTMs reduce enzymatic activity, resulting in a marked reduction in intracellular Ser. Using stable isotope tracing, we demonstrate reduced flux through the de novo Ser biosynthetic pathway. Collectively, these data identify PHGDH as a target for modification by lactoylLys, resulting in reduced enzymatic activity and reduced intracellular Ser.

         <title>Expanding the Diversity of Nitroxide&#8208;Based Paramagnetic Probes Conjugated to Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids for Sdsl&#8208;Epr Applications</title>

Understanding protein structure requires studying its dynamics, which is critical for elucidating its functional role. Using Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling (SDSL) combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), a powerful method delivering structural data at the residue level, irrespective of protein size or environment, we expand the toolkit of the ncaa&#8208;nitroxide pairs, enabling EPR&#8208;based structural studies of proteins where cysteine modification is impractical.







Abstract
Understanding protein structure requires studying its dynamics, which is critical to elucidating its functional role. Biophysical techniques have revolutionized this field over time, providing remarkable insights into structure&#8208;function relationships. Among these, Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling (SDSL) combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) is a powerful method delivering structural data at the residue level, irrespective of protein size or environment. Traditional nitroxide labels targeting cysteine residues face limitations when these residues are essential for protein structure or function. To address this, alternatives have been proposed as the use of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncaa) coupled with specific nitroxide labels. This study introduces 14N&#8208;HO&#8208;5223, a novel nitroxide label specific to the pAzPhe ncaa, along with its 15N&#8208;derivative. These labels were grafted at two sites of the model protein, the diflavin cytochrome P450 reductase. For comparative purpose, two already reported labels were also used. Continuous wave (cw) EPR spectroscopy confirmed the HO&#8208;5223 label as an effective reporter of protein dynamics. Additionally, Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance (DEER) measurements provided distance distributions between the semi&#8208;quinone FMNH&#8901; state of the CPR and all nitroxide labels. These results expand the toolkit of the ncaa&#8208;nitroxide pairs, enabling EPR&#8208;based structural studies of proteins where cysteine modification is impractical, further advancing our ability to decode protein dynamics and function.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of C&#8722;N Lyases by Homologue Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homology&#8208;based strategy is employed to identify and biochemically characterize 13 enzymes homologous to ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid (EDDS) lyase. Several homologues exhibit a broadened substrate scope, accepting L&#8208;amino acids for the enantioselective hydroamination of fumarate to produce the corresponding aminopolycarboxylic acids. Further bioinformatic analysis of the aspartase/fumarase superfamily suggests that EDDS lyase and its homologues represent an underexplored isofunctional subfamily.







Abstract
The aspartase/fumarase superfamily is a group of homologous enzymes that promote the reversible elimination of functional groups from succinyl&#8208;containing compounds, typically yielding fumarate as the common product. Over the past 50&#8197;years, members of this superfamily have continuously demonstrated their power and significance as biocatalysts. This is exemplified by ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid (EDDS) lyase, which was shown to have an extraordinary amine scope, enabling the production of a wide variety of N&#8208;substituted aspartic acids. In this work, we used this enzyme as a starting point for a homology&#8208;based strategy to expand the biocatalytic toolbox of C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming enzymes. We selected 13 enzymes for biochemical characterization, and identified several EDDS&#8208;lyase homologues that can accept L&#8208;amino acids as substrates in the hydroamination of fumarate to produce the corresponding aminopolycarboxylic acids. Lastly, we carried out a sequence similarity network analysis of the aspartase/fumarase superfamily, which suggests that EDDS lyase and its homologues may represent a distinct isofunctional subfamily, laying the foundations for future enzyme discovery and engineering campaigns.

         <title>Identification and Protein Engineering of Galactosidases for the Conversion of Blood Type B to Blood Type O</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We identified and characterized a galactosidase from Pedobacter panaciterrae (PpaGal), which is more efficient than previously characterized galactosidases from the GH110 family of Bacteroides fragilis in converting B&#8208;type to O&#8208;type blood. We further increased the activity of PpaGal by enzyme engineering and solved crystal structures with and without bound galactose.







Abstract
The supply of blood products such as red blood cells poses a challenge due to rising demand and declining donor numbers. Careful matching of blood products of different types is required. Only type O of the blood types A, B, AB and O can be received by any patient without transfusion incompatibilities. Therefore, O&#8208;type blood can be considered &#8220;universal blood&#8221; and is especially needed in emergency situations. In this study, we focused on the conversion of the B antigen by enzymatic deglycosylation to generate the H antigen determining O&#8208;type blood. For this, we characterized several previously unstudied &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactosidases belonging to the GH110 family. Our findings revealed that the &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactosidase from Pedobacter panaciterrae (PpaGal) exhibits superior efficiency compared to previously described galactosidases. We further increased the activity of PpaGal by 2.5&#8208;fold using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. Moreover, we solved two crystal structures of PpaGal, one in the apo&#8208;state and another in complex with d&#8208;galactose. The combination of our mutagenesis study with the solved crystal structures provides valuable information to guide further optimization of PpaGal or other B antigen converting enzymes paving the way for the easier production of universal blood from B&#8208;type blood.

Our findings revealed that the &#945;-1,3-galactosidase from &lt;i&gt;Pedobacter panaciterrae&lt;/i&gt; (PpaGal) exhibits superior efficiency compared to previously described galactosidases. We further increased the activity of PpaGal by 2.5-fold using site-directed mutagenesis. Moreover, we solved two crystal structures of PpaGal, one in the apo-state and another in complex with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose. The combination of our mutagenesis study with the solved crystal structures provides valuable information to guide further optimization of PpaGal or other B antigen converting enzymes paving the way for the easier production of universal blood from B-type blood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of D&#8208;Amino Acid Replacements on the Conformational Stability of Miniproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We probed the effects of L&#8208;to&#8208;D amino acid substitutions on protein stability using far&#8208;UV CD. Comparison of the &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich villin headpiece subdomain and the &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich WW domain revealed that L&#8208;to&#8208;D substitutions generally destabilize proteins.







Abstract
For many proteins, proper function requires adoption of a specific tertiary structure. This study explores the effects of L&#8208;to&#8208;D amino acid substitutions on tertiary structure stability for two well&#8208;known miniproteins, a single&#8208;site variant of the chicken villin headpiece subdomain (VHP) and the human Pin1 WW domain (WW). For VHP, which features an &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich tertiary structure, substitutions led to significant destabilization, as detected by variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) measurements. For WW, which has a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich tertiary structure, most single L&#8208;to&#8208;D changes seemed to cause complete unfolding at room temperature, according to CD measurements. These findings suggest that amino acid residue configuration changes at a single site will often prove to be deleterious in terms of tertiary structure stability, and in some cases dramatically destabilizing.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Fluorescent and Bioluminescent Probes for HDAC8</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing genetically encoded probes for protein deacetylases exhibit excellent sensitivity to NAD+&#8208;dependent sirtuins but lack responsiveness to Zn2+&#8208;dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs). Herein, we reformed the probe design by utilizing trifluoroacetyl lysine (TfAcK) instead and developed probes that could respond specifically to HDAC8 experimentally and promisingly other HDACs.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based probes constructed via genetically encoding acetyl lysine (AcK) or its close analogs represent an important way to detect protein lysine deacetylases. Existing reported probes exhibit excellent sensitivity to NAD+&#8208;dependent sirtuins but lack responsiveness to Zn2+&#8208;dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs). Herein, we reformed the probe design by replacing the genetically encoded AcK with trifluoroacetyl lysine (TfAcK) and generated fluorescent and bioluminescent probes that could respond specifically to HDAC8 recombinantly expressed in E. coli and to endogenous HDACs in mammalian cells. We believe these probes would benefit the biological investigation of HDAC8 and promisingly some other HDACs, as well as the discovery of innovative HDAC inhibitors.

         <title>Biomimetic Recognition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain N&#8208;Glycans by an Antiviral Synthetic Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycan&#8208;binding agents may be a key asset in the development of new antivirals against enveloped viruses. Using a combination of glycoengineering and mass spectrometry techniques, we present here direct evidence of biomimetic recognition of the N&#8208;glycans exposed on the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the wild&#8208;type spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by a synthetic receptor targeting mannose and acting as antiviral.







Abstract
Recognition of glycans by simple synthetic receptors is a key issue in supramolecular chemistry, endowed with relevant implications in glycobiology and medicine. In this context, glycoproteins featuring N&#8208;glycans represent an important biological target, because they are often exploited by enveloped viruses in adhesion and infection processes. However, a direct evidence for their recognition by a synthetic receptor targeting N&#8208;glycans is still missing in the literature. Using a combination of glycoengineering and mass spectrometry techniques, we present here the direct evidence of biomimetic recognition of complex&#8208;type N&#8208;glycans exposed on the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the wild&#8208;type spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by a biologically active, synthetic receptor.

The cytochromes P450 are a powerful class of heme&#8208;containing enzymes capable of a wide range of oxidative transformations in nature. A potent example of their power is their role in the biosynthesis of the biarylitides, a class of ribosomal encoded peptide natural products. This cover image draws an analogy with black holes to highlight the power of these enzymes in their demonstrated ability to catalyse peptide crosslinking even when fluorine is present.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoboroxole facilitates the delivery of ubiquitin to living cells by utilizing the apo&#8208;zinc finger protein domain and thereby converts the apo&#8208;zinc finger protein (apo&#8208;ZFP) into a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP), despite being inherently a non&#8208;CPP. The introduction of point mutations within the skeletal structure, along with the incorporation of benzoboroxole into the lysine side chain, further enhances the efficacy of apo&#8208;ZFP. Cellular delivery was monitored using fluorescence microscopy and validated through flow cytometry. More details can be found inarticle 10.1002/cbic.202401040 by Pritam Ghosh and Oliver Seitz.

         <title>Challenges and Emerging Strategies of Immunotherapy for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a highly aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis despite conventional treatments. Immunotherapy, including oncolytic viruses, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T cells, and tumor vaccines, offers promising therapeutic potential. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or gene therapy further enhances efficacy. This review explores current challenges and emerging strategies, highlighting advancements and future directions for improving GBM treatment outcomes.







Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is recognized as the most lethal primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Although traditional treatments can somewhat prolong patient survival, the overall prognosis remains grim. Immunotherapy has become an effective method for GBM treatment. Oncolytic virus, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T cells and tumor vaccines have all been applied in this field. Moreover, the combining of immunotherapy with traditional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or gene therapy can further improve the treatment outcome. This review systematically summarizes the features of GBM, the recent progress of immunotherapy in overcoming GBM.

         <title>Research Status and Applications of Adeno&#8208;Associated Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>

This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in adeno&#8208;associated viruses (AAV). Our objective is to conclude information regarding the characterization of AAVs and to emphasize the latest advancements in their applications within ocular, muscular, liver, and central nervous system disorders.







Abstract
Adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a powerful and effective tool for the delivery of exogenous genes into various cells or tissues. To improve the gene delivery efficiency, as well as the safety and specificity of AAV&#8242;s cell&#8208;targeting capabilities, extensive investigations have been conducted into its molecular biological characteristics, including capsid structure, cellular tropism, and the mechanisms underlying its entry, replication, DNA packaging, and capsid assembly. Significant differences exist between human and non&#8208;human primate AAVs regarding tissue targeting and transduction efficiency. These differences are primarily attributed to the amino acid sequences of AAV capsid proteins, the structural characteristics of these proteins, and the interactions of AAV with surface factors on host cells, such as cell surface receptors, signaling molecules, and associated proteins. This review primarily focuses on several key aspects of AAV, including its genome, coat proteins and their structures, genome replication, virus assembly, and the role of helper viruses. Additionally, it examines the utilization of recombinant adeno&#8208;associated viruses (rAAV), detailing their production methods, mechanisms of cell entry and trafficking, and various serotypes. The review further interprets the role of rAAV by analyzing its current applications in research and therapy.

         <title>Engineering Gizmos for Short Cancer Genetic Fragments Discrimination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny Gizmos, mixtures of nucleic acids and organic/inorganic materials, can quickly identify cancer&#8208;specific short base&#8208;sequence fragments and help suggest appropriate medications.







Abstract
Currently, mankind is fiercely struggling with cancer. Recently, we have been winning the battle against cancer through precision medicine and accompanying diagnostic methods, and we are raising many hopes with blockbuster drugs. It would be even better if we could read the cancer nucleotide sequence, identify them in advance, and suggest treatments simultaneously. However, this may be an impossible dream because it takes a lot of time and effort to diagnose and ensure all the long gene sequences of cancer at once. Thus, victory will be even closer if a rapid and accurate diagnosis of the cancer&#8208;specific gene biomarkers that will soon be imprinted can be made. With the advent of nanotechnology, a new short cancer diagnostic toolkit has been proposed to achieve the goal. This review presents a small diagnostic device that detects certain cancers&#8242; genetic fragments (simply &#8216;Gizmo&#8217;). The development of numerous diagnostic methods has focused on (1) directly detecting pre&#8208;selectively targeted genes using novel diagnostic systems, and (2) indirectly detecting substantial improvements in diagnostic sensitivity only through detection signal amplification without existing gene amplification steps. Our fight against cancer is not a dream, but the result of success, and it is assumed that victory will accelerate as soon as possible.

         <title>Deciphering the Interplay Between G&#8208;Quadruplexes and Natural/Synthetic Polyamines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though PAs are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G4s are transient regulatory elements. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G4s and biogenic polyamines or synthetic G4 ligands containing polyamines. This work will assist to understand the biological impact of the association between G4s and natural/synthetic PAs.







Abstract
The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though polyamines are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G&#8208;quadruplexes are transient regulatory elements, being both of them key regulators of biological processes. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G&#8208;quadruplexes and biogenic polyamines to understand the biological interplay between them. Moreover, we overview the main works focused on synthetic ligands containing polyamines designed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes, aiming to unravel the structural motifs for designing potent and selective G4 ligands.

         <title>Detecting the Undetectable: Advances in Methods for Identifying Small Tau Aggregates in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores current methods for detecting and characterising small tau aggregates, which are increasingly recognised as key drivers of neurotoxicity in tauopathies. It discusses emerging techniques such as single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down (SiMPull), single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), and cryo&#8208;electron tomography (cryo&#8208;ET), highlighting their potential to improve our understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer's where traditional methods fall short.







Abstract
Tau, a microtubule&#8208;associated protein, plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal structure and function. However, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, tau misfolds and aggregates into oligomers and fibrils, leading to neuronal damage. Tau oligomers are increasingly recognised as the most neurotoxic species, inducing synaptic dysfunction and contributing to disease progression. Detecting these early&#8208;stage aggregates is challenging due to their low concentration and high heterogeneity in biological samples. Traditional methods such as immunostaining and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) lack the sensitivity and specificity to reliably detect small tau aggregates. Advanced single&#8208;molecule approaches, including single&#8208;molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down (SiMPull), offer improved sensitivity for studying tau aggregation at the molecular level. These emerging tools provide critical insights into tau pathology, enabling earlier detection and characterisation of disease&#8208;relevant aggregates, thereby offering potential for the development of targeted therapies and diagnostic approaches for tauopathies.

Abstract
Nanopipette&#8208;based assays have gained widespread applications in electrochemical and analytical technologies, achieving significant advancements over the past decade in DNA sequencing, biosensing, targeted delivery, and bioimaging. The ultrasmall tip size of nanopipettes bridges the gap between the macro&#8208; and nano worlds, which can be attributed to the capability of nanopipettes to transport ultrasmall volumes of liquids, ions, and solutes. In this review, we discuss the fabrication, characterization, and modification of nanopipettes to provide an overview of the recent developments of nanopipette&#8208;based sensors and strategies. We also introduce the recent studies developed by our group and other groups using nanopipettes for chemical analysis of life science. Finally, we discuss the future development of nanopipette&#8208;based strategies and their exciting potential for studying bioscience and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Novel Approaches in Targeting Cell Surface and Secreted Proteins for Lysosomal Degradation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TransTAC&#8208;mediated membrane protein degradation via the lysosome. TransTACs are small molecules that trigger the engagement between transferrin receptor (TfR1) and the target protein on the cell membrane surface resulting in co&#8208;internalization of the target protein and TfR1 to early endosomes and subsequently shuttling of the target protein for lysosomal degradation.







Abstract
Protein degradation is pivotal for all biochemical aspects of cellular function. In mammalian cells, protein degradation is mediated mainly by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic&#8208;lysosomal system (ALS). Over the last two decades, different types of targeted protein degradation approaches have been developed including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs), which employ the UPS to degrade intracellular proteins and the ALS to degrade extracellular and membrane proteins respectively. Nevertheless, Current targeted membrane protein degradation approaches face some inherent challenges including limited target protein degradation efficacy and cell type specific applicability. Herein, we highlight some recent developments of novel targeted membrane protein degradation modalities that exhibit wide&#8208;applicability and high protein degradation efficiency. These novel membrane protein degraders hold tremendous promise as new pharmacological and biochemical tools in targeting membrane and secretory proteins for lysosomal degradation.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biarylitides are fascinating RiPP natural products with small core peptides and diverse peptide crosslinks performed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Here, we address the discovery and diversity of the biarylitides, methods to analyse these constrained cyclic peptides, the structures of the biarylitide P450 enzymes and address alternate catalytic outcomes as recently seen in rufomycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The biarylitides are a recently discovered class of RiPP natural products that are fascinating both from the small size of the core peptides as well as the diversity of peptide crosslinking exhibited by the cytochrome P450 enzymes found in these systems. In this review, we address the discovery and biosynthetic diversity of these systems and discuss the methods and challenges of analysing the structures of these constrained cyclic peptides. We also discuss the structures of the P450 enzymes involved in these pathways and address the potential for alternate catalytic outcomes and activities as seen most recently with the inclusion of biarylitide related enzymes within rufomycin biosynthesis.

         <title>Laccase Functional Analysis: Substrates, Activity Assays, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme functional analysis is crucial for evaluating enzyme performance. However, even well&#8208;known enzymes, such as laccase, face challenges with substrates and methods for activity assays. The review examines both commonly and less&#8208;utilized compounds, as well as their associated techniques, methods, and approaches. The review highlights potential strategies to overcome identified gaps.







Abstract
Enzyme functional analysis is a multifaceted process that can be used for various purposes, such as screening for specific activities, as well as developing, optimising, and validating processes or final products. Functional analysis methods are crucial for assessing enzyme performance and catalytic properties. Laccase, a well&#8208;known blue multi&#8208;copper oxidase, holds immense potential in diverse industries such as pharmaceuticals, paper and pulp, food and beverages, textiles, and biorefineries due to its clean oxidation process and versatility in handling a wide range of substrates. Despite its prominence, the use of laccase encounters challenges in selecting appropriate functional analysis substrates and methods. This review delves into the substrates utilised in qualitative and quantitative techniques for laccase activity analysis. Although laccase catalyses mono&#8208;electron oxidation of aromatic hydroxyl, amine, and thiol compounds efficiently, using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor, the review identifies limitations in the specificity of the commonly employed substrates, concerns regarding the stability of certain compounds and highlights potential strategies.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the most recent progress of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures based on the scaffolds of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA for biological applications, including gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription, due to their excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Nucleic acid, as a carrier of genetic information, has been widely employed as a building block for the construction of versatile nanostructures with pre&#8208;designed sizes and shapes through complementary base pairing. With excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility, nucleic acid nanostructures are extensively applied in biomedical researches, such as bio&#8208;imaging, bio&#8208;sensing, and drug delivery. Notably, the original gene&#8208;encoding capability of the nucleic acids themselves has been utilized in these structurally well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress in the design of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA&#8208;encoded nanostructures for various biological applications, such as gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription. Furthermore, the challenges and future opportunities of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures in biomedical applications will be discussed.

         <title>Exploring Aspartate Transcarbamoylase: A Promising Broad&#8208;Spectrum Target for Drug Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrimidine biosynthesis is a pivotal process shared by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This review examines the applications and advantages of a series of inhibitors specifically designed to target aspartate transcarbamylase within the de novo biosynthetic pathway of the malarial parasite. Members of this small molecule series have also shown inhibitory activity against a range of other organisms, suggesting a common scaffold may provide solutions to a number of biomedical challenges







Abstract
Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential for a wide variety of cellular processes and are synthesized either via a salvage pathway or through de novo biosynthesis. The latter is particularly important in proliferating cells, such as infectious diseases and cancer cells. Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the first committed and rate&#8208;limiting step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, making it an attractive therapeutic target for various diseases. This review summarizes the development of a series of allosteric ATCase inhibitors, advancing them as potential candidates for malarial, tuberculosis and cancer therapies. Furthermore, it explores the potential for these compounds to be expanded into drugs targeting neglected tropical diseases, antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens, and their possible application as herbicides. We identify the likely equivalent allosteric pocket in these systems and perform a structure and sequence&#8208;based analysis of the residues comprising it, providing a rationale for continued exploration of this compound series as both specific and broad&#8208;range inhibitors.

     alt="Exploring Aspartate Transcarbamoylase: A Promising Broad-Spectrum Target for Drug Development"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyrimidine biosynthesis is a pivotal process shared by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This review examines the applications and advantages of a series of inhibitors specifically designed to target aspartate transcarbamylase within the de novo biosynthetic pathway of the malarial parasite. Members of this small molecule series have also shown inhibitory activity against a range of other organisms, suggesting a common scaffold may provide solutions to a number of biomedical challenges
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential for a wide variety of cellular processes and are synthesized either via a salvage pathway or through &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis. The latter is particularly important in proliferating cells, such as infectious diseases and cancer cells. Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the first committed and rate-limiting step in the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, making it an attractive therapeutic target for various diseases. This review summarizes the development of a series of allosteric ATCase inhibitors, advancing them as potential candidates for malarial, tuberculosis and cancer therapies. Furthermore, it explores the potential for these compounds to be expanded into drugs targeting neglected tropical diseases, antimicrobial-resistant infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens, and their possible application as herbicides. We identify the likely equivalent allosteric pocket in these systems and perform a structure and sequence-based analysis of the residues comprising it, providing a rationale for continued exploration of this compound series as both specific and broad-range inhibitors. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research into ATCase inhibitors, given their potential broad applicability in treating diverse diseases to enhance both human health and agricultural practices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>d&#8208;Alanine, a Circadian Metabolite that Regulates Glucose Metabolism and Viral Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
d&#8208;Alanine is a circadian metabolite essential for life. Beyond exhibiting a pronounced circadian rhythm in its concentration within the body, d&#8208;alanine regulates the circadian rhythm itself by influencing the circadian transcriptional network, thereby modulating related physiological processes such as glucose homeostasis. d&#8208;Alanine, of the circadian, by the circadian, for the circadian.







Abstract
d&#8208;Alanine, a rare d&#8208;amino acid, exhibits a clear circadian rhythm and is present in organs associated with glucose metabolism. Recent findings have revealed that d&#8208;alanine acts on the circadian rhythm, thereby regulating physiological processes related to circadian cycles that are essential for maintaining body homeostasis. The regulation of circadian rhythm by d&#8208;alanine is vital for correcting blood glucose levels in diabetic conditions. In viral infections, d&#8208;alanine serves as a sensitive biomarker that reflects the severity of the infection, as its level drastically decreases due to consumption. Supplementation with d&#8208;alanine is effective to alleviate the progression of viral infections, potentially through the maintenance of the circadian rhythm and its associated immune responses. In addition to its role as a circadian biomarker, d&#8208;alanine also functions as a circadian regulator and exerts a wide range of physiological effects. This review summarizes the physiological roles of d&#8208;alanine as a circadian metabolite.

         <title>Structural Biology of RNA and Protein&#8208;RNA Complexes after AlphaFold3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlphaFold is a great research accelerator and hypothesis generator for structural biology and beyond. With the release of AlphaFold3, RNA and protein&#8208;RNA complex structure prediction is readily possible. This review assesses the reliability of these predictions. For the moment, care needs to be taken when AlphaFold3 RNA/protein&#8208;RNA complex structure predictions are used as research hypotheses.







Abstract
Recent breakthroughs in AI&#8208;mediated protein structure prediction have significantly accelerated research and generated valuable hypotheses within the field of structural biology and beyond. Notably, AlphaFold2 has facilitated the determination of larger protein complexes for which only limited experimental data are available. De novo predictions can now be experimentally validated with relative ease compared to the pre&#8208;AlphaFold2 era. In May 2024, AlphaFold3 was launched with high expectations, promising the capability to accurately predict RNA structures and protein&#8208;RNA complexes &#8208; features that were absent in AlphaFold2. This review evaluates the extent to which AlphaFold3 fulfills this promise through specific examples. At present, AlphaFold3 falls short in reliably predicting RNA and protein&#8208;RNA complex structures, particularly for non&#8208;canonical interactions where training data remain scarce. As a result, users should exercise caution when using AlphaFold3 predictions as hypotheses generators for RNA and protein&#8208;RNA complex structures. In the interim, integrating AI&#8208;based predictors with data&#8208;driven docking tools is recommended to address these limitations. This approach can help bridge the gap until sufficient training data are available to enable the development of more reliable predictive algorithms.

         <title>Beyond Phenolics: Alternative Substrates for Type III Copper Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 7, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;containing metalloenzyme tyrosinase is well known for synthesis of melanin pigments and enzymatic browning of fruits and vegetables. These reactions proceed from phenolics, but tyrosinases can also convert aromatic amines. This perspective brings together the scarce data on the enzymatic conversion of non&#8208;phenolic substrates by these important enzymes.







Abstract
The type III copper enzyme family of tyrosinases (TYRs) catalyzes the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and oxidation of phenols as well as the two&#8208;electron oxidation of catechols to ortho&#8208;quinones. TYRs use copper ions as their tightly bound cofactors and utilize molecular oxygen as their cosubstrate. They are responsible for physiologically important reactions like the formation of melanin, the primary pigment animals apply for protection against UV light. While the reactivity of TYRs on substrates containing aromatic hydroxy groups (i.&#8201;e. phenols) is well recognized, reports clearly demonstrating that TYRs are active on aromatic amines as well have gone largely unnoticed. In this perspective we aim to bring together the sparse data on non&#8208;phenolic TYR substrates to illustrate the potential of TYRs for the oxidation of aminophenols and anilines. The activity of TYRs on aromatic amines extends the substance classes amenable to biotechnological production with TYRs from catechols to N&#8208;phenyl imines and phenoxazinone derivates and calls for the inclusion of TYRs among the candidates for oxidative modification of aromatic amines in metabolic pathways.

         <title>Phase Separation in Biological Systems: Implications for Disease Pathogenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase separation in biological systems is discussed in various aspects including mechanisms involving various biomolecules, molecular complexes, and at cellular and organism level. Further, technologies to study phase separation, its implications in biological physiology, and diseases mechanisms and progression are discussions along with the potential targets and future therapeutics to probe and program phase separation in biological systems.

Phase separation is the phenomenon where distinct liquid phases, within solution, play a critical role in the organization and function of biomolecular condensates within cells. Dysregulation of phase separation has been implicated, which can be witnessed in various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of phase separation in disease pathogenesis, which focuses on single amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Molecular mechanisms underlying phase separation are also discussed with specific examples of diseases associated with dysregulated phase separation. Furthermore, consideration of therapeutic strategies targeting phase separation for disease intervention is explored.

         <title>Purine Chemistry in the Early RNA World at the Origins of Life: From RNA and Nucleobases Lesions to Current Key Metabolic Routes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the nascent processes of the beginnings and evolution of life, nucleobases and especially purines, ribonucleos(t)ides and primitive RNAs have been continuously modified. A RNA&#8208;peptide world and key metabolic pathways probably have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications resulting from adenine deamination, purine alkylation and, acylation from amino acids, purine ring&#8208;opening reactions and rearrangements, RNA depurination and abasic site formation.

In early life, RNA probably played the central role and, in the corresponding RNA world, the main produced amino acids and small peptides had to react continuously with RNA, ribonucleos(t)ides and nucleobases, especially with purines. A RNA&#8208;peptide world and key metabolic pathways have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications such as the translation process performed by the ribosome. Some interesting reactions of the purine bicycle and of the corresponding ribonucleos(t)ides are performed under plausible prebiotic conditions and described RNA chemical lesions are reviewed with the prospect to highlight their connection with some major steps of the purine and histidine biosynthetic pathways that are, in an intriguingly way, related through two key metabolites, adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate and the imidazole ribonucleotide 5&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide ribonucleotide. Ring&#8208;opening reactions of purines stand out as efficient accesses to imidazole ribonucleotides and to formamidopyrimidine (Fapy) ribonucleotides suggesting that biosynthetic pathway&#8217; first steps have emerged from RNA and ribonucleos(t)ide damages. Also, are summarized the works on the formation and catalytic properties, under plausible prebiotic conditions, of N6&#8208;derivatives of the purine base adenine as potential surrogates of histidine in catalysis accordingly to their structural relationship.

&lt;p&gt;In the nascent processes of the beginnings and evolution of life, nucleobases and especially purines, ribonucleos(t)ides and primitive RNAs have been continuously modified. A RNA-peptide world and key metabolic pathways probably have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications resulting from adenine deamination, purine alkylation and, acylation from amino acids, purine ring-opening reactions and rearrangements, RNA depurination and abasic site formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early life, RNA probably played the central role and, in the corresponding RNA world, the main produced amino acids and small peptides had to react continuously with RNA, ribonucleos(t)ides and nucleobases, especially with purines. A RNA-peptide world and key metabolic pathways have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications such as the translation process performed by the ribosome. Some interesting reactions of the purine bicycle and of the corresponding ribonucleos(t)ides are performed under plausible prebiotic conditions and described RNA chemical lesions are reviewed with the prospect to highlight their connection with some major steps of the purine and histidine biosynthetic pathways that are, in an intriguingly way, related through two key metabolites, adenosine 5&#8242;-triphosphate and the imidazole ribonucleotide 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide. Ring-opening reactions of purines stand out as efficient accesses to imidazole ribonucleotides and to formamidopyrimidine (Fapy) ribonucleotides suggesting that biosynthetic pathway&#8217; first steps have emerged from RNA and ribonucleos(t)ide damages. Also, are summarized the works on the formation and catalytic properties, under plausible prebiotic conditions, of N6-derivatives of the purine base adenine as potential surrogates of histidine in catalysis accordingly to their structural relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur(IV) Chemistry Based Peptide and Protein Late&#8208;Stage Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of precise and controllable chemical modification tools for peptides and proteins represents a great challenge in elucidating their structure&#8208;activity relationships and regulatory mechanisms, as well as a powerful driver for advancing macromolecular therapeutic strategies. However, current technologies predominantly rely on irreversible covalent labeling or genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids, exhibiting significant limitations in reversible modification, in situ functional regulation, and adaptability to complex physiological environments. In recent years, breakthrough advancements in sulfur(IV) chemistry have provided a novel paradigm for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins. Through synergistic innovations in sulfur(IV)&#8208;based reagent design, intermediate modulation, and bioorthogonal reactions, a more multifaceted modification toolbox has been progressively established, integrating site selectivity, condition responsiveness, and functional rescue. Providing current challenges and future perspectives in this field, this review focuses on sulfur(IV) chemistry&#8208;driven strategies for peptide and protein modification, as well as their applications in proximity&#8208;labeling strategies and drug delivery/therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Thrombosis Initiation with Lasso Peptide Variants as Inhibitors to the von Willebrand Protein&#8208;Collagen interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, there are no peptide&#8208;based therapeutics that safely target thrombosis initiation. Anti&#8208;clot medications are mostly focused on platelet interactions, leading to side&#8208;effects and complications. Herein we describe the utilization of known peptide natural products, lasso peptides, as scaffolds for the development of new inhibitors to the protein&#8208;protein interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWF) and collagen, paramount to clot initiation. The microcin J25 lasso peptides tolerated substitution of four contiguous amino acids within its loop, leading to two variants with LWEQ and FRSH sequences grafted within the loop. Each variant showed low micromolar activity in a fluorescently&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA), an in vitro test for inhibition of the collagen&#8208;vWF interaction. In addition, the lasso peptides were treated with a panel of proteases and showed exceptional stability. These peptides launch a new class of potential anti&#8208;thrombosis agents and also help probe the connection between peptide structure and its inhibitory, drug&#8208;like characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversity Of ThDP&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Forming Chiral Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes are well known biocatalysts for C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. While this enzyme class is mainly investigated for the formation of acyloins of secondary alcohols, recent studies have expanded its scope to utilize ketones as electrophiles in asymmetric carboligation reactions for the formation of tertiary alcohols. Chiral tertiary alcohols are ubiquitous motifs in natural products and important building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive compounds. ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes are emerging as one of the most promising classes of biocatalysts for synthesizing a wide range of products due to the variety of possible substrate combinations, accessible starting materials, high enantioselectivity, and advantageous self&#8208;regeneration of the catalytic ThDP cofactor. This review provides an overview of the tertiary alcohol&#8208;forming ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, focusing on the substrate scope, diversity of physiological functions, and future perspectives. Of nine superfamilies of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, three (decarboxylases, DC; transketolases, TK; &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase superfamily 2, &#945;KADH2) are known to use ketones as acceptor substrates. It is unknown whether other superfamilies of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes hold similar potential. Inspired by nature, an even broader diversity of classes and substrate specificities is expected in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Styryl Dye Complexes for Fluorescent Recognition of DNA and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recognition properties in solution and in cancer cells: a two dicationic cyanine dyes with different functionalities were developed and studied for their fluorescent properties, cytotoxicity and cellular imaging. The effect of encapsulation was checked using synthetic molecular container of cucurbit[7]uril. Two cancer lines were used for staining living and fixed cells.







Abstract
This paper focused on the DNA&#8208;binding properties of novel dicationic cyanine dyes, in which pyridinium centers are linked by bridges of different functionalities. We found that dye 1, bearing a flexible butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylpyridinium terminal fragment, has the ability to bind to the DNA groove. The attachment of a quite rigid para&#8208;xylylene&#8208;4&#8208;methylpyridinium unit as a terminal group in dye 2 contributed to dual DNA&#8208;binding modes: intercalation and groove binding. We tested the encapsulation ability and the effect on the dye&#8208;DNA binding mode by using a synthetic molecular container such as CB[7]. Unexpectedly, monitoring dye&#8208;DNA interaction in the presence of CB[7] revealed that dye molecules partially remain in DNA frameworks, even though they had a higher affinity towards CB[7]. In the case of dye 1, the transformation of dimeric forms to the left&#8208;handed aggregates to yield a ternary system CB[7]&#8208;dye&#8208;DNA occurred. As for dye 2, reversibility of intercalation and a slight right&#8208;handed aggregation templated by DNA are observed. A cytotoxicity and ability of dyes to stain the living cells in their free and encapsulated forms have been investigated. These findings provide useful information about ligand&#8211;DNA interactions, which are valuable for the rational design of drug delivery systems and platforms for cellular imaging and therapy.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Postlabeling Reveals Nuclear Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Half&#8208;Sandwich Ir(III) Tetrazine Complex in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the synthesis of five tetrazine&#8208;coordinated, half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes and extensively describe their reactivity. Live cell fluorescent bioorthogonal labeling reveals the nuclear tropism of the most cytotoxic complex.

Intracellular imaging of anticancer metallodrugs often relies on prelabeling with organic fluorophores, which significantly affects their physicochemical properties and intracellular distribution. On the other hand, the reported postlabeling strategies based on click&#8208;chemistry reactions require cell fixation and permeabilization. Here, this study presents a postlabeling approach based on the catalyst&#8208;free, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (iEDDA) between a strained fluorescein&#8208;tagged bicyclononyne derivative (BCN&#8208;FAM) and half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes containing bidentate ligands comprising a tetrazine (Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;) entity. Five half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes with formula [Cp*Ir(Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;)Cl]0/+ have been synthesized and fully characterized, including the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of three of the five derivatives. Investigations of their stability and their reactivity in aqueous solution and in a model iEDDA reaction reveal the strong influence of the tetrazine ligand structure on the chemical properties of the corresponding complexes. A highly cytotoxic metallodrug candidate (Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me) is identified from biological studies, and chemical reactivity studies disclose an unusual preference for binding of methionine over cysteine. Postlabeling of Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me in live HeLa cells highlights its preferential accumulation within the nucleus, suggesting its retention through covalent modifications of nuclear proteins in good agreement with other half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes.

         <title>Leaf&#8208;Like Nanostructures Self&#8208;Assembled by Silver&#8208;Coordinated Photosensitizers as Collaborative Antimicrobial Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel approach to combat bacterial infections in wounds using self&#8208;assembled leaflike nanostructures. These structures, formed by coordination between the photosensitizers Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;mPy and silver ions, combine the antibacterial properties of silver with photoinduced singlet oxygen generation to enhance wound healing.

This research introduces an innovative approach to addressing bacterial infections in wounds using leaflike nanostructures, which are self&#8208;assembled via coordination between the photosensitizer phenylcarbazole&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;f]benzotriazole&#8208;m&#8208;pyridine and silver ions. These nanostructures combine photosensitizer&#8208;generated singlet oxygen with silver's antibacterial effects, synergistically promoting wound healing. When incorporated into a Carbopol 941 hydrogel matrix, these nanostructures achieve near&#8208;total bacterial eradication (0.04% survival) while accelerating wound healing and tissue regeneration in a mouse model. This dual&#8208;functional mechanism allows the nanostructures to perform exceptionally well against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, even in biofilm environments, where conventional strategies solely on individual components often fail.

         <title>Identification of Endogenous Sequences Interacting with METTL3/METTL14 RNA Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endogenous RNA sequences interacting with METTL3/METTL14 RNA methyltransferases (MTD3/14) are identified using RNA&#8208;capturing microsphere particles (R&#8208;CAMPs) that immobilize RNA fragments derived from the endogenous RNAs of human cells. Potential G&#8208;quadruplex sequences are isolated as binding targets and are preferentially methylated by MTD3/14, indicating a strong relationship between RNA modification and RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structure.

N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification in mRNA and regulates various biological processes. The RNA&#8208;binding properties of m6A writer proteins play an important role in determining RNA modification sites. METTL3 and METTL14 form the core of the m6A writer complex, with METTL3 as the catalytic methyltransferase and METTL14 as the RNA&#8208;binding scaffold. Thus far, the comprehensive RNA&#8208;binding properties of METTL3/14 remain unknown. Using RNA&#8208;capturing microsphere particles (R&#8208;CAMPs), immobilizing RNA fragments derived from endogenous RNAs of human lung carcinoma cells, RNA fragments that interacted with the METTL3/14 methyltransferase domain are isolated. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that the pool of isolated sequences contains significantly more regions with the potential to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rG4s) than the randomly extracted RNA sequence pool and that the (GGA) repeat sequences are most enriched. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, gel mobility shift assays, and methylation experiments demonstrate that METTL3/14 binds to RNA sequences containing (GGA) repeats that form rG4 structure much stronger than RNAs that do not form rG4s. This study shows the potential of RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures as a modulator of epitranscriptomic modification of m6As.

         <title>Tuning Tetrazine Substituents to Enhance Vinyltetrazine Labeling Performance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;position&#8208;modified vinyltetrazines are thiol&#8208;specific reagents for precision biomedicine. Six derivatives show tunable thiol&#8208;labeling (k2&#8201;=&#8201;17.7&#8211;227&#8201;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1) and rapid bioorthogonal kinetics (k2&#8201;=&#8201;1.4&#8211;5.7&#8201;&#215;&#8201;103&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). High peptide labeling yields (88%&#8211;99%), serum/reduced glutathione&#160;stability, improved cellular uptake via charge/lipophilicity optimization, pretargeted cell imaging, and radionuclide labeling are achieved.

The site&#8208;specific labeling of peptides and proteins is a powerful tool for investigating biological processes. It is demonstrated that the powerful thiol&#8208;specific labeling reagent vinyltetrazine activates prodrugs and enables 18F and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;modality imaging. It is predicted that substitutions at the 3&#8208;position of tetrazine can affect the labeling efficiency, bioorthogonal kinetics, and stability. Six vinyltetrazines with different 3&#8208;position modifications exhibit rapid labeling and, subsequently, bioorthogonal kinetics and excellent stability. Vinyltetrazine labeling modifies the charge characteristics and lipophilicity of target peptides, thereby improving cellular uptake. This research on tuning tetrazine substituents will aid in the construction of a comprehensive vinyltetrazine library, leading to the development of new peptide conjugates and pretargeted immuno&#8208;positron emission tomography (immune&#8208;PET) imaging.

         <title>Characterization of the Cubamyces menziesii terpenome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1,000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, we explored the genome of Cubamyces (C.) menziesii and identified eighteen genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, we cloned the eighteen codon&#8208;optimized open reading frames and overproduced the C. menziesii sesquiterpene cyclases in Escherichia coli. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme was purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate (GDP), farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these ten enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes was determined by GC&#8208;MS and NMR analysis. Among the ten enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds and the remaining two acted as multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore C. menziesii and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A library of (&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene) and&#160;bis&#8208;bpy Ru (II) complexes bearing thiazolhidrazinylidene&#8208;chroman&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione was synthesized, characterized and the molecules evaluated for their antibacterial activity, and cytotoxicity. From this library, several compounds were identified as being active, against Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin&#8208;sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). A polypyridyl complex showed a noteworthy minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) of 3.12 &#181;M and no toxicity in healthy eukaryotic cells with therapeutic index (T.I.) of &gt; 32. Active complexes appear to exert their antibiotic activity by affecting both the permeabilization of the bacterial membrane and/or the electron transport chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and in vitro Reconstitution of Closoxazole Biosynthesis from Pyxidicoccus fallax</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazoles are important structural components of both bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical active ingredients. We investigated a putative benzoxazole gene cluster originating from the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax. This gene cluster was found to confer the ability for production of closoxazoles, which were recently discovered in the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium cavendishii. To obtain further insights into the biosynthetic mechanism, the required key enzymes were subjected to in vitro studies. Notably, significant differences to the biosynthetic pathway in C. cavendishii were observed. First, the condensing amidohydrolase uses an unstable ester as substrate and, thus, establishes a C&#8208;N bond for benzoxazole formation. In contrast, the homolog from C.&#160;cavendishii is thought to use an amide substrate. Secondly, both AMP ligases encoded in this pathway attach a third aryl carboxylic acid building block to the benzoxazole intermediate, but these enzymes exhibit different regioselectivities. This facilitated the production of closoxazole A and B but also gave access to new derivatives in which a third building block is linked to the phenolic amine of the benzoxazole. The substrate flexibility of these enzymes allowed us to introduce other building blocks into the biosynthetic pathway and thus, to expand the structural diversity of benzoxazole&#8208;containing natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>A ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step approach for the generation of bicyclic peptides containing a benzylphenyl thioether framework</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy to prepare a unique type of bicyclic peptide molecules containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. Different from the conventional bicyclic peptide construction method, we first utilized peptide ligases (SrtA or OaAEP1) to introduce an arylthiol group into the parent peptides, and then performed bicyclization of the peptides by using tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene to generate the desired bicyclic peptides. Since the pKa of aryl thiols is lower than that of alkyl thiols, the bicyclization reaction of the peptides in our system can occur under low concentrations of tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene or low pH conditions. The low concentrations of tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene have little effect on the phage infectivity, which will help maintain the diversity of phage&#8208;displayed cyclic peptides. This study established a biocompatible ligase&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step strategy for the preparation of bicyclic peptides, which has potential applications in the discovery of bioactive cyclic peptide ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Constraint For Prevention of Aging of Organophosphate&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphate compounds (OPCs) prevents the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, and results in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leading to severe cholinergic crisis. To treat toxic exposure to OPCs, the focus has been on using reactivator compounds (e.g., oximes) to reverse the adduct formation in the enzyme&#8217;s active site, and to release the regenerated, active form of AChE. However, the interaction between the OPC inhibitor and the enzyme is usually followed by a secondary dealkylative reaction in which the OPC &#8220;ages&#8221;, i.e., produces an oxyanion on the phosphoryl group that cannot be recovered with standard reactivators. Unexpectedly, we discovered that immobilization of AChE prevented aging of OPC adducts. This result led us to hypothesize that the inhibition and recovery pathways in AChE could be regulated by allosteric effectors that bind to the enzyme at a distance away from the site of inhibition. To demonstrate this, we have replicated resistance to aging using bifunctional crosslinking of AChE in solution. This work provides the foundation to expand these principles to other potential effectors.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the advancements in DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategies for cell membrane engineering. It covers the summary of strategies for functionalization of DNA nanomaterials on cell membranes and the applications of cell&#8208;based biomedicine. The DNA&#8208;based nongenetic approach to engineering cell membranes holds great promise in the field of cell&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic.

Engineering the cell surface has emerged as a significant method for manipulating cell behavior and determining cell fate. Regulating the composition or structure of cell membranes has the potential to impact the essential roles they play in biointerfacing, signal transduction, and compartmentalization. This presents significant prospects for the advancement of cell&#8208;based biomedicine. DNA nanotechnology has emerged as a promising experimental toolbox for cell membrane engineering, owing to its high programmability and excellent biocompatibility. Nongenetic strategies based on DNA nanotechnology for programming cell membranes have seen rapid growth over the past decade, showing promising prospects for cell&#8208;based therapeutic diagnostics. In this review, the nongenetic&#8208;based strategies for the functionalization of cell membranes are first introduced. The biological applications of DNA nanotechnology in cell membrane engineering are also highlighted and summarized, including molecular sensing, modulation of cell membrane signaling pathways and intercellular interactions, and establishment of transmembrane channels. Finally, the challenges and prospects of DNA nanotechnology in cell membrane engineering are discussed.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Cholane&#8211;Phenanthrene&#8211;Cholane Trimers for Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of phosphodiester&#8208;linked cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers is described. The morphology of the formed nanostructures depends on the phenanthrene isomer used and on the cooling rate during the assembly process leading to nanosheets, worm&#8208;like structures, or nanotubes. Doping with pyrene results in a strong increase in the quantum yield, demonstrating the potential of these assemblies as artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems.

The self&#8208;assembly of two isomeric amphiphilic cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers and the light&#8208;harvesting properties of the formed supramolecular assemblies in aqueous medium are presented. Distinct differences in the supramolecular nanostructures are observed based on the type of phenanthrene isomer used, as well as on the cooling rate applied during the thermal self&#8208;assembly process. A fast cooling rate results in the formation of 2D objects (nanosheets) with both trimers. In contrast, a slow cooling process results in the observation of 3D objects, with worm&#8208;like nanostructures for the self&#8208;assembled 3,6&#8208;disubstituted phenanthrene trimer and nanotubes for the 2,7&#8208;isomer. Upon doping with an acceptor chromophore, the supramolecular phenanthrene assemblies demonstrate efficient energy transfer. The presence of small quantities (6%) of a pyrene acceptor results in a fivefold increase in the quantum yield compared to the phenanthrene trimer alone, highlighting their potential as artificial light&#8208;harvesting complexes. This work underscores the versatility of amphiphilic phenanthrene derivatives as building blocks for light&#8208;harvesting supramolecular systems.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein S&#8208;palmitoylation is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification transferring the 16&#8208;carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteines. It plays a critical role in many cellular processes by influencing protein function, localization, stability, and protein&#8208;protein interactions and has a significant impact on various physiological and pathological conditions. This emphasizes the need to develop new technologies to study and treat diseases associated with aberrant palmitoylation. To address these challenges, we present cell&#8208;permeable peptides containing a DHHC palmitoylation motif aiming to affect intracellular protein S&#8208;palmitoylation. A small library of peptides was generated and screened for cellular uptake and cell compatibility. Interestingly, the newly designed peptides internalized to high extent into different cell lines and human breast cell spheroids dependent on their palmitoylation motif. In addition, out of this screen we identified DC&#8208;2 as very potent and investigated this peptide in more detail concerning its impact on palmitoylated proteins that are connected to cancer progression. These initial explorations highlighted that DC&#8208;2 affected the localization of HRas and altered S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;related signaling cascades of EGFR. Our findings suggest a peptide&#8208;driven impact on proteins having palmitoylation sites and highlight cell&#8208;permeable DHHC&#8208;peptides as a potential tool to be further evolved in the context of palmitoylation and cancer.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein S-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification transferring the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteines. It plays a critical role in many cellular processes by influencing protein function, localization, stability, and protein-protein interactions and has a significant impact on various physiological and pathological conditions. This emphasizes the need to develop new technologies to study and treat diseases associated with aberrant palmitoylation. To address these challenges, we present cell-permeable peptides containing a DHHC palmitoylation motif aiming to affect intracellular protein S-palmitoylation. A small library of peptides was generated and screened for cellular uptake and cell compatibility. Interestingly, the newly designed peptides internalized to high extent into different cell lines and human breast cell spheroids dependent on their palmitoylation motif. In addition, out of this screen we identified DC-2 as very potent and investigated this peptide in more detail concerning its impact on palmitoylated proteins that are connected to cancer progression. These initial explorations highlighted that DC-2 affected the localization of HRas and altered S-palmitoylation-related signaling cascades of EGFR.

         <title>Efficient synthesis of cleavable CPP&#8208;cargo conjugate via low&#8208;equivalent of CPP activated by 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dithiodipyridine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) are favored for protein delivery due to their efficiency, rapidity, and low toxicity. However, conjugation of CPPs to proteins often requires significant amounts of CPPs to ensure yields, which also may result in increased proteins dimer formation. Here, we report that the use of low equivalents 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dithiodipyridine (DPDS)&#8208;activated CPP for conjugation cargo allows for high&#8208;conversion&#8208;rate CPP&#8208;cargo conjugates. Using this strategy, we obtained high&#8208;conversion&#8208;rate conjugates of cyclic deca&#8208;arginine peptide (cR10) with ubiquitin (Ub) and UbcH7 using only low equivalents of cR10. Furthermore, we successfully conjugate three CPPs to cargo via DPDS and confirmed its successful cytosolic delivery through fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>An Indole Dearomatization Strategy for the Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indole moiety is a privileged fragment that frequently populates existing bioactive compound collections. We describe the development of an indole&#8208;dearomatization sequence and its application for library expansion of a collection of indole&#8208;containing pseudo&#8208;NPs. The resulting compounds are topologically distinct from the original compound class. Phenotyping by means of the cell painting assay initially indicated that the dearomatized compounds are morphologically different than the original pseudo&#8208;NP compound class and guiding NPs. However, analysis by means of a new sub&#8208;profile analysis of the same cell painting assay data indicated that similar morphologies persisted throughout the compound classes. Further biological studies supported the findings of the sub&#8208;profile analysis and highlights its potential to more effectively characterize novel compounds. The biological findings suggest that a plethora of indole&#8208;dearomatization reactions could be applied to existing indole&#8208;containing compound collections to rapidly access new biologically relevant scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemical Characterization of Multimodular Xylanolytic Carbohydrate Esterases from the Marine Bacterium Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodular carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes often combine different catalytic activities for efficient polysaccharide degradation. In this work, the structural and functional characterization of three multimodular xylan&#8208;targeting esterases, Fl6, Fll1 and Fll4 from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48, are presented. Each protein shows novelty in its architecture, with particular emphasis on the enzyme Fll4, which consists of three esterase domains, resulting in bifunctional esterase activity.

Carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes) are critical for sustainable biomass utilization due to their ability to degrade complex polysaccharides. Frequently, a multimodularity can be observed combining several CAZyme domains and activities in close proximity which can benefit this degradation process. In this study, three multimodular xylanolytic carbohydrate esterases (CEs), named Fl6, Fll1, and Fll4, originating from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48 that represent a novel arrangement of catalytic and/or binding domains, are investigated. While Fl6 acts as a glucuronyl esterase, it also contains a carbohydrate binding module which is normally associated with xylanase activity. Fll1 combines xylosidase with acetylxylan esterase (AXE) activity mediated by a CE3 domain. The third enzyme, Fll4, is the first enzyme that comprises three distinct CE domains and shows bifunctional activity as an AXE and a feruloyl esterase (FAE). Investigation of the single domains reveals that the CE6 domain of Fll4 mediates its AXE activity while one of the putative CE1 domains, CE1a, mediates the FAE activity. This investigation of multimodularity of marine CAZymes not only enhances our understanding of these enzymes but may provide a promising route toward more efficient algal biomass utilization for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Dynamic G&#8208;Quadruplexes in the Rous Sarcoma Virus Genome: Scaffolds for Protein Interaction and Potential Anti&#8208;Viral Targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(A) The RSV&#8208;DNA contains three G4 elements characterised by CD&#8208;spectroscopy. (B) The CD data was analysed by PCA and SVD to identify the structural forms of these G4s. (C) These G4s are potential anti&#8208;viral targets as G4&#8208;specific small&#8208;molecule ligands recognise them. (D) Further, the importance of these G4s in the viral life cycle is established by their interaction with the host&#8208;protein nucleolin.







Abstract
Summarising the study, RSV is an important pathogen that causes oncogenic transformation in its host via the action of a protein kinase that it expresses. The RSV genome is reverse&#8208;transcribed into its complementary DNA, which then integrates into the host genome. This DNA thereafter serves as a template for transcription to manufacture viral proteins. The viral life cycle can, therefore, be inhibited if the functional elements of this DNA are altered. In this aspect, G4s may play an important role due to their involvement in hijacking the host machinery. Interestingly, the RSV&#8208;DNA contains multiple probable G4 forming elements, among which the sequences with the highest G4 forming propensity are located within the GAG and POL genes. Additionally, a sequence within the SRC oncogene also has G4 forming potential. In this study, we verified the G4 formation in these sequences via various biophysical assays. Further, the structural topology of these G4s has also been studied using computational and biophysical methods. We have established that GG4 forms a parallel G4 structure while PG4 and SG4 form highly dynamic G4s, switching between various structural forms. Such molecular switching behaviour may also aid in the functional properties of these G4s in&#8197;vivo. However, further studies are required to elucidate the functional properties of these elements. We have also analysed the binding of these G4s to specific small&#8208;molecule ligands and the structural changes induced by the binding of Braco&#8208;19 on the G4s. Finally, we have observed that the G4 forming sequences in the RSV&#8208;DNA are recognised and bound by human nucleolin, which is highly similar in structure to the chicken nucleolin. This suggests that the G4s in the RSV&#8208;DNA may be implicated in various biological functions. These studies conclude that G4s are formed in the RSV&#8208;DNA at multiple locations, and these G4s show molecular switching properties under physiological conditions. Further, these G4s are also bound by small&#8208;molecule ligands and proteins, which induce structural changes. Thus, these G4s may be targetable sites for the control of RSV infection.

         <title>Thermal Folding of Peptides into Single &#945;&#8208;Helical Turns</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single &#945;&#8208;helical turns (S&#945;HT) are biorelevant peptide structures with potential applications in drug design. We envisioned augmented applications for thermal folding (T&#8208;folding) S&#945;HT, wherein, a dynamic S&#945;HT in equilibrium with non&#8208;helical conformers can be biased to favor S&#945;HT by increasing the temperature. Short peptides cannot fold into native S&#945;HT due to large conformational entropy. Covalent hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) for the peptide H&#8208;bond have been designed to counter the entropy and enable such S&#945;HT folds. Here, HBS&#8208;constrained S&#945;HT are synthesized. NMR, CD spectral and computational analyses reveal their existence in a S&#945;HT conformer which is in equilibrium with non&#8208;helical conformers. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral analyses reveal their T&#8208;folding behaviour, the extent of which can be controlled by varying the number of C&#945;&#8208;substituents at the i+1st and i+2nd residues and solvent polarities. The conformational transition of the minor non&#8208;helical conformers to S&#945;HT with increasing temperature, is at the origin of T&#8208;folding. T&#8208;folding molecules can uniquely serve as therapeutics with thermally augmentable potencies.</dc:description>

Covalent hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) for the peptide H-bond have been designed to counter the entropy and enable such S&#945;HT folds. Here, HBS-constrained S&#945;HT are synthesized. NMR, CD spectral and computational analyses reveal their existence in a S&#945;HT conformer which is in equilibrium with non-helical conformers. Temperature-dependent spectral analyses reveal their T-folding behaviour, the extent of which can be controlled by varying the number of C&#945;-substituents at the i+1st and i+2nd residues and solvent polarities. The conformational transition of the minor non-helical conformers to S&#945;HT with increasing temperature, is at the origin of T-folding. T-folding molecules can uniquely serve as therapeutics with thermally augmentable potencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Avoiding Misreading during Genetic Reprogramming in mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology, but the in&#8201;vitro translation system it uses to create screening libraries is imperfect. This study examines the prevalence of errors during in&#8201;vitro translation and provides best practices for avoiding such errors to researchers who are designing mRNA display libraries.

mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology. It takes advantage of a reconstituted in&#8201;vitro transcription and translation system to generate highly diverse affinity screening libraries. However, this process relies on the faithful translation of genetically encoded peptides, a conversion that is imperfect. Errors in translational decoding of mRNA can occur, decoupling the produced library from its genetic code. Because mRNA display affinity selections are analyzed with sequencing of the encoding DNA, rather than direct detection of the peptides, misreading silently reduces library diversity and complicates analysis. Herein, the presence of significant translational misreading during the production of mRNA display libraries is confirmed, best practices for genetic reprogramming are developed, and those rules are deployed to minimize the disconnect between genotype and phenotype in peptide affinity selections.

         <title>PSL Chemical Biology Symposia: The Increasing Impact of Chemistry in Life Sciences</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 6th Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres Symposium on Chemical Biology gathered&#160;leading researchers to explore cutting&#8208;edge advancements in the field. Held at the Institut Curie in Paris on February 27&#8211;28, 2025, it showcased the latest innovations in designing molecular tools to probe and manipulate biological systems. Through insightful presentations and discussions, the symposium highlighted emerging trends and directions in this rapidly evolving discipline.

This symposium is the 6th Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres (PSL) Chemical Biology meeting (2015, 2016, 2019, 2023, 2024, 2025) being held at Institut Curie. This initiative originally started in 2013 at Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles (ICSN) in Gif&#8208;sur&#8208;Yvette and was mostly focused on organic synthesis. It was then exported at Institut Curie to cover a larger scope, before becoming the official French Chemical Biology meeting. This year, around 200 participants had the opportunity to meet world leaders in chemistry and biology who described their latest innovations and future trends covering topics as diverse as prebiotic chemistry, activity&#8208;based protein profiling, high&#8208;resolution cell imaging, nanotechnologies, bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry, metal ion signaling, ferroptosis, and biocatalysis.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Naphthoyl Thiourea&#8208;Based Binuclear Ruthenium(II) Arene Complexes: Studies on Anticancer Activity and Apoptotic Mechanism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and anticancer activity of ruthenium(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes comprising naphthoyl thiourea&#8208;based ligands. The synthesized&#160; ruthenium(II) complexes(1&#8208;3) were fully characterized by elemental analysis and spectral&#160;methods. The structure of complex 2 has been elucidated by employing single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), which verifies the two bidentate N^O and N^S coordination of the thiourea ligand to two Ru(II) centres. Further, the complexes have been subjected to stability studies to illustrate their aquation behavior in an aqueous medium. All the complexes have been screened for their anticancer efficacy in Breast (MCF&#8208;7), Colon (HT&#8208;29), Liver (HepG2) cancerous cells and non&#8208;cancerous kidney (Hek&#8208;293) cells. Among them, complex 2 with an IC50 concentration of 3.59 &#177; 0.72 &#181;M exhibits the most potent activity in HT&#8208;29 cells, surpassing the positive control, cisplatin. &#160;In addition, AO&#8208;EB and Hoechst labelling of all the complexes(1&#8208;3) on HT&#8208;29 cells reveals morphological alterations such as nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation resulting from the death of cancerous cells via apoptosis. Biochemical assays such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and flow cytometry strongly confirm the cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction&#8208;mediated apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering and Structural Elucidation of a Sac7d&#8208;Derived IgG Fc&#8208;Specific Affitin and Its Application for the Light&#8208;Controlled Affinity Purification of Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affitin derived from the Sac7d scaffold enables the light&#8208;controlled affinity purification of antibodies under physiological conditions, thus overcoming limitations of protein A chromatography. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and affinity measurements reveal complex formation with Fc at the CH2/CH3 junction, similar to protein A/G and FnRn. Combined with the light&#8208;responsive Azo&#8208;tag, this tiny adapter molecule opens new applications in antibody research.

While protein A affinity chromatography is widely established for antibody purification, the acidic elution conditions often lead to protein aggregation and deamidation. Here, an alternative approach is described for the purification of antibodies utilizing an engineered binding protein based on the archaebacterial Sac7d scaffold in combination with light&#8208;controlled &#945;&#8208;CD affinity chromatography (Excitography). Starting from a published affitin molecule, a monomeric protein version (C3A24) was engineered by substituting the unpaired thiol side chain Cys24 within the binding site by Ala, and, unexpectedly, its binding activity towards the human IgG1 Fc region was even improved (KD&#8201;=&#8201;76&#8201;nM). X&#8208;ray analysis of the cocrystallized C3A24 with a recombinant human Fc fragment revealed a 2:1 stoichiometry, with a binding site at the junction between the CH2 and CH3 domains. Interestingly, this binding site coincides with the ones of protein A, protein G, and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The affitin/Fc interaction is dominated by a network of hydrogen bonds, whereas, unpredicted by the initial affitin design, the two C&#8208;terminal Lys residues are also involved via a salt bridge and another hydrogen bond. Using the Azo&#8208;tagged C3A24, we purified clinically relevant antibodies from cell culture medium in a single step under physiological buffer conditions.

         <title>Mining Thermophile Genomes for New PETases with Exceptional Thermostabilities Using Sequence Similarity Networks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted genome mining identified thermostable enzymes (PETases) that hydrolyze the commonly used plastic polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Thermostable enzymes are identified from thermophilic microbial sources. Experimental results reveal enzymatic activity on authentic PET films, highlighting potential for industrial application. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of one PETase is solved to understand its exceptional thermostability. These findings pave the way for engineering catalysts for a circular PET economy.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a promising technology for advancing a circular PET economy. Several PET&#8208;degrading &#945;/&#946; hydrolases have been identified, but the full potential of this enzyme family to catalyze PET hydrolysis remains largely unexplored. To address this, sequence similarity networks are employed to investigate the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold&#8208;5 subfamily (IPR029059) for new PETases. Priority is given to sequences from thermophiles, as thermostable enzymes are likely more suitable for industrial applications. Ten enzymes with &#8776;20% sequence identity to the well&#8208;known LCC&#8208;PETase are identified, and seven are successfully overexpressed and purified for in vitro characterization. Each enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl butyrate, a mimic of trimeric PET, and emulsified PET nanoparticles. Notably, three enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing PET films. Novel PETases exhibit melting temperatures (Tm) exceeding 55&#8201;&#176;C and only modest losses of activity after incubation at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;h. The crystal structure of AroC (Tm&#8201;=&#8201;85&#8201;&#176;C) is resolved to 2.2&#8201;&#197;, revealing several salt bridges that likely confer thermostability, and a unique loop that is conserved among the PETases described here. These novel enzymes will enable engineering campaigns to generate thermostable and catalytically efficient PETases for use as industrial biocatalysts.

Ten enzymes with &#8776;20% sequence identity to the well-known LCC-PETase are identified, and seven are successfully overexpressed and purified for in vitro characterization. Each enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl butyrate, a mimic of trimeric PET, and emulsified PET nanoparticles. Notably, three enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing PET films. Novel PETases exhibit melting temperatures (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) exceeding 55&#8201;&#176;C and only modest losses of activity after incubation at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;h. The crystal structure of AroC (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;=&#8201;85&#8201;&#176;C) is resolved to 2.2&#8201;&#197;, revealing several salt bridges that likely confer thermostability, and a unique loop that is conserved among the PETases described here. These novel enzymes will enable engineering campaigns to generate thermostable and catalytically efficient PETases for use as industrial biocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lienhwalides: Unique Tropolone&#8211;Maleidride Hybrids from Hypoxylon lienhwacheense</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lienhwalides are novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecules unique in nature. Absolute configuration is solved by semisynthetic approaches and X&#8208;ray analysis. Interplay between both lwt and lwm biosynthetic gene clusters is responsible for the production of lienhwalides.

Hypoxylon lienhwacheense, a fungal species with an unclear taxonomic placement within the Hypoxylaceae, presents a highly rare stromatal secondary metabolite profile. Isolation of its major stromatal constituents leads to the discovery of a novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecule, lienhwalide A 5, in addition to the known cordyanhydride B 6, its new derivative 7, and binaphthalenetetraol 8. Unexpectedly, Hypoxylon lienhwacheense produces in liquid cultures various lienhwalide A congeners 9&#8211;11. Their structures and relative configurations are elucidated using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry&#160;and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with their absolute configurations determined using X&#8208;ray analysis of a semisynthetic brominated derivative of 9 and synthesizing &#945;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylphenylacetyl&#160;esters of 11. Feeding experiments with 13C&#8208;labeled precursors (13C&#8208;methionine; 1&#8208;13C&#8208; and U&#8208;13C6&#8208;glucose) reveal insights into the biogenesis of tropolone and maleidride moieties, according to 13C couplings and incredible natural abundance double quantum transfer NMR data. Genome analysis identifies two separate biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for these moieties, and heterologous expression experiments provide further insights into the interplay of both clusters during the biosynthesis of these hybrid natural products. Remarkably, lienhwalides exhibit reduced toxicity and enhance antibacterial selectivity compared to related fungal tropolones.

         <title>Artificial Lipidation of Antifungal Proteins and Antifungal Behavior: A Case Study with Cholesterylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antifungal behavior of artificial palmitoylated or cholesterylated chitinase domain is studied from biological, chemical, and physical properties, highlighting the importance of the chemical properties of the lipid moiety covalently attached to chitinase domain to obtain effective antifungal activity by artificial protein lipidation through a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;mediated reaction.

Lipid&#8208;based formulation of antifungal small drugs is used to mitigate drug toxicity while retaining effective antifungal activity. Herein, the effect of artificial cholesterylation of is studied, both of which were site&#8208;specifically modified using a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;reactive Q&#8208;tag (LysM&#8208;Q and CatD&#8208;Q). This produced protein&#8211;lipid conjugates (LysM&#8208;cholesteryl [Chol] or &#8208;palmitoyl [Pal] and CatD&#8208;Chol or &#8208;Pal). Although lipidation of these chitinase domains enhances the antifungal activity against Trichoderma viride, palmitoylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Pal and CatD&#8208;Pal) show stronger antifungal effects than cholesterylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Chol and CatD&#8208;Chol) both in the absence and presence of amphotericin B. Further characterization with lipidated LysM&#8208;fused green fluorescent protein (LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol) shows that the cholesterylation of proteins promotes distribution to dextran&#8208;rich phase in an aqueous two&#8208;phase system consisting of polyethylene glycol and dextran. Fluorescence microscopic analyses of the phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar vesicles reveal a distinct anchoring behavior between LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol to lipid membranes, which is possibly correlated with aggregate formation. These results highlight that the chemical properties of the lipid moiety are crucial to achieve effective enhancement of antifungal activity through artificial lipidation.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Gapmer Oligonucleotides Containing 4&#8242;&#8208;Carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;Carbamoyl&#8208;Thymidine Analogs</title>

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs in the gap region are synthesized and evaluated. Derivatization of the ONs is performed via postsynthetic modification. The synthesized ONs can form a stable duplex with target RNA regardless of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents and elicit RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of the RNA, and the RNA degradation rate is depending on the type of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents.

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) contain a gap region consisting of DNA, whose heteroduplex with RNA can be a substrate for RNase H. Herein, the synthesis and properties of gapmer ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs at the gap region are reported. Synthesis of the ONs was performed by postsynthetic modification of 4&#8242;&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)thymidine through hydrolysis and nucleophilic substitution. Concerning the synthesis of ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;(propylcarbamoyl)thymidine, postsynthetic conversion of 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxythymidine or 4&#8242;&#8208;(phenoxycarbonyl)thymidine on the support is effective. The duplex stabilities of the modified ONs are comparable to those of the unmodified ON. Several types of modified ONs can elicit the RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of target RNA. Furthermore, modified ON containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208;thymidine at the gap region shows improved stability in fetal bovine serum solution. The analogs used in this study can be modified nucleosides for the gap region of gapmer ONs.

         <title>Interdomain Coordination Determines Polyketide Extender Unit Specificity in UK&#8208;2A Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current understanding suggests that the specificity of extender unit incorporation is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domain, along with ketosynthase and thioesterase domains, In this work, it shows that the specificity extender unit incorporation is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire polyketide synthase module, rather than individual domains, offering new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

Controlling the incorporation of extender units is a key strategy for manipulating polyketide scaffolds. Current understanding suggests that extender unit incorporation by modular polyketide synthase (PKS) is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domains, along with ketosynthase, ketoreductase, and thioesterase domains. In this study, the mechanism is investigated underlying the specific incorporation of the benzyl side chain at the C7 position of UK&#8208;2A, both in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro. These findings reveal that the incorporation of the benzylmalonyl&#8208;CoA extender unit is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire PKS module, rather than being controlled by individual domains. These results challenge previous recognition and offer new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

         <title>Bromine&#8208;substituted tricyanofuran&#8208;based fluorogenic probes for the sensitive detection of glycosidases under acidic pH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosidases participate in modulating a number of biological processes, and their overexpression is a hallmark of several human diseases. Considering the localization of glycosidases predominantly in the lysosomes, it is imperative to develop molecular probes that are resistant to interference from acidic pH. Here, we synthesized tricyanofuran (TCF)&#8208;based long&#8208;wavelength fluorogenic probes, and demonstrated that the introduction of bromine to the ortho&#8208;position of the phenol alcohol of the probe substantially enhanced its fluorescence over an acidic pH range of 3.0&#8208;10.0.

The imaging results are validated by quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting.</dc:description>

         <title>The Persistent Myth of Limonene's Smell</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural monoterpenes stir our sense of smell in a special way. The scent of the monoterpene limonene, a major component of citrus oils, is thoroughly investigated. Still, the information on its smell is confusing. In this Perspective article, the smell of citrus oils and its odorant components are discussed, focusing especially on the two enantiomers of limonene.

The scent of the well&#8208;known monoterpene limonene is thoroughly investigated. Despite this, the scientific community does not reach consensus. In this Perspective article, a discussion is contributed by giving a simple overview of the olfactory system, as well as presenting the smell of well&#8208;known compounds and their odor threshold values in citrus oils, from which (R)&#8208;limonene is extracted. In particular, the composition of oils from orange and lemon peel and their association with the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantiomers of limonene, respectively, are considered. Then, the controversy surrounding the odors of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;limonene and the myth that has been spun from this are reported, particularly in the organic chemistry literature, before an argument for why this myth should be dismantled. Based on the chemical and physiological processes involved in the sense of smell, whether the odor attributed to a certain compound is from that compound and/or from derivatives produced by enzymes associated with the olfactory system is also briefly discussed.

         <title>The Molecular Toolbox for Linkage Type&#8208;Specific Analysis of Ubiquitin Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modification of proteins and other biomolecules with ubiquitin regulates virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. Ubiquitin can be attached to substrates as a monomer or as an array of polyubiquitin chains with defined linkages between the ubiquitin moieties. Each ubiquitin linkage type adopts a distinct structure, enabling the individual linkage types to mediate specific functions or outcomes in the cell. The dynamics, heterogeneity, and in some cases low abundance, makes analysis of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling a challenging and complex task. Here we review the strategies and molecular tools available for enrichment, detection, and characterization of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling. The molecular &#8216;toolbox&#8217; consists of a range of molecularly different affinity reagents, including antibodies and antibody&#8208;like molecules, affimers, engineered ubiquitin&#8208;binding domains, catalytically inactive deubiquitinases, and macrocyclic peptides, each with their unique characteristics and binding modes. The molecular engineering of these ubiquitin&#8208;binding molecues makes them useful tools and reagents that can be coupled to a range of analytical methods, such as immunoblotting, fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics, or enzymatic analyses to aid in deciphering the ever&#8208;expanding complexity of ubiquitin modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharides Using Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery and Evaluation of Their Immune&#8208;Enhancing Activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (&#945;&#8208;GOSs) are natural oligomeric saccharides found in plants that have garnered significant interest due to their indigestible nature and various biological activities. However, they often exist as inseparable mixtures, particularly long&#8208;chain substances.&#160;This study successfully achieved the total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;GOSs 1&#8208;6, featuring different lengths of galactose chains, using the boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) method developed in our laboratory. Additionally, we investigated the immune&#8208;enhancing activity and structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR) of the chemically synthesized &#945;&#8208;GOSs. It was revealed that the length of the galactose chain in the &#945;&#8208;GOSs significantly influences their immune&#8208;enhancing properties. Specifically, &#945;&#8208;GOS 2, which contains two galactose units, was found to markedly promote macrophage phagocytosis and increase the production of cytokines such as IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IL&#8208;1&#946;. These results suggest that &#945;&#8208;GOS 2 could serve as a natural immunomodulatory agent in functional foods.</dc:description>

Directed Evolution of Fluorescent Genetically Encoded Biosensors: Innovative Approaches for Development and Optimization of Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution significantly facilitates development of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, enabling the development of brighter and more specific biosensors. Novel methods enhance screening processes, decrease resources and costs, and integrate machine learning for optimized outcomes. Promising directions include near&#8208;infrared and photochromic biosensors, alongside de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains.

Fluorescent protein&#8208;based biosensors are indispensable molecular tools in cell biology and biomedical research, providing non&#8208;invasive dynamic measurements of metabolite concentrations and other cellular signals. Traditional methods for developing these biosensors rely on rational design, but directed evolution methods offer a more efficient alternative. This review discusses recent advancements in the development of biosensors using directed evolution, including methods for optimizing domain fusions, sequence optimization, and new screening and selection systems. Additionally, the incorporation of machine learning into the directed evolution process is explored, highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency and cost reduction of biosensor development. Finally, emerging trends in the development of near&#8208;infrared biosensors and photochromic sensors are discussed, along with the opportunities presented by de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains and biosensors.

Cationic Polymers for Gene Delivery: Properties and Functional Optimization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, three types of cationic polymers, the nonbiodegradable polymers polyethyleneimine and polyamidoamine, the biodegradable natural polymers chitosan and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin , and the biodegradable synthetic polymers poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s, are reviewed. The modification of these cationic polymers includes four general strategies, which improve the overall performance of gene carriers.

Developing safe and efficient nucleic acid delivery systems has been a major challenge for gene therapy. Cationic polymers, with their easily modifiable chemical structure and high nucleic acid loading capacity, can meet a wide range of needs for gene delivery. Research on using these polymers as gene delivery vectors is rapidly developing. In this paper, cationic polymers are briefly categorized into three types: nonbiodegradable polymers, biodegradable natural polymers, and biodegradable synthetic polymers. Among these three types, several representative delivery carriers are selected to be discussed in detail, which are polyethyleneimine, polyamidoamine, chitosan, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, and poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s. The physicochemical properties and structure optimization strategies of these representative types of carriers are outlined. The deficiencies and common major modification strategies of these vectors are summarized in comparison, which can provide new ideas for the design and development of cationic polymer gene vectors in the future.

         <title>Peptide Stapling Using Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogashira coupling of sidechains has been employed for stapling a series of peptides. The iodide and alkynyl derivatives required for the stapling reaction were introduced at the i and i+4 or i and i+7 positions as 4&#8208;iodophenylalanine and 4&#8208;propargyloxyphenylalanine, respectively. It is shown through CD analysis that a linear peptide showed increased helicity after stapling.







Abstract
An efficient method for the stapling of peptides by linking residues at the i and i+4 or i and i+7 positions through Sonagashira coupling is reported. The alkyne and aryl iodide functionality required are introduced by modifying tyrosine residues to 4&#8208;iodophenylalanine (PhI) and 4&#8208;propargyloxyphenylalanine (TyP) residues. Comparing the conformations of a stapled peptide with the corresponding linear peptide using CD spectroscopy reveals a more helical structure for the stapled peptide.

     alt="Peptide Stapling Using Sonogashira Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonogashira coupling of sidechains has been employed for stapling a series of peptides. The iodide and alkynyl derivatives required for the stapling reaction were introduced at the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;i+4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;i+7&lt;/i&gt; positions as 4-iodophenylalanine and 4-propargyloxyphenylalanine, respectively. It is shown through CD analysis that a linear peptide showed increased helicity after stapling.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reactions for Bioactive Sulfur Species Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the concept of bioorthogonal reactions triggered bioactive sulfur species delivery and summarizes representative delivery systems developed by this strategy in recent years. This approach offers a promising solution to realize precise and controllable small sulfuric molecule release. These bioorthogonal prodrug strategies also have enhanced benefits, including organelle targeting ability, spatiotemporal fluorescence feedback, and orthogonality with other reactions.

Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for the development of controllable drug delivery systems. Bioactive sulfur species, which participate in complex sulfur signaling pathways, play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, achieving precise and controlled administration of these sulfur species remains challenging due to their unique physicochemical properties. Over the past few years, a growing number of delivery strategies, which are triggered by different stimuli, have been developed to enhance our understanding of sulfur signaling. Bioorthogonal triggers not only offer excellent controllability but also provide advantages such as tunability, targeted delivery, and spatiotemporal feedback. This review highlights representative donors that can be activated through bioorthogonal reactions and their applications in studying the biological mechanisms and therapeutic functions of the bioactive sulfur species.

         <title>Target&#8208;Guided Design and Synthesis of Aryl&#8208;Functionalized Promysalin Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, target&#8208;guided analog design was employed to enhance the interactions of promysalin, a species&#8208;specific Pseudomonad inhibitor, with succinate dehydrogenase. We hypothesized that aromatic analogs could target an unexplored region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions leading to more potent compounds. Here, we report the in&#8208;silico design, scalable route, and biological characterization against a panel of clinically relevant strains.

The development of new narrow&#8208;spectrum antibiotics is a promising approach to combat antibiotic resistance. Promysalin, a secondary metabolite isolated from Pseudomonas putida, exhibits potent species&#8208;specific inhibition of the pathogen P. aeruginosa (IC50 21&#8201;nM). Herein, the total synthesis and stereochemical assignment of promysalin, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, and the identification of its molecular target, succinate dehydrogenase, are previously reported by the group. These findings enable computational studies of promysalin's interactions with succinate dehydrogenase, revealing a novel binding site region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions with a nearby tryptophan residue. It is hypothesized that new aromatic analogs of promysalin can target this beneficial interaction, potentially leading to more potent inhibitors of P. aeruginosa growth. Herein, the in silico design of these analogs, a scalable and general synthetic route to access them, and characterization of their activity against a panel of clinically relevant P. aeruginosa strains are reported.

         <title>Degradation of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Megasynthetases SrfAA and SrfAB by Acyldepsipeptide&#8208;Activated ClpP in Bacillus Subtilis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsZ is the only target protein that has been biochemically confirmed to be hydrolyzed both in&#8201;vitro and in bacterial cells. Coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP1 proteolytic complex that degrades the surfactin synthetases SrfAA and SrfAB in cell lysates and bacterial cells is demonstrated.

Protein degradation is a tightly controlled biological process and is essential for maintaining bacterial proteostasis. ClpPs are a highly conserved family of serine proteases that interact with ATPases and play key roles in diverse cellular activities, including heat&#8208;shock response, expression of virulence factors, and protein turnover and homeostasis. Owing to their vital roles, drugs targeting ClpP&#8208;ATPases have attracted interest in treating bacterial infections. The mode of action of the antibiotic acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) is uncontrolled proteolysis by an ATPase&#8208;independent ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. The cell division protein FtsZ is the only bacterial protein confirmed to be hydrolyzed by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex in recombinant enzyme systems and cells. Here, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that causes degradation of the secondary metabolite nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) SrfAA and SrfAB in Bacillus subtilis is reported. Using in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro studies coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of NRPSs, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that degrades SrfAA and SrfAB is demonstrated. Furthermore, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex is reconstructed in cell lysates, confirming that SrfAA and SrfAB are sensitive to degradation by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. These findings demonstrate that SrfAA and SrfAB are protein substrates for the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex, providing novel insights into the ClpP degradation machinery.

         <title>Design of Short Peptides for the Reduction of Silver Ions and Stabilization of Nanocomposites in Combating Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of amino acids, amphiphilic peptides, oligopeptides, and cationic antimicrobial peptides is crucial for reducing silver ions and stabilizing nanocomposites. The silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites can be formed with and without the assistance of ultraviolet/sunlight but without any toxic reagents and plant extracts or microorganism, and they effectively inhibit bacterial strains by disrupting membranes and generating reactive oxygen species.

Combating bacterial infections has become a formidable challenge in healthcare due to the rise of antibiotic resistance. Recently, short peptide&#8208;based nanobiomaterials, assembled through silver metal and peptide building blocks, have emerged as promising antibiotic agents for treating resistant bacterial infections. In this minireview, recent advances in silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites are highlighted, both with and without the assistance of UV or sunlight, for antibacterial applications. The chemical design of biomolecules such as amphiphilic short peptides, amino acids, and oligopeptides plays a crucial role in the reduction, stabilization, and biocompatibility of silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites. Noncovalent interactions involved in the formation of nanocomposites are explored in the context of the structure&#8211;function relationship. The antibacterial activities and underlying mechanisms, which depend on specific peptide building blocks, are also reviewed. Finally, the conclusion and the outlook provide insights into the design of novel peptide building blocks for the development of silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites with enhanced antibacterial activities.

         <title>Direct Preparation of Site&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates with Unpurified Antibodies in Culture Medium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K248 site&#8208;specific conjugation strategy enabling direct preparation of homogeneous antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) from unpurified cell culture media is established in this study. The method can be conducted under mild conditions with rapid completion, eliminating antibody pretreatment. It demonstrates broad compatibility with diverse payloads , , offering a streamlined, scalable solution for both laboratory and industrial ADCs&#160;production.

In comparison with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) have been extensively employed in cancer therapy due to their high selectivity and low systemic toxicity. However, the structural complexity of ADCs makes its preparation process more intricate and time&#8208;consuming. Conventional ADC production involves multistep purification processes, which significantly increase the costs. Herein, an approach for the direct preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs in an antibody expression system that is derived from the reported K248 site&#8208;specific modification technology is demonstrated. This strategy requires only a single purification step to obtain site&#8208;specific ADCs, thereby greatly shortening the preparation cycle of ADCs. The preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs in the expression system of Sacituzumab is successfully achieved. The resulting ADCs exhibited comparable physicochemical properties and activities to those obtained through the conventional two&#8208;step purification strategy. The approach demonstrates high compatibility with various linkers and antibodies, offering a streamlined&#160;methodology for the preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs.

This strategy requires only a single purification step to obtain site-specific ADCs, thereby greatly shortening the preparation cycle of ADCs. The preparation of site-specific ADCs in the expression system of Sacituzumab is successfully achieved. The resulting ADCs exhibited comparable physicochemical properties and activities to those obtained through the conventional two-step purification strategy. The approach demonstrates high compatibility with various linkers and antibodies, offering a streamlined&#160;methodology for the preparation of site-specific ADCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase&#8208;1 (IDO1) is a critical immunoregulatory enzyme responsible for the metabolism of tryptophan during inflammation and disease. Based on a 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran framework, examples of indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors containing a diverse set of boron&#8208;based functional groups (closo&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;carborane, boronic acids and esters, and benzoxaboroles) are reported. The novel boron derivatives display low micrometer affinity for the human recombinant enzyme, with IC50 values ranging from 8 to 60&#8201;&#956;M. Superior results are observed for the closo&#8208;carborane compounds which demonstrate a significant improvement in potency over their phenyl analogues, with inhibition of the IDO1 enzyme increasing by up to &#8776;80%.

         <title>Valdiazen Derivatives for Chemoproteomic Studies in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valdiazen is a&#8201;quorum&#8208;sensing signal isolated from B. c. H111. Using diazeniumdiolate chemical probes, several valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins are identified, many of which are involved in structural and metabolic processes. This study offers valuable chemical tools and advances our understanding of the interactome associated with diazeniumdiolate signaling molecules.

Quorum sensing (QS) allows bacteria to coordinate community&#8208;wide behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence, and symbiosis. The diazeniumdiolate valdiazen is identified in the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 as a novel quorum&#8208;sensing signal, yet its protein interactome remains unexplored. In this study, a chemoproteomic pulldown approach is used to identify potential valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins. For these pulldown experiments, a series of alkyne&#8208;linked and biotin&#8208;conjugated valdiazen probes are synthesized. Affinity&#8208;based pulldown experiments using biotin&#8208;valdiazen conjugates successfully identify several putative proteins including an ATP synthase subunit, a succinylglutamate desuccinylase/aspartoacylase, a granule&#8208;associated protein, an acetyl&#8208;CoA hydrolase, a serine protease and an OmpA/MotB precursor. Overall, this study provides insights into the valdiazen&#8211;protein interactome in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111, advancing our understanding of the role of valdiazen in bacterial QS.

         <title>Synthesis and Metal&#8208;Ion Binding Properties of Duplexes Containing Thymine Analogs with 1,2&#8208;Diamine Groups</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The findings of thermal denaturation experiments indicate that duplexes containing thymine analogues with 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine side chains show stabilizing effects with six metal ions (e.g., Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Cd(II)). The 1,2&#8208;diamine side chain demonstrated to be useful as a new metal&#8208;ion binding site.

Thymidine analogue with a 1,2&#8208;diamino side chain at the 3N position is synthesized and converted into an amidite unit for oligonucleotide synthesis. It is used for preparing oligonucleotides containing a 1,2&#8208;diamino side chain as X residue. Thermal denaturation studies are performed on a duplex containing an X&#8211;X pair in the presence and absence of metal ions. Among various metal ions used in this research, Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) ions increased the duplex stability. The results prove the new strategy to design metallo&#8208;base pairs containing various metal ions.

         <title>A Bacterial Sulfotransferase Catalyzes an Unusual Di&#8208;Sulfation in Natural Products Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a unique sulfotransferase, AdpST, is identified from the adp biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) in Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 and demonstrates that AdpST possesses di&#8208;sulfation activity, which is unprecedented for bacterial phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS)&#8208;dependent sulfotransferases. It is further shown that the adp BGC contains a dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette essential for improving sulfation capacity.

Sulfation is a widely used strategy in nature to modify the solubility, polarity, and biological activities of molecules. The enzymes catalyzing sulfation, sulfotransferases (STs), are typically highly specific to a single sulfation site in a molecule. Herein, the identification and characterization of sulfated adipostatins is reported and reveals a novel sulfotransferase, AdpST, which is responsible for di&#8208;sulfation at two sites of adipostatins. The initial bioinformatic analysis in search of adipostatin analogs from Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 identifies adpST and a 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthetic cassette, which are co&#8208;clustered with the adipostatin&#8208;encoding type III polyketide synthase. Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfated adipostatin analogs are discovered in the extracts of S. davaonensis DSM101723, whereas di&#8208;sulfated bacterial natural products has not been reported. Using a series of in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro experiments, it is confirmed that AdpST is solely responsible for both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfation of adipostatins, a catalytic activity which has not been identified in bacterial PAPS&#8208;dependent STs to date. It is further demonstrated that the dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette improves di&#8208;sulfation capacity. Lastly, it is determined that AdpST shares similarity with a small group of uncharacterized STs, suggesting the presence of additional unique bacterial STs in nature, and that AdpST is phylogenetically distant from many characterized STs.

         <title>Investigation of the Mechanism of Action of Natural and Synthetic Monoterpenoids: For a New Route in Antimycotic Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Bromothymol shows a stunning in&#8201;vivo antimycotic efficacy, even on resistant molds and yeast. Discrete Fourier transform and molecular dynamics approaches reveal that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a high affinity toward the bilayer. Noteworthy, it forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the phosphate in the lipid head, altering its structure and conceivably triggering a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; that affects the overall membrane stability.

Monoterpenoids are well&#8208;recognized natural antimycotic agents, but their mechanism of action is still unclear. Interestingly, synthetic derivatives, such as 4&#8208;bromothymol (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;5&#8208;methylphenol), are emerging as promising alternatives to natural molecules, due to their even greater biological activity. Herein, the antimycotic efficacy of 4&#8208;bromothymol is evaluated: in vivo experiments on species of acclaimed resistance demonstrate that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a minimum inhibitory concentration up to 6 times lower than thymol. In silico investigations, sweeping from partition coefficient (LogP) determination through density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations based on a minimum bias approach, support its improved antifungal activity with respect to thymol, carvacrol, and thymyl acetate. A structural insight of the mechanism of action is proposed. Even though all the analyzed compounds are able to penetrate the cellular membrane, 4&#8208;bromothymol shows a higher predicted affinity for the bilayer, and it causes a strong perturbation at the water/bilayer interface, altering the stability of the membrane, thus leading to cell death.

Noteworthy, it forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the phosphate in the lipid head, altering its structure and conceivably triggering a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; that affects the overall membrane stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoterpenoids are well-recognized natural antimycotic agents, but their mechanism of action is still unclear. Interestingly, synthetic derivatives, such as 4-bromothymol (4-bromo-2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol), are emerging as promising alternatives to natural molecules, due to their even greater biological activity. Herein, the antimycotic efficacy of 4-bromothymol is evaluated: in vivo experiments on species of acclaimed resistance demonstrate that 4-bromothymol has a minimum inhibitory concentration up to 6 times lower than thymol. In silico investigations, sweeping from partition coefficient (Log&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) determination through density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations based on a minimum bias approach, support its improved antifungal activity with respect to thymol, carvacrol, and thymyl acetate. A structural insight of the mechanism of action is proposed. Even though all the analyzed compounds are able to penetrate the cellular membrane, 4-bromothymol shows a higher predicted affinity for the bilayer, and it causes a strong perturbation at the water/bilayer interface, altering the stability of the membrane, thus leading to cell death.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Enzymatic Reactivity with an Expanded Palette</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovation in biocatalysis is rapidly increasingly the diversity of catalytic reactivity that can be mediated by enzymes, addressing a key bottleneck for their widespread adoption in industrial chemical synthesis. A key approach to this is building enzymes with unnatural catalytic components that provide an expanded palette with new possibilities for enzymatic reactivity.

The expanding applications of biocatalysis in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors herald a greener future for these industries. Yet, the range of chemical reactions known to enzymes only covers a small fraction of what is required for modern synthetic routes. To continue the increases in sustainability afforded by converting chemical processes into enzymatic ones, fundamentally new kinds of biocatalytic reactivity are required. Perhaps the very components from which enzymes are constructed, a palette of canonical amino acids and cofactors, inherently limit their catalytic possibilities, even if all the available natural sequence space can be explored. In recent years, there has been an explosion of strategies to produce new biocatalytic function through the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids and synthetic cofactors, new colors which are added to the enzyme design palette. This has enabled new enzymatic reactions that proceed via organocatalytic, organometallic, and photocatalytic mechanisms. Aside from designing new enzymatic activities from scratch, exogenous photocatalysts have recently also been used in synergy with natural enzyme active sites to diverge their reactivity towards radical pathways. This review will highlight recent developments in enriching enzymatic chemistry with new unnatural components, providing an outlook for future directions and needed developments for practicality and sustainability.

         <title>Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation of Supercharged Green Fluorescence Proteins in the Polyamine Biosynthetic Pathway Deleted E. coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of charged proteins was examined using super charged GFP in the polyamine synthetase knock down HT873 strain. Following ATP depletion and polyamine treatment, negatively charged GFP (&#8722;27) exhibited phase separation through charge&#8208;charge interactions with polyamines, indicating that polyamines are the main drivers for the formation of condensates of negatively charged proteins.

Protein liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has attracted significant attention due to its involvement in cellular functions and has been believed to be the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the primary mechanisms governing its formation and function remain unclear. Since most of proteins involved in condensation in cells are charged, it is hypothesized that charge&#8211;charge interactions mediated by small charged biomolecules, such as adenosine tri&#8208;phosphate (ATP) and polyamines, would be the primary driving force behind the protein LLPS. In the previous study, it is showed that small charged biomolecules are to be a main driver of protein LLPS through charge&#8211;charge interaction. Furthermore, multivalently charged small molecules play a crucial role in creating protein condensates when the protein themselves are charged, effectively acting as bridges between charged proteins. Having said that, the effect of endogenous polyamine molecules in protein condensation in cells could not be ruled out. In this study, an E. coli strain is utilized with a polyamine synthetase knocked&#8208;down, HT873, to investigate the role of polyamines in the aggregation of both negatively and positively charged green fluorescence proteins. This study suggests that both ATP and polyamine, as small charged biomolecules, play critical roles in the LLPS of charged proteins in cells.

         <title>Macrocycles of Saxitoxin: Insights into the Structure of Zetekitoxin AB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic macrocycles of (+)&#8208;saxitoxin, the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning, have been prepared. These are designed to mimic the macrocyclic core of the proposed structure for zetekitoxin AB. Interestingly, these synthetic macrocycles do not form the C12 hydrate as commonly observed in this family of toxins, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin AB.

Zeteketoxin AB is the only macrocyclic member of the bis&#8208;guanidinium ion toxins, and the only member reported to be more potent than the parent (+)&#8208;saxitoxin. A rationale for this exquisite potency remains difficult to develop due to the scarcity of natural material and a lack of consensus around the specific structure of the toxin itself. A strategy is reported, leveraging an intramolecular Michael addition to forge macrocycles bridging the saxitoxin core, mimicking the proposed structure of zetekitoxin AB. Intriguingly, these analogs do not form a hydrate at C12. Experimental and computational studies suggest that a macrocyclic framework destabilizes the hydrate, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin. Preliminary activity screening utilizing calcium imaging&#8208;based constellation pharmacology demonstrates several analogs to have potent pharmacological activity similar to (+)&#8208;saxitoxin despite the lack of the C12 hydrated ketone.

Unlike the lysate&#8208;based CFPS system, the alternative purified cell&#8208;free system, Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements (PURE), has garnered a great attention due to its controllability and flexibility of adjusting individual component for in vitro transcription and translation research. The PURE system has been widely studied in the synthetic biological field, and optimized for its application in prototyping research, non&#8208;canonical amino acid incorporation and synthetic cell construction. Herein, we discuss the recent optimization strategies for a simple and enhanced PURE system. In addition, the recent application via the PURE system and the current challenges for the development of a more robust and controllable PURE are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>SAAP&#8208;148 oligomerizes into a hexamer forming a hydrophobic inner core</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 is a widely studied antimicrobial 37&#8208;mer peptide with various ascribed functions, that serves as a template for designing novel peptides. Its derivative, the 24&#8208;mer SAAP&#8208;148, is highly effective in vitro in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, persistent cells, and biofilms, without inducing resistance. SAAP&#8208;148 is characterized by a high cationic charge (+11) and 46% hydrophobicity, which, once the peptide folds into an alpha helix, forms a wide hydrophobic face. This highly amphipathic nature facilitates on the one hand its insertion into the membrane's fatty acyl chain region and on the other hand it&#180;s interaction with anionic membrane components, which contributes to its mode of action in killing bacteria. However, the contributions of the secondary and quaternary structures remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted a study using anionic and zwitterionic membrane models, applying circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray scattering, AlphaFold 3 and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that SAAP&#8208;148 adopts a stable hexameric bundle composed of three parallel dimers, creating a hydrophobic core of aromatic residues. This structure is retained at the membrane interface, where MD simulations suggest the formation of a fiber&#8208;like structure on anionic membranes, most likely driven by exposed cationic side chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Conjugation Method of CpG&#8208;ODN Adjuvant to Intact Virions for Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vaccines are a pivotal achievement in public health, offering inexpensive, distributable and highly effective protection against infectious diseases. Despite significant advancements in vaccine development, there are still many diseases for which vaccines are unavailable or offer limited protection. The global impact of the deficiency in vaccine&#8208;induced immunity against these diseases is profound, leading to increased rates of illness, more frequent hospitalizations, and higher mortality rates. Recent studies have demonstrated conjugation mechanisms and delivery methods to co&#8208;present adjuvants and protein epitopes to antigen&#8208;presenting cells, significantly enhancing adaptive immunity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are a pivotal achievement in public health, offering inexpensive, distributable and highly effective protection against infectious diseases. Despite significant advancements in vaccine development, there are still many diseases for which vaccines are unavailable or offer limited protection. The global impact of the deficiency in vaccine-induced immunity against these diseases is profound, leading to increased rates of illness, more frequent hospitalizations, and higher mortality rates. Recent studies have demonstrated conjugation mechanisms and delivery methods to co-present adjuvants and protein epitopes to antigen-presenting cells, significantly enhancing adaptive immunity. We introduce a novel approach to incorporate an adjuvant into the vaccine by covalently attaching it to whole enveloped virions. Using "clickable" azide-enabled viral particles, generated through metabolic incorporation of N-azidoacetyl glucosamine (GlcNAz), we conjugated the virions with a cyclo-octyne-modified CpG-ODN. Conjugation yielded a potent adjuvant-virus complex, eliciting higher TLR9-mediated cell activation of cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages relative to co-administered adjuvants and virions. Administration of covalent adjuvant-virion conjugates increase immune cell stimulation and may provide a generalizable and effective strategy for eliciting a heightened immune response for vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cold&#8208;Adapted Lipid A from Polaribacter sp. SM1127: A Study of Structural Heterogeneity and Immunostimulatory properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polaribacter sp. SM1127, a cold&#8208;adapted marine Gram&#8208;negative bacterium isolated from Laminaria in Arctic waters, plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and biopolymer degradation in cold environments. Additionally, its exopolysaccharide (EPS) exhibits promising biotechnological potential, including antioxidant and wound&#8208;healing properties. This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of lipid A, the glycolipid component of Polaribacter sp. SM1127 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by bypassing full LPS extraction and working directly with the ethanol precipitation product containing both EPS and bacterial cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant structural heterogeneity in the lipid A, with variations in fatty acid chain length, branching, saturation and hydroxylation. These features likely enable the bacterium to fine&#8208;tune its response to fluctuating temperatures or other cold&#8208;related environmental stresses, contributing to resilience in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. Furthermore, immunological assays demonstrated that both LPS and EPS produced by Polaribacter sp. SM1127 induce weak TLR4 activation and, in general, poorly stimulate the NF&#8208;kB pathway, compared to E. coli LPS. These findings suggest their potential as immunomodulatory agents, like vaccine adjuvants.</dc:description>

Molecular Tweezers for Biomimetic Recognition of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular tweezers have emerged as effective binders for biomolecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, eliciting biological activities. Tweezer molecules, which exploit an open and adaptive binding cavity, can target relatively large guests, such as oligosaccharides and glycans, and often provide some advantages over corresponding macrocyclic architectures.

Molecular recognition of biomolecules by means of synthetic receptors is a key topic with several potential applications, which must face the challenge of recognizing relatively large guests in an aqueous medium. Due to their open cavity, molecular tweezers are promising architectures for this purpose that have already shown interesting recognition properties with lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, thereby eliciting biological activities. Carbohydrates, assembled within glycans, are polar biomolecules of high structural complexity that are particularly difficult to be effectively recognized in water. Notably, in addition to reports on more widely explored structures, significant advances have been achieved exploiting the structural peculiarity of tweezer receptors. In this review a selection of some emblematic examples from the literature of molecular tweezers, cleft and clips targeting carbohydrates is presented, together with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of this type of architecture.

         <title>Study on the Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 3,3,3&#8208;Trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;Hydroxypropanoic Acids by Lactate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two lactate dehydrogenases, chicken l&#8208;lactate dehydrogenases (l&#8208;LDH) from Gallus and d&#8208;LmLDH from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, are screened for high reductive activity and stereoselectivity toward 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropionic acid, achieving 99% enantiomeric excess for (R) and (S), respectively. Formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii is used to construct stereocomplementary reactions with chicken l&#8208;LDH and d&#8208;LmLDH, enabling efficient synthesis of chiral (2R)&#8208; and (2S)&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanoic acid.

Chiral 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanoic acid (3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic acid, TFLA), which possesses two significant functional groups, is a versatile intermediate in pharmaceutical and material synthesis. A feasible strategy for producing both the enantiomers of chiral TFLAs involves reduction of the corresponding pyruvate using lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs). In this study, ldh genes encoding l&#8208;LDHs from animals and d/l&#8208;LDHs from lactic acid bacteria are cloned and all the recombinant LDHs are successfully expressed with a histidine tag in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). To achieve cofactor regeneration, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide regeneration system is constructed using formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii. Chiral TFLA is synthesized from 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropionic acid (trifluoropyruvic acid, TFPy) with good yields and excellent stereoselectivity, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase. Under optimized biocatalytic conditions, highly active d&#8208;LmLDH from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and chicken l&#8208;LDH from Gallus are screened for their ability to completely convert 0.5&#8201;m TFPy to produce optically pure (S)&#8208;TFLA and (R)&#8208;TFLA with enantiomeric excess &gt;99.5% within 6&#8201;h, respectively. Molecular docking simulations investigate the catalytic mechanisms of selected d&#8208;LDH and l&#8208;LDH, revealing their activity and stereoselectivity toward &#63743;CF3&#8208;containing TFPy.

         <title>Profiling Serine Hydrolases in the Leishmania Host&#8208;Pathogen Interactome Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Activity&#8208;Based Fluorophosphonate Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leishmaniasis, a vector borne neglected tropical disease, caused by the protozoan parasite&#160;Leishmania, is a major global public health challenge with millions of new cases annually.&#160;Treatment of leishmaniasis is difficult for many reasons including a multiple life&#8208;cycle stages, involving both an infective insect vector form, the promastigote, and a disease causing intracellular mammalian host form, the amastigote, and increasing drug&#8208;tolerance that are all linked by the interplay between parasite and host.&#160;We employed activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) using new cell&#8208;permeable fluorophosphonate probes to explore serine hydrolases (SHs) in&#160;Leishmania mexicana&#160;with subsequent analysis enabled by secondary reaction with an affinity reagent. Importantly, these cell&#8208;permeable probes can access all life&#8208;cycle stages including the disease&#8208;critical intramacrophage amastigote. Probe efficacy is a combination of both target engagement and subsequent accessibility to the affinity agent. Fourteen SHs, including peptidases and lipases, were identified in the&#160;L. mexicana&#160;proteome with comparative profiling of different parasite life&#8208;stages revealing significant changes in SH activity across the life&#8208;cycle stages. This intra&#8208;cellular ABPP approach provides insights into the host&#8208;parasite interactome demonstrating that SHs function as important virulence factors with Z&#8208;Pro&#8208;Prolinal, a known prolyloligopeptidase inhibitor, being able to reduce parasite infectivity in the macrophage by altering multiple SH targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactive specialized metabolites from Staphylococcus: diversity, biosynthesis and biotechnological potential.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria capable of colonizing diverse ecological niches and adopting a wide variety of lifestyles. While several strains are known as notorious, multidrug&#8208;resistant human pathogens, others are harmless inhabitants of soil, water and food products, or beneficial members of the skin microbiota. To survive and remain competitive under challenging environmental conditions, staphylococci have evolved the ability to assemble and secrete a diverse range of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides, nonribosomal peptides, terpenes, siderophores and other specialized metabolites with antibiotic, immunomodulating and metal chelating activities. In this review, we provide an overview of the bioactive metabolite arsenal of staphylococci with a focus on their biosynthetic pathway, mode of action and industrial application potential.

While several strains are known as notorious, multidrug-resistant human pathogens, others are harmless inhabitants of soil, water and food products, or beneficial members of the skin microbiota. To survive and remain competitive under challenging environmental conditions, staphylococci have evolved the ability to assemble and secrete a diverse range of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, nonribosomal peptides, terpenes, siderophores and other specialized metabolites with antibiotic, immunomodulating and metal chelating activities. In this review, we provide an overview of the bioactive metabolite arsenal of staphylococci with a focus on their biosynthetic pathway, mode of action and industrial application potential. We also highlight unexplored natural product biosynthetic pathways in staphylococci, along with strategies to access this hidden potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Loop Dynamics in Reshaping the Conformation of YB&#8208;1 Cold Shock Domain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the regulatory role of the C&#8208;terminal loop in stabilizing the YB&#8208;1 cold shock domain (CSD). Through molecular dynamics simulations, NMR, and crosslinking, it identifies a critical interaction network formed by the loop. Phosphorylation at S102 disrupts this network, altering CSD dynamics, stability, and DNA binding affinity.







Abstract
The human Y&#8208;box binding protein 1 (YB&#8208;1) plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The cold shock domain (CSD) of YB&#8208;1 is responsible for specific nucleic acid recognition and exhibits a unique &#946;&#8208;barrel structure. While the CSD alone is unstable, the addition of 11 residues at the C&#8208;terminus significantly stabilizes the structure. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which this extended loop region influences the structure and dynamics of the CSD using all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by NMR and crosslinking experiments. Our simulations reveal that the extended loop forms a sandwich&#8208;like interaction network with the CSD, stabilizing the overall structure. This network involves hydrogen bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions, preventing the loop from collapsing due to electrostatic attractions. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of S102 within the loop region disrupts this network, leading to increased structural flexibility and conformational changes. This disruption weakens the interaction between CSD and DNA, explaining the experimentally observed decrease in binding affinity upon phosphorylation. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the role of loop dynamics in reshaping the conformation of the YB&#8208;1 CSD.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Cobalt Alloy@Graphene&#8208;Engineered Milk Extracellular Vesicles for Gastric Retentive Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To establish a gastric&#8208;retentive drug delivery system, FeCo@G&#8208;engineered milk extracellular vesicles are developed. This platform integrates the protective properties of milk extracellular vesicles, shielding drugs from degradation, with FeCo@G's robust magnetic retention capabilities. These features enable efficient mucosal penetration and significantly extend gastric retention time, enhancing therapeutic efficacy in gastric environments.







Abstract
Oral drug delivery is widely used for treating gastric diseases as it allows drugs to act directly on gastric lesions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. However, its efficacy is hindered by the specific gastric environment, such as the gastric mucosal barrier, which limits drug penetration, and the short gastric emptying time, which results in transient residence time. Raw milk&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (M&#8208;EVs) offer promise as a gastric drug delivery platform. Their high cellular affinity, stability under gastrointestinal conditions, and ability to protect drugs from acidic and enzymatic degradation make them suitable for this purpose. Incorporating mangetic nanoparticles encapsulated in M&#8208;EV provides magnetic navigation and active mucosal penetration capabilities. Herein, we developed a gastric drug delivery system based on iron&#8208;cobalt alloy@graphene (FeCo@G)&#8208;engineered M&#8208;EV (M&#8208;FNP). M&#8208;FNP serves as a versatile drug carrier that can load both small molecules and proteins through simple physical approach. And it demonstrates stability in the simulated gastric fluid system for at least 6&#8197;hours. Under magnetic field guidance, it penetrates the simulated mucosal layer and is internalized by cells within 4&#8197;hours significantly enhancing cellular drug uptake. M&#8208;FNP is expected to serve as an innovative drug delivery platform with enhanced retention capabilities within the stomach.

         <title>A Cryptic Loop that Modulates Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction: Implications in PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2 Late&#8208;stage Binding Event</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of computational and experimental approaches revealed the role of a cryptic loop in the late&#8208;stage binding of Plasmodium falciparum proteins PfAMA1 and PfRON2, crucial for malaria parasite entry into human red blood cells. Simulations captured loop dynamics, while experiments validated binding kinetics, identifying, fort the first time, key residues in PfRON2&#8217;s helix region essential for binding.







Abstract
Disease&#8208;related protein&#8208;protein interactions are important molecular targets for drug discovery campaigns. The dynamics of a disordered loop, which are commonly found in the receptor binding domain of many proteins, often plays a decisive role during protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;small molecule binding events. One notable example is the interactions between two proteins from Plasmodium falciparum, PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2, which are crucial for the malaria parasite's invasion into human red blood cells. A thorough understanding of the interactions between these macromolecular binding partners is important for designing better therapeutics against this ancient disease. The available crystal structures of the PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2 complex show insufficient electron density, making it challenging to fully understand the molecular&#8208;level association of the domain II (DII) loop with the PfRON2. To address this, we have computationally simulated the dynamics and free energetics of DII loop closing processes, identifying a set of key amino acid residues in the PfRON2 helix that are essential for binding. The subsequent experimental validation of the relative importance of residues in context provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular recognition event between PfAMA1 and PfRON2, specifically in the post&#8208;binding stage. This insight could potentially open up new avenues to drug discovery against malaria.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Component Reactions in Protein Modification and Immobilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the role of multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) in protein immobilization and modification is highlighted. MCRs are particularly significant in protein chemistry due to their advantages, such as the ability to be conducted under physiological conditions and the simultaneous attachment of multiple functional groups to proteins.







Abstract
Protein modification/immobilization has been introduced as a large toolbox for creating a myriad of engineered proteins with profound implications for various scientific and industrial applications. Proteins immobilization techniques are generally performed through protein fixation in/to heterogeneous materials or via inter cross&#8208;linking of protein molecules, enabling the development of biocatalysts, biosensors, and drug delivery systems. On the other hand, chemical modification of proteins offers tailored changes in their functionality, enhances protein performance, extends their shelf life, and enables their specific binding interactions. The choice of immobilization or modification technique depends on the significance of various factors for the final product. Chemical coupling methods that create covalent bonds are commonly used for both proposes. Multi&#8208;component reactions are particularly effective because they operate under mild conditions to maintain protein functionality while simultaneously introducing multiple functional groups. This review provides an overview of multi&#8208;component reactions employed for the immobilization and modification of proteins.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Turn Mimicking Crosslinking Provides Hyperstability and Fast Folding Kinetics for Short Collagen Triple Helices</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen triple helices and &#946;&#8208;turns are compatible chemical motifs to fuse based on their identical H&#8208;bond geometry. The resulting collagen triple helices are intramolecularly folded, exhibiting high stability and fast folding kinetics. Besides serving as a scaffold structure for designing short, stable, heterotrimeric collagen triple helices, the bis &#946;&#8208;turn collagen peptides were used to deconvolute a two&#8208;step collagen folding mechanism as a kinetic model.







Abstract
Creating stabilized peptide mimics of the collagen triple helix is challenging, especially for collagen heterotrimers. Interstrand sidechain crosslinking offers a useful approach, though this strategy can suffer from destabilizing structural perturbations, sequence limitations and synthetic complexity. Herein, we show that the geometry of hydrogen bonding in the collagen triple helix is compatible with installation of terminal &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;mimicking linkers at the N&#8208;terminal and C&#8208;terminal ends of the triple helix. These double&#8208;turn&#8208;containing collagen peptide mimics fold into highly stable, intramolecular triple helical structures, providing access to profoundly miniaturized triple helix mimics. Intramolecular triple helix formation exhibits significantly accelerated folding kinetics. Comprehensive kinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;limiting step of folding is distinct at low and high temperatures, affording unique insight into the mechanism.

         <title>Characterization of ActVI&#8208;ORF3 and ActVI&#8208;ORF4 as Lactonizing and Delactonizing Enzymes in Relation to Metabolic Flux in Actinorhodin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We identified ActVI&#8208;ORF3 as a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme that exhibits lactonization activity toward compounds with the same stereochemistry as actinorhodin. ActVI&#8208;ORF4 functioned as an NAD(P)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the delactonization of benzoisochomanequinone lactones. ActVI&#8208;ORF3 contributed significantly to lactonization of related compounds in the metabolic flux of actinorhodin biosynthesis, whereas the contribution of delactonization of ActVI&#8208;ORF4 was less pronounced.







Abstract
Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is an aromatic polyketide antibiotic with a benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) skeleton. Although actVI&#8208;ORF3 and actVI&#8208;ORF4 are not essential for ACT biosynthesis, homologous genes to these are present in the biosynthetic gene clusters of BIQ lactones. In this study, ActVI&#8208;ORF3 was identified as a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme with lactonization activity, using ACT as a substrate. ActVI&#8208;ORF3 recognized dihydrokalafungin and 8&#8208;hydroxykalafafungin, which share the same pyran&#8208;ring configuration as ACT, but not nanaomycin A, which has an opposite configuration. In contrast, ActVI&#8208;ORF4 functioned as an NAD(P)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, catalyzing the delactonization of BIQ lactones. Conversion experiments using isotopically labeled compounds revealed that both lactonization and delactonization reactions of these enzymes yielded products in which the carboxyl oxygen at the C1 position was retained. Subsequently, we reexamined the accumulation of ACT&#8208;related compounds in the actVI&#8208;ORF3 and actVI&#8208;ORF&#8208;4 disruptants. The results suggested that ACT intermediates are predominantly pooled in the bacteria as (S)&#8208;DNPA rather than in lactone&#8208;form. The contribution of ActVI&#8208;ORF4 to metabolic flux is not significant, and endogenous reductases can convert these intermediates to the dihydro form, which subsequently re&#8208;enters the ACT biosynthetic pathway.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the C&#8208;Glycosylated Depside Arenicolin B</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenicolin B is a C&#8208;glucosylated depside assembled by a combination of highly&#8208;reducing (HRPKS) and non&#8208;reducing polyketide synthases (NRPKS) to afford the aglycone depside precursor. Depside bond formation is catalyzed by the NRPKS thioesterase (TE) domain. Tailoring by a C&#8208;glycosyltransferase selectively mono&#8208;glycosylates the depside to furnish arenicolin B.







Abstract
We uncovered the biosynthetic pathway of the C&#8208;glycosylated depside arenicolin B from Phialomyces arenicola through genome mining, heterologous reconstitution and biochemical characterization. The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of arenicolin B is comprised of a HRPKS, a NRPKS, and a C&#8208;glycosyltransferase. Through biochemical dissection and evaluation, we demonstrate the NRPKS thioesterase (TE) domain catalyses depside formation.

         <title>Maintaining the Integral Membrane Proteome: Revisiting the Functional Repertoire of Integral Membrane Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is crucial for functional proteome in all kingdoms of life. The task of cleaving transmembrane proteins within the unique environment of the lipid bilayer presents biochemical challenges that has been solved by integral membrane proteases (IMPRs). This review explores the structural and functional characteristics of IMPRs while also discussing future directions in this exciting field of science.







Abstract
Cells in all kingdoms of life employ dedicated protein quality control machineries for both their cytosolic and membrane proteome ensuring cellular functionality. These crucial systems consist besides a large variety of molecular chaperones, ensuring a proper fold and consequently function of the client's proteome, of several proteases to clean out damaged, unfunctional and potentially toxic proteins. One of the key features underlying the functional cycle of these quality control systems is the inherent flexibility of their bound clients which for a long time impaired detailed structural characterization, with advanced high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy in the last decade playing a key role contributing to the present understanding of their functional properties. Although these studies laid the foundation of the present knowledge of the mechanistic details of the maintenance of cytosolic proteins, the understanding of related systems employed for membrane associated as well as integral membrane proteins remains rather sparse to date. Herein, we review the crucial contributions of structural and dynamical biology approaches, possessing the power to resolve both structure and dynamics of such systems as well as enabling the elucidation of the functional repertoire of multimeric proteases involved in maintaining a functional membrane proteome.

         <title>Recent Chemical Biology Insights Towards Reversible Stapled Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible stapled peptides have greatly expanded the chemical space of peptide stapling methods. They retain the advantages of stapled peptides while allowing controlled release of peptide molecules and other cargoes, broadening the application of peptides in chemical biology research, drug discovery and delivery.







Abstract
Peptides are increasingly recognized for their advantages over small molecules in the modulation of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs), particularly in terms of potency and selectivity. &#8220;Staples&#8221; can be coupled to the amino acid residues of linear peptides to limit their conformation, improving the stability, membrane permeability, and resistance to proteolysis of peptides. However, the addition of staples can sometimes lead to the complete inactivation of the original peptide or result in extensive interactions that complicate biophysical analysis. Reversible stapled peptides provide an excellent solution to these issues. Besides, probes based on reversible stapled peptides are also indispensable tools for thoroughly investigating PPIs. Consequently, the development of diverse reversible stapling techniques for stapled peptides is crucial for broadening the applications of peptide molecules in drug discovery, drug delivery, and as tools in chemical biology research. This review aims to summarize representative chemical design strategies for reversible stapled peptides, focusing on reversible chemical stapling methods involving sulfhydryl, amino, and methylthio groups, as well as reversible modulation of the conformational states of stapled peptides. Additionally, we demonstrate some intriguing biological applications of stapled peptides and, finally, suggest future research directions in the field that will serve as references for related researchers.

         <dc:description>
mFNA, a novel nanomaterial that combines the self&#8208;assembly precision of FNAs with the stability of metal nanomaterials, hold great potential in fields such as biomedicine, chemical sensing, materials science, and energy conversion. This article is the first to define &#8220;metal&#8208;framework nucleic acids,&#8221; exploring their construction methods and functional characteristics, while also providing a forward&#8208;looking analysis of research challenges and future trends, offering readers a comprehensive perspective on this field.







Abstract
Based on the Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing principle, precisely programmable metal&#8208;framework nucleic acids (mFNA) have evolved from one&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale structures, a technological advancement attributed to progress in DNA nanotechnology. mFNA are a new type of nanomaterial formed by using framework nucleic acids (FNAs) as precise templates to guide the ordered assembly and self&#8208;assembly of metal ions, metal salts (such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, etc.), metal nanoclusters, metal nanoparticles, or metal oxide nanoparticles. Compared to traditional FNAs, mFNA not only inherits the powerful programmed self&#8208;assembly capabilities of nucleic acids but also incorporates the unique physicochemical properties of inorganic metal nanomaterials. This intersection of organic and inorganic chemistry presents broad application prospects in fields such as biology, chemistry, materials science, and energy science. This review, based on the principles related to FNAs, introduces the concept of mFNA for the first time, aiming to explore the fundamental connections between nanoscale FNAs and metal materials. Additionally, the article focuses on the construction methods and functional characteristics of mFNA. Finally, the current challenges faced by mFNA are reviewed, and their future development is anticipated, providing detailed information for a comprehensive understanding of the research progress in mFNA.

         <title>Coelenterazine&#8208;dependent Bioluminescence in the Cyclopoid Copepod, Triconia conifera</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calanoid copepod has been know to be bioluminescent using coelenterazine. The cyclopoid copepod, Triconia conifera emits blue light. In this study, we identified the presence of luciferase activity to coelenterazine in T. conifera. The presence of coelenterazine in the specimen was confirmed by LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS. These results suggested that coelenterazine&#8208;dependent bioluminescence was evolved parallelly at least twice in copepod lineages.







Abstract
Species in the cyclopoid copepod Triconia are known to be bioluminescent, emitting blue light by mechanical stimulus. In this study in Triconica conifera, we identified the presence of luciferase activity to coelenterazine, a substrate for the bioluminescence in various marine taxa such as luminous cnidarians, fishes, and crustaceans including calanoid copepods. The molecular size estimated by gel&#8208;filtration chromatography and pH dependency of the luciferase activity were similar to those in calanoid copepods. On the other hand, the reaction rate and inhibitory effect by magnesium ion were much different between them. The presence of coelenterazine in the specimen was confirmed by LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS. Taken together with the phylogenetically distant relationship between Cyclopoida and Calanoida, our findings suggested that coelenterazine&#8208;dependent bioluminescence was evolved parallelly at least twice in copepod lineages.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoates From Sucrose by Recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sucrose&#8208;utilization pathway was developed in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 using sacC from Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which encodes a &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. MCL&#8208;PHA and P(3HB) were successfully produced in recombinant P. putida KT2440 expressing SacC from sucrose as a sole carbon source.







Abstract
A sucrose&#8208;utilization pathway was developed in Pseudomonas putida using sacC from Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which encodes a &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Excretion of &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase into the culture medium was confirmed via western blot analysis. In nitrogen&#8208;limited cultivation, P. putida expressing SacC produced 10.52&#8197;wt&#8201;% medium&#8208;chain&#8208;length polyhydroxyalkanoate (MCL&#8208;PHA), while P. putida expressing SacC along with poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] biosynthesis genes produced 9.16&#8197;wt&#8201;% P(3HB) from sucrose. Batch and fed&#8208;batch cultures of recombinant P. putida suggested that the glucose and fructose derived from sucrose can be completely utilized for cell growth and P(3HB) production. In fed&#8208;batch cultures, sucrose supplied into the fermentor to maintain its concentration around 20&#8197;g/L was rapidly hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose supporting the production of 30.2&#8197;g/L P(3HB) with 38.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The engineered P. putida reported herein can facilitate the production of PHAs from sucrose, an abundant and inexpensive carbon source.

         <title>Conjugation of Human N&#8208;Glycans Improves the Drug Properties of Existing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylation, which can impart the beneficial properties of N&#8208;glycans to peptides and proteins, can be applied by a glycoconjugation approach at the post&#8208;synthesis stage in an aqueous environment. The synthesis of glycoconjugation&#8208;ready N&#8208;glycans does not require the manipulation of glycan carbohydrate protecting groups, allowing for their use in unprotected form.







Abstract
Glycosylation is one of the most ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modifications observed in peptides and proteins. It affects the structural and functional characteristics of these macromolecules, thereby exerting a profound influence on a multitude of biological processes. N&#8208;Glycans are expected to be a beneficial modifier for increasing the solubility and in&#8197;vivo half&#8208;life, and reducing the aggregation and immunogenicity of native bioactive peptides and proteins, which have seen limited clinical utility due to their short blood half&#8208;life and unsuitable physicochemical properties. Chemoselective glycosylation reactions that can be conducted post&#8208;synthesis and in aqueous conditions are a promising strategy for the high&#8208;throughput development of peptide/protein drugs. This &#8220;glycoconjugation&#8221; approach is particularly advantageous in that manipulation of glycan protecting groups is not necessary, thereby allowing conjugation reactions to be carried out between target molecules and unprotected glycans. By providing a single glycosylation profile, i.&#8201;e., glycan structure, number, and position, glycoconjugation not only allows the beneficial properties of N&#8208;glycans to be exploited, but also facilitates the investigation of N&#8208;glycan function.

         <title>Probing Native CB2 Receptor Mobility in Plasma Membranes of Living Cells by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates CB2 receptor (CB2R) mobility in live cells using the fluorescent probe RO7304924 and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Results demonstrate the probe&#8216;s efficiency in quantifying receptor diffusion and mobility, with CB2R showing high mobile fractions and diffusion coefficients. This approach provides a non&#8208;invasive and precise tool for studying CB2R dynamics, relevant to cellular processes and receptor functions.







Abstract
In this study, we employed a novel fluorescent probe, RO7304924 &#8211; which selectively targets cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) &#8211; to assess the lateral mobility of CB2R within the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing a functional, untagged receptor variant. Utilizing confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we quantified the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of CB2R, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of RO7304924 as an innovative tool for elucidating the dynamics of this major endocannabinoid&#8208;binding G protein&#8208;coupled receptor. Our present findings highlight the potential of combining advanced ligand&#8208;based fluorescent probes with FRAP for future investigations into the biochemical details of CB2R mobility in living cells, and its impact on receptor&#8208;dependent cellular processes.

         <title>Harnessing Synthetic Riboswitches for Tunable Gene Regulation in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores using RNA switches as molecular tools for conditional gene regulation in mammalian cells. It covers the design strategies for tailoring RNA switches, their functional mechanisms in RNA&#8208;mediated regulatory processes, and their diverse applications in gene function analysis, biosensor development, and targeted gene therapies.







Abstract
RNA switches regulated by specific inducer molecules have become a powerful synthetic biology tool for precise gene regulation in mammalian systems. The engineered RNA switches can be integrated with natural RNA&#8208;mediated gene regulatory functions as a modular and customizable approach to probe and control cellular behavior. RNA switches have been used to advance synthetic biology applications, including gene therapy, bio&#8208;production, and cellular reprogramming. This review explores recent progress in the design and functional implementation of synthetic riboswitches in mammalian cells based on diverse RNA regulation mechanisms by highlighting recent studies and emerging technologies. We also discuss challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, system stability, and ligand delivery in complex biological environments. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of synthetic riboswitches as a platform for customizable gene regulation in diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Wireframe DNA Origami Capable of Vertex&#8208;protruding Transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wireframe DNA origami capable of vertex&#8208;protruding transformation is reported. Spacer strands between vertices and edges introduce vertex&#8208;specific flexibility, enabling designed vertex protrusion. Through DNA hybridization and strand displacement reactions, the structure is reversibly transformed between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;forms. This vertex&#8208;protruding transformation mechanism will expand the design possibilities of dynamic DNA nanostructures with tunable functions and applications.







Abstract
Regulating dynamic behavior of the designed molecular structures provides a foundation for the construction of functional molecular devices. DNA nanotechnology allows conformational changes in two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional DNA origami nanostructures by introducing flexibility between the faces of the structures. However, dynamic transformations in wireframe DNA origami, composed solely of vertices and edges, remain challenging due to vertex&#8208;specific flexibility. We report a wireframe DNA origami capable of vertex&#8208;protruding transformation between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;form with eight protruding vertices. This reversible transformation is driven by DNA hybridization and a toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction. Spacer strands between vertices and edges were designed to introduce flexibility. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that a longer spacer increases conformational flexibility and can achieve the narrow angles required for the vertex&#8208;protruding transformation. The experimental results showed the successful assembly of the open&#8208;form structure under optimized salt conditions, as visualized through transmission electron microscopy images. Furthermore, the transformation between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;form structures was demonstrated by the sequential addition of signal strands. This vertex&#8208;protruding transformation mechanism will expand the design approach of dynamic DNA nanostructures and help develop functional molecular devices for artificial molecular systems.

         <title>Silencing of O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Attenuated O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and Metastatic Potentials of Melanoma Cells Through Suppression of Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B Signaling Pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in the metastasis of melanoma. O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes are elevated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors and normal tissues. Suppression of OGT by siRNA showed that O&#8208;GlcNAcylation regulates melanoma metastasis via Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway, consequence in the expression of metastatic related genes.







Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is an important biological process in regulating the function of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins in cells. Enhancement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation was associated with cancer development and progression. Here, we demonstrated the involvement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in melanoma metastasis. Using the data from GEO database, we found that O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes, including glutamine fructose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and O&#8208;GlcNAcase (OGA); were elevated in metastatic melanoma compared with primary tumors and normal tissues. Functional analyses in melanoma cell lines &#8211; MNT&#8208;1, SK&#8208;MEL&#8208;28, and A&#8208;375 showed that suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation by siRNA against OGT significantly reduces the migration and invasion abilities of the cells. Phosphorylation of Akt and NF&#954;B was drastically suppressed after the knockdown of OGT, suggesting the role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating the Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway. In addition, we found that the NF&#954;B target genes, such as ZEB&#8208;2 and MCT&#8208;1, were significantly upregulated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors. MCT&#8208;1 expression in melanoma tissues was also correlated with the O&#8208;GlcNAcylation level. Taken together, we have demonstrated in this study the possible role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in controlling melanoma metastasis via upregulating MCT&#8208;1 expression through activation of the Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway.

         <title>Unveiling the Architecture of Human Fibrinogen: A Full&#8208;Length Structural Model</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first full&#8208;length three&#8208;dimensional structure of human fibrinogen was obtained through homology modelling, coarse&#8208;grained and all&#8208;atoms molecular dynamics simulations. Large sections that play important roles in fibrin assembly (coloured) and whose structures were missing in the crystallographic structure (grey) and therefore were unknown, were in silico modelled and analysed. This will allow the construction of a protofibril to shed light on the polymerization process.







Abstract
Fibrinogen is a protein involved in the haemostasis process playing a central role by forming the fibrin clot. An understanding of protein structure is vital to determining biological function. Despite many studies on the fibrin polymerization process, its molecular mechanism remains elusive mainly due to the absence of a full&#8208;length three&#8208;dimensional model of human fibrinogen. Amino&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;terminal regions of the three pairs of chains that form this molecule are missing in the crystallographic structure, being the carboxyl&#8208;terminal of the A&#945; chain the most affected with a section of more than 400 amino acids missing. To have a full structure of the fibrinogen molecule would allow the creation of a model of protofibril, shedding light into the fibrin formation process through computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations. Absent regions were explored using homology modelling and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations. Later on, the model was refined and stabilized with atomistic molecular dynamic simulations. In the present study, we obtained the first realistic full&#8208;length structure of fibrinogen, with features in accordance with previous results obtained by experimental techniques.
