         <title>New dipterocarpol&#8208;based molecules with &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitory and hypoglycemic activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dammarane triterpenoids are affordable and bioactive natural metabolites with great structural potential, which makes them attractive sources&#160; for drug development. The aim of the study was to investigate the potency of new dipterocarpol derivatives for the treatment of diabetes. Two dammaranes (dipterocarpol and its 20(24)&#8208;diene derivative) were modified by a Claisen&#8208;Schmidt aldol condensation to afford C2(E)&#8208;arylidenes in good yields. The majority of the synthesized compounds exhibited an excellent&#8208;to&#8208;moderate inhibitory effect toward &#945;&#8208;glucosidase (from S. saccharomyces), among them eight compounds showed IC50 values less than 10 &#956;M. 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;dammarane&#8208;2(E)&#8208;benzylidenes (holding p&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; 3l and p&#8208;carbonyl&#8208; 3m substituents) demonstrated the most potent &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition with IC50 0.753 and 0.204 &#181;M, being 232&#8208; and 857&#8208;times more active than acarbose (IC50 174.90 &#181;M), and a high level of NO inhibition in Raw 264.7 cells with IC50 of 1.75 and 4.57 &#956;M, respectively. An in vivo testing of compound 3m (in a dose 20 mg/kg) on a model of streptozotocin&#8208;induced T1DM in rats showed a pronounced hypoglycemic activity, the ability to reduce effectively the processes of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue and decrease the excretion of glucose and pyruvic acid in the urine. Compound 3m reduced the death of diabetic rats and preserved their motor activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibacterial Photodynamic Therapy by Zn(II)&#8208;Curcumin Complex: Synthesis, Characterization, DFT Calculation, Antibacterial Activity, and Molecular Docking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the synthesis and characterization of three Zn(II)&#8208;complexes is presented. DFT calculations are used to insight into their electronic structures, photophysical properties, and photoactivity. The synthesized complexes presented an antibacterial effect upon low&#8208;energy visible light exposure via singlet oxygen generation. The molecular docking study indicated the binding of the complexes to DNA gyrase B. Overall, this research offers insights into a potential new approach for antibacterial photodynamic therapy with Zn(II) complexes.







Abstract
The increase in antibacterial drug resistance is threatening global health conditions. Recently, antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has emerged as an effective antibacterial treatment with high cure gain. In this work, three Zn(II) complexes viz., [Zn(en)(acac)Cl] (1), [Zn(bpy)(acac)Cl] (2), [Zn(en)(cur)Cl] (3), where en=ethylenediamine (1 and 3), bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (2), acac=acetylacetonate (1 and 2), cur=curcumin monoanionic (3) were developed as aPDT agents. Complexes 1&#8211;3 were synthesized and fully characterized using NMR, HRMS, FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis. and fluorescence spectroscopy. The HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap (Eg), and adiabatic splittings (&#916;S1&#8722;T1 and &#916;S0&#8722;T1) obtained from DFT calculation indicated the photosensivity of the complexes. These complexes have not shown any potent antibacterial activity under dark conditions but the antibacterial activity of these complexes was significantly enhanced upon light exposure (MIC value up to 0.025&#8197;&#956;g/mL) due to their light&#8208;mediated 1O2 generation abilities. The molecular docking study suggested that complexes 1&#8211;3 interact efficiently with DNA gyrase B (PDB ID: 4uro). Importantly, 1&#8211;3 did not show any toxicity toward normal HEK&#8208;293 cells. Overall, in this work, we have demonstrated the promising potential of Zn(II) complexes as effective antibacterial agents under the influence of visible light.

         <title>Fluorimetric Cell Analysis with 9&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Berberine Derivatives as DNA&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staining subcompartments of eukaryotic cells: The high affinity of 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted berberine derivatives to DNA and the resulting fluorescent light&#8208;up effect were used for fluorimetric staining of eukaryotic cells, specifically for the distinct visualization of the heterochromatin or the nucleoli.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;sensitive fluorescent light&#8208;up probes based on berberine are presented. This biogenic fluorophore was chosen as central unit to use its potential biocompatibility and its DNA&#8208;binding properties. To provide predictable fluorescence quenching in aqueous solution and a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect upon DNA binding, aryl substituents were attached at the 9&#8208;position by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions. The 9&#8208;arylberberine derivatives have a very low fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl=&lt;0.02), which is caused by the radiationless deactivation of the excited state by torsional relaxation about the biaryl axis. In addition, these berberine derivatives intercalate into DNA with high affinity (Kb=2.0&#8722;22&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1). Except for the nitrophenyl&#8208; and hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, all tested compounds exhibited a pronounced fluorescence light&#8208;up effect upon association with DNA, because the deactivation of the excited&#8208;state by torsional relaxation is suppressed in the DNA binding site. Most notably, it was shown exemplarily with the 9&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208; and the 9&#8208;(6&#8208;methoxynaphthyl)&#8208;substituted derivatives that these properties are suited for fluorimetric cell analysis. In particular, these probes generated distinct staining patterns in eukaryotic cells (NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts), which enabled the identification of nuclear substructures, most likely heterochromatin or nucleoli, respectively.

         <title>Lipid Droplets Specific Fluorophore for Demarcation of Normal and Diseased Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing high&#8208;permeability fluorescent probes with large Stokes shifts, this study successfully differentiated between diseased and healthy tissues in liver, adipose, and small intestine.







Abstract
Using high&#8208;fidelity, permeable, lipophilic, and bright fluorophores for imaging lipid droplets (LDs) in tissues holds immense potential in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic or alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this work, we utilized linear and &#923;&#8208;shaped polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes for imaging LDs in both cellular and tissue environments, specifically in rats with diabetic and alcoholic fatty liver disease. The fluorescent probes possess several key characteristics, including high permeability, lipophilicity, and brightness, which make them well&#8208;suited for efficient LD imaging. Notably, the probes exhibit a substantial Stokes shift, with 143&#8197;nm for DCS and 201&#8197;nm for DCN with selective targeting of the lipid droplets. Our experimental investigations successfully differentiated morphological variations between diseased and normal tissues in three distinct tissue types: liver, adipose, and small intestine. They could help provide pointers for improved detection and understanding of LD&#8208;related pathologies.

         <dc:description>Glutamylation yields N&#8208;functionalized amino acids in several natural pathways. &#947;&#8208;Glutamylated amino acids may exhibit improved properties for their industrial application, e.g., as taste enhancers or in peptide drugs. &#947;&#8209;Glutamyl&#8208;isopropylamide (GIPA) can be synthesized from isopropylamine (IPA) and l&#8208;glutamate. In Pseudomonas sp. strain KIE171, GIPA is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of l&#8208;alaninol (2&#8209;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol), a precursor of the fluorochinolone antibiotic levofloxacin and of the chloroacetanilide herbicide metolachlor. In this study, fermentative production of GIPA with metabolically engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440 using &#947;&#8208;glutamylmethylamide synthetase (GMAS) from Methylobrorum extorquens was established. Upon addition of IPA during growth with glycerol as carbon source in shake flasks, the recombinant strain produced up to 21.8 mM GIPA. In fed&#8209;batch bioreactor cultivations, GIPA accumulated to a titer of 11&#160;g&#160;L&#8208;1 with a product yield of 0.11 g g&#8208;1 glycerol and a volumetric productivity of 0.24 g L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fermentative production of GIPA.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a New Germacrene Derivative Named Germacrene F</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the course studies on the promiscuity sesquiterpene cyclases, it was found that the protoillude synthase (Omp7) and the viridiflorene synthase (Tps32) and the FPP derivative with shifted double bond (C6&#8208;C7 to C7&#8208;C8) are able to generate a so far unknown germacrene derivative, that we name germacrene F. It must have been formed via 1&#8594;10 instead of 1&#8594;11 cyclization commonly conducted by these enzymes.







Abstract
The new farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) derivative with a shifted olefinic double bond from C6&#8208;C7 to C7&#8208;C8 is accepted and converted by the sesquiterpene cyclases protoilludene synthase (Omp7) as well as viridiflorene synthase (Tps32). In both cases, a so far unknown germacrene derivative was found to be formed, which we name &#8220;germacrene F&#8221;. Both cases are examples in which a modification around the central olefinic double bond in FPP leads to a change in the mode of initial cyclization (from 1&#8594;11 to 1&#8594;10). For Omp7 a rationale for this behaviour was found by carrying out molecular docking studies. Temperature&#8208;dependent NMR experiments, accompanied by NOE studies, show that germacrene F adopts a preferred mirror&#8208;symmetric conformation with both methyl groups oriented in the same directions in the cyclodecane ring.

         <title>Increasing the Stability of Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases by Disulfide Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together we are strong: Covalent homodimerization by disulfide engineering of the tryptophan halogenases Thal and PyrH leads to a significant increase in thermostability while retaining activity.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases allow halogenation of electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds under mild reaction conditions even at electronically unfavored positions with high regioselectivity. In order to expand the application of halogenases, the enzymes need to be improved in terms of stability and efficiency. A previous study with the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal demonstrated that thermostable Thal variants tend to form dimers in solution while the wild type is present as a monomer. Based on this a dimeric Thal variant was generated that is covalently linked by disulfide bonds. Introducing two cysteine residues at the dimer interface resulted in the variant Thal&#8197;CC with significantly increased thermostability (&#9653;T50=15.7&#8197;K) and stability over time at elevated temperature compared to the wild type. By introducing the homologous mutations into the tryptophan 5&#8208;halogenase PyrH, we were able to show that the stabilization by covalent dimerization can also be transferred to other halogenases. Moreover, it was possible to further increase the thermostability of PyrH by inserting cysteine mutations at alternative sites of the dimer interface.

         <title>Hoechst&#8208;modification on oligodeoxynucleotides for efficient transport to the cell nucleus and gene regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various artificial oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that contribute to gene regulation have been developed and their diversity and multifunctionality have been demonstrated. However, few artificial ODNs are actively transported to the cell nucleus, despite the fact that gene regulation also takes place in both the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. In this study, to prepare ODNs with the ability to accumulate in the cell nucleus, we introduced Hoechst molecules into ODNs that act as carriers of functional molecules to the cell nucleus (Hoe&#8208;ODNs). We synthesized Hoe&#8208;ODNs and confirmed that they bound strongly to DNA duplexes. When single&#8208;stranded Hoe&#8208;ODNs or double&#8208;stranded ODNs consisting of Hoe&#8208;ODNs and its complementary strand were administered into living cells, both ODNs were efficiently accumulated in the cell nucleus. In addition, antisense ODNs, which were tethered with Hoechst unit, were delivered into the cell nucleus and efficiently suppressed the expression of their target RNA. Thus, we constructed a delivery system that enables the transport of ODNs into cell nucleus.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Comparing with normal assembly/disassembly approach,&#160;enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies due to their superior specificity, biocompatibility and selectivity, can more effectively release molecules at lesions and be capable of imaging&#160;in vivo&#160;biological events.&#160;Specifically, due to the over&#8208;expression of enzymes in specific tissues, the assembly/disassembly processes can directly occur on the pathological site (or region of interest), thus these enzyme&#8208;instructed processes are widely and effectively used for disease treatment or precise bioimaging. In this concept, we introduce the concept and major strategies of enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies, illustrate their importance in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases, and review their advances in biomedical applications. Further, the challenges of such strategies in the clinic and future tendencies are also prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative analysis of 2D EXSY NMR spectra of strongly coupled spin systems in transmembrane exchange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solute translocation by membrane transport proteins is a vital biological process that can be tracked, on the sub&#8208;second timescale, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Fluorinated substrate analogues facilitate such studies because of high sensitivity of 19F NMR and absence of background signals. Accurate extraction of translocation rate constants requires precise quantification of NMR signal intensities. This becomes complicated in the presence of J&#8208;couplings, cross&#8208;correlations, and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) that alter signal integrals through mechanisms unrelated to translocation. Geminal difluorinated motifs introduce strong and hard&#8208;to&#8208;quantify contributions from non&#8208;exchange effects, the nuanced nature of which makes them hard to integrate into data analysis methodologies. With analytical expressions not being available, numerical least squares fitting of 2D spectra to theoretical models emerges as the preferred quantification approach. For large spin systems with simultaneous coherent evolution, cross&#8208;relaxation, cross&#8208;correlation, conformational exchange, and membrane translocation between compartments with different viscosities, the only available simulation framework is Spinach. In this study, we demonstrate GLUT&#8208;1 dependent membrane transport of two model sugars featuring CF2 and CF2CF2 fluorination motifs, with precise determination of translocation rate constants enabled by numerical fitting of 2D EXSY spectra. For spin systems and kinetic networks of this complexity, this was not previously tractable.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we show how tuning hydrophobicity and charge density via peptide design can be used to control the encapsulation of small molecule drugs, doxorubicin, and methylene blue. We find that sequences with both higher charge density and higher hydrophobicity are better at encapsulation. In some cases, drug encapsulation can significantly alter the material properties of the polyelectrolyte complexes from liquid coacervates to solid precipitates.







Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based polyelectrolyte complexes are biocompatible materials that can encapsulate molecules with different polarities due to their ability to be precisely designed. Here we use UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and infrared spectroscopy to investigate the encapsulation of model drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and methylene blue (MB) using a series of rationally designed polypeptides. For both drugs, we find an overall higher encapsulation efficiency with sequences that have higher charge density, highlighting the importance of ionic interactions between the small molecules and the peptides. However, comparing molecules with the same charge density, illustrated that the most hydrophobic sequence pairs had the highest encapsulation of both DOX and MB molecules. The phase behavior and stability of DOX&#8208;containing complexes did not change compared to the complexes without drugs. However, MB encapsulation caused changes in the stabilities of the complexes. The sequence pair with the highest charge density and hydrophobicity had the most dramatic increase in stability, which coincided with a phase change from liquid to solid. This study illustrates how multiple types of molecular interactions are required for efficient encapsulation of poorly soluble drugs and provides insights into the molecular design of delivery carriers.

         <title>Shedding Light on the D1&#8208;Like Receptors: A Fluorescence&#8208;Based Toolbox for Visualization of the D1 and D5 Receptors
</title>

         <dc:description>
We herein report the identification of UR&#8208;NR435 (25), a SCH&#8208;23390&#8208;based fluorescent ligand bearing a 5&#8208;TAMRA dye, as suitable for fluorescence microscopy at the D1R. Single&#8208;digit nanomolar binding affinity could be determined in radioligand competition binding and molecular brightness studies at D1&#8208;like receptors.







Abstract
Dopamine D1&#8208;like receptors are the most abundant type of dopamine receptors in the central nervous system and, even after decades of discovery, still highly interesting for the study of neurological diseases. We herein describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands, structurally derived from D1R antagonist SCH&#8208;23390 and labeled with two different fluorescent dyes, as tool compounds for the visualization of D1&#8208;like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR&#8208;NR435 (25) as a high&#8208;affinity ligand for D1&#8208;like receptors (pKi (D1R)=8.34, pKi (D5R)=7.62) with excellent selectivity towards D2&#8208;like receptors. Compound 25 proved to be a neutral antagonist at the D1R and D5R in a Gs heterotrimer dissociation assay, an important feature to avoid receptor internalization and degradation when working with whole cells. The neutral antagonist 25 displayed rapid association and complete dissociation to the D1R in kinetic binding studies using confocal microscopy verifying its applicability for fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, molecular brightness studies determined a single&#8208;digit nanomolar binding affinity of the ligand, which was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. For this reason, this fluorescent ligand is a useful tool for a sophisticated characterization of native D1 receptors in a variety of experimental setups.

         <dc:description>
In this study, we have identified UR&#8208;MN212 (20), a spiperone&#8208;based fluorescent ligand bearing a 5&#8208;TAMRA dye, as suitable for fluorescence microscopy at the D2R. The binding affinity in the single&#8208;digit nanomolar range could be determined in radioligand competition binding and molecular brightness studies at D2&#8208;like receptors.







Abstract
The family of dopamine D2&#8208;like receptors represents an interesting target for a variety of neurological diseases, e.&#8201;g. Parkinson's disease (PD), addiction, or schizophrenia. In this study we describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands as tools for visualization of dopamine D2&#8208;like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR&#8208;MN212 (20) as a high&#8208;affinity ligand for D2&#8208;like receptors (pKi (D2longR)=8.24, pKi (D3R)=8.58, pKi (D4R)=7.78) with decent selectivity towards D1&#8208;like receptors. Compound 20 is a neutral antagonist in a Go1 activation assay at the D2longR, D3R, and D4R, which is an important feature for studies using whole cells. The neutral antagonist 20, equipped with a 5&#8208;TAMRA dye, displayed rapid association to the D2longR in binding studies using confocal microscopy demonstrating its suitability for fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, in molecular brightness studies, the ligand's binding affinity could be determined in a single&#8208;digit nanomolar range that was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. Therefore, the fluorescent compound can be used for quantitative characterization of native D2&#8208;like receptors in a broad variety of experimental setups.

         <title>Chimeric Small Molecules for Detouring Drugs into Mitochondria to Engender Apoptosis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric Small Molecules (CSMs) were designed and synthesized in a concise strategy. One of the CSMs localized into the mitochondria, damaged them and generated ROS, leading to remarkable cancer cell killing in different cancer cell lines. These CSMs can be useful tools to understand organelle chemical biology in diseased states.







Abstract
Mitochondrion has appeared as one of the important targets for anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Subsequently, small molecule anti&#8208;cancer drugs are directed to the mitochondria for improved therapeutic efficacy. However, simultaneous imaging and impairing mitochondria by a single probe remained a major challenge. To address this, herein Chimeric Small Molecules (CSMs) encompassing drugs, fluorophore and mitochondria homing moiety were designed and synthesized through a concise strategy. Screening of the CSMs in a panel of cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF7, A549, and HCT&#8208;116) revealed that one of the CSMs comprising Indomethacin V exhibited remarkable cervical cancer cell (HeLa) killing (IC50=0.97&#8197;&#956;M). This lead CSM homed into the mitochondria of HeLa cells within 1&#8197;h followed by mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This novel Indomethacin V&#8208;based CSM&#8208;mediated mitochondrial damage induced programmed cell death (apoptosis). We anticipate these CSMs can be used as tools to understand the drug effects in organelle chemical biology in diseased states.

         <dc:description>The installation of aldehydes into synthetic protein ligands is an efficient strategy to engage protein lysine residues in remarkably stable imine bonds and augment the molecule affinity and selectivity for their biological targets. The high frequency of lysine residues in proteins and the reversibility of the covalent ligand&#8208;protein bond support the application of aldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands, holding promises for their future use as drugs.&#160;This review highlights the increasing exploitation of salicylaldehyde modules in various classes of protein binders, aimed at the reversible&#8208;covalent engagement of lysine residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted preparation and NMR spectroscopic characterization of Lys11&#8208;linked ubiquitin trimers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ubiquitylation refers to the attachment of mono&#8208; or poly&#8208;ubiquitin molecules to a substrate protein. To shield ubiquitin chains against potential hydrolysis, a facile, click&#8208;chemistry based approach was recently established for the generation of site&#8208;specifically conjugated ubiquitin dimers relying on triazole linkage. Here, the preparation of such ubiquitin chains was advanced by the generation of homotypic Lys11&#8208;linked ubiquitin trimers considering an isotopic labeling scheme in a moiety&#8208;wise manner. The structural and dynamical impact on the ubiquitin unit at proximal, central or distal position that is potentially invoked by the respective other two moieties was systematically probed by heteronuclear high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopic approaches. As a result, conjugating a third ubiquitin moiety to the proximal or distal site of a ubiquitin dimer does not alter structural and dynamical characteristics as it has been seen for ubiquitin dimers. This observation suggests that recognition of a homotypically assembled ubiquitin chain by a potential substrate is primarily done by screening the length of a ubiquitin chain rather than relying on subtle changes in structure or dynamic properties of single ubiquitin moieties composing the chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI Stabilizers by Extension of an Amidine&#8208;Substituted Thiophene Fragment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilizers were discovered through a fragment extension approach. The stabilizer exhibited moderate stabilization effect and selectivity towards a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; peptide complex.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) modulation is a promising approach in drug discovery with the potential to expand the &#8216;druggable&#8217; proteome and develop new therapeutic strategies. While there have been significant advancements in methodologies for developing PPI inhibitors, there is a relative scarcity of literature describing the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; development of PPI stabilizers (Molecular Glues). The hub protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and its interactome provide an excellent platform for exploring conceptual approaches to PPI modulation, including evolution of chemical matter for Molecular Glues. In this study, we employed a fragment extension strategy to discover stabilizers for the complex of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein and an Estrogen Receptor alpha&#8208;derived peptide (ER&#945;). A focused library of analogues derived from an amidine&#8208;substituted thiophene fragment enhanced the affinity of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; complex up to 6.2&#8208;fold. Structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) analysis underscored the importance of the newly added, aromatic side chain with a certain degree of rigidity. X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a unique intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking binding mode of the most active analogues, resulting in the simultaneous binding of two molecules to the PPI binding pocket. Notably, analogue 11 displayed selective stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; complex.

         <title>Terpene Synthases in the Biosynthesis of Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpenes across Diverse Organisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are bioactive natural products found in various organisms. We review the discovery of DTS synthases and the tailoring enzymes generating the chemical diversity. The catalytic motifs, domain functions and underlying mechanisms of the DTS synthases in constructing drimane scaffold are summarized. These discoveries present valuable opportunities for exploring DTSs biosynthesis through genome mining.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are significant terpenoid natural products characterized by their unique C15 bicyclic skeleton. They are produced by various organisms including plants, fungi, bacteria and marine organisms, and exhibit a diverse array of bioactivities. These bioactivities encompass antifeedant, anti&#8208;insecticidal, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;fungal, anti&#8208;viral and anti&#8208;proliferative properties. Some DTSs contribute to the pungent flavor found in herb plants like water pepper, while others serve as active components responsible for the anti&#8208;cancer activities observed in medicinal mushrooms such as (&#8722;)&#8208;antrocin from Antrodia cinnamomea. Recently, DTS synthases have been identified in various organisms, biosynthesizing drimenol, drim&#8208;8&#8208;ene&#8208;11&#8208;ol and (+)&#8208;albicanol, which all possess the characteristic drimane skeleton. Interestingly, despite these enzymes producing chemical molecules with a drimane scaffold, they exhibit minimal amino acid sequence identity across different organisms. This Concept article focuses on the discovery of DTS synthases and the tailoring enzymes generating the chemical diversity of drimane natural products. We summarize and discuss their key features, including the chemical mechanisms, catalytic motifs and functional domains employed by these terpene synthases to generate DTS scaffolds.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Diamond Platelet&#8208;Shaped Zinc Oxide Nanostructures Display Enhanced Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quasi&#8208;diamond platelet&#8208;shaped ZnO (neZnO) nanostructures exhibited enhanced antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (G&#8722;) and Staphylococcus aureus (G+) compared to the quasi&#8208;round particles. The morphology of the material plays an important or determining role in the antimicrobial activity, but not the enrichment of oxygen vacancies in neZnO.







Abstract
The current study compares the antibacterial activity of zinc oxide nanostructures (neZnO). For this purpose, two bacterial strains, Escherichia coli (ATCC 4157) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) were challenged in room light conditions with the aforementioned materials. Colloidal and hydrothermal methods were used to obtain the quasi&#8208;round and quasi&#8208;diamond platelet&#8208;shape nanostructures. Thus, the oxygen vacancy (VO) effects on the surface of neZnO are also considered to assess its effects on antibacterial activity. The neZnO characterization was achieved by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and Raman spectroscopy. The microstructural effects were monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, optical absorption ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry (UV&#8208;Vis) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses complement the physical characterization of these nanostructures; neZnO caused 50&#8201;% inhibition (IC50) at concentrations from 0.064 to 0.072&#8197;mg/mL for S. aureus and from 0.083 to 0.104&#8197;mg/mL for E. coli, indicating an increase in activity against S. aureus compared to E. coli. Consequently, quasi&#8208;diamond platelet&#8208;shaped nanostructures (average particle size of 377.6&#177;10&#8197;nm) showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared to quasi&#8208;round agglomerated particles (average size of 442.8&#177;12&#8197;nm), regardless of Vo presence or absence.

         <title>Nucleoside&#8208;Driven Specificity of DNA Methyltransferase
</title>

Nucleobase binding defines cofactor specificity. In this study, we demonstrate the promiscuous nature of DNA methyltransferases towards novel S&#8208;nucleobase&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SNM) cofactors. Based on enzymatic assays and molecular dynamics, we found that MTaqI is specific for SAM, whereas MHhaI accepts other nucleobases. A detailed investigation of the cofactor binding pocket reveals how nucleobase binding defines cofactor specificity.







Abstract
We have studied the adenosine binding specificities of two bacterial DNA methyltransferases, Taq methyltransferase (M.TaqI), and HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI). While they have similar cofactor binding pocket interactions, experimental data showed different specificity for novel S&#8208;nucleobase&#8208;l&#8208;methionine cofactors (SNMs; N=guanosyl, cytidyl, uridyl). Protein dynamics corroborate the experimental data on the cofactor specificities. For M.TaqI the specificity for S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) is governed by the tight binding on the nucleoside part of the cofactor, while for M.HhaI the degree of freedom of the nucleoside chain allows the acceptance of other bases. The experimental data prove catalytically productive methylation by the M.HhaI binding pocket for all the SNMs. Our results suggest a new route for successful design of unnatural SNM analogues for methyltransferases as a tool for cofactor engineering.

While they have similar cofactor binding pocket interactions, experimental data showed different specificity for novel &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nucleobase-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-methionine cofactors (SNMs; N=guanosyl, cytidyl, uridyl). Protein dynamics corroborate the experimental data on the cofactor specificities. For M.TaqI the specificity for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-methionine (SAM) is governed by the tight binding on the nucleoside part of the cofactor, while for M.HhaI the degree of freedom of the nucleoside chain allows the acceptance of other bases. The experimental data prove catalytically productive methylation by the M.HhaI binding pocket for all the SNMs. Our results suggest a new route for successful design of unnatural SNM analogues for methyltransferases as a tool for cofactor engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Enhanced Control of Enzyme&#8208;Assisted DNA Assembly
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sterically controlled, nuclease enhanced DNA assembly technique successfully assembles DNA structures containing multiple capture probes. Short (60&#8197;bp) DNA stands, with probes attached, are assembled with larger (1&#8197;kb) strands, overcoming the limitations of Gibson assembly, and offering a multiplex diagnostic tool.







Abstract
Traditional methods for the assembly of functionalised DNA structures, involving enzyme restriction and modification, present difficulties when working with small DNA fragments (&lt;100&#8197;bp), in part due to a lack of control over enzymatic action during the DNA modification process. This limits the design flexibility and range of accessible DNA structures. Here, we show that these limitations can be overcome by introducing chemical modifications into the DNA that spatially restrict enzymatic activity. This approach, sterically controlled nuclease enhanced (SCoNE) DNA assembly, thereby circumvents the size limitations of conventional Gibson assembly (GA) and allows the preparation of well&#8208;defined, functionalised DNA structures with multiple probes for specific analytes, such as IL&#8208;6, procalcitonin (PCT), and a biotin reporter group. Notably, when using the same starting materials, conventional GA under typical conditions fails. We demonstrate successful analyte capture based on standard and modified sandwich ELISA and also show how the inclusion of biotin probes provides additional functionality for product isolation.

         <title>Functionalized Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles Based AIE Enabling Effectively Targeting Cancer Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cRGD&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles obtained by chiral self&#8208;assembly with red emission and AIE characteristics could serve as efficient fluorescent probes for targeting cancer cells.







Abstract
We report a fluorescent dye TM by incorporating the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and cholesterol components into perylene bisimides (PBI) derivative. Fluorescence emission spectrum shows that the dye has stable red emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The incorporation of cholesterol components triggers TM to show induced chirality through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The cRGD&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles were prepared by encapsulating fluorescent dyes with amphiphilic polymer matrix. The functionalized fluorescent organic nanoparticles exhibit excellent biocompatibility, large Stokes&#8217; shift and good photostability, which make them effective fluorescent probes for targeting cancer cells with high fluorescence contrast.

         <title>Nucleic Acid Detection through RNA&#8208;Guided Protease Activity in Type III&#8208;E CRISPR&#8208;Cas Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two for one: We have established an assay for nucleic acid detection by using the target ssRNA&#8208;activated protease from the type III&#8208;E CRISPR&#8208;Cas system. This assay would allow simultaneous detection of one or two target genes or viruses, which could be further expanded by incorporating more type III&#8208;E systems of various species. This assay provides an easily adaptable platform for biological and clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
RNA&#8208;guided protease activity was recently discovered in the type III&#8208;E CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems (Craspase), providing a novel platform for engineering a protein probe instead of the commonly used nucleic acid probe in nucleic acid detection assays. Here, by adapting a fluorescence readout technique using the affinity&#8208; and fluorescent protein dual&#8208;tagged Csx30 protein substrate, we have established an assay monitoring Csx30 cleavage by target ssRNA&#8208;activated Craspase. Four Craspase&#8208;based nucleic acid detection systems for genes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), norovirus, and the influenza virus (IFV) were reconstituted with demonstrated specificity. The assay could reliably detect target ssRNAs at concentrations down to 25&#8197;pM, which could be further improved approximately 15&#8201;000&#8208;fold (ca. 2&#8197;fM) by incorporating a recombinase polymerase isothermal preamplification step. Importantly, the species&#8208;specific substrate cleavage specificity of Craspase enabled multiplexed diagnosis, as demonstrated by the reconstituted composite systems for simultaneous detection of two genes from the same virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, spike and nsp12) or two types of viruses (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and IFV). The assay could be further expanded by diversifying the fluorescent tags in the substrate and including Craspase systems from various species, thus potentially providing an easily adaptable platform for clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Amino Acid Residues Controlling Domain Interaction and Interdomain Electron Transfer in Cellobiose Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellobiose dehydrogenase serves as an auxiliary enzyme donating electrons to lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase in biomass depolymerization, as well as a biorecognition element in biosensors due to its electron transfer capability. The involvement of two amino acids in the interdomain electron transfer process is investigated in depth with stopped&#8208;flow spectrophotometry, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, multistate modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
The function of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) in biosensors, biofuel cells, and as a physiological redox partner of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) is based on its role as an electron donor. Before donating electrons to LPMO or electrodes, an interdomain electron transfer from the catalytic FAD&#8208;containing dehydrogenase domain to the electron shuttling cytochrome domain of CDH is required. This study investigates the role of two crucial amino acids located at the dehydrogenase domain on domain interaction and interdomain electron transfer by structure&#8208;based engineering. The electron transfer kinetics of wild&#8208;type Myriococcum thermophilum CDH and its variants M309A, R698S, and M309A/R698S were analyzed by stopped&#8208;flow spectrophotometry and structural effects were studied by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The data show that R698 is essential to pull the cytochrome domain close to the dehydrogenase domain and orient the heme propionate group towards the FAD, while M309 is an integral part of the electron transfer pathway &#8211; its mutation reducing the interdomain electron transfer 10&#8208;fold. Structural models and molecular dynamics simulations pinpoint the action of these two residues on the domain interaction and interdomain electron transfer.

         <title>Generation of Cannabigerolic Acid Derivatives and Their Precursors by Using the Promiscuity of the Aromatic Prenyltransferase NphB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of novel olivetolic acid derivatives with the highly promiscuous prenyltransferase NphB is analyzed as a tool for the creation of synthetic cannabinoid libraries. By using in silico and in&#8197;vitro experiments CBGA derivatives were synthesized and characterized as products of enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
NphB is an aromatic prenyltransferase with high promiscuity for phenolics including flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and plant polyketides. It has been demonstrated that cannabigerolic acid is successfully formed by the reaction catalysed by NphB using geranyl diphosphate and olivetolic acid as substrates. In this study, the substrate specificity of NphB was further determined by using olivetolic acid derivatives as potential substrates for the formation of new synthetic cannabinoids. The derivatives differ in the hydrocarbon chain attached to C6 of the core structure. We performed in silico experiments, including docking of olivetolic acid derivatives, to identify differences in their binding modes. Substrate acceptance was predicted. Based on these results, a library of olivetolic acid derivatives was constructed and synthesized by using different organic synthetic routes. Conversion was monitored in in&#8197;vitro assays with purified NphB versions. For the substrates leading to a high conversion olivetolic acid&#8208;C8, olivetolic acid&#8208;C2 and 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4,6&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid, the products were further elucidated and identified as cannbigerolic acid derivatives. Therefore, these substrates show potential to be adapted in cannabinoid biosynthesis.

     alt="Generation of Cannabigerolic Acid Derivatives and Their Precursors by Using the Promiscuity of the Aromatic Prenyltransferase NphB"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion of novel olivetolic acid derivatives with the highly promiscuous prenyltransferase NphB is analyzed as a tool for the creation of synthetic cannabinoid libraries. By using in silico and in&#8197;vitro experiments CBGA derivatives were synthesized and characterized as products of enzyme catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NphB is an aromatic prenyltransferase with high promiscuity for phenolics including flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and plant polyketides. It has been demonstrated that cannabigerolic acid is successfully formed by the reaction catalysed by NphB using geranyl diphosphate and olivetolic acid as substrates. In this study, the substrate specificity of NphB was further determined by using olivetolic acid derivatives as potential substrates for the formation of new synthetic cannabinoids. The derivatives differ in the hydrocarbon chain attached to C6 of the core structure. We performed in silico experiments, including docking of olivetolic acid derivatives, to identify differences in their binding modes. Substrate acceptance was predicted. Based on these results, a library of olivetolic acid derivatives was constructed and synthesized by using different organic synthetic routes. Conversion was monitored in in&#8197;vitro assays with purified NphB versions. For the substrates leading to a high conversion olivetolic acid-C8, olivetolic acid-C2 and 2-benzyl-4,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid, the products were further elucidated and identified as cannbigerolic acid derivatives. Therefore, these substrates show potential to be adapted in cannabinoid biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extended Biocatalytic Halogenation Cascades Involving a Single&#8208;Polypeptide Regeneration System for Diffusible FADH2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional fusion enzyme with phosphite dehydrogenase and flavin reductase activities has been constructed and characterised. Co&#8208;expression of this single polypeptide regeneration system with tryptophan halogenases and carrier&#8208;free immobilisation in combiCLEAs facilitates preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of halotryptophan from a single cultivation. Extension of the catalytic cascade with a specific dioxygenase enables single cultivation one&#8208;pot synthesis of l&#8208;4&#8208;Cl&#8208;kynurenine on a preparative scale.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases have attracted increasing interest for aryl halogenation at unactivated C&#8722;H positions because they are characterised by high regioselectivity, while requiring only FADH2, halide salts, and O2. Their use in combined crosslinked enzyme aggregates (combiCLEAs) together with an NADH&#8208;dependent flavin reductase and an NADH&#8208;regeneration system for the preparative halogenation of tryptophan and indole derivatives has been previously described. However, multiple cultivations and protein purification steps are necessary for their production. We present a bifunctional regeneration enzyme for two&#8208;step catalytic flavin regeneration using phosphite as an inexpensive sacrificial substrate. This fusion protein proved amenable to co&#8208;expression with various flavin&#8208;dependent Trp&#8208;halogenases and enables carrier&#8208;free immobilisation as combiCLEAs from a single cultivation for protein production and the preparative synthesis of halotryptophan. The scalability of this system was demonstrated by fed&#8208;batch fermentation in bench&#8208;top bioreactors on a 2.5&#8197;L scale. Furthermore, the inclusion of a 6&#8208;halotryptophan&#8208;specific dioxygenase into the co&#8208;expression strain further converts the halogenation product to the kynurenine derivative. This reaction cascade enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of l&#8208;4&#8208;Cl&#8208;kynurenine and its brominated analogue on a preparative scale.

         <title>Trifunctional Saxitoxin Conjugates for Covalent Labeling of Voltage&#8208;Gated Sodium Channels
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifunctional chemical probes derived from the potent shellfish poison, (+)&#8208;saxitoxin (STX), irreversibly inhibit wild&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels (NaVs). Saxitoxin derivatives decorated with a maleimide electrophile and either biotin, a fluorescent dye, or biorthogonal&#8208;reactive group were synthesized and evaluated using whole&#8208;cell, voltage&#8208;clamp electrophysiology.







Abstract
Voltage&#8208;gated sodium ion channels (NaVs) are integral membrane protein complexes responsible for electrical signal conduction in excitable cells. Methods that enable selective labeling of NaVs hold potential value for understanding how channel regulation and post&#8208;translational modification are influenced during development and in response to diseases and disorders of the nervous system. We have developed chemical reagents patterned after (+)&#8208;saxitoxin (STX) &#8211; a potent and reversible inhibitor of multiple NaV isoforms &#8211; and affixed with a reactive electrophile and either a biotin cofactor, fluorophore, or &#8216;click&#8217; functional group for labeling wild&#8208;type channels. Our studies reveal enigmatic structural effects of the probes on the potency and efficiency of covalent protein modification. Among the compounds analyzed, a STX&#8208;maleimide&#8208;coumarin derivative is most effective at irreversibly blocking Na+ conductance when applied to recombinant NaVs and endogenous channels expressed in hippocampal neurons. Mechanistic analysis supports the conclusion that high&#8208;affinity toxin binding is a prerequisite for covalent protein modification. Results from these studies are guiding the development of next&#8208;generation tool compounds for selective modification of NaVs expressed in the plasma membranes of cells.

         <title>Modulating the RAGE&#8208;Induced Inflammatory Response: Peptoids as RAGE Antagonists</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptoids were designed to mimic receptors for advanced glycation end&#8208;products (RAGE) ligand amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) and curtail RAGE inflammatory activation. Here, we reveal the nanomolar binding capability of the peptoid&#8208;based mimics to RAGE and demonstrate their ability to attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine production as well as reduce upregulation of cell surface RAGE at non&#8208;toxic concentrations.







Abstract
While the primary pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by brain deposition of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, chronic inflammation has emerged as an important factor in AD etiology. Upregulated cell surface expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end&#8208;products (RAGE), a key receptor of innate immune response, is reported in AD. In parallel, RAGE ligands, including A&#946; aggregates, HMGB1, and S100B, are elevated in AD brain. Activation of RAGE by these ligands triggers release of inflammatory cytokines and upregulates cell surface RAGE. Despite such observation, there are currently no therapeutics that target RAGE for treatment of AD&#8208;associated neuroinflammation. Peptoids, a novel class of potential AD therapeutics, display low toxicity, facile blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability, and resistance to proteolytic degradation. In the current study, peptoids were designed to mimic A&#946;, a ligand that binds the V&#8208;domain of RAGE, and curtail RAGE inflammatory activation. We reveal the nanomolar binding capability of peptoids JPT1 and JPT1a to RAGE and demonstrate their ability to attenuate lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine production as well as upregulation of RAGE cell surface expression. These results support RAGE antagonist peptoid&#8208;based mimics as a prospective therapeutic strategy to counter neuroinflammation in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Variation of Clasper Scent Gland Composition of Heliconius Butterflies from a Biodiversity Hotspot</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Male Heliconius butterflies, which occur locally in three mimicry groups, show an extremely high diversity of compounds in their clasper scent glands. The more than 1,000 different compounds identified in 17 species are used for species&#8208;specific mixtures of volatile and non&#8208;volatile compounds, presumably used for chemical communication. (Photos: C. Jiggins)







Abstract
Male Heliconius butterflies possess two pheromone emitting structures, wing androconia and abdominal clasper scent glands. The composition of the clasper scent gland of males of 17 Heliconius and Eueides species from an overlapping area in Ecuador, comprising three mimicry groups, was investigated by GC/MS. The chemical signal serves as an anti&#8208;aphrodisiac signal that is transferred from males to females during mating, indicating the mating status of the female to prevent them from harassment by other males. In addition, the odour may also serve in predator defence. There is potential for convergence driven by mimicry, although, such convergence might be detrimental for species recognition of the butterflies within the mimicry ring, making mating more difficult. More than 500 compounds were detected, consisting of volatile, semi&#8208;volatile or non&#8208;volatile compounds, including terpenes, fatty acid esters or aromatic compounds. Several novel esters were identified by GC/MS and GC/IR data, microderivatisation and synthesis, including butyl (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;dodecenoate and other (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;alkenoates, 3&#8208;oxohexyl citronellate and 5&#8208;methylhexa&#8208;3,5&#8208;dienyl (E)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrofarnesoate. The secretions were found to be species specific, potentially allowing for species differentiation. Statistical analysis of the compounds showed differentiation by phylogenetic clade and species, but not by mimicry group.

More than 500 compounds were detected, consisting of volatile, semi-volatile or non-volatile compounds, including terpenes, fatty acid esters or aromatic compounds. Several novel esters were identified by GC/MS and GC/IR data, microderivatisation and synthesis, including butyl (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-3-dodecenoate and other (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-3-alkenoates, 3-oxohexyl citronellate and 5-methylhexa-3,5-dienyl (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2,3-dihydrofarnesoate. The secretions were found to be species specific, potentially allowing for species differentiation. Statistical analysis of the compounds showed differentiation by phylogenetic clade and species, but not by mimicry group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Access to High&#8208;Purity 7mG&#8208;cap RNA in Substantial Quantities by a Convenient All&#8208;Chemical Solid&#8208;Phase Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and valuable all&#8208;chemical method has been developed to synthesize 5&#8217;&#8208;7mGppp RNA on solid&#8208;support without damaging the 7mG&#8208;cap or the RNA during RNA deprotection and release from the support under mild basic conditions. Substantial quantities of high&#8208;purity 5&#8217;&#8208;7mGppp RNA are thus affordable as useful research tools.







Abstract
Given the importance of mRNA with 5&#8217;&#8208;cap, easy access to RNA substrates with different 7mG caps, of high quality and in large quantities is essential to elucidate the roles of RNA and the regulation of underlying processes. In addition to existing synthetic routes to 5&#8217;&#8208;cap RNA based on enzymatic, chemical or chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods, we present here an all&#8208;chemical method for synthetic RNA capping. The novelty of this study lies in the fact that the capping reaction is performed on solid&#8208;support after automated RNA assembly using commercial 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;propionyloxymethyl ribonucleoside phosphoramidites, which enable final RNA deprotection under mild conditions while preserving both 7mG&#8208;cap and RNA integrity. The capping reaction is efficiently carried out between a 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphoroimidazolide RNA anchored on the support and 7mGDP in DMF in the presence of zinc chloride. Substantial amounts of 7mG&#8208;cap RNA (from 1 to 28 nucleotides in length and of any sequence with or without internal methylations) containing various cap structures (7mGpppA, 7mGpppAm, 7mGpppm6A, 7mGpppm6Am, 7mGpppG, 7mGpppGm) were obtained with high purity after IEX&#8208;HPLC purification. This capping method using solid&#8208;phase chemistry is convenient to perform and provides access to valuable RNA substrates as useful research tools to unravel specific issues regarding cap&#8208;related processes.

         <title>Rapid On&#8208;Resin N&#8208;Formylation of Peptides as One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast but not furious. A rapid on&#8208;resin N&#8208;formylation protocol for peptides was developed using formic acid, acetic anhydride, pyridine, and DMF. This method is simple in execution and provides near quantitative yield independent of peptide length and sequence.







Abstract
N&#8208;formylation is a common pre&#8208; and post&#8208;translational modification of the N&#8208;terminus or the lysine side chain of peptides and proteins that plays a role in the initiation of immune responses, gene expression, or epigenetics. Despite its high biological relevance, protocols for the chemical N&#8208;formylation of synthetic peptides are scarce. The few available methods are elaborate in their execution and the yields are highly sequence&#8208;dependent. We present a rapid, easy&#8208;to&#8208;use one&#8208;pot procedure that runs at room temperature and can be used to formylate protected peptides at both the N&#8208;terminus and the lysine side chain on the resin in near&#8208;quantitative yields. Only insensitive, storage&#8208;stable standard chemicals &#8211; formic acid, acetic anhydride, pyridine and DMF &#8211; are used. Formylation works for both short and long peptides of up to 34&#8197;amino acids and over the spectrum of canonical amino acids.

         <title>Front Cover: Extended Biocatalytic Halogenation Cascades Involving a Single&#8208;Polypeptide Regeneration System for Diffusible FADH2 (ChemBioChem 22/2023)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a bifunctional fusion protein for FADH2 regeneration and successfully coexpressed it with different flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases, as well as a dioxygenase that converts 6&#8208;chlorotryptophan to 4&#8208;Cl&#8208;Kynurenine. The figure is a still life of a laboratory bench, with a single oversized E. coli bacterium hovering over an Erlenmeyer flask. Cell disruption is depicted in visual analogy to cracking an egg with the lysate appearing like egg yolk. The lysate in the flask contains all necessary enzymes for the biocatalytic cascade described in the paper rendered as ribbon structures with coloring consistent with the paper. Shown as permanent marker notes on the bench surface are a key reaction scheme as well as a &#8220;ToDo&#8208;list&#8221; that checks off some important goals of the research work. More information can be found in the Research article by N. Montua, N. Sewald.

         <title>Conventional Understanding of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro and Common Strategies for Developing Its Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mutants continue to lower the efficacy of COVID vaccines, the development of antiviral drugs becomes more important. This review focuses on targeting the main protease (Mpro), which is essential for viral replication and transcription. In particular, small&#8208;molecule drugs &#8211; popular for their easy oral administration, convenient storage and transportation, relatively low prices, and ability to act on intracellular targets &#8211; are considered.







Abstract
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic has brought a widespread influence on the world, especially in the face of sudden coronavirus infections, and there is still an urgent need for specific small molecule therapies to cope with possible future pandemics. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), and understanding its structure and lifecycle is beneficial for designing specific drugs of treatment for COVID&#8208;19. The main protease (Mpro) which has conservative and specific advantages is essential for viral replication and transcription. It is regarded as one of the most potential targets for anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 drug development. This review introduces the popular knowledge of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro in drug development and lists a series of design principles and relevant activities of advanced Mpro inhibitors, hoping to provide some new directions and ideas for researchers.

The information on the potential therapeutic effects of terpenoids reviewed here should help to guide researchers in the development of safer and more effective drugs derived from natural terpenoid compounds for managing inflammatory problems.







Abstract
Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is an enzyme that plays a key role in the body&#8216;s inflammatory response. It has been linked to several diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. As potential treatments for these diseases, HNE inhibitors are of great interest. Metabolites derived from plants, particularly terpenoids such as &#946;&#8208;caryophyllene found in black pepper and other plants, and geraniol present in several essential oils, are recognized as significant sources of inhibitors for HNE. Because of their ability to inhibit HNE, terpenoids are considered promising candidates for developing novel therapies to treat inflammatory conditions such as COPD and emphysema. Furthermore, nature can serve as an excellent designer, and it may offer a safer drug candidate for inhibiting HNE production and activity in the future. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta&#8208;Analyses were searched to get relevant and up&#8208;to&#8208;date literature on terpenoids as human neutrophil elastase inhibitors. This review focuses on the isolation, chemical diversity, and inhibition of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) of various terpenoids reported from natural sources up to 2022. A total of 251 compounds from various terpenoids classes have been reported. Further, it also provides a summary of HNE inhibitors and includes a thorough discussion on the structure&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Structural Description of Chiral E&#8208;Tiling DNA Nanotubes with the Chiral Indices (n,m) and Handedness Defined by Microscopic Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral index theory, widely used in carbon nanotubes, has been introduced to describe the chiral structures of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes precisely. In particular, we define a general equation of tube curvature with a clear physical picture by modifying its mathematical definition. Furthermore, we summarize the recent progress on defining the left&#8208; or right&#8208;handedness of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes through differentiating their inside and outside surfaces by fluorescence or electron or atomic force microscopic imaging.







Abstract
In structural DNA nanotechnology, E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes are evidenced to be homogeneous in diameter and thus have great potential in biomedical applications such as cellular transport and communication, transmembrane ion/molecule channeling, and drug delivery. However, a precise structural description of chiral DNA nanotubes with chiral parameters was lacking, thus greatly hindering their application breadth and depth, until we recently raised and partly solved this problem. In this perspective, we summarize recent progress in defining the chiral indices and handedness of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes by microscopic imaging, especially atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Such a detailed understanding of the chiral structures of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes will be very helpful in the future, on the one hand for engineering DNA nanostructures precisely, and, on the other, for realizing specific physicochemical properties and biological functions successfully.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Transfer of Charge, Atoms, and Energy within Isolated Biomolecular Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 22, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we survey mainly experimental but also theoretical work, focusing on radiation&#8208;induced intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular transfer of charge, atoms, and energy within biomolecular systems in the gas phase. Building blocks of DNA, proteins, and saccharides, but also antibiotics are considered. The emergence of general processes as well as their timescales and mechanisms are highlighted.







Abstract
In biological tissues, ionizing radiation interacts with a variety of molecules and the consequences include cell killing and the modification of mechanical properties. Applications of biological radiation action are for instance radiotherapy, sterilization, or the tailoring of biomaterial properties. During the first femtoseconds to milliseconds after the initial radiation action, biomolecular systems typically respond by transfer of charge, atoms, or energy. In the condensed phase, it is usually very difficult to distinguish direct effects from indirect effects. A straightforward solution for this problem is the use of gas&#8208;phase techniques, for instance from the field of mass spectrometry. In this review, we survey mainly experimental but also theoretical work, focusing on radiation&#8208;induced intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular transfer of charge, atoms, and energy within biomolecular systems in the gas phase. Building blocks of DNA, proteins, and saccharides, but also antibiotics are considered. The emergence of general processes as well as their timescales and mechanisms are highlighted.

         <title>Virtual Screening Assisted Search for Inhibitors of the Translocated Intimin Receptor of Enteropathogenic Escherichia Coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study aimed to identify inhibitors of the translocated intimin receptor (Tir) of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). EPEC is an intestinal pathogen that causes diarrhea and is a major health concern worldwide. Because Tir is a key virulence factor involved in EPEC pathogenesis, inhibiting its function is a potential strategy for controlling EPEC infections. Virtual screening was applied to chemical libraries to search for compounds that inhibit Tir&#8208;mediated bacterial adherence to host cells. Three sites were targeted using the cocrystal structure published earlier. A selection of compounds was then assessed in a cell&#8208;based infection model and fluorescence microscopy assay. The results of this study provide a basis for further optimization and testing of Tir inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for EPEC infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Octacosamicin A: Uncommon Starter/extender Units and Product Releasing via Intermolecular Amidation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of octacosamicin A requires uncommon starter and extender units and likely employs an unusual mechanism for product release by catalysing an intermolecular amidation reaction.







Abstract
Octacosamicin A is an antifungal metabolite featuring a linear polyene&#8208;polyol chain flanked by N&#8208;hydroxyguanidine and glycine moieties. We report here that sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations of streptomycin elicited the production of octacosamicin A in Amycolatopsis azurea DSM 43854T. We identified the biosynthetic gene cluster (oca BGC) that encodes a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) system for assembling the polyene&#8208;polyol chain of octacosamicin A. Our analysis suggested that the N&#8208;hydroxyguanidine unit originates from a 4&#8208;guanidinobutyryl&#8208;CoA starter unit, while the PKS incorporates an &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone moiety using a (2R)&#8208;hydroxymalonyl&#8208;CoA extender unit. The modular PKS system contains a non&#8208;canonical terminal module that lacks thioesterase (TE) and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains, indicating the biosynthesis is likely to employ an unconventional and cryptic off&#8208;loading mechanism that attaches glycine to the polyene&#8208;polyol chain via an intermolecular amidation reaction.

The cover shows an artist&#8242;s impression of a cultured macrophage cell, bathed in lipopolysaccharide, depicted as faint wire structures. The cell senses there may be a bacterial infection to address, and forms projections, spreads out along the well bottom, and secretes cytokines. This inflammatory phenotype can be prevented by inhibitors of mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), depicted as space filling structures. Design by B. M. Rabbitts. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. S. Lokey et al.

         <dc:description>
Catcher/Tag pairs enable protein conjugation via an isopeptide&#8208;bond mediated biological Click&#8208;reaction. In this review, we summarize the existing toolbox of Catcher/Tag pairs as well as the currently existing versatile applications of the Catcher/Tag pairs. Finally, we review the pH sensitivity of the reaction and discuss future outlooks towards further improved control and efficiency of the reactions.







Abstract
Manipulating protein architectures beyond genetic control has attracted widespread attention. Catcher/Tag systems enable highly specific conjugation of proteins in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro via an isopeptide&#8208;bond. They provide efficient, robust, and irreversible strategies for protein conjugation and are simple yet powerful tools for a variety of applications in enzyme industry, vaccines, biomaterials, and cellular applications. Here we summarize recent development of the Catcher/Tag toolbox with a particular emphasis on the design of Catcher/Tag pairs targeted for specific applications. We cover the current limitations of the Catcher/Tag systems and discuss the pH sensitivity of the reactions. Finally, we conclude some of the future directions in the development of this versatile protein conjugation method and envision that improved control over inducing the ligation reaction will further broaden the range of applications.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demand for biocompatible, non&#8208;invasive, and continuous real&#8208;time monitoring of organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip has driven the development of a variety of novel sensors. However, highest accuracy and sensitivity can arguably be achieved by integrated biosensing, which enables in situ monitoring of the in vitro microenvironment and dynamic responses of tissues and miniature organs recapitulated in organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip. This paper reviews integrated electrical, electrochemical, and optical sensing methods within organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices and platforms. By affording precise detection of analytes and biochemical reactions, these methods expand and advance the monitoring capabilities and reproducibility of organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip technology. The integration of these sensing techniques allows a deeper understanding of organ functions, and paves the way for important applications such as drug testing, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. By consolidating recent advancements and highlighting challenges in the field, this review aims to foster further research and innovation in the integration of biosensing in organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenolic Substitution in Fidaxomicin: A Semisynthetic Approach to Antibiotic Activity Across Species
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow&#8208;spectrum antibiotic fidaxomicin is active against a small number of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. New antibiotics were synthesized through modification the two phenolic hydroxy groups of fidaxomicin. The authors studied how switching the modification site influenced activity against different bacteria. The cover image depicts an antibiotic exploring a cave filled with stylized bacteria (Clostridioides difficile in blue, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in red, Caulobacter crescentus in green) and was designed by Erik Jung. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Gademann et&#8197;al.

         <title>A Lateral Flow Assay Based on Streptavidin&#8208;biotin Amplification System with Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Rapid and Quantitative Detection of Salmonella enteritidis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salmonella constitutes a prevalent alimentary pathogen, instigating zoonotic afflictions. Consequently, the prompt discernment of Salmonella in sustenance is of cardinal significance. Lateral flow assays utilizing colorimetric methodologies adequately fulfill the prerequisites of point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics, however, their detection threshold remains elevated, generally permitting only qualitative discernment, an impediment to the preliminary screening of nascent pathogens. In response to this conundrum, we propose a lateral flow diagnostic predicated upon a streptavidin&#8208;biotin amplification system with recombinase polymerase amplification engineered for the expeditious and quantitative discernment of Salmonella enteritidis. Trace nucleic acids within a sample undergo exponential amplification via recombinase polymerase amplification to a level discernable, constituting the initial signal amplification. Subsequently, along the test line (T&#8208;line) of the lateral flow strip, the chromatic signal undergoes augmentation by securing a greater quantity of AuNPs through the magnification capacity of the streptavidin&#8208;biotin mechanism, affecting the second signal amplification. Quantitative results are procured via smartphone capture and transferred to computer software for precise calculation of the targeted quantity. The lateral flow strip exhibits a LOD at 19.41 CFU/mL for cultured S. enteritidis. The RSD of three varying concentrations were respectively 3.74%, 5.96%, and 4.25%.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Challenges in Enzymatic Depolymerization and Recycling of PET Wastes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most commonly used plastics in daily life and various industries. Enzymatic depolymerization and recycling of post&#8208;consumer PET (pc&#8208;PET) provides a promising strategy for the sustainable circular economy of polymers. Great protein engineering efforts have been devoted to improving the depolymerization performance of PET hydrolases. In this review, we firstly discuss the mechanisms and challenges of enzymatic PET depolymerization. Subsequently, we summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art engineering of PET hydrolases including rational design, machine learning and directed evolution for improved depolymerization performance, and highlight the advances in screening methods of PET hydrolases. We further discuss several factors that affect the enzymatic depolymerization efficiency. We conclude with our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in bio&#8208;recycling and bio&#8208;upcycling of PET wastes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in RNA&#8208;Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in gene regulation and protein biosynthesis. Interfering the physiological function of key RNAs to induce cell apoptosis holds great promise for cancer treatment. Many RNA&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;cancer strategies have emerged continuously. Among them, RNA interference (RNAi) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic modality for various disease treatments. Nevertheless, the primary obstacle in siRNA delivery&#8208;escaping the endosome and crossing the plasma membrane severely impedes its therapeutic potential. Thus far, a variety of nanosystems as well as carrier&#8208;free bioconjugation for siRNA delivery have been developed and employed to enhance the drug delivery and anti&#8208;tumor efficiency. Besides, the use of small molecules to target specific RNA structures and disrupt their function, along with the covalent modification of RNA, have also drawn tremendous attention recently owing to high therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we will provide an overview of recent progress in RNA&#8208;targeted cancer therapy including various siRNA delivery strategies, RNA&#8208;targeting small molecules, and newly emerged covalent RNA modification. Finally, challenges and future perspectives faced in this research field will be discussed (Figure 1).</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Analyses of DP&#8208;1, a Protein with the Ability To Bind Gold Nanoparticles, by Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting hold of gold: We have identified the DP&#8208;1 fragment (GHAATPEQYGVVTANK), which binds AuNPs and disperses them in solution. Structural analyses by solution NMR spectroscopy indicated that gold&#8208;binding peptide interacted with AuNPs through negatively charged residues and controlled the growth of the gold crystals.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), consisting of metallic gold, are applied in various fields owing to their characteristic physical properties. Collimonas sp. D&#8208;25 (D&#8208;25) is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium obtained from soil, compost, and other environmental materials in the Akita Prefecture. DP&#8208;1 is a water&#8208;soluble protein found in D&#8208;25 that binds specifically to AuNPs and retains them with high stability. This study aimed to identify the part of DP&#8208;1 that interacts with AuNPs and determine its 3D structure in solution using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Peptide fragments obtained by trypsin digestion were examined for their AuNP&#8208;binding capacity to determine the key Au&#8208;binding domain of DP&#8208;1. A fragment consisting of 16 amino acid residues (GHAATPEQYGVVTANK) was identified as the peptide with the highest binding activity. Structural analyses of this peptide indicated that the main chain was elongated, and negatively charged residues in the side chain were exposed on the surface by incorporating AuNPs. These results suggest that DP&#8208;1 interacts with AuNPs through negatively charged residues and extended hydrophobic residues for protein&#8211;protein interactions. The structural data also provide new insights into biomimetic technologies.

         <title>Unlocking The Mysteries of DNA Adducts with Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the experimental approaches are evolving, parallel computational efforts are indispensable to decode DNA adducts. This review accentuates AI's potential in various adduct biology aspects, including novel adduct identification, parent genotoxin associations, formation mechanisms, site of metabolism prediction, and genomic positioning.







Abstract
Cellular genome is considered a dynamic blueprint of a cell since it encodes genetic information that gets temporally altered due to various endogenous and exogenous insults. Largely, the extent of genomic dynamicity is controlled by the trade&#8208;off between DNA repair processes and the genotoxic potential of the causative agent (genotoxins or potential carcinogens). A subset of genotoxins form DNA adducts by covalently binding to the cellular DNA, triggering structural or functional changes that lead to significant alterations in cellular processes via genetic (e.&#8201;g., mutations) or non&#8208;genetic (e.&#8201;g., epigenome) routes. Identification, quantification, and characterization of DNA adducts are indispensable for their comprehensive understanding and could expedite the ongoing efforts in predicting carcinogenicity and their mode of action. In this review, we elaborate on using Artificial Intelligence (AI)&#8208;based modeling in adducts biology and present multiple computational strategies to gain advancements in decoding DNA adducts. The proposed AI&#8208;based strategies encompass predictive modeling for adduct formation via metabolic activation, novel adducts&#8217; identification, prediction of biochemical routes for adduct formation, adducts&#8217; half&#8208;life predictions within biological ecosystems, and, establishing methods to predict the link between adducts chemistry and its location within the genomic DNA. In summary, we discuss some futuristic AI&#8208;based approaches in DNA adduct biology.

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA with DNAzyme Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNAzymes (Dz) 10&#8211;23 were optimized to cleave three RNA targets having different folding energies. The optimized Dzs can have RNA&#8208;binding arms with a melting temperature much higher than the reaction temperature. The article discusses this phenomenon and suggests changes in the Dz optimization workflow to achieve optimal Dz catalytic activity in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Cleavage of biological mRNA by DNAzymes (Dz) has been proposed as a variation of oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT). The design of Dz&#8208;based OGT agents includes computational prediction of two RNA&#8208;binding arms with low affinity (melting temperatures (Tm) close to the reaction temperature of 37&#8201;&#176;C) to avoid product inhibition and maintain high specificity. However, RNA cleavage might be limited by the RNA binding step especially if the RNA is folded in secondary structures. This calls for the need for two high&#8208;affinity RNA&#8208;binding arms. In this study, we optimized 10&#8211;23 Dz&#8208;based OGT agents for cleavage of three RNA targets with different folding energies under multiple turnover conditions in 2&#8197;mM Mg2+ at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Unexpectedly, one optimized Dz had each RNA&#8208;binding arm with a Tm &#8805;60&#8201;&#176;C, without suffering from product inhibition or low selectivity. This phenomenon was explained by the folding of the RNA cleavage products into stable secondary structures. This result suggests that Dz with long (high affinity) RNA&#8208;binding arms should not be excluded from the candidate pool for OGT agents. Rather, analysis of the cleavage products&#8217; folding should be included in Dz selection algorithms. The Dz optimization workflow should include testing with folded rather than linear RNA substrates.

         <title>Interrogating Aptamer Chemical Space Through Modified Nucleotide Substitution Facilitated by Enzymatic DNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically modified aptamers are typically obtained through SELEX with unnatural nucleotides. If binding affinity or specificity falls short, re&#8208;selection or post&#8208;SELEX methods that are often time&#8208;consuming or synthetically challenging become necessary. To address these issues, we present a chemoenzymatic method for further aptamer modification. Here, we substituted the cubane&#8208;side chains of a previously identified aptamer with bioisosteres and modified cubane moieties using polymerase&#8208;mediated synthesis. This method offers a practical way to streamline post&#8208;SELEX optimization efforts. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Hollenstein et al.

Trihydroxypiperidine iminosugars featured with orthoester moieties double the enzymatic activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) in L444P/L444P mutated fibroblasts, responsible for the neuropathic form of Gaucher Disease







Abstract
Engineering bioactive iminosugars with pH&#8208;responsive groups is an emerging approach to develop pharmacological chaperones (PCs) able to improve lysosomal trafficking and enzymatic activity rescue of mutated enzymes. The use of inexpensive l&#8208;malic acid allowed introduction of orthoester units into the lipophilic chain of an enantiomerically pure iminosugar affording only two diastereoisomers contrary to previous related studies. The iminosugar was prepared stereoselectively from the chiral pool (d&#8208;mannose) and chosen as the lead bioactive compound, to develop novel candidates for restoring the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. The stability of orthoester&#8208;appended iminosugars was studied by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy both in neutral and acidic environments, and the loss of inhibitory activity with time in acid medium was demonstrated on cell lysates. Moreover, the ability to rescue GCase activity in the lysosomes as the result of a chaperoning effect was explored. A remarkable pharmacological chaperone activity was measured in fibroblasts hosting the homozygous L444P/L444P mutation, a cell line resistant to most PCs, besides the more commonly responding N370S mutation.

         <title>An Enzymatic Cofactor Regeneration System for the in&#8208;Vitro Reduction of Isolated C=C Bonds by Geranylgeranyl Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferredoxin from Archaeoglobus fulgidus has been identified that regenerates the cofactor in the corresponding geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR) for the reduction of isolated C=C bonds. The reaction was coupled to an unspecific ferredoxin reductase from E.&#8197;coli and a glucose dehydrogenase/glucose regeneration system for NAD(P)+ to enable reactions with purified enzymes. Moreover, reactions can be performed in E.&#8197;coli cell&#8208;free extracts.







Abstract
Cofactor regeneration systems are of major importance for the applicability of oxidoreductases in biocatalysis. Previously, geranylgeranyl reductases have been investigated for the enzymatic reduction of isolated C=C bonds.

     alt="An Enzymatic Cofactor Regeneration System for the in-Vitro Reduction of Isolated C=C Bonds by Geranylgeranyl Reductases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ferredoxin from &lt;i&gt;Archaeoglobus fulgidus&lt;/i&gt; has been identified that regenerates the cofactor in the corresponding geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR) for the reduction of isolated C=C bonds. The reaction was coupled to an unspecific ferredoxin reductase from &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; and a glucose dehydrogenase/glucose regeneration system for NAD(P)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to enable reactions with purified enzymes. Moreover, reactions can be performed in &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; cell-free extracts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cofactor regeneration systems are of major importance for the applicability of oxidoreductases in biocatalysis. Previously, geranylgeranyl reductases have been investigated for the enzymatic reduction of isolated C=C bonds. However, an enzymatic cofactor-regeneration system for in&#8197;vitro use is lacking. In this work, we report a ferredoxin from the archaea &lt;i&gt;Archaeoglobus fulgidus&lt;/i&gt; that regenerates the flavin of the corresponding geranylgeranyl reductase. The proteins were heterologously produced, and the regeneration was coupled to a ferredoxin reductase from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and a glucose dehydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, thereby enabling the reduction of isolated C=C bonds by purified enzymes. The system was applied in crude, cell-free extracts and gave conversions comparable to those of a previous method using sodium dithionite for cofactor regeneration. Hence, an enzymatic approach to the reduction of isolated C=C bonds can be coupled with common systems for the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactors, thereby opening new perspectives for the application of geranylgeranyl reductases in biocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Environmentally Friendly Degradation and Detoxification of Rifampicin by a Bacterial Laccase and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibiotics are micropollutants accumulating in our rivers and wastewaters, potentially leading to bacterial antibiotic resistance, a worldwide problem to which there is no current solution. Here, we have developed an environmentally friendly two&#8208;step process to transform the antibiotic rifampicin (RIF) into non&#8208;antimicrobial compounds. The process involves an enzymatic oxidation step by the bacterial CotA&#8208;laccase and a hydrogen peroxide bleaching step. NMR identified rifampicin quinone as the main product of the enzymatic oxidation. Growth of Escherichia coli strains in the presence of final degradation products (FP) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements confirmed that FP are non&#8208;anti&#8208;microbial compounds, and bioassays suggest that FP is not toxic to eukaryotic organisms. Moreover, competitive fitness assays between susceptible and RIF&#8208;resistant bacteria show that susceptible bacteria is strongly favoured in the presence of FP. Our results show that we have developed a robust and environmentally friendly process to effectively remediate rifampicin from antibiotic contaminated environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrin Facilitates the Internalization of TAT Peptide Conjugated to RGD Motif in Model Lipid Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, targeted drug delivery has attracted a great interest for enhanced therapeutic efficiency, with diminished side effects, especially in cancer therapy. Cell penetrating peptides like HIV1&#8208;TAT peptide, appear to be the perfect vectors for translocating drugs or other cargoes across the plasma membrane, but their application is limited mostly due to insufficient specificity for intended targets. The tripeptide motif RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartate), found in extracellular matrix proteins has high affinity for integrin receptors overexpressed in cancer and it is involved in different phases of disease progression, including proliferation, invasion and migration. Discovery of new peptides with high binding affinity for disease receptors and permeability of plasma membranes is desirable for both, development of targeted drug delivery systems and early detection and diagnosis. To complement the TAT peptide with specific targeting ability, we conjugated it with an integrin&#8208;binding RGD motif. In this paper&#160;we describe the permeability abilities and specificity for integrin receptor of RGD&#8208;TAT peptides in model membranes. Our findings reveal that RGD&#8208;TAT peptide maintains its ability to permeate lipid membranes and exhibits specificity for integrin receptors embedded in giant unilamellar vesicles. This promising outcome suggests that the&#160;peptide has significant potential for aplications in targeted drug delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of NSD2&#8208;Degraders from Novel and Selective DEL Hits</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries were employed to screen billions of molecules against the histone methyltransferase NSD2. Hits were identified against the PWWP1 domain of NSD2. One chemotype was converted into a VHL1/EloB/EloC E3 ligase PROTAC, which demonstrated selective and on target degradation of NSD2 in cells. The binding MoA of compounds was elucidated by molecular docking and validated by subsequent single&#8208;point mutation studies. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. L. Andersson, P. A. C. Cloos et al.

         <title>Immunological Quantitation of the Glycation Site Lysine&#8208;414 in Serum Albumin in Human Plasma Samples by Indirect ELISA Using Highly Specific Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycation sites on human serum albumin (HSA) appear to be potential biomarkers for diabetes mellitus. In contrast to previous mass spectrometry techniques, immunoassays including ELISA using specific and sensitive antibodies directed against the glycation site (e.g. Lys414) are suitable for high&#8208;throughput screening and thus for routine laboratory analysis.







Abstract
Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder that is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, is common throughout the world and its prevalence is steadily increasing. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent acute complications and life&#8208;threatening long&#8208;term organ damage. Glycation sites in human serum albumin (HSA) are considered to be promising biomarkers of systemic glycemic status. This work aimed to develop a sensitive and clinically applicable ELISA for the quantification of glycation site Lys414 in HSA (HSAK414). The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated by immunizing mice with a glycated peptide. The established indirect ELISA based on mAb 50D8 (IgG1 isotype) yielded a limit of detection of 0.39&#8197;nmol/g HSA for HSAK414 with a linear dynamic range from 0.50 to 6.25&#8197;nmol/g glycated HSA. The inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;day assays with coefficients of variation less than 20&#8201;% indicated good assay performance and precision. Assay evaluation was based on plasma samples from diabetic and non&#8208;diabetic subjects with known HSAK414 glycation levels previously determined by LC&#8211;MS. Both data sets correlated very well. In conclusion, the generated mAb 50D8 and the established ELISA could be a valuable tool for the rapid quantitation of glycation site HSAK414 in plasma samples to evaluate its clinical relevance.

A Sinomenine&#8208;indole pseudo&#8208;natural product, termed Inducin, increases LC3 lipidation independently of canonical autophagy and impairs lysosomal function leading to Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)&#8208;dependent membrane repair ultimately leading to cell death.

Lipidation of the LC3 protein has frequently been employed as a marker of autophagy. However, LC3&#8208;lipidation is also triggered by stimuli not related to canonical autophagy. Therefore, characterization of the driving parameters for LC3 lipidation is crucial to understanding the biological roles of LC3. We identified a pseudo&#8208;natural product, termed Inducin, that increases LC3 lipidation independently of canonical autophagy, impairs lysosomal function and rapidly recruits Galectin 3 to lysosomes. Inducin treatment promotes Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)&#8208;dependent membrane repair and transcription factor EB (TFEB)&#8208;dependent lysosome biogenesis ultimately leading to cell death.

         <title>Dissection of MKK6 and p38 Signaling Using Light&#8208;Activated Protein Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying stress&#8208;activated signaling is challenging, because stress conditions induce adaptation and impose selection pressure. Applying an optogenetic system to express light&#8208;activated p38&#945; or its upstream activator, MKK6, the functional roles of these kinases in dynamic signaling programs are clarified.







Abstract
Stress&#8208;activated signaling pathways orchestrate cellular behaviors and fates. Studying the precise role(s) of stress&#8208;activated protein kinases is challenging, because stress conditions induce adaptation and impose selection pressure. To meet this challenge, we have applied an optogenetic system with a single plasmid to express light&#8208;activated p38&#945; or its upstream activator, MKK6, in conjunction with live&#8208;cell fluorescence microscopy. In starved cells, decaging of constitutively active p38&#945; or MKK6 by brief exposure to UV light elicits rapid p38&#8208;mediated signaling, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and apoptosis with different kinetics. In parallel, light activation of p38&#945; also suppresses autophagosome formation, similarly to stimulation with growth factors that activate PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling. Active MKK6 negatively regulates serum&#8208;induced ERK activity, which is p38&#8208;independent as previously reported. Here, we reproduce that result with the one plasmid system and show that although decaging active p38&#945; does not reduce basal ERK activity in our cells, it can block growth factor&#8208;stimulated ERK signaling in serum&#8208;starved cells. These results clarify the roles of MKK6 and p38&#945; in dynamic signaling programs, which act in concert to actuate apoptotic death while suppressing cell survival mechanisms.

         <title>Application of Vitreoscilla Hemoglobin as a Green and Efficient Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of Benzoxazoles in Water</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new efficient and green biocatalysis system was reported for the synthesis of benzoxazoles catalyzed by Vitreoscilla hemoglobin. High yields of desired products (up to 94&#8201;%) were obtained under mild conditions within 1&#8197;h in water. A gram&#8208;scale reaction was also successfully conducted. This strategy also extends the application of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin in non&#8208;natural reactions and green biocatalysis.







Abstract
We report an efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method for the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of benzoxazoles in water at room temperature. tert&#8208;Butyl hydroperoxide and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy were used as oxidant and radical scavenger, respectively. A total of 27 functionally diverse benzoxazoles were prepared in moderate to high yields (62&#8201;%&#8208;94&#8201;%) by the annulation reaction of phenols with amines in the presence of VHb in 1&#8197;h. Thus, this method is highly viable for practical applications. This work broadens the application of hemoglobin to organic synthesis.

         <title>Orthogonal End Labelling of Oligonucleotides through Dual Incorporation of Click&#8208;Reactive NTP Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemoenzymatic method involving dual incorporation of &#947;&#8208; and 3&#8242;&#8208;modified NTPs allows sequential 5&#8242;&#8208; and 3&#8242;&#8208;end labelling of DNA and RNA molecules.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of nucleic acid structures with clickable functionality is a versatile tool that facilitates many emerging applications, including immune evasion, enhancements in stability, fluorescent labelling, chemical 5&#8242;&#8208;RNA&#8208;capping and the development of functional aptamers. While certain chemoenzymatic approaches for 3&#8242;&#8208;azido and alkynyl labelling are known, equivalent 5&#8242;&#8208;strategies are either inefficient, complex, or require harsh chemical conditions. Here, we present a modular and facile technology to consecutively modify DNA and RNA strands at both ends with click&#8208;modifiable functional groups. Our approach using &#947;&#8208;modified ATP analogues facilitates T4&#8197;PNK&#8208;catalysed 5&#8242;&#8208;modification of oligonucleotides, a process that is compatible with TdT&#8208;catalysed 3&#8242;&#8208;elongation using 3&#8242;&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;ddGTP. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for both oligo&#8208;oligo ligations, as well ssDNA circularization. We anticipate that such approaches will pave the way for the synthesis of highly functionalised oligonucleotides, improving the therapeutic and diagnostic applicability of oligonucleotides such as in the realm of next&#8208;generation sequencing.

         <title>Investigation Of The Biosynthesis Pathway That Generates cis&#8208;Jasmone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GC MS/MS experiments using deuterium&#8208;labelled methyl jasmonate, methyl 4,5&#8208;didehydro&#8208;jasmonate, and methyl 3,7&#8208;didehydro&#8208;jasmonate. The compounds were provided by air propagation, and the biosynthetic pathways identified to produce jasmonic acid and cis&#8208;jasmone were separate and independent in Mentha suavelons.







Abstract
Researchers have established that (+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid ((+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA) is an intermediate in the production of cis&#8208;jasmone (CJ); however, the biosynthetic pathway of CJ has not been fully described. Previous reports stated that CJ, a substructure of pyrethrin II produced by pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium), is not biosynthesized through this biosynthetic pathway. To clarify the ambiguity, stable isotope&#8208;labelled jasmonates were synthesized, and compounds were applied to apple mint (Mentha suaveolens) via air propagation. The results showed that cis&#8208;jasmone is not generated from intermediate (+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA, and (+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA is not produced from 3,7&#8208;dideydro&#8208;JA (3,7&#8208;ddh&#8208;JA); however, 3,7&#8208;didehydro&#8208;JA and 4,5&#8208;didehydro&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA were converted into CJ and JA, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Content Image&#8208;Based Screening and Deep Learning for the Detection of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drug Leads</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our screen, compound&#8208;treated macrophages are either stimulated with LPS or not, then fixed, stained, and imaged. Control images are used to train a deep learning algorithm to identify which compounds are associated with the unstimulated phenotype in the presence of LPS. Hits were explored with a single&#8208;cell linear classifier and cytokine panels.







Abstract
We developed a high&#8208;content image&#8208;based screen that utilizes the pro&#8208;inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and murine macrophages (RAW264.7) with the goal of enabling the identification of novel anti&#8208;inflammatory lead compounds. We screened 2,259 bioactive compounds with annotated mechanisms of action (MOA) to identify compounds that block the LPS&#8208;induced phenotype in macrophages. We utilized a set of seven fluorescence microscopy probes to generate images that were used to train and optimize a deep neural network classifier to distinguish between unstimulated and LPS&#8208;stimulated macrophages. The top hits from the deep learning classifier were validated using a linear classifier trained on individual cells and subsequently investigated in a multiplexed cytokine secretion assay. All 12 hits significantly modulated the expression of at least one cytokine upon LPS stimulation. Seven of these were allosteric inhibitors of the mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2) and showed similar effects on cytokine expression. This deep learning morphological assay identified compounds that modulate the innate immune response to LPS and may aid in identifying new anti&#8208;inflammatory drug leads.

&lt;p&gt;In our screen, compound-treated macrophages are either stimulated with LPS or not, then fixed, stained, and imaged. Control images are used to train a deep learning algorithm to identify which compounds are associated with the unstimulated phenotype in the presence of LPS. Hits were explored with a single-cell linear classifier and cytokine panels.

         <title>CoFeSe2@DMSA@FA nanocatalyst for amplification of oxidative stress to achieve multimodal tumor therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomedicine has significantly advanced precise tumor therapy, providing essential technical blessing for active drug accumulation, targeted consignment, and mitigation of noxious side effects. To enhance anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, the integration of multiple therapeutic modalities has garnered significant attention. Here, we designed an innovative CoFeSe2@DMSA@FA nanocatalyst with Se vacancies (abbreviated as CFSDF), which exhibits synergistic chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), leading to amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced photothermal effects. The multifunctional CFSDF nanocatalyst exhibits the remarkable ability to catalyze the Fenton reaction within the acidic tumor microenvironment, efficiently converting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly harmful hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). Moreover, the nanocatalyst effectively diminishes GSH levels and ameliorates intracellular oxidative stress. The incorporation of FA modification enables CFSDF to evade immune detection and selectively target tumor tissues. Numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations have consistently demonstrated that CFSDF optimizes its individual advantages and significantly enhances therapeutic efficiency through synergistic effects of multiple therapeutic modalities, offering a valuable and effective approach for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Preferential Binding of a Red Emissive Julolidine Derivative to a Promoter G&#8208;quadruplex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The therapeutic potential of G&#8208;quadruplexes has increased significantly with the growing understanding of its functional roles in pathogens apart from human diseases such as cancer. Here, we report the synthesis of three julolidine&#8208;based molecules and their binding to nucleic acids. Among the synthesized molecules, compound 1 exhibited red emissive fluorescence with a distinct preference for Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex. The binding of compound 1 to Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex, initially identified through a fluorescence&#8208;based screening, was further confirmed by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism&#8208;based experiments. Thermal denaturation of compound 1 in the presence of Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex revealed a concentration&#8208;dependent stabilization (~ 10.0 &#176;C at 1:3 stoichiometry).&#160; Fluorescence&#8208;based experiments revealed 1:1 stoichiometry of the interaction and an association constant (Ka) of 5.67 &#215; 106 M&#8208;1. CD experiments displayed that the parallel conformation of the G&#8208;quadruplex was retained on compound 1&#8217;s binding and signs of higher order binding/complex formation were observed at high compound 1 to DNA ratio. Molecular docking studies revealed the dominance of stacking and van der Waals interactions in the molecular recognition which was aided by some close&#8208;distance interactions involving the quinolinium nitrogen atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterial Isothiocyanate Biosynthesis by Rhodanese&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfur Transfer onto Isonitriles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products bearing isothiocyanate (ITC) groups are an important group of specialized metabolites that play various roles in health, nutrition, and ecology. Whereas ITC biosynthesis via glucosinolates in plants has been studied in detail, there is a gap in understanding the bacterial route to specialized metabolites with such reactive heterocumulene groups, as in the antifungal sinapigladioside from Burkholderia gladioli. Here we propose an alternative ITC pathway by enzymatic sulfur transfer onto isonitriles catalyzed by rhodanese&#8208;like enzymes (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferases). Mining the B. gladioli genome revealed six candidate genes (rhdA&#8211;F), which were individually expressed in E. coli. By means of a synthetic probe, the gene products were evaluated for their ability to produce the key ITC intermediate in the sinapigladioside pathway. In vitro biotransformation assays identified RhdE, a prototype single&#8208;domain rhodanese, as the most potent ITC synthase. Interestingly, while RhdE also efficiently transforms cyanide into thiocyanate, it shows high specificity for the natural pathway intermediate, indicating that the sinapigladioside pathway has recruited a ubiquitous detoxification enzyme for the formation of a bioactive specialized metabolite. These findings not only elucidate an elusive step in bacterial ITC biosynthesis but also reveals an overlooked function of rhodanese&#8208;like enzymes.</dc:description>

Exploring Interactions: Catechol Molecules and Amyloid Proteins. This review delves into intricate mutual interactions between catechol&#8208;containing molecules and aggregation&#8208;prone proteins. While previous research has primarily focused on unidirectional interactions, we examine their multifaceted dynamics, shedding light on chemical insights and three&#8208;dimensional orientations that may unlock undiscovered roles in supramolecular structures.







Abstract
This review introduces multifaceted mutual interactions between molecules containing a catechol moiety and aggregation&#8208;prone proteins. The complex relationships between these two molecular species have previously been elucidated primarily in a unidirectional manner, as demonstrated in cases involving the development of catechol&#8208;based inhibitors for amyloid aggregation and the elucidation of the role of functional amyloid fibers in melanin biosynthesis. This review aims to consolidate scattered clues pertaining to catechol&#8208;based amyloid inhibitors, functional amyloid scaffold of melanin biosynthesis, and chemically designed peptide fibers for providing chemical insights into the role of the local three&#8208;dimensional orientation of functional groups in manifesting such interactions. These orientations may play crucial, yet undiscovered, roles in various supramolecular structures.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange Kinetics and Redox Potential of the Coenzyme M and Coenzyme B Heterodisulfide, an Electron Acceptor Coupled to Energy Conservation in Methanogenic Archaea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterodisulfide CoB&#8722;S&#8722;S&#8722;CoM is a central redox cofactor for energy conservation in methanogenesis and methane oxidation, and its redox potential is a key value to detangle the associated processes. We analysed its thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange kinetics and deduced its standard redox potentials from equilibrium mixtures that were quantified via 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea play important roles in the global carbon cycle by interconverting CO2 and methane. To conserve energy from these metabolic pathways that happen close to the thermodynamic equilibrium, specific electron carriers have evolved to balance the redox potentials between key steps. Reduced ferredoxins required to activate CO2 are provided by energetical coupling to the reduction of the high&#8208;potential heterodisulfide (HDS) of coenzyme M (2&#8208;mercaptoethanesulfonate) and coenzyme B (7&#8208;mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate). While the standard redox potential of this important HDS has been determined previously to be &#8722;143&#8197;mV (Tietze et&#8197;al. 2003 DOI: 10.1002/cbic.200390053), we have measured thiol disulfide exchange kinetics and reassessed this value by equilibrating thiol&#8208;disulfide mixtures of coenzyme M, coenzyme B, and mercaptoethanol. We determined the redox potential of the HDS of coenzyme M and coenzyme B to be &#8722;16.4&#177;1.7&#8197;mV relative to the reference thiol mercaptoethanol (E0&#8217;=&#8722;264&#8197;mV). The resulting E0&#8217; values are &#8722;281&#8197;mV for the HDS, &#8722;271&#8197;mV for the homodisulfide of coenzyme M, and &#8722;270&#8197;mV for the homodisulfide of coenzyme B. We discuss the importance of these updated values for the physiology of methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea and their implications in terms of energy conservation.

         <title>Inhibition of Aurora&#8208;A/N&#8208;Myc protein&#8211;protein interaction using peptidomimetics: Understanding the role of peptide cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using N&#8208;Myc61&#8208;89 as a starting template we showcase the systematic use of truncation and maleimide constraining to develop peptidomimetic inhibitors of the N&#8208;Myc/Aurora&#8208;A protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI); a potential anticancer drug discovery target. The most promising of these &#8211; N&#8208;Myc73&#8208;94&#8208;N85C/G89C&#8208;mal, is shown to favour a more Aurora&#8208;A compliant binding ensemble in comparison to the linear wild&#8208;type sequence as observed through fluorescence anisotropy competition assays, circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Further in silico investigation of this peptide in its Aurora&#8208;A bound state, by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, imply (i) the bound conformation is more stable as a consequence of the constraint, which likely suppresses dissociation and (ii) the constraint may make further stabilizing interactions with the Aurora&#8208;A surface. Taken together this work unveils the first orthosteric N&#8208;Myc/Aurora&#8208;A inhibitor and provides useful insights on the biophysical properties and thus design of constrained peptides, an attractive therapeutic modality.</dc:description>

         <title>Interrogating Aptamer Chemical Space Through Modified Nucleotide Substitution Facilitated by Enzymatic DNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;SELEX modification of aptamers allows to improve their performance but comes at the cost of uncertain and labor&#8208;intensive structure activity relationship studies. Here, we have evaluated the possibility of improving a previously reported, chemically modified aptamer by combining enzymatic synthesis and nucleotides bearing bioisosteres of the parent cubane side&#8208;chains or substituted cubane moieties. This method lowers the synthetic burden associated with post&#8208;SELEX approaches and allowed to identify one additional sequence that maintains binding to the PvLDH target protein, albeit with reduced specificity.







Abstract
Chemical modification of aptamers is an important step to improve their performance and stability in biological media. This can be performed either during their identification (mod&#8208;SELEX) or after the in&#8197;vitro selection process (post&#8208;SELEX). In order to reduce the complexity and workload of the post&#8208;SELEX modification of aptamers, we have evaluated the possibility of improving a previously reported, chemically modified aptamer by combining enzymatic synthesis and nucleotides bearing bioisosteres of the parent cubane side&#8208;chains or substituted cubane moieties. This method lowers the synthetic burden often associated with post&#8208;SELEX approaches and allowed to identify one additional sequence that maintains binding to the PvLDH target protein, albeit with reduced specificity. In addition, while bioisosteres often improve the potency of small molecule drugs, this does not extend to chemically modified aptamers. Overall, this versatile method can be applied for the post&#8208;SELEX modification of other aptamers and functional nucleic acids.

         <title>Prodrug&#8208;Type Phosphotriester Oligonucleotides with Linear Disulfide Promoieties Responsive to Reducing Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prodrug&#8208;type phosphotriester&#8208;modified oligonucleotide bearing linear disulfide promoiety can be converted quickly into an unmodified oligonucleotide in a glutathione&#8208;based intracellular mimetic reducing environment. The modification enhances the stability in serum and promotes the cellular uptake of oligonucleotide. In addition, the gapmer bearing linear disulfide promoieties can exhibit gene silencing activity.







Abstract
Various chemical modifications have been developed to create new antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) for clinical applications. Our previously designed prodrug&#8208;type phosphotriester&#8208;modified oligonucleotide with cyclic disulfides (cyclic SS PTE ON) can be converted into unmodified ON in an intracellular&#8208;mimetic reducing environment. However, the conversion rate of the cyclic SS PTE ON was very low, and the AON with cyclic SS PTE modifications showed much weaker antisense activity than corresponding to the fully phosphorothioate&#8208;modified AON. In this study, we synthesized several types of PTE ONs containing linear disulfides (linear SS PTE ONs) and evaluated their conversion rates under reducing conditions. From the results, the structural requirements for the conversion of the synthesized linear SS PTE ONs were elucidated. Linear SS PTE ON with promising promoieties showed a nuclease resistance up to 4.8&#8208;fold compared to unmodified ON and a cellular uptake by endocytosis without any transfection reagent. In addition, although the knockdown activity of the linear SS PTE gapmer AON is weaker than that of the fully phosphorothioate&#8208;modified gapmer AON, the knockdown activity is slightly stronger than that of the cyclic SS PTE gapmer AON. These results suggest that the conversion rates may be related to the expression of the antisense activity.

         <title>Development of Ruthenium Nanophotocages with Red or Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Concept overviews the latest research progress in Ru nanophotocages, including design principles, photocaging efficacy, photoactivation mechanisms, and their potential biomedical applications. Questions and challenges regarding their synthesis, characterization, and applications are discussed. The direction of further development of Ru nanophotocage is also proposed, which may stimulate the research interest and further promote the development of this field.







Abstract
The development of light&#8208;triggered ruthenium (Ru) nanophotocages has revolutionized conventional methods of drug administration, thereby facilitating cancer therapy in a noninvasive and temperate manner. Ru nanophotocages employ a distinct approach known as photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT), wherein light&#8208;induced ligand dissociation yields a toxic metal complex or a ligand capable of performing other functions such as optically controlled protein degradation and drug delivery. Simultaneously, this process is accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which serve as an effective anticancer agent in combination with PACT and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Due to its exceptional attributes of extended tissue penetration, and minimized tissue damage, red light or near&#8208;infrared light is widely acknowledged as the &#8220;phototherapeutic window&#8221; (650&#8211;900&#8197;nm). In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent advancements in Ru nanophotocages within the phototherapeutic range. Diverse aspects, including design principles, photocaging efficacy, photoactivation mechanisms, and potential applications in the field of biomedical chemistry, are discussed. Questions and challenges regarding their synthesis, characterization, and applications are also discussed. This Concept would foster further exploration into the realm of Ru nanophotocages.

         <title>Interfacing Whole Cell Biocatalysis with a Biocompatible Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction for One&#8208;Pot Syntheses of Tetrahydroisoquinolines and Tryptolines
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous Pictet&#8208;Spengler annulation has been interfaced with whole&#8208;cell alcohol oxidation. This one&#8208;pot cascade reaction converts aliphatic alcohols and tyramines or tryptamines into alkaloid heterocycles under mild, aqueous conditions, delivering tetrahydroisouinolines and tryptolines in &gt;90&#8201;% and &gt;40&#8201;% isolated yield, respectively, with excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
Biocatalytic processes are highly selective and specific. However, their utility is limited by the comparatively narrow scope of enzyme&#8208;catalysed transformations. To expand product scope, we are developing biocompatible processes that combine biocatalytic reactions with chemo&#8208;catalysis in single&#8208;flask processes. Here, we show that a chemocatalysed Pictet&#8208;Spengler annulation can be interfaced with biocatalysed alcohol oxidation. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot cascade reaction converts tyramine and aliphatic alcohols to tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids in aqueous buffer at mild pH. Tryptamine derivatives are also efficiently converted to tryptolines. Optimization of stoichiometry, pH, reaction time, and whole&#8208;cell catalyst deliver the tetrahydroisouinolines and tryptolines in &gt;90&#8201;% and &gt;40&#8201;% isolated yield, respectively, with excellent regioselectivity.

         <title>Harnessing a Biocatalyst to Bioremediate the Purification of Alkylglycosides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective enzymatic oxidation of a long&#8208;chain alcohol by&#8208;product with an immobilised alcohol oxidase, followed by subsequent sequestration of the aldehyde with amino resins is shown. The use of solid supported biocatalysts and reagents enabled a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot bioremediation of an alkyl monoglucoside, used as a surfactant in several industries.







Abstract
As the world moves towards net&#8208;zero carbon emissions, the development of sustainable chemical manufacturing processes is essential. Within manufacturing, purification by distillation is often used, however this process is energy intensive and methods that could obviate or reduce its use are desirable. Developed herein is an alternative, oxidative biocatalytic approach that enables purification of alkyl monoglucosides (essential bio&#8208;based surfactant components). Implementing an immobilised engineered alcohol oxidase, a long&#8208;chain alcohol by&#8208;product derived from alkyl monoglucoside synthesis (normally removed by distillation) is selectively oxidised to an aldehyde, conjugated to an amine resin and then removed by simple filtration. This affords recovery of the purified alkyl monoglucoside. The approach lays a blueprint for further development of sustainable alkylglycoside purification using biocatalysis and, importantly, for refining other important chemical feedstocks that currently rely on distillation.

         <title>Analytical Tools for Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries of Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identification of combinatorial cyclic peptides: Complex dynamic combinatorial libraries of cyclic peptides can be generated by thiol&#8208;to&#8208;thioester exchanges. Structural tools were developed onto the peptidic scaffold to facilitate the identification of a hit by chromatography and mass spectrometry. A chemically inert UV&#8208;Vis probe was introduced as well as an ornithine residue for site&#8208;selective ring&#8208;opening in MS/MS.







Abstract
Target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a very attractive strategy for the discovery of bioactive peptides. However, its application has not yet been demonstrated, presumably due to analytical challenges that arise from the diversity of a peptide library with combinatorial side&#8208;chains. We previously reported an efficient method to generate, under biocompatible conditions, large dynamic libraries of cyclic peptides grafted with amino acid's side&#8208;chains, by thiol&#8208;to&#8208;thioester exchanges. In this work, we present analytical tools to easily characterize such libraries by HPLC and mass spectrometry, and in particular to simplify the isomers&#8217; distinction requiring sequencing by MS/MS fragmentations. After structural optimization, the cyclic scaffold exhibits a UV&#8208;tag, absorbing at 415&#8197;nm, and an ornithine residue which favors the regioselective ring&#8208;opening and simultaneous MS/MS fragmentation, in the gas&#8208;phase.

         <title>Impact of Metabolic Stress on BeWo Syncytiotrophoblast Function
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;nucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells exhibit enhanced expression of syncytan 1 (ERVW&#8208;1) and syncytin 2 (ERVFRD&#8208;1) as well as secretion of progesterone, human chorionic gonadotropin beta (HCG&#946;), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP&#8208;2), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP&#8208;9). Metabolic stress (such as insulin, glucose, and palmitate) inhibits secretion of progesterone, HCG&#946;, MMP&#8208;2, and MMP&#8208;9 by syncytiotrophoblast cells. Created with BioRender.







Abstract
During placental formation, cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) fuse into multinucleate, microvilli&#8208;coated syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs), which contact maternal blood, mediating nutrient, metabolite, and gas exchange between mother and fetus, and providing a barrier against fetal infection. Trophoblasts remodel the surrounding extracellular matrix through the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Maternal obesity and diabetes mellitus can negatively impact fetal development and may impair trophoblast function. We sought to model the impact of metabolic stress on STB function by examining MMP and hormone secretion. The BeWo CTB cell line was syncytialized to STB&#8208;like cells with forskolin. Cell morphology was examined by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence; phenotype was further assessed by ELISA and RT&#8208;qPCR. STBs were exposed to a metabolic stress cocktail (MetaC: 30&#8197;mM glucose, 10&#8197;nM insulin, and 0.1&#8197;mM palmitic acid). BeWo syncytialization was demonstrated by increased secretion of HCG&#946; and progesterone, elevated syncytin gene expression (ERVW&#8208;1 and ERVFRD&#8208;1), loss of tight junctions, and increased surface microvilli. MetaC strongly suppressed syncytin gene expression (ERVW&#8208;1 and ERVFRD&#8208;1), suppressed HCG&#946; and progesterone secretion, and altered both MMP&#8208;9 and MMP&#8208;2 production. Metabolic stress modeling diabetes and obesity altered BeWo STB hormone and MMP production in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Creating NADP+&#8208;Specific Formate Dehydrogenases from Komagataella phaffii by Enzymatic Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To convert native NAD+&#8208;specific formate dehydrogenase from Komagataella phafii to NADP+&#8208;specific, we gained the optimal variant as KphFDH/V19 (D195Q/Y196R/Q197H) with (kcat/KM)NADP+/(kcat/KM)NAD+ of 129.226 through a range of characterizations, which was then successfully applied to an in&#8197;vitro NADPH regeneration system. This study fills a research gap in engineering the cofactor specificity of KphFDH.







Abstract
Most natural formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) exhibit NAD+ specificity, making it imperative to explore the engineering of FDH cofactor specificity for NADPH regeneration systems. The endogenous FDH of Komagataella phaffii (K. phaffii), termed KphFDH, is a typical NAD+&#8208;specific FDH. However, investigations into engineering the cofactor specificity of KphFDH have yet to be conducted. To develop an NADP+&#8208;specific variant of KphFDH, we selected D195, Y196, and Q197 as mutation sites and generated twenty site&#8208;directed variants. Through kinetic characterization, KphFDH/V19 (D195Q/Y196R/Q197H) was identified as the variant with the highest specificity towards NADP+, with a ratio of catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM)NADP+/(kcat/KM)NAD+ of 129.226. Studies of enzymatic properties revealed that the optimal temperature and pH for the reduction reaction of NADP+ catalyzed by KphFDH/V19 were 45&#8201;&#176;C and 7.5, respectively. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to elucidate the mechanism of high catalytic activity of KphFDH/V19 towards NADP+. Finally, KphFDH/V19 was applied to an in&#8197;vitro NADPH regeneration system with Meso&#8208;diaminopimelate dehydrogenase from Symbiobacterium thermophilum (StDAPDH/H227V). This study successfully created a KphFDH variant with high NADP+ specificity and demonstrated its practical applicability in an in&#8197;vitro NADPH regeneration system.

         <title>Overcoming Biochemical Limitations of Galactose Oxidase through the Design of a Solid&#8208;Supported Self&#8208;Sufficient Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the novel design of an active and stable self&#8208;sufficient galactose oxidase (GalOx) biocatalyst by co&#8208;immobilization of a hemoprotein as activator. The study of its diffusional constraints by co&#8208;immobilization of a luminescent compound enables the quantification of the oxygen concentration inside the particle. Finally, its application in the oxidation of galactose in an aerated bioreactor is presented.







Abstract
Galactose Oxidase (GalOx) has gained significant interest in biocatalysis due to its ability for selective oxidation beyond the natural oxidation of galactose, enabling the production of valuable derivatives. However, the practical application of GalOx has been hindered by the limited availability of active and stable biocatalysts, as well as the inherent biochemical limitations such as oxygen (O2) dependency and the need for activation. In this study, we addressed these challenges by immobilizing GalOx into agarose&#8208;based and Purolite supports to enhance its activity and stability. Additionally, we identified and quantified the oxygen supply limitation into solid catalysts by intraparticle oxygen sensing showing a trade&#8208;off between the amount of protein loaded onto the solid support and the catalytic effectiveness of the immobilized enzyme. Furthermore, we coimmobilized a heme&#8208;containing protein along with the enzyme to function as an activator. To evaluate the practical application of the immobilized GalOx, we conducted the oxidation of galactose in an instrumented aerated reactor. The results showcased the efficient performance of the immobilized enzyme in the 8&#8197;h reaction cycle. Notably, the GalOx immobilized into dextran sulfate&#8208;activated agarose exhibited improved stability, overcoming the need for a soluble activator supply, and demonstrated exceptional performance in galactose oxidation. These findings offer promising prospects for the utilization of GalOx in technical biocatalytic applications.

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the novel design of an active and stable self-sufficient galactose oxidase (GalOx) biocatalyst by co-immobilization of a hemoprotein as activator. The study of its diffusional constraints by co-immobilization of a luminescent compound enables the quantification of the oxygen concentration inside the particle. Finally, its application in the oxidation of galactose in an aerated bioreactor is presented.

         <title>Discovery of NSD2&#8208;Degraders from Novel and Selective DEL Hits</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries were employed to screen billions of molecules against NSD2. Hits were identified against the PWWP1 domain. One chemotype was converted into a VHL1/EloB/EloC E3 ligase PROTAC, which demonstrated selective and on&#8208;target degradation of NSD2 in cells. The binding MoA of compounds was elucidated by molecular docking and validated by subsequent single&#8208;point mutation studies.







Abstract
NSD2 is a histone methyltransferase predominantly catalyzing di&#8208;methylation of histone H3 on lysine K36. Increased NSD2 activity due to mutations or fusion&#8208;events affecting the gene encoding NSD2 is considered an oncogenic event and a driver in various cancers, including multiple myelomas carrying t(4;14) chromosomal translocations and acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#8216;s expressing the hyperactive NSD2 mutant E1099&#8197;K. Using DNA&#8208;encoded libraries, we have identified small molecule ligands that selectively and potently bind to the PWWP1 domain of NSD2, inhibit NSD2 binding to H3K36me2&#8208;bearing nucleosomes, but do not inhibit the methyltransferase activity. The ligands were subsequently converted to selective VHL1&#8208;recruiting NSD2 degraders and by using one of the most efficacious degraders in cell lines, we show that it leads to NSD2 degradation, decrease in K3&#8197;K36me2 levels and inhibition of cell proliferation.

         <title>Analysing Megasynthetase Mutants at High Throughput Using Droplet Microfluidics
</title>

         <dc:description>
NRPSs are an important source of pharmaceutically valuable natural products. The large sequence space of NRPS variant libraries requires a robust, high&#8208;throughput sorting and screening platform. Here we present a novel high&#8208;throughput microfluidic screening platform for the investigation of mutants of NRP producing bacteria in a highly parallel manner. Our results demonstrate the power of this platform for studying large libraries of NRPS variants.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant enzymatic assembly lines that deliver many pharmaceutically valuable natural products, including antibiotics. As the search for new antibiotics motivates attempts to redesign nonribosomal metabolic pathways, more robust and rapid sorting and screening platforms are needed. Here, we establish a microfluidic platform that reliably detects production of the model nonribosomal peptide gramicidin S. The detection is based on calcein&#8208;filled sensor liposomes yielding increased fluorescence upon permeabilization. From a library of NRPS mutants, the sorting platform enriches the gramicidin S producer 14.5&#8208;fold, decreases internal stop codons 250&#8208;fold, and generates enrichment factors correlating with enzyme activity. Screening for NRPS activity with a reliable non&#8208;binary sensor will enable more sophisticated structure&#8208;activity studies and new engineering applications in the future.

         <title>Efficient Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Using a Flavoprotein Oxidase from the Honeybee Apis mellifera</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel insect&#8208;derived flavoenzyme from the honeybee Apis mellifera (beeHMFO) can selectively oxidize 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to the corresponding dialdehyde 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), which is an interesting bio&#8208;based polymer precursor. Moreover, activity toward a number of other aromatic alcohols is observed. The predicted structure of beeHMFO shows high similarity to other flavoprotein oxidases capable of oxidizing HMF.







Abstract
The chemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be derived from lignocellulose and is an interesting bio&#8208;based platform chemical as it has the potential to be transformed into numerous valuable building blocks such as the polymer&#8208;precursor 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF). To date, only a few oxidases acting on HMF are known and by sampling atypical species, we discovered a novel flavin&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase from the honeybee Apis mellifera (beeHMFO). The enzyme can perform the chemoselective oxidation of HMF to DFF but can also readily accept other aromatic alcohols as substrates. The function of the enzyme may well be the antimicrobial generation of hydrogen peroxide using HMF, which is very abundant in honey. The discovery of this insect&#8208;derived flavoprotein oxidase holds promising potential in the synthesis of renewable products and demonstrates that insects can be an interesting source of novel biocatalysts.

         <title>ThermoBRET: A Ligand&#8208;Engagement Nanoscale Thermostability Assay Applied to GPCRs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Measurements of membrane protein thermostability reflect ligand binding. Current thermostability assays often require protein purification or rely on pre&#8208;existing radiolabelled or fluorescent ligands, limiting their application to established targets. Alternative methods, such as fluorescence&#8208;detection size exclusion chromatography thermal shift, detect protein aggregation but are not amenable for high&#8208;throughput screening. &#160;
Here, we present a ThermoBRET method to quantify the relative thermostability of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), using cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the b2&#8208;adrenoceptor (b2AR) as model systems. ThermoBRET reports receptor unfolding, does not need labelled ligands and can be used with non&#8208;purified proteins. It uses Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) between Nanoluciferase (Nluc) and a thiol&#8208;reactive fluorescent dye that binds cysteines exposed by unfolding. We demonstrate that the melting point (Tm) of Nluc&#8208;fused GPCRs can be determined in non&#8208;purified detergent solubilised membrane preparations or solubilised whole cells, revealing differences in thermostability for different solubilising conditions and in the presence of stabilising ligands. We extended the range of the assay by developing the thermostable tsNLuc by incorporating mutations from the fragments of split&#8208;Nluc (Tm of 87 &#8304;C versus 59 &#8304;C). ThermoBRET allows the determination of GPCR thermostability, which is useful for protein purification optimisation and for drug discovery screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Metabolic Pathways in Non&#8208;photosynthetic Biohybrid Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomanufacturing via microorganisms relies on carbon substrates for molecular feedstocks and a source of energy to carry out enzymatic reactions. This creates metabolic bottlenecks and lowers the efficiency for substrate conversion. Nanoparticle biohybridization with proteins and whole cell surfaces can bypass the need for redox cofactor regeneration for improved secondary metabolite production in a non&#8208;specific manner. Here we propose using nanobiohybrid organisms (Nanorgs), intracellular protein&#8208;nanoparticle hybrids formed through the spontaneous coupling of core&#8208;shell quantum dots (QDs) with histidine&#8208;tagged enzymes in non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria, for light&#8208;mediated control of bacterial metabolism. This proved to eliminate metabolic constrictions and replace glucose with light as the source of energy in Escherichia coli, with an increase of growth by 1.7&#8208;fold in 75 % reduced nutrient media. Metabolomic tracking through carbon isotope labeling confirmed flux shunting through targeted pathways, with accumulation of metabolites downstream of respective targets. Finally, application of Nanorgs with the Ehrlich pathway improved isobutanol titers/yield by 3.9&#8208;fold in 75 % less carbon source from E. coli strains with no genetic alterations.

This creates metabolic bottlenecks and lowers the efficiency for substrate conversion. Nanoparticle biohybridization with proteins and whole cell surfaces can bypass the need for redox cofactor regeneration for improved secondary metabolite production in a non-specific manner. Here we propose using nanobiohybrid organisms (Nanorgs), intracellular protein-nanoparticle hybrids formed through the spontaneous coupling of core-shell quantum dots (QDs) with histidine-tagged enzymes in non-photosynthetic bacteria, for light-mediated control of bacterial metabolism. This proved to eliminate metabolic constrictions and replace glucose with light as the source of energy in Escherichia coli, with an increase of growth by 1.7-fold in 75 % reduced nutrient media. Metabolomic tracking through carbon isotope labeling confirmed flux shunting through targeted pathways, with accumulation of metabolites downstream of respective targets. Finally, application of Nanorgs with the Ehrlich pathway improved isobutanol titers/yield by 3.9-fold in 75 % less carbon source from E. coli strains with no genetic alterations. These results demonstrate the promise of Nanorgs for metabolic engineering and low-cost biomanufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selection of Highly Specific DNA Aptamer for the Development of QCM&#8208;Based Arsenic Sensor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A previously reported arsenic aptamer, ars&#8208;3 has shown non&#8208;specific binding and failed to elicit signal in the presence of arsenic, requiring an alternative aptamer for use as sensor recognition element. The novel aptamer was characterized by a Kd value of 8.15&#8197;nM and a label&#8208;free QCM sensor was developed for detection of arsenic with detection limit of 8.6&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Heavy metal arsenic is a water pollutant that affects millions of lives worldwide. A novel aptamer candidate for specific and sensitive arsenic detection was identified using Graphene Oxide&#8208;SELEX (GO&#8208;SELEX). Eleven rounds of GO&#8208;SELEX were performed to screen As(III) specific sequences. The selected aptamer sequences were evaluated for their binding affinity. The dissociation constant of the best aptamer candidate, As&#8208;06 was estimated by fluorescence recovery upon target addition, and it was found to be 8.15&#8197;nM. A QCM&#8208;based biosensing platform was designed based on the target&#8208;triggered release of aptamer from the QCM electrode. An rGO&#8208;SWCNT nanocomposite was adsorbed on the gold surface, and the single&#8208;stranded probe was stacked on the rGO&#8208;CNT layer. Upon addition of the target to the solution, a concentration&#8208;dependent release of the ssDNA probe was observed and recorded as the change in the electrode frequency. The developed QCM sensor showed a dynamic linear range from 10&#8197;nM to 100&#8197;nM and a low detection limit of 8.6&#8197;nM. The sensor exhibited excellent selectivity when challenged with common interfering anions and cations.

         <title>Effect of Hyaluronic Acid on the Self&#8208;Assembly of a Dipeptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Gel</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;component hydrogel made of a dipeptide amphiphile and hyaluronic acid (HA) is reported. A minimal amount of HA is enough to control polymorphism and rheological performance of the material. The hydrogel has been studied for suspended cell growth avoiding cell sedimentation even in the presence of competing cell&#8208;adhesive surfaces, which can be of interest for advanced cell delivery techniques.







Abstract
The combination of polymers and low molecular weight (LMW) compounds is a powerful approach to prepare new supramolecular materials. Here we prepare two&#8208;component hydrogels made by a well&#8208;known and biologically active polymer, hyaluronic acid (HA), and a dipeptide&#8208;based supramolecular gelator. We undertake a detailed study of materials with different compositions including macroscopic (hydrogel formation, rheology) and micro/nanoscopic characterization (electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction). We observe that the two components mutually benefit in the new materials: a minimum amount of HA helps to reduce the polymorphism of the LMW network leading to reproducible hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; the LMW component network holds HA without the need for an irreversible covalent crosslinking. These materials have a great potential for biomedical application as, for instance, extracellular matrix mimetics for cell growth. As a proof of concept, we have observed that this material is effective for cell growth in suspension and avoids cell sedimentation even in the presence of competing cell&#8208;adhesive surfaces. This may be of interest to advanced cell delivery techniques.

         <title>Prebiotic Synthesis of 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Cyclic Adenosine and Guanosine Monophosphates through Carbodiimide&#8208;Assisted Cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbodiimides, which are well known to form in large amounts during thermal treatment of formamide, might mediate the cyclization of nucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphates to 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cyclic nucleotides in a formamide medium. The reported reaction route thus suggests that 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cyclic nucleotides could have been formed on the early Earth through a formamide&#8208;based systems chemistry.







Abstract
3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Cyclic nucleotides play a fundamental role in modern biochemical processes and have been suggested to have played a central role at the origin of terrestrial life. In this work, we suggest that a formamide&#8208;based systems chemistry might account for their availability on the early Earth. In particular, we demonstrate that in a liquid formamide environment at elevated temperatures 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cyclic nucleotides are obtained in good yield and selectivity upon intramolecular cyclization of 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphorylated nucleosides in the presence of carbodiimides.

         <title>Small Molecules Targeting Human UDP&#8208;GlcNAc 2&#8208;Epimerase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high throughput screening campaign against the UDP&#8722;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine 2&#8208;epimerase (GNE), the master regulator of the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway, resulted in the identification of three small molecule inhibitors in the low &#956;M range. These compounds were validated in&#8197;vitro and their effect on the oligomeric state of GNE was demonstrated.







Abstract
Uridine diphosphate N&#8208;acetylglucosamine 2&#8208;epimerase (GNE) is a key enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway. Sialic acids are primarily terminal carbohydrates on glycans and play fundamental roles in health and disease. In search of effective GNE inhibitors not based on a carbohydrate scaffold, we performed a high&#8208;throughput screening campaign of 68,640 drug&#8208;like small molecules against recombinant GNE using a UDP detection assay. We validated nine of the primary actives with an orthogonal real&#8208;time NMR assay and verified their IC50 values in the low micromolar to nanomolar range manually. Stability and solubility studies revealed three compounds for further evaluation. Thermal shift assays, analytical size exclusion, and interferometric scattering microscopy demonstrated that the GNE inhibitors acted on the oligomeric state of the protein. Finally, hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX&#8208;MS) revealed which sections of GNE were shifted upon the addition of the inhibitors. In summary, we have identified three small molecules as GNE inhibitors with high potency in&#8197;vitro, which serve as promising candidates to modulate sialic acid biosynthesis in more complex systems.

         <title>Formation and Effects of Upstream DNA&#8211;RNA Base Pairing in Telomerase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the functional cycle of telomerase, the templating region of RNA and upstream regions of DNA form base pairs. Upstream base pairing provides a balance between the number of dissociating and forming base pairs during translocations. Hydrogen bonds between the protein and guanines of DNA mark the end of telomeric repeat synthesis.







Abstract
Telomere elongation by telomerase consists of two types of translocation: duplex translocation during each repeat synthesis and template translocation at the end of repeat synthesis. Our replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations show that in addition to the Watson&#8211;Crick interactions in the active site, templating RNA can also form base pairs with the upstream regions of DNA, mostly with the second upstream DNA repeat with respect to the 3&#8217;&#8208;end. At the end of the repeat synthesis, dG10&#8208;P442 and dG11&#8208;N446 hydrogen bonds form. Then, active&#8208;site base pairs dissociate one by one, and the RNA bases reanneal with the complementary base on the upstream DNA repeat. For each dissociating base pair a new one forms, thus conserving the number of base pairs during template translocation.

Our replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations show that in addition to the Watson&#8211;Crick interactions in the active site, templating RNA can also form base pairs with the upstream regions of DNA, mostly with the second upstream DNA repeat with respect to the 3&#8217;-end. At the end of the repeat synthesis, dG10-P442 and dG11-N446 hydrogen bonds form. Then, active-site base pairs dissociate one by one, and the RNA bases reanneal with the complementary base on the upstream DNA repeat. For each dissociating base pair a new one forms, thus conserving the number of base pairs during template translocation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Copper(I) Clusters for Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Biological Thiols in Living Cells
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim of developing compounds capable of specifically inducing fatal in&#8197;cellulo redox reactions upon light irradiation, we have prepared, characterized, and studied a series of copper(I) clusters with thiopyrimidine ligands. The clusters display high photooxidation capacity towards cysteine &#8211; an essential amino acid &#8211; upon light irradiation in the visible range (450&#8197;nm), while remaining completely inactive in the dark.







Abstract
The cell redox balance can be disrupted by the oxidation of biological peptides, eventually leading to cell death, which provides opportunities to develop cytotoxic drugs. With the aim of developing compounds capable of specifically inducing fatal redox reactions upon light irradiation, we have developed a library of copper compounds. This metal is abundant and considered essential for human health, making it particularly attractive for the development of new anticancer drugs. Copper(I) clusters with thiol ligands (including&#8197;5 novel ones) have been synthesized and characterized. Structures were elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and showed that the compounds are oligomeric clusters. The clusters display high photooxidation capacity towards cysteine &#8211; an essential amino acid &#8211; upon light irradiation in the visible range (450&#8197;nm), while remaining completely inactive in the dark. This photoredox activity against a biological thiol is very encouraging for the development of anticancer photoredox drugs.The in&#8197;vitro assay on murine colorectal cancer cells (CT26) did not show any toxicity &#8211; whether in the dark or when exposed to 450&#8197;nm light, likely because of the poor solubility of the complexes in biological medium.

         <title>Stereoselective Biocatalytic &#945;&#8208;Deuteration of L&#8208;Amino Acids by a Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;Phosphate&#8208;Dependent Mannich Cyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PLP&#8208;dependent Mannich cyclase LolT is repurposed for &#945;&#8208;deuteration of amino acids. Complete deuteration can be achieved with diverse L&#8208;amino acids bearing assorted functional groups, e.&#8201;g. from lysine to glutamic acid. The broad substrate scope and strict stereoselectivity make LolT a powerful biocatalyst for preparation of &#945;&#8208;deuterated L&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Deuterated amino acids are valuable building blocks for developing deuterated drugs, and are important tools for studying biological systems. Biocatalytic deuteration represents an attractive strategy to directly access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;deuterated amino acids. Here, we show that a PLP&#8208;dependent Mannich cyclase, LolT, involved in the biosynthesis of loline alkaloids, is capable of deuterating a diverse range of L&#8208;amino acids, including basic and acidic, nonpolar and polar, aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. Furthermore, complete deuteration of many amino acids can be achieved within minutes with exquisite control on the site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. During the course of this investigation, we also unexpectedly discovered that LolT exhibits &#946;&#8208;elimination activity with L&#8208;cystine and O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;serine, confirming our previous hypothesis based on structural and phylogenetic analysis that LolT, a C&#945;&#8722;C bond forming enzyme, is evolved from a primordial C&#946;&#8722;S lyase family. Overall, our study demonstrates that LolT is an extremely versatile biocatalyst, and can be used for not only heterocyclic quaternary amino acid biosynthesis, but also biocatalytic amino acid deuteration.

         <title>Double Stranded DNA Binding Stapled Peptides: An Emerging Tool for Transcriptional Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;binding proteins regulate key cellular processes through sequence selective high affinity interactions of an &#945;&#8208;helix with the major groove of DNA. These &#945;&#8208;helices provide a starting point in designing DNA&#8208;binding stapled peptides. This review examines all known DNA&#8208;binding stapled peptides and analyzes their features and trends.







Abstract
Stapled peptides have rapidly established themselves as a powerful technique to mimic &#945;&#8208;helical interactions with a short peptide sequence. There are many examples of stapled peptides that successfully disrupt &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions, with an example currently in clinical trials. DNA&#8208;protein interactions are also often mediated by &#945;&#8208;helices and are involved in all transcriptional regulation processes. Unlike DNA&#8208;binding small molecules, which typically lack DNA sequence selectivity, DNA&#8208;binding proteins bind with high affinity and high selectivity. These are ideal candidates for the design DNA&#8208;binding stapled peptides. Despite the parallel to protein&#8208;protein interaction disrupting stapled peptides and the need for sequence specific DNA binders, there are very few DNA&#8208;binding stapled peptides. In this review we examine all the known DNA&#8208;binding stapled peptides. Their design concepts are compared to stapled peptides that disrupt protein&#8208;protein interactions and based on the few examples in the literature, DNA&#8208;binding stapled peptide trends are discussed.

         <title>A Degron Blocking Strategy Towards Improved CRL4CRBN Recruiting PROTAC Selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
E3 ligase mediated targeted protein degradation is an ever more important area in drug discovery. In the case of cereblon two avenues exist; either heterobifunctional PROTACs, or discrete cereblon ligands that induce a specific neosubstrate degron association to the complex. Here we present a degron blocking approach, whereby structural and in silico understandings of degron association has directed ligand design to block IMiD&#8208;like binding of degron containing neosubstrates, thus enhancing PROTAC selectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Bouguenina, J. J. Caldwell et al.

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Switch Motif of Aromatic Ammonia Lyases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified novel substrate switch motifs of aromatic ammonia lyases. These alternative amino acids were introduced into a tyrosine ammonia lyase (TALrpc). The characterization of these enzyme variants revealed a significant (up to 20&#8208;fold) improvement in the activity for phenylalanine. A computational analysis could explain these experimental results.







Abstract
Aromatic ammonia lyases (AALs) are important enzymes for biocatalysis as they enable the asymmetric synthesis of chiral l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated precursors. AALs have very similar protein structures and active site pockets but exhibit strict substrate specificity towards tyrosine, phenylalanine, or histidine. Herein, through systematic bioinformatics and structural analysis, we discovered eight new motifs of amino acid residues in AALs. After introducing them &#8211; as well as four already known motifs &#8211; into different AALs, we learned that altering the substrate specificity by engineering the substrate switch motif in phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs), phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyases (PTALs), and tyrosine ammonia lyases (TALs) was only partially successful. However, we discovered that three previously unknown residue combinations introduced a substrate switch from tyrosine to phenylalanine in TAL, which was converted up to 20&#8208;fold better compared to the wild&#8208;type TAL enzyme.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Binding of Adenosine by Aptamers Selected Using Theophylline</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly selected DNA aptamer for theophylline can also bind adenosine, whereas the classical RNA aptamer cannot. Theophylline and adenosine are related molecules in regulating sleep, suggesting that nucleic acids also have the chemical basis for a similar function.







Abstract
We recently reported that some adenosine binding aptamers can also bind caffeine and theophylline with around 20&#8208;fold lower affinities. This discovery led to the current work to examine the cross&#8208;binding of adenosine to theophylline aptamers. For the DNA aptamer for theophylline, cross&#8208;binding to adenosine was observed, and the affinity was 18 to 38&#8208;fold lower for adenosine based on assays using isothermal titration calorimetry and ThT fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding complexes were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, and both adenosine and theophylline showed an overall similar binding structure to the DNA theophylline aptamer, although small differences were also observed. In contrast, the RNA aptamer did not show binding to adenosine, although both aptamers have very similar relative selectivity for various methylxanthines including caffeine. After a negative selection, a few new aptamers with completely different primary sequences for theophylline were obtained and they did not show binding to adenosine. Thus, there are many ways for aptamers to bind theophylline and some can have cross&#8208;binding to adenosine. In biology, theophylline, caffeine, and adenosine can bind to the same protein receptors to regulate sleep, and their binding to the same DNA motifs may suggest an early role of nucleic acids in similar regulatory functions.

         <title>Covalent Targeting of Glutamate Cysteine Ligase to Inhibit Glutathione Synthesis
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have discovered a covalent inhibitor of glutamate&#8208;cysteine ligase (GCL) that targets an allosteric C114 in the regulatory subunit GCLM to inhibit GCL activity, lower GSH levels, and impair cell viability in ARID1A&#8208;negative cancer cells.







Abstract
Dysregulated oxidative stress plays a major role in cancer pathogenesis and some types of cancer cells are particularly vulnerable to inhibition of their cellular antioxidant capacity. Glutamate&#8208;cysteine ligase (GCL) is the first and rate&#8208;limiting step in the synthesis of the major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Developing a GCL inhibitor may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for certain cancer types that are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress. In this study, we reveal a cysteine&#8208;reactive ligand, EN25, that covalently targets an allosteric cysteine C114 on GCLM, the modifier subunit of GCL, and leads to inhibition of GCL activity. This interaction also leads to reduced cellular GSH levels and impaired cell viability in ARID1A&#8208;deficient cancer cells, which are particularly vulnerable to glutathione depletion, but not in ARID1A&#8208;positive cancer cells. Our studies uncover a novel potential ligandable site within GCLM that can be targeted to inhibit GSH synthesis in vulnerable cancer cell types.

         <title>The Conversion of UDP&#8208;Glc to UDP&#8208;Man: In Silico and Biochemical Exploration To Improve the Catalytic Efficiency of CDP&#8208;Tyvelose C2&#8208;Epimerases</title>

         <dc:description>
Promiscuous CDP&#8208;tyvelose 2&#8208;epimerase (TyvE) converts NDP&#8208;glucose to NDP&#8208;mannose. We present the sequence fingerprints that are indicative of this conversion in TyvE&#8208;like enzymes. Eleven TyvE&#8208;like enzymes were identified, and the top two wild&#8208;type candidates and a quadruple mutant were characterized. The improved catalytic efficiency of these enzymes might help the design of new nucleotide production pathways starting from a cheap sugar substrates like sucrose.







Abstract
A promiscuous CDP&#8208;tyvelose 2&#8208;epimerase (TyvE) from Thermodesulfatator atlanticus (TaTyvE) belonging to the nucleotide sugar active short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (NS&#8208;SDRs) was recently discovered. TaTyvE performs the slow conversion of NDP&#8208;glucose (NDP&#8208;Glc) to NDP&#8208;mannose (NDP&#8208;Man). Here, we present the sequence fingerprints that are indicative of the conversion of UDP&#8208;Glc to UDP&#8208;Man in TyvE&#8208;like enzymes based on the heptagonal box motifs. Our data&#8208;mining approach led to the identification of 11 additional TyvE&#8208;like enzymes for the conversion of UDP&#8208;Glc to UDP&#8208;Man. We characterized the top two wild&#8208;type candidates, which show a 15&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency, respectively, on UDP&#8208;Glc compared to TaTyvE. In addition, we present a quadruple variant of one of the identified enzymes with a 70&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency on UDP&#8208;Glc compared to TaTyvE. These findings could help the design of new nucleotide production pathways starting from a cheap sugar substrate like glucose or sucrose.

         <title>Improving the Enantioselectivity of CHMOBrevi1 for Asymmetric Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Precursor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;rational design of the cyclohexanone monooxygenase CHMOBrevi1 generated the L145A mutant with improved enantioselectivity (96.8&#8201;% ee) for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;piperonyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, a precursor of anti&#8208;cancer drug podophyllotoxin, compared with the wild type (75&#8201;% ee). Coupled with the cofactor regeneration system, 9.3&#8197;mM substrate was converted completely in a 100&#8208;mL scale reaction.







Abstract
(R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;piperonyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones are key building blocks for the synthesis of podophyllotoxin, which have demonstrated remarkable potential in cancer treatment. Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs)&#8208;mediated asymmetric oxidation is a green approach to produce chiral lactones. While several BVMOs were able to oxidize the corresponding cyclobutanone, most BVMOs gave the (S) enantiomer while Cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) from Brevibacterium sp. HCU1 gave (R) enantiomer, but with a low enantioselectivity (75&#8201;% ee). In this study, we use a strategy called &#8220;focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis&#8221; (FRISM) at residues ranging from 6&#8197;&#197; from substrate. The mutations by using a restricted set of rationally chosen amino acids allow the formation of a small mutant library. By generating and screening less than 60 variants, we achieved a high ee of 96.8&#8201;%. Coupled with the cofactor regeneration system, 9.3&#8197;mM substrate was converted completely in a 100&#8208;mL scale reaction. Therefore, our work reveals a promising synthetic method for (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;piperonyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone with the highest enantioselectivity, and provides a new opportunity for the chem&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of podophyllotoxin.

         <title>A Degron Blocking Strategy Towards Improved CRL4CRBN Recruiting PROTAC Selectivity
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of CRL4CRBN recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is currently still a largely empirical process and the design principles are still to be deciphered. Herein, a design strategy to generate CRL4CRBN PROTACs selective for a target of interest by dialling&#8208;out the molecular glue function of thalidomide derivatives is reported.







Abstract
Small molecules inducing protein degradation are important pharmacological tools to interrogate complex biology and are rapidly translating into clinical agents. However, to fully realise the potential of these molecules, selectivity remains a limiting challenge. Herein, we addressed the issue of selectivity in the design of CRL4CRBN recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). Thalidomide derivatives used to generate CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTACs have well described intrinsic monovalent degradation profiles by inducing the recruitment of neo&#8208;substrates, such as GSPT1, Ikaros and Aiolos. We leveraged structural insights from known CRL4CRBN neo&#8208;substrates to attenuate and indeed remove this monovalent degradation function in well&#8208;known CRL4CRBN molecular glues degraders, namely CC&#8208;885 and Pomalidomide. We then applied these design principles on a previously published BRD9 PROTAC (dBRD9&#8208;A) and generated an analogue with improved selectivity profile. Finally, we implemented a computational modelling pipeline to show that our degron blocking design does not impact PROTAC&#8208;induced ternary complex formation.

     alt="A Degron Blocking Strategy Towards Improved CRL4CRBN Recruiting PROTAC Selectivity**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation of CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is currently still a largely empirical process and the design principles are still to be deciphered. Herein, a design strategy to generate CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; PROTACs selective for a target of interest by dialling-out the molecular glue function of thalidomide derivatives is reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small molecules inducing protein degradation are important pharmacological tools to interrogate complex biology and are rapidly translating into clinical agents. However, to fully realise the potential of these molecules, selectivity remains a limiting challenge. Herein, we addressed the issue of selectivity in the design of CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). Thalidomide derivatives used to generate CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; recruiting PROTACs have well described intrinsic monovalent degradation profiles by inducing the recruitment of neo-substrates, such as GSPT1, Ikaros and Aiolos. We leveraged structural insights from known CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; neo-substrates to attenuate and indeed remove this monovalent degradation function in well-known CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; molecular glues degraders, namely CC-885 and Pomalidomide. We then applied these design principles on a previously published BRD9 PROTAC (dBRD9-A) and generated an analogue with improved selectivity profile. Finally, we implemented a computational modelling pipeline to show that our degron blocking design does not impact PROTAC-induced ternary complex formation. We believe that the tools and principles presented in this work will be valuable to support the development of targeted protein degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bispidine as a Versatile Scaffold: From Topological Hosts to Transmembrane Transporters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We delineate a highly versatile strategy for the synthesis of topologically intriguing molecule and self&#8208;assembling macrocycles. The self&#8208;assembly of the macrocycle to nanotube displays unconventional interactions such as dihydrogen bonding. The nanotubular assembly acts as a channel for transmembrane ion transport as evident from patch clamp experiments.







Abstract
The development of designer topological structures is a synthetically challenging endeavor. We present herein bispidine as a platform for the design of molecules with various topologies and functions. The bispidine&#8208;based acyclic molecule, which shows intriguing S&#8208;shape topology, is discussed. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that this molecule exists in the solid state as two conformational enantiomers. In addition, bispidine&#8208;based designer macrocycles were synthesized and investigated for ionophoric properties. Patch clamp experiments revealed that these macrocycles transport both anions and cations non&#8208;specifically with at least tenfold higher chloride conductance over the cations under the given experimental conditions. Ultramicroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies indicated that the self&#8208;assembling macrocycle forms a tubular assembly. Our design highlights the use of unconventional dihydrogen interactions in nanotube fabrication.

         <title>Biotransformation Of l&#8208;Tryptophan To Produce Arcyriaflavin A With Pseudomonas putida KT2440</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arcyriaflavin A was produced in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 using genes from Lentzea aerocolonigenes. Cultivation conditions and supply of the precursor l&#8208;tryptophan were optimized. Genetic engineering of outer membrane vesicle release and cultivation with polyurethane adsorbent resulted in product enrichment in the supernatant. Overall, 4.7&#8197;mg arcyriaflavin A were obtained from 1&#8197;L bacterial culture representing a ten&#8208;fold increase in productivity.







Abstract
Natural products such as indolocarbazoles are a valuable source of highly bioactive compounds with numerous potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Arcyriaflavin A, isolated from marine invertebrates and slime molds, is one representative of this group and acts as a cyclin D1&#8208;cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 4 inhibitor. To date, access to this compound has mostly relied on multi&#8208;step total synthesis. In this study, biosynthetic access to arcyriaflavin A was explored using recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440 based on a previously generated producer strain. We used a Design of Experiment approach to analyze four key parameters, which led to the optimization of the bioprocess. By engineering the formation of outer membrane vesicles and using an adsorbent in the culture broth, we succeeded to increase the yield of arcyriaflavin A in the cell&#8208;free supernatant, resulting in a nearly eight&#8208;fold increase in the overall production titers. Finally, we managed to scale up the bioprocess leading to a final yield of 4.7&#8197;mg arcyriaflavin A product isolated from 1&#8197;L of bacterial culture. Thus, this study showcases an integrative approach to improve biotransformation and moreover also provides starting points for further optimization of indolocarbazole production in P. putida.
