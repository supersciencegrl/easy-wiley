      <title>Incorporation of halogenated amino acids into antibody fragments at multiple specific sites enhances antigen binding</title>
      <dc:description>The expansion of the amino&#8208;acid repertoire with synthetic derivatives introduces novel structures and functionalities into proteins. In the present study, we improved the antigen binding of antibodies by incorporating halogenated tyrosines at multiple selective sites. Tyrosines in the Fab fragment of an anti&#8208;EGF&#8208;receptor antibody 059&#8208;152 were systematically replaced with 3&#8208;bromo&#8208; and 3&#8208;chlorotyrosines, and simultaneous replacements at 4 specific sites were thus found to cause a 10&#8208;fold increase in the affinity toward the antigen. Structure modeling suggested that this effect was due to enhanced shape complementarity between the antigen and antibody molecules. On the other hand, we showed that chlorination in the constant domain, far from the binding interface, of Rituximab Fab also increased the affinity significantly (up to 17&#8208;fold). Our results showed that antigen binding is tunable with the halogenation&#160;in and out of the binding motifs.</dc:description>

      <title>Biochemical and structural characterization of an unusual and naturally split class 3 intein</title>
      <dc:description>Split inteins are indispensable tools for protein engineering because their ligation and cleavage reactions enable unique modifications of the polypeptide backbone. Three different classes of inteins have been identified according to the nature of covalent intermediates resulting from the acyl rearrangements in the multistep protein splicing pathway. Class 3 inteins employ a characteristic internal cysteine for a branched thioester intermediate. A bioinformatic database search in non&#8208;redundant protein sequences revealed the absence of split variants in 1701 class 3 inteins. We discovered the first reported split class 3 intein in a metagenomics data set and report its biochemical, mechanistic and structural analysis. The AceL NrdHF intein exhibits low sequence conservation with other inteins and marked deviations of residues at conserved key positions, including a variation of the typical class&#8208;3 WCT triplet motif. Nevertheless, functional analysis confirmed the class 3 mechanism of the intein and revealed excellent splicing yields within a few minutes over a wide range of conditions and with barely detectable cleavage side reactions. A high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of the AceL NrdHF precursor with a mutagenesis study explained the importance and roles of several residues at the key positions. Tolerated substitutions in the flanking extein residues and a high affinity between the split intein fragments further underline the intein&#8217;s future potential as a ligation tool.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Making partying safer. &#947;&#8208;Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has gained attention as a drug that is frequently misused in social settings to induce euphoria and to facilitate sexual assault. A simple approach for selective sensing of GHB has been developed for drug screening and forensic investigation. Such a strategy, based on a specific enzymatic reaction, allows GHB to be analyzed in a complicated sample matrix, including biological specimens. The results can be readily acquired by either spectral assay or observation with the naked&#8208;eye. More information can be found in the full paper by B.&#8208;G. Xing et&#8197;al.

Abstract
A lysozyme (Lys)&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation technique was designed to synthesize MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2&#8208;Lys NSs). As a novel nanozyme antibacterial agent with high peroxidase&#8208;like catalyst activity, MoS2&#8208;Lys NSs showed good antibacterial efficacy against both Gram&#8208;negative ampicillin&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli (Ampr E. coli) and Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis. A possible antibacterial mechanism is also proposed. This work provides an effective antibacterial strategy based on the MoS2&#8208;Lys NSs antibacterial agent.

      <title>Riboflavin Is Directly Involved in N&#8208;Dealkylation Catalyzed by Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases
</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct transfer: Riboflavin directly transfers electrons to bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in an oxidative N&#8208;dealkylation. A new mechanism for the electron&#8208;transfer process is proposed that could be generally applicable to numerous P450&#8208;like monooxygenases that lack the reductase domain.







Abstract
Like a vast number of enzymes in nature, bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenases require an activated form of flavin as a cofactor for catalytic activity. Riboflavin is the precursor of FAD and FMN that serves as indispensable cofactor for flavoenzymes. In contrast to previous notions, herein we describe the identification of an electron&#8208;transfer process that is directly mediated by riboflavin for N&#8208;dealkylation by bacterial P450 monooxygenases. The electron relay from NADPH to riboflavin and then via activated oxygen to heme was proposed based on a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography, molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis of representative bacterial P450 monooxygenases. This study provides new insights into the electron transfer mechanism in bacterial P450 enzyme catalysis and likely in yeasts, fungi, plants and mammals.

      <title>Fluorophore&#8208;Labeled Cyclic Nucleotides as Potent Agonists of Cyclic Nucleotide&#8208;Regulated Ion Channels</title>
      <dc:description>
Selecting channels: Fluorescent cyclic nucleotide derivatives synthesized with a thiophenol motif&#8208;containing heterobifunctional cross&#8208;linking reagent efficiently activate CNG as well as HCN channels in the nanomolar range and are potential candidates to study related target proteins.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity fluorescent derivatives of cyclic adenosine and guanosine monophosphate are powerful tools for investigating their natural targets. Cyclic nucleotide&#8208;regulated ion channels belong to these targets and are vital for many signal transduction processes, such as vision and olfaction. The relation of ligand binding to activation gating is still challenging, and there is a need for fluorescent probes that enable the process to be broken down to the single&#8208;molecule level. This inspired us to prepare fluorophore&#8208;labeled cyclic nucleotides, which are composed of a bright dye and a nucleotide derivative with a thiophenol motif at position 8 that has already been shown to enable superior binding affinity. These bioconjugates were prepared by a novel cross&#8208;linking strategy that involves substitution of the nucleobase with a modified thiophenolate in good yield. Both fluorescent nucleotides are potent activators of different cyclic nucleotide&#8208;regulated ion channels with respect to the natural ligand and previously reported substances. Molecular docking of the probes excluding the fluorophore reveals that the high potency can be attributed to additional hydrophobic and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between the ligand and the protein. Moreover, the introduced substances have the potential to investigate related target proteins, such as cAMP&#8208; and cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinases, exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP or phosphodiesterases.

      <title>Dolastatin 15 from a Marine Cyanobacterium Suppresses HIF&#8208;1&#945; Mediated Cancer Cell Viability and Vascularization</title>
      <dc:description>
The true producer of the clinically relevant microtubule&#8208;destabilizing agent dolastatin 15 has been determined. Isogenic cell&#8208;line screening indicated that its cytotoxicity is mediated by HIF&#8208;1&#945;, controlling angiogenesis. Dolastatin 15 inhibited vascularization in cell and zebrafish models, thus suggesting its potential to treat vascularized tumors. RNA&#8208;seq provided a global snapshot of the anticancer effects.







Abstract
Chemical investigation of a benthic marine cyanobacterium yielded the anticancer agent dolastatin 15, originally isolated from a mollusk. Dolastatin 15 is a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing agent with analogues undergoing clinical evaluation. Profiling against a panel of isogenic HCT116 colorectal cancer cells showed remarkable differential cytotoxicity against the parental cells over isogenic cells lacking HIF or other key players in the pathway, including oncogenic KRAS and VEGF. Dolastatin 15 displayed an antivascularization effect in human endothelial cells and in zebrafish vhl mutants with activated Hif, thus signifying its clinical potential as a treatment for solid tumors with an angiogenic component. Global transcriptome analysis with RNA sequencing suggested that dolastatin 15 could affect other major cancer pathways that might not directly involve tubulin or HIF. The identification of the true producer of a clinically relevant agent is important for sustainable supply, as is understanding the biosynthesis, and future genetic manipulation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for analogue production.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Base Pairing of Rigid and Flexible Benzaldoxime Metallacycles</title>
      <dc:description>
Take the strain: A flexible PdII&#8208;mediated base pair of a benzaldoxime palladacycle disrupts oligonucleotide hybridization less than its rigid analogue, whereas the opposite is true for HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs. With a base pair of an incompatible geometry, increased flexibility alleviates some of the strain; with a strain&#8208;free base pair it merely leads to an increased entropic penalty of hybridization.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides incorporating a central C&#8208;nucleoside with either a rigid or flexible benzaldoxime base moiety have been synthesized, and the hybridization properties of their metallacyclic derivatives have been studied by UV melting experiments. In all cases, the metallated duplexes were less stable than their unmetallated counterparts, and the metallacyclic nucleobases did not show a clear preference for any of the canonical nucleobases as a base&#8208;pairing partner. With palladated oligonucleotides, increased flexibility translated to less severe destabilization, whereas the opposite was true for the mercurated oligonucleotides; this reflects the greater difficulties in accommodating a rigid PdII&#8208;mediated base pair than a rigid HgII&#8208;mediated base pair within the base stack of a double helix.

      <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Mediated Release of Inhibitors of Lysine&#8208;Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) from Prodrugs in Transfected Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Cells
</title>
      <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific targeting: Nitroaromatic prodrugs were activated by the bacterial nitroreductase NfsB (NTR) to selectively inhibit lysine&#8208;specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in transfected leukaemic cells. The effects of LSD1 inhibition and cytotoxicity of the side products were distinguished by negative controls. This system may be applied in targeting approaches to reach site&#8208;specific LSD1 inhibition.







Abstract
Lysine&#8208;specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has evolved as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). To approach the challenge of site&#8208;specific LSD1 inhibition, we developed an enzyme&#8208;prodrug system with the bacterial nitroreductase NfsB (NTR) that was expressed in the virally transfected AML cell line THP1&#8208;NTR+. The cellular activity of the NTR was proven with a new luminescent NTR probe. We synthesised a diverse set of nitroaromatic prodrugs that by design do not affect LSD1 and are reduced by the NTR to release an active LSD1 inhibitor. The emerging side products were differentially analysed using negative controls, thereby revealing cytotoxic effects. The 2&#8208;nitroimidazolyl prodrug of a potent LSD1 inhibitor emerged as one of the best prodrug candidates with a pronounced selectivity window between wild&#8208;type and transfected THP1 cells. Our prodrugs are selectively activated and release the LSD1 inhibitor locally, proving their suitability for future targeting approaches.

      <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxic Properties of Terpyridine&#8208;Based Copper Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Some things take time: How terpyridine&#8208;based copper complexes inhibit cancer&#8208;cell growth depends on the functional group para to the central pyridine ring. With naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl, the activity after 24&#8197;h of incubation with cell lines is higher than that of cisplatin. With chlorine, the complexes are still almost inactive after 24&#8197;h, but their cytotoxicity increases dramatically after 72&#8197;h.







Abstract
Five copper complexes supported by terpyridine ligands were prepared and characterized, viz. [Cu3Cl4(naphtpy)2][CuCl2] (1), [Cu2Cl2(naphtpy)2](ClO4)2 (2), [CuCl2(naphtpy)]2(MeOH)3(H2O) (3), [CuCl2(Cltpy)] (4) and [Cu(Cltpy)2](ClO4)2 (5); (where naphtpy stands for 4&#8217;&#8208;((naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methoxy)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine and Cltpy for 4&#8242;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine). Their ability to interact with DNA was investigated, and their cytotoxic behaviour was examined with three cells lines, namely human ovarian carcinoma cells (A2780), their derived cisplatin&#8208;resistant line (A2780cis), and human cervix adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa). All compounds show good cytotoxic properties (especially after 72&#8197;h of incubation). Remarkably, two compounds, 4 and 5, are still almost inactive after 24&#8197;h (particularly 4), but are highly active after 72&#8197;h, with IC50 values in the low&#8208;micromolar to sub&#8208;micromolar range. Compounds 1 and 2 induce necrosis, whereas late apoptosis is observed with 3&#8211;5, 4 exhibiting a behaviour close to that of cisplatin.

      <title>UV&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer States in Short Guanosine&#8208;Containing DNA Oligonucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>
Studying the photophysical dynamics of dG&#8208;containing oligonucleotides by time&#8208;resolved IR spectroscopy showed transient absorption changes pointing to excitation decay and vibrational cooling within a few picoseconds. On the 10&#8208;500 picosecond time range transient charge&#8208;transfer states were identified which are efficiently formed in these oligomers. The known reactivity and the high formation yield make charge&#8208;transfer states important promoters for secondary reactions in DNA.







Abstract
Charge transfer has proven to be an important mechanism in DNA photochemistry. In particular, guanine (dG) plays a major role as an electron donor, but the photophysical dynamics of dG&#8208;containing charge&#8208;transfer states have not been extensively investigated so far. Here, we use UV pump (266&#8197;nm) and picosecond IR probe (&#8764;5&#8211;7&#8197;&#956;m) spectroscopy to study ultrafast dynamics in dG&#8208;containing short oligonucleotides as a function of sequence and length. For the pure purine oligomers, we observed lifetimes for the charge&#8208;transfer states of the order of several hundreds of picoseconds, regardless of the oligonucleotide length. In contrast, pyrimidine&#8208;containing dinucleotides d(GT) and d(GC) show much faster relaxation dynamics in the 10 to 30&#8197;ps range. In all studied nucleotides, the charge&#8208;transfer states are formed with an efficiency of the order of &#8764;50&#8201;%. These photophysical characteristics will lead to an improved understanding of DNA damage and repair processes.

      <title>The Influence of Competing tRNA Abundance on Translation: Quantifying the Efficiency of Sense Codon Reassignment at Rarely Used Codons</title>
      <dc:description>
Making sense: We quantitatively evaluate the effect of the abundance of competing endogenous tRNAs on the ability of orthogonal tRNA variants to reassign E. coli sense codons. For rarely used codons, a strong correlation exists between tRNA abundance and reassignment efficiency. Our measurements suggest that the Ile AUA codon is a particularly good target for genetic code expansion.







Abstract
A quantitative understanding of how system composition and molecular properties conspire to determine the fidelity of translation is lacking. Our strategy directs an orthogonal tRNA to directly compete against endogenous tRNAs to decode individual targeted codons in a GFP reporter. Sets of directed sense codon reassignment measurements allow the isolation of particular factors contributing to translational fidelity. In this work, we isolated the effect of tRNA concentration on translational fidelity by evaluating reassignment of the 15 least commonly employed E. coli sense codons. Eight of the rarely used codons are reassigned with greater than 20&#8201;% efficiency. Both tRNA abundance and codon demand moderately inversely correlate with reassignment efficiency. Furthermore, the reassignment of rarely used codons does not appear to confer a fitness advantage relative to reassignment of other codons. These direct competition experiments also map potential targets for genetic code expansion. The isoleucine AUA codon is particularly attractive for the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids, with a nonoptimized reassignment efficiency of nearly 70&#8201;%.

      <title>Sanger Gap Sequencing for Genetic Alphabet Expansion of DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Mind the gap: Our unnatural base pair (UBP) Ds&#8208;Px has promising applications in xenobiology. Here, we present an improved Sanger sequencing method in which our UBPs are detected as clear gaps in sequence peak patterns, thus allowing easy determination of UBP positions. High processivity is also exhibited with three UBPs close together.







Abstract
Genetic alphabet expansion technology, creating new replicable and functional DNA molecules with unnatural base pairs (UBPs), is the novel promising research area of xenobiology. Recently, this technology has rapidly advanced, resulting in the need for a sequencing method for DNA molecules containing UBPs. However, all of the conventional sequencing methods, such as Sanger methods, are for four&#8208;letter DNA molecules. Here, we present an improved Sanger sequencing method (Sanger gap sequencing) for DNAs containing our UBP, Ds&#8208;Px, which appears as gaps in the sequencing peak patterns. By improving the sequencing reaction for efficient Ds&#8208;Px pairing and using modified Px substrates, we have developed a sequencing method with increased processivity and clear gap patterns for multiple Ds&#8208;Px pairs in various sequence contexts. This method is useful for UBP applications such as high&#8208;affinity DNA aptamer generation and semisynthetic organism creation involving UBPs. In addition, through this research, we found that the side chains of UBs greatly affect the efficiency of UB pairings in replication, thus suggesting further development of UBPs.

      <title>Synthesis, Derivatization and Photochemical Control of ortho&#8208;Functionalized Tetrachlorinated Azobenzene&#8208;Modified siRNAs</title>
      <dc:description>
Stop at the red light: RNAi activity is controlled by a modified tetrachlorinated azobenzene derivative embedded within a short interfering RNA. In mammalian cells, we can inactivate the siRNA duplex, and no RNA interference activity occurs in the presence of red light. When the red light is removed and the complex isomerizes back to an active form, and RNA interference activity resumes.







Abstract
We report the chemical synthesis and derivatization of an ortho&#8208;functionalized tetrachlorinated azobenzene diol. A 4&#8242;,4&#8208;dimethoxytrityl (DMT) phosphoramidite was synthesized for its site&#8208;specific incorporation within the sense strand of an siRNA duplex to form ortho&#8208;functionalized tetrachlorinated azobenzene&#8208;containing siRNAs (Cl&#8208;siRNAzos). Compared to a non&#8208;halogenated azobenzene, ortho&#8208;functionalized tetrachlorinated azobenzenes are capable of red&#8208;shifting the &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition from the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum into the visible range. Within this visible range, the azobenzene molecule can be reliably converted from trans to cis with red light (660&#8197;nm), and converted back to trans with violet wavelength light (410&#8197;nm) and/or thermal relaxation. We also report the gene&#8208;silencing ability of these Cl&#8208;siRNAzos in cell culture as well as their reversible control with visible light for up to 24&#8197;hours.

A 4&#8242;,4&#8208;dimethoxytrityl (DMT) phosphoramidite was synthesized for its site&#8208;specific incorporation within the sense strand of an siRNA duplex to form &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;functionalized tetrachlorinated azobenzene&#8208;containing siRNAs (Cl&#8208;siRNAzos). Compared to a non&#8208;halogenated azobenzene, &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;functionalized tetrachlorinated azobenzenes are capable of red&#8208;shifting the &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition from the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum into the visible range. Within this visible range, the azobenzene molecule can be reliably converted from &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; with red light (660&#8197;nm), and converted back to &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; with violet wavelength light (410&#8197;nm) and/or thermal relaxation. We also report the gene&#8208;silencing ability of these Cl&#8208;siRNAzos in cell culture as well as their reversible control with visible light for up to 24&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Xenobiology: A Journey towards Parallel Life Forms</title>
      <dc:description>
The alien life: A long journey towards estranged life forms begins here! How could we think of it in terms of science?







Abstract
Xenobiology is the science of estranged life forms. More specifically, this is an emergent technoscience that combines advances in genetic engineering with the design of biological systems based on unusual biochemistries delivered by chemical compounds of mostly anthropogenic origin. Xenobiology enables us to create and study strange new life forms, &#8220;aliens&#8221;, not in the way science fiction books do it, but in terms of enlightened science, design, and engineering.

      <title>Optochemical Control of Protein Degradation</title>
      <dc:description>
Stereochemistry matters: Optochemical approach has been used to regulate cellular protein degradation with a high resolution of spatiotemporal control. Two recent studies combining reversible optochemical functionalities with bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras, PHOTACs and photoPROTACs, are highlighted here to illustrate light&#8208;controlled degradation of desired protein.







Abstract
Optochemical approach has been successfully utilized to regulate cellular protein degradation with a high resolution of spatiotemporal control. In this highlight, we discuss two recent developments of combining reversible optochemical functionalities with the bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTACs to achieve light&#8208;controlled degradation of protein targets of interest. PHOTACs are azobeneze&#8208;containing molecules that are inactive as trans forms and active as cis forms, switchable upon pulse&#8208;irradiation with either an activating 390 nm light or a deactivating 525 nm light. In contrast, photoPROTACs are o&#8208;F4&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;containing molecules that can be switched between active trans isomers and inactive cis isomers by a single irradiation event using 415 or 530 nm light. Combining these two optochemically controlled PROTAC systems has the potential to achieve orthogonal control on protein degradation.

      <dc:description>
Light monitor: Electrospray ionization MS has great potential as a research tool for investigating photoreactions. This Minireview shows examples of the on&#8208;line monitoring of photo&#8208;intermediates and detailed studies of photo&#8208;transformations in the gas phase. Examples cover photocatalytic reactions with metal&#8208; and organophotocatalysts, photoswitching, photofragmentation, and applications to studying biomolecules.







Abstract
This Minireview highlights the application of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) to investigating photochemical reactions. We show possible approaches to on&#8208;line ESI&#8208;MS monitoring of photocatalytic reactions and give examples of the characterization of short&#8208;lived photochemical intermediates by ion spectroscopy. The minireview also exemplifies in&#8208;depth mass spectrometric studies of photoisomerization reactions and photofragmentation reactions. Apart from mechanistic studies, the coupling of photochemistry and mass spectrometry is a powerful approach to studying structure and properties of biomolecules. We show several examples focused on investigation of intrinsic properties of model biomolecules.

      <title>The Quest for Xenobiotic Enzymes: From New Enzymes for Chemistry to a Novel Chemistry of Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Unlimited: Current research on artificial enzymes conclusively shows that we are not limited to nature's biocatalytic repertoire. Functional xenobiology, that is, the implementation of new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions in&#8197;vivo, will open up a plethora of novel applications and has the potential for transformative biotechnological innovation. Herein, we highlight current challenges and future opportunities for xenobiotic reactions in living cells.







Abstract
Enzyme engineering has made impressive progress in the past decades, paving the way for the widespread use of enzymes for various purposes. In contrast to &#8220;classical&#8221; enzyme engineering, which focuses on optimizing specific properties of natural enzymes, a more recent trend towards the creation of artificial enzymes that catalyze fundamentally distinct, new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions is observable. While approaches for creating such enzymes differ significantly, they share the common goal of enabling biocatalytic novelty to broaden the range of applications for enzymes. Although most artificial enzymes reported to date are only moderately active and barely function in&#8197;vivo, they have the potential to endow cells with capabilities that were previously out of reach and thus herald a new wave of &#8220;functional xenobiology&#8221;. Herein, we highlight recent developments in the field of artificial enzymes with a particular focus on challenges and opportunities for their use in xenobiology.

      <title>Pb2+ as a Substrate and a Cofactor of a Porphyrin Metalation DNAzyme</title>
      <dc:description>
Leaded lights: T30695 DNA can catalyze Pb2+ insertion into protoporphyrin IX with another Pb2+ ion as a cofactor. This inserted Pb2+ causes blue&#8208;shifted emission from 635 to 590&#8197;nm, allowing simple ratiometric fluorescent sensing of Pb2+ with excellent sensitivity and selectivity.







Abstract
We herein report a DNAzyme named T30695 (sequence: (G3T)4) that can catalyze Zn2+ insertion into three different porphyrins in the presence of Pb2+ as a cofactor. Meanwhile, T30695 with Pb2+ alone was found to cause a shift in both the fluorescence and UV&#8208;vis spectra of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), thus suggesting that metalation of Pb2+ was also achieved at room temperature. From kinetic measurements, the reaction required two Pb2+ ions; this is consistent with one being a cofactor and the other being a substrate. No previous reports inserted Pb2+ into porphyrins by using DNAzymes or protein&#8208;based enzymes. This reaction was most significantly inhibited in the presence of K+ followed by Na+ and Li+, suggesting the importance of the Pb2+&#8208;stabilized G&#8208;quadruplex. When Pb2+ is inserted into PPIX, its emission blue shifts from 635 to 590&#8197;nm, thus allowing simple ratiometric fluorescent sensing with a detection limit of 1.2&#8197;nM Pb2+.

      <dc:description>
Room for a halogen: The plasticity of the aurachin biosynthetic pathway in the myxobacterium S. erecta was explored for the use of fluoro&#8208; and chloroanthranilic acids. Incorporation of the unnatural precursors was quantified. Three fluorinated aurachin analogues were produced in sufficient quantity to enable their antibacterial activities to be assessed.







Abstract
Enzyme promiscuity has important implications in the field of biocatalysis. In some cases, structural analogues of simple metabolic building blocks can be processed through entire pathways to give natural product derivatives that are not readily accessible by chemical means. In this study, we explored the plasticity of the aurachin biosynthesis pathway with regard to using fluoro&#8208; and chloroanthranilic acids, which are not abundant in the bacterial producers of these quinolone antibiotics. The incorporation rates of the tested precursor molecules disclosed a regiopreference for halogen substitution as well as steric limitations of enzymatic substrate tolerance. Three previously undescribed fluorinated aurachin derivatives were produced in preparative amounts by fermentation and structurally characterized. Furthermore, their antibacterial activities were evaluated in comparison to their natural congener aurachin D.

      <title>Xyloneside A: A New Glycosylated Incisterol Derivative from Xylaria sp. FB</title>
      <dc:description>
Glycosylated incisterol derivative xyloneside A has been isolated from an ascomycetous Xylaria hypoxylon species &#8211; a prolific fungal species. The structure was determined by spectroscopy, and its pharmacological properties were evaluated. Identification of fungal incisterols and ergosterol derivatives could lead to potential new antifungal drug scaffolds.







Abstract
Xylaria species are prolific natural product producers. Here, we report the characterization of a new glycosylated incisterol derivative, called xyloneside A (1) and two known lignans (2 and 3) from the ascomycetous Xylaria sp. FB. The structure of xyloneside A (1) was determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and electronic circular dichroism measurements. Xyloneside A is composed of a 1,2,3,4,5,10,19&#8208;heptanorergosterane skeleton and a &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannopyranose moiety. This is the first report of an incisterol derivative from an Ascomycete. The biological effects of the isolated metabolites on cytotoxicity, autophagy, cell&#8208;migration, and angiogenesis were evaluated.

      <title>The Selectivity of Fosfosal for STAT5b over STAT5a is Mediated by Arg566 in the Linker Domain</title>
      <dc:description>
The selectivity of fosfosal for STAT5b over STAT5a is mediated by Arg566 in the linker domain (Berg @UniLeipzig)







Abstract
Fosfosal is the O&#8208;phosphorylated derivative of salicylic acid, with documented clinical use as a prodrug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We recently discovered that fosfosal itself inhibits the protein&#8208;protein interaction domain, the SH2 domain, of the tumor&#8208;related transcription factor STAT5b. Here, we demonstrate that fosfosal is selective for STAT5b over its close homologue STAT5a. This selectivity is mediated by the STAT5b residue Arg566, located in the SH2 domain&#8208;adjacent linker domain. Our data provide further evidence for the role of the STAT linker domain in determining the activity of small molecules against the SH2 domain. We present a refined binding model for fosfosal and STAT5b, which can serve as the basis for the development of fosfosal&#8208;based STAT5b inhibitors.

      <title>Site&#8208;specific phosphorylation of Huntingtin exon 1 recombinant proteins enabled by the discovery of novel kinases</title>
      <dc:description>Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) within the first 17 amino acids (Nt17) of exon1 of the Huntingtin protein (Httex1) play important roles in modulating its cellular properties and functions in health and disease. In particular, phosphorylation of threonine and serine residues (T3, S13, and/or S16) has been shown to inhibit Htt aggregation  in vitro  and inclusion formation in cellular and animal models of Huntington&#8217;s disease (HD). In this manuscript, we describe a new and simple methodology for producing milligram quantities of highly pure wild type or mutant Httex1 proteins that are site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated at T3 or at both S13 and S16. This advance was enabled by 1) the discovery and validation of novel kinases that efficiently phosphorylate Httex1 at S13 and S16 (TBK1), at T3 (GCK) or T3 and S13 (TNIK and HGK); and, 2) the development of an efficient methodology for producing recombinant native Httex1 proteins using a SUMO&#8208;fusion expression and purification strategy. As proof of concept, we demonstrate how this method can be applied to produce Httex1 proteins that are both site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated and fluorescently labeled or isotopically labeled. Together, these advances should increase access to these valuable tools and expand the range of methods and experimental approaches that can be used to elucidate the mechanisms by which phosphorylation influences Httex1 structure, aggregation, interactome and function(s) in health and disease.</dc:description>

The covalent structure of chersinamycin was determined by NMR and tandem mass spectrometry methods in conjunction with chemical degradation studies.

      <title>19F&#8208;NMR&#8208;based fragment screening for 14 different biologically active RNAs and 10 DNA and protein counter&#8208;screens</title>
      <dc:description>We report here on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  19  F screening of 14 RNA targets with different secondary and tertiary structure to systematically assess druggability of RNAs. Our RNA targets include representative bacterial riboswitches that naturally bind with nanomolar affinity and high specificity to cellular metabolites of low molecular weight. Based on counter&#8208;screens against five DNAs and five proteins, we can show that RNA can be specifically targeted. To demonstrate the quality of the initial fragment library that has been designed for easy follow&#8208;up chemistry, we further show how to increase binding affinity from an initial fragment hit by chemistry that links the identified fragment to the intercalator acridine. Thus, we achieve low&#160;micromolar binding affinity without losing binding specificity between two different terminator structures.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report here on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  19  F screening of 14 RNA targets with different secondary and tertiary structure to systematically assess druggability of RNAs. Our RNA targets include representative bacterial riboswitches that naturally bind with nanomolar affinity and high specificity to cellular metabolites of low molecular weight. Based on counter&#8208;screens against five DNAs and five proteins, we can show that RNA can be specifically targeted. To demonstrate the quality of the initial fragment library that has been designed for easy follow&#8208;up chemistry, we further show how to increase binding affinity from an initial fragment hit by chemistry that links the identified fragment to the intercalator acridine. Thus, we achieve low&#160;micromolar binding affinity without losing binding specificity between two different terminator structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Site Selective Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclized peptides have seen a rise in popularity in the pharmaceutical industry as drug molecules. As such, new macrocyclization methodologies have become abundant in the last several decades. However, efficient methods of cyclization without the formation of side products have still remained a great challenge. Herein, we review the cyclization approaches that focus on site selective chemistry. Site selectivity in macrocyclization decreases the generation of side products, lending to a greater yield of desired peptide macrocycles. We will also take an in&#8208;depth look at the new exclusively intramolecular N&#8208;terminal site selective CyClick strategy for synthesis of cyclic peptides. The CyClick method utilizes imine formation between an aldehyde and the N&#8208;terminus. The imine is then trapped by a nucleophilic attack from the second amidic nitrogen in a non&#8208;reversible site selective fashion.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of Regiochemistry and Methylation on the Anticancer Activity of a Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Organometallic Nucleoside Analogue</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron works: A ferrocene derivative, one of a series of ferronucleosides designed by the Tucker group, shows micromolar toxicity in a range of cancer cell lines. Their latest research shows the importance to activity of having arms in adjacent positions, with the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;regioisomer much less active in bone cancer cell lines. On the other hand, N&#8208; or O&#8208;methylation has much less of an effect; this rules out a conventional mechanism of action for a nucleoside, giving further weight to one that involves the iron centre.

      <dc:description>
The notoamides are a fascinating class of anticancer natural products where two phylogenetically related fungal strains have evolved to generate enantiomeric (mirror image) terminal products. A study of the enzymes (NotI/NotI&#8242;) responsible for spirocycle formation revealed their differential flexibility in accepting the opposite substrate and catalyzing formation of the respective spiro&#8208;oxindole product. The preferential conversion of (&#8722;)&#8208;stephacidin&#8197;A by both enzymes suggests an evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor that was selective for (+)&#8208;notoamide B/A production.

      <dc:description>The thermostabilization of enzymes while retaining their activity and enantioselectivity for applied biocatalysis is an important topic in protein engineering. Rational and computational design strategies as well as directed evolution have been used successfully to thermostabilize enzymes.

      <dc:description>Anti&#8208;apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL&#8208;2) family proteins were proven targets for human cancers. Targeting the BH3&#8208;binding pockets of these anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins could reactivate apoptosis in BCL&#8208;2&#8208;depedent cancers. BFL&#8208;1 is a BCL&#8208;2 family protein overexpressed in various chemoresistant cancers. A unique cysteine at the binding interface of the BH3 and BFL&#8208;1 was previously proven as an intriguing targeting site to irreversibly inhibit BFL&#8208;1 functions with stabilized cyclic peptide bearing a covalent warhead. Recently, we developed a sulfonium tethered peptide cyclization strategy to construct peptide ligands which could selectively and efficiently react with cysteine(s) of target proteins nearby the interacting interface. Utilizing this method, we constructed a BFL&#8208;1 peptide inhibitor B4&#8208;MC, which could selectively conjugate with BFL&#8208;1 both in vitro and in cell. B4&#8208;MC showed good cellular uptake, colocalized with BFL&#8208;1 on mitochondria, and showed obvious growth inhibition of BFL&#8208;1 over&#8208;expressed cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights into protein stability in cell lysate by 19F NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>In living organisms, protein folding and function take place in an inhomogeneous, highly crowded environment possessing a concentration of diverse macromolecules of up to 400&#160;g/L. It has been shown that the intracellular environment has a pronounced effect on the stability, dynamics and function of the protein under study and has for this reason to be considered. However, most protein studies are neglecting the presence of these macromolecules. Consequently, we probe here the overall thermodynamic stability of cold shock protein B from&#160;  Bacillus subtilis  &#160;(  Bs  CspB) in cell lysate. We found that an increase in cell lysate concentration causes a monotonic increase in thermodynamic stability of&#160;  Bs  CspB. This result strongly underlines the importance of considering the biological environment when inherent protein parameters shall be quantitatively determined. Moreover, we demonstrate that the targeted application of&#160;  19  F NMR spectroscopy operates as an ideal tool utilized to protein studies performed in complex cellular surroundings.</dc:description>

      <title>An Enzyme Containing the Conserved Domain of Unknown Function DUF62 Acts as a Stereoselective (Rs,Sc)&#8208;S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine Hydrolase</title>
      <dc:description>Homochirality is a signature of biological systems. The essential and ubiquitous cofactor  S  &#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) is synthesized in cells from adenosine triphosphate and l&#8208;methionine to yield exclusively the (  S,S  )&#8208;SAM diastereomer.

However, (  S,S  )&#8208;SAM slowly racemizes at the sulfonium center to yield the inactive (  R,S  )&#8208;SAM, which can inhibit methyltransferases. Control of SAM homochirality has been shown to involve homocysteine  S  &#8208;methyltransferases in plants, insects, worms, yeast, and in ~18% of bacteria.

      <title>Prebiotic origin of pre&#8208;RNA building blocks in a urea &#8220;warm little pond&#8221; scenario.</title>
      <dc:description>Urea appears to be a key intermediate of important prebiotic synthetic pathways. Concentrated pools of urea likely existed on the surface of the early Earth, as urea is synthesized in significant quantities from hydrogen cyanide or cyanamide (widely accepted prebiotic molecules), it has extremely high water solubility, and it can concentrate to form eutectics from aqueous solutions. The dual nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic character of urea makes it an ideal precursor for the formation of nitrogenous bases. We propose a model for the origin of a variety of canonical and non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, including some known to form supramolecular assemblies that contain Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;like base pairs. These reactions involve urea condensation with other prebiotic molecules (e.g., malonic acid) that could be driven by environmental cycles (e.g., freezing/thawing, drying/wetting). The resulting heterocycle assemblies are compatible with the formation of nucleosides and, possibly, the chemical evolution of molecular precursors to RNA. We show that urea eutectics at moderate temperature represent a robust prebiotic source of nitrogenous heterocycles. The simplicity of these pathways, and their independence from specific or rare geological events, support the idea of urea being of fundamental importance to the prebiotic chemistry that gave rise to life on Earth.</dc:description>

      <title>Simple analysis of primary and secondary bile salt hydrolysis in mouse and human gut microbiome samples using fluorogenic substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Animals produce bile to maximize absorption of lipophilic nutrients in the gut. The physical properties of bile are largely dictated by amphipathic bile salt molecules, which also participate in signalling pathways by modulating physiological processes upon binding host receptors. Upon excretion of bile salts from the gall bladder into the intestine, the gut microbiome can create metabolites with modified signaling capabilities. The category and magnitude of bile salt metabolism can have positive or negative effects on the host. A key modification is bile salt hydrolysis, which is a prerequisite for all additional microbial transformations. We have synthesized five different fluorogenic bile salts for simple and continuous reporting of hydrolysis in both murine and human fecal samples. Our data demonstrate that most gut microbiomes have the highest capacity for hydrolysis of host&#8208;produced primary bile salts, but some microbially modified secondary bile salts also display significant turnover.</dc:description>

      <title>NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) Complexes Containing &#945;&#8208;Oligothiophenes for Applications in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>The design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;active photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;based cancer treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a challenge. While several NIR&#8208;Ru(II) scaffolds have been reported, this approach has not been proven in cells. This is the first report of NIR&#8208;Ru(II) PSs that are phototoxic to cancer cells, including highly pigmented B16F10 melanoma cells. The PS family incorporated a bis(1,8&#8208;naphthyridine)&#8208;based ligand (tpbn), a bidentate thiophene&#8208;based ligand (nT; n=0&#8211;4), and a monodentate 4&#8208;picoline ligand (4&#8208;pic). All compounds absorbed light &gt;800 nm with maxima near 730 nm. Transient absorption (TA) measurements indicated that n&#8805;4 thiophene rings (4T) positioned the PDT&#8208;active triplet intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT) excited state in energetic proximity to the lowest lying triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT). 4T had low micromolar phototoxicity with PIvis and PI733nm values as large as 90 and 12, respectively. Spectroscopic studies suggested that the long&#8208;lived (&#964;TA=3&#8211;6 &#181;s) 3ILCT was accessible from the 3MLCT state, but energetically uphill in the overall photophysics. The study highlights that phototoxic effects can be achieved with NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) PSs as long as the reactive 3ILCT states are energetically accessible from the low&#8208;energy 3MLCT states. It also demonstrates that tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR light can be used to activate the PSs in highly pigmented cells where melanin attenuates shorter wavelengths of light.</dc:description>

      <title>2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles inhibit virulence gene expression and block polymyxin resistance in Salmonella enterica</title>
      <dc:description>One promising strategy to combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria is to develop compounds that block bacterial defenses against antibacterial conditions produced by the innate immune system. Salmonella enterica , which causes food&#8208;borne gastroenteritis and typhoid fever, requires histidine kinases to resist innate immune defenses such as cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). Here, we report that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles block histidine kinase&#8208;dependent phenotypes in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. We found that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles inhibited growth in low Mg  2+  , a stressful condition that requires histidine kinase&#8208;mediated responses, and decreased expression of the virulence genes pagC and pagK . Furthermore, we discovered that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles weaken Salmonella &#8217;s resistance to polymyxin B and polymyxin E, which are last&#8208;line antibiotics and models for host defense CAMPs. These findings raise the possibilities that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles can block HK&#8208;mediated bacterial defenses and can be used in combination with polymyxins to treat infections caused by Salmonella .</dc:description>

      <title>The Impact of Halogenated Phenylalanine Derivatives on NFGAIL Amyloid Formation</title>
      <dc:description>The hexapeptide hIAPP  22&#8208;27  (NFGAIL) is known as a crucial amyloid core sequence of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) whose aggregates can be used to better understand the wild&#8208;type hIAPP's toxicity to &#946;&#8208;cell death. In amyloid research, the role of hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions as potential driving forces during the aggregation process is controversially discussed not only in case of NFGAIL, but also for amyloidogenic peptides in general. Here, we used halogenation of the aromatic residue as a strategy to modulate hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions and prepared a library of NFGAIL variants containing fluorinated and iodinated phenylalanine analogues. We used thioflavin T staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) to study the impact of side&#8208;chain halogenation on NFGAIL amyloid formation kinetics. Our data revealed a synergy between aggregation behavior and hydrophobicity of the phenylalanine residue. This study introduces systematic fluorination as a toolbox to further investigate the nature of the amyloid self&#8208;assembly process.</dc:description>

      <title>An Engineered Escherichia coli Strain with Synthetic Metabolism for In&#8208;cell Production of Translationally Active Methionine Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>In the last decades, it became clear that the canonical amino acid repertoire codified by the universal genetic code is not up to the needs of the emerging biotechnologies. For such reason, extensive genetic code re&#8208;engineering is essential to expand the scope of ribosomal protein translation, leading to reprogrammed microbial cells equipped with an alternative biochemical alphabet to be exploited as potentially factories for biotechnological purposes. The prerequisite for this to happen is a continuous intracellular supply of non&#8208;canonical amino acids from simple and cheap precursors via synthetic metabolism. We engineered an  E. coli  bacterial system that fulfills these requirements through the reconfiguration of the methionine biosynthetic pathway and the introduction of an exogenous direct transsulfuration pathway. Our metabolic scheme operates  in vivo,  rescuing intermediates from core cell metabolism, and combining them with small bio&#8208;orthogonal compounds. Our reprogrammed  E. coli  strain is capable of in&#8208;cell production of  L&#8208;azidohomoalanine, which is directly incorporated into proteins in response to methionine codons. We thereby constructed a prototype suitable for economic, versatile, green sustainable chemistry, pushing towards enzyme chemistry and biotechnology&#8208;based production.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress in the Synthesis of Homogeneous Erythropoietin (EPO) Glycoforms</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting just what you want: The FDA&#8208;approved glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) is an important therapeutic agent and is manufactured by using recombinant protein synthesis, generating a mixture of glycoforms. We highlight recent alternative approaches employing chemical protein synthesis or semisynthesis that produce a single EPO glycoform, thus allowing the roles of the glycans to be more fully understood.







Abstract
Erythropoietin (EPO) has been regarded as a therapeutic glycoprotein for the clinical treatment of anaemia since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Commercial production of the 165&#8208;residue glycoprotein is by recombinant protein expression using mammalian cell lines that renders a complex mixture of glycoforms that have an identical amino acid sequence but variations in the structures of the pendant glycans. This heterogeneous nature of human recombinant EPO restricts structural and bioactivity studies in medicinal chemistry. Consequently, chemical synthesis provides an elegant approach for the preparation of complex homogeneous glycoproteins from a readily accessible pool of amino acids and sugars. In addition, the combination of chemical and biosynthesis enables robust and large&#8208;scale production of homogeneous EPO. The scope of this minireview is to summarise the recent advances in the chemical and semisyntheses of homogeneous EPO glycoforms, highlighting the versatile approaches to the preparation and structural manipulations of the carbohydrate chains incorporated into synthetic EPO glycoproteins.

      <dc:description>The global pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 calls for a fast development of antiviral drugs against this particular coronavirus. Chemical tools to facilitate inhibitor discovery as well as detection of target engagement by hit or lead compounds from high throughput screens are therefore in urgent need. We here report novel, selective activity&#8208;based probes that enable detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease. The probes are based on acyloxymethyl ketone reactive electrophiles combined with a peptide sequence including non&#8208;natural amino acids that targets the non&#8208;primed site of the main protease substrate binding cleft. They are the first activity&#8208;based probes for the main protease of coronaviruses and display target labeling within a human proteome without background.

      <title>Comparison of multiple factors that impact the efficiency of non&#8208;enzymatic DNA ligation: Key parameters for maximizing ligation rates and yields with carbodiimide activation</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical ligation is an important tool for the generation of synthetic DNA structures, which are used for a wide range of applications. Surprisingly, reported chemical ligation yields can range from 30% to 95% for the same chemical activating agent and comparable DNA structures. We report a systematic study of DNA ligation using a well&#8208;defined bimolecular test system and a water&#8208;soluble carbodiimide (EDC) as a phosphate&#8208;activating agent. Our results emphasize the interplay between template&#8208;substrate complex stability and the rates of the chemical steps of ligation, with 3&#180; phosphate substrates providing yields near 100% after 24 hours for particularly favorable reaction conditions. Ligation rates are also shown to be sensitive to the identity of base pairs flanking a nick site, with as much as three&#8208;fold variation.

      <title>Synthesis of modified galacto&#8208; or fuco&#8208;clusters exploiting siderophore pathway to inhibit LecA or LecB associated virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
      <dc:description>Galacto and fuco&#8208;clusters conjugated with one to three catechol or hydroxamate motifs were synthesized to target LecA and LecB lectins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) localized in the outer membrane and in the bacterium. The resulting glycocluster pseudosiderophore conjugates were evaluated as Trojan horse to cross the outer membrane of (PA) thanks to iron transport. The data suggests that glycoclusters with catechol moieties were able to hijack the iron transport while those with hydroxamates showed strong non&#8208;specific interactions. Mono&#8208; and tri&#8208;catechol galactoclusters ( G1C and G3C ) were evaluated as inhibitors of the infection by PA in comparison with the free galactocluster ( G0 ). All of them exhibited an inhibitory effect between 46 to 75% at 100 mM with a higher potency than G0 .

      <title>A bimane&#8208;based peptide staple for combined helical induction and fluorescent imaging</title>
      <dc:description>The thiol&#8208;selective fluorescent imaging agent, dibromobimane, is repurposed to cross&#8208;link cysteine and homocysteine containing peptides, with the resulting bimane&#8208;linker acting as both a structural constraint and a fluorescent tag. Macrocyclisation was conducted on nine short peptides containing two cysteines and/or homocysteines, both on&#8208;resin and in buffered aqueous solution, to give macrocycles ranging in size from 16 ( i &#8208; i +2)&#160;to 31 ( i &#8208; i +7)&#160;atoms. The structures were defined by CD, NMR structure calculations using Xplor&#8208;NIH, NMR secondary shift and&#160;J H&#945;NH &#160;analyses, to reveal helical structure in the&#160; i &#8208; i +4 ( 1 ,&#160; 2 ), and&#160; i &#8208; i +3 ( 5 ) constrained peptides. Cellular uptake studies were conducted with three of the macrocycles. Subsequent confocal imaging revealed bright punctate fluorescence within the cytosol indicative of peptides trapped in endocytic vesicles. These studies demonstrate that dibromobimane is an effective tool to define secondary structure within short peptides, whilst simultaneously introducing a fluorescent tag suitable for common cell&#8208;based experiments.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The thiol&#8208;selective fluorescent imaging agent, dibromobimane, is repurposed to cross&#8208;link cysteine and homocysteine containing peptides, with the resulting bimane&#8208;linker acting as both a structural constraint and a fluorescent tag. Macrocyclisation was conducted on nine short peptides containing two cysteines and/or homocysteines, both on&#8208;resin and in buffered aqueous solution, to give macrocycles ranging in size from 16 ( i &#8208; i +2)&#160;to 31 ( i &#8208; i +7)&#160;atoms. The structures were defined by CD, NMR structure calculations using Xplor&#8208;NIH, NMR secondary shift and&#160;J H&#945;NH &#160;analyses, to reveal helical structure in the&#160; i &#8208; i +4 ( 1 ,&#160; 2 ), and&#160; i &#8208; i +3 ( 5 ) constrained peptides. Cellular uptake studies were conducted with three of the macrocycles. Subsequent confocal imaging revealed bright punctate fluorescence within the cytosol indicative of peptides trapped in endocytic vesicles. These studies demonstrate that dibromobimane is an effective tool to define secondary structure within short peptides, whilst simultaneously introducing a fluorescent tag suitable for common cell&#8208;based experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Pathogenesis&#8208;related (PR) proteins constitute a broad class of plant proteins with analogues found throughout nature from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. PR proteins were first noted in plants as part of the hypersensitive response but have since been assigned an array of biological roles. The PR10/Bet v 1&#8208;like proteins are a subset of PR proteins characterized by an ability to bind an wide range of lipophilic ligands, uniquely positioning them as contributors to specialized biosynthetic pathways. PR10/Bet v 1&#8208;like proteins participate in the production of plant alkaloids and phenolics including flavonoids, both as general binding proteins and in special cases as catalysts. Owing initially to the perceived allergenic properties of PR10/Bet v 1&#8208;like proteins, many were studied at the structural level to elucidate the basis for ligand binding. These studies were foundational to more recent efforts to understand higher&#8208;level structural order and how PR10/Bet v 1&#8208;like proteins catalyse key reactions in plant pathways. Synthetic biology aimed at reconstituting plant specialized metabolism in microorganisms uses knowledge of these proteins to fine&#8208;tune performance in new systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids with Extended Backbones</title>
      <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) forms a triple helix with double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) stabilized by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding zipper formed by PNA&#8217;s backbone amides (N&#8208;H) interacting with RNA phosphate oxygens. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern is enabled by the matching ~5.7 &#197; spacing (typical for A&#8208;form dsRNA) between PNA&#8217;s backbone amides and RNA phosphate oxygens. We hypothesized that extending the PNA&#8217;s backbone by one &#8208;CH2&#8208; group may bring the distance between PNA amide N&#8208;H closer to 7 &#197;, favourable for hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the B&#8208;form dsDNA phosphate oxygens. Extension of PNA backbone was expected to selectively stabilize PNA&#8208;DNA triplexes compared to PNA&#8208;RNA. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized triplex&#8208;forming PNAs that had the pseudopeptide backbones extended by an additional &#8208;CH2&#8208; group in three different positions. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of the binding affinity of these extended PNA analogues for the matched dsDNA and dsRNA showed that, contrary to our structural reasoning, extending the PNA backbone at any position had a strong negative effect on triplex stability. Our results suggest that PNA may have an inherent preference for A&#8208;form&#8208;like conformations when binding double&#8208;stranded nucleic acids. It appears that the original six atoms long PNA backbone is an almost perfect fit for binding to A&#8208;form nucleic acids.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are a fascinating example of complex natural product biosynthesis, with the non&#8208;ribosomal synthesis of the peptide core coupled to a cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated cyclisation cascade that crosslinks aromatic side chains within this peptide.

      <title>Distinct mechanisms for processing autophagy protein LC3&#8208;PE by RavZ and ATG4B</title>
      <dc:description>Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process involved in the elimination of proteins, organelles and pathogens. Lipidated LC3 proteins that are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) play a key role in autophagosome biogenesis. Endogenous ATG4&#8208;mediated deconjugation of LC3&#8208;PE is required for LC3 recycling. However, the  Legionella  effector RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3&#8208;PE to inhibit autophagy. It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3&#8208;PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semi&#8208;synthetic LC3&#8208;PE proteins containing C&#8208;terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C&#8208;terminal structure of LC3&#8208;PE with ATG4/RavZ&#8208;mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln  116  , Phe  119  and Gly  120  of LC3&#8208;PE are required for the cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, while Glu  117  (LC3) is specific for the cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B but not in RavZ. Met  63  and Gln  64  at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif (116&#8208;120) with ATG4 and RavZ may determine the specificity of cleavage site.</dc:description>

      <title>Methyltransferase contingencies in the pathway of everninomicin D antibiotics and analogs</title>
      <dc:description>Everninomicins are orthoester oligosaccharide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. Everninomicins act via disruption of ribosomal assembly in a distinct region in comparison to clinically prescribed drugs. We employed microporous intergeneric conjugation with  Escherichia coli  to manipulate  Micromonospora  for targeted gene&#8208;replacement studies of multiple putative methyltransferases across the octasaccharide scaffold of everninomicin effecting the A1  , C, F, and H&#8208;rings. Analyses of gene&#8208;replacement and genetic complementation mutants established the mutability of the everninomicin scaffold through the generation of twelve previously unreported analogs and, together with previous results, permitted assignment of the ten methyltransferases required for everninomicin biosynthesis. The in vitro activity of A1  &#8208; and H&#8208;ring modifying methyltransferases demonstrated the ability to catalyze late&#8208;stage modification of the scaffold on an A  1  &#8208;ring phenol and H&#8208;ring C&#8208;4&#8217; hydroxyl moiety. Together these results establish the potential of the everninomicin scaffold for modification via mutagenesis and in vitro modification of advanced biosynthetic intermediates.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Everninomicins are orthoester oligosaccharide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. Everninomicins act via disruption of ribosomal assembly in a distinct region in comparison to clinically prescribed drugs. We employed microporous intergeneric conjugation with  Escherichia coli  to manipulate  Micromonospora  for targeted gene&#8208;replacement studies of multiple putative methyltransferases across the octasaccharide scaffold of everninomicin effecting the A1  , C, F, and H&#8208;rings. Analyses of gene&#8208;replacement and genetic complementation mutants established the mutability of the everninomicin scaffold through the generation of twelve previously unreported analogs and, together with previous results, permitted assignment of the ten methyltransferases required for everninomicin biosynthesis. The in vitro activity of A1  &#8208; and H&#8208;ring modifying methyltransferases demonstrated the ability to catalyze late&#8208;stage modification of the scaffold on an A  1  &#8208;ring phenol and H&#8208;ring C&#8208;4&#8217; hydroxyl moiety. Together these results establish the potential of the everninomicin scaffold for modification via mutagenesis and in vitro modification of advanced biosynthetic intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Hydroxyquinoline&#8208;Based Unnatural Amino Acid for the Design of Novel Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Expanding biotransformations: Several metal&#8208;binding noncanonical amino acids have been incorporated into protein scaffolds to create artificial metalloenzymes. We introduced 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)propanoic acid (HQAla) into lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) and complexed it with several transition metal ions such as CuII, ZnII and RhIII to showcase its catalytic potential in a variety of different reactions.







Abstract
We have examined the potential of the noncanonical amino acid (8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)alanine (HQAla) for the design of artificial metalloenzymes. HQAla, a versatile chelator of late transition metals, was introduced into the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) by stop codon suppression methodology. LmrR_HQAla was shown to complex efficiently with three different metal ions, CuII, ZnII and RhIII to form unique artificial metalloenzymes. The catalytic potential of the CuII&#8208;bound LmrR_HQAla enzyme was shown through its ability to catalyse asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Craft alkylation and water addition, whereas the ZnII&#8208;coupled enzyme was shown to mimic natural Zn hydrolase activity.

      <title>Probing the Compatibility of an Enzyme&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay toward the Reprogramming of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Adenylation Domains</title>
      <dc:description>
A reprogramming platform: An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of aryl acid adenylation (A) domains. Combined with a directed&#8208;evolution approach, the ELISA technology can be used to isolate aryl acid A&#8208;domains with the desired activity.







Abstract
An important challenge in natural product biosynthesis is the biosynthetic design and production of artificial peptides. One of the most promising strategies is reprogramming adenylation (A) domains to expand the substrate repertoire of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, the precise detection of subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of A domains might accelerate their reprogramming. Here we show that an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect the effects of substrate binding pocket residue substitutions in A&#8208;domains. When coupled with a set of aryl acid A&#8208;domain variants (total of nine variants), the ELISA can analyze the subtle differences in their active&#8208;site architectures. Furthermore, the ELISA&#8208;based screening was able to identify the variants with substrate binding pockets that accepted a non&#8208;cognate substrate from an original pool of 45. These studies demonstrate that ELISA is a reliable platform for providing insights into the active&#8208;site properties of A&#8208;domains and can be applied for the reprogramming of NRPS A&#8208;domains.

      <title>Trimethylation of the R5 Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptide Increases Silica Particle Size by Redirecting Orthosilicate Binding</title>
      <dc:description>
Unexpected direction: The silaffin R5 peptide precipitates silica from solutions of orthosilicic acid. Post&#8208;translational modifications in R5 modulate silica morphology. We studied the effect of lysine trimethylation, which installs a positive charge, on silica particle formation. Surprisingly, trimethylation led to larger particle sizes by reducing the maximum activity of R5 and redirecting orthosilicate binding to the R5N terminus.







Abstract
The unmodified R5 peptide from silaffin in the diatom Cylindrotheca fusiformis rapidly precipitates silica particles from neutral aqueous solutions of orthosilicic acid. A range of post&#8208;translational modifications found in R5 contribute toward tailoring silica morphologies in a species&#8208;specific manner. We investigated the specific effect of R5 lysine side&#8208;chain trimethylation, which adds permanent positive charges, on silica particle formation. Our studies revealed that a doubly trimethylated R5K3,4me3 peptide has reduced maximum activity yet, surprisingly, generates larger silica particles. Molecular dynamics simulations of R5K3,4me3 binding by the precursor orthosilicate anion revealed that orthosilicate preferentially associates with unmodified lysine side&#8208;chain amines and the peptide N terminus. Thus, larger silica particles arise from reduced orthosilicate association with trimethylated lysine side chains and their redirection to the N terminus of the R5 peptide.

      <title>Effect of metal shielding on the enzymatic construction of artificial base pairs</title>
      <dc:description>Formation of metal base pairs is a versatile method for the introduction of metal cations into nucleic acids that has been applied in numerous applications including the construction of metal nanowires, development of energy, charge transfer devices and expansion of the genetic alphabet.

      <title>Probing the Interaction between HIV&#8208;1 Protease and the Homodimeric p66/p66&#8217; Reverse Transcriptase Precursor by Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance EPR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Opening up p66: Q&#8208;band pulsed double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy shows that binding of HIV&#8208;1 protease to the asymmetric p66/p66&#8242; homodimer precursor of HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase favours an open conformation of the p66&#8242; subunit allowing the linker connecting the RNaseH and connection domains to bind to the active site of protease in an extended conformation.







Abstract
Following excision from the Gag&#8208;Pol polyprotein, HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase is released as an asymmetric homodimer comprising two p66 subunits that are structurally dissimilar but identical in amino acid sequence. Subsequent cleavage of the RNase H domain from only one of the subunits, denoted p66&#8242;, results in the formation of the mature p66/p51 enzyme in which catalytic activity resides in the p66 subunit, and the p51 subunit (derived from p66&#8242;) provides a supporting structural scaffold. Here, we probe the interaction of the p66/p66&#8242; asymmetric reverse transcriptase precursor with HIV&#8208;1 protease by pulsed Q&#8208;band double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy to measure distances between nitroxide labels introduced at surface&#8208;engineered cysteine residues. The data suggest that the flexible, exposed linker between the RNaseH and connection domains in the open state of the p66&#8242; subunit binds to the active site of protease in a configuration that is similar to that of extended peptide substrates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening up p66&lt;/b&gt;: Q&#8208;band pulsed double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy shows that binding of HIV&#8208;1 protease to the asymmetric p66/p66&#8242; homodimer precursor of HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase favours an open conformation of the p66&#8242; subunit allowing the linker connecting the RNaseH and connection domains to bind to the active site of protease in an extended conformation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following excision from the Gag&#8208;Pol polyprotein, HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase is released as an asymmetric homodimer comprising two p66 subunits that are structurally dissimilar but identical in amino acid sequence. Subsequent cleavage of the RNase H domain from only one of the subunits, denoted p66&#8242;, results in the formation of the mature p66/p51 enzyme in which catalytic activity resides in the p66 subunit, and the p51 subunit (derived from p66&#8242;) provides a supporting structural scaffold. Here, we probe the interaction of the p66/p66&#8242; asymmetric reverse transcriptase precursor with HIV&#8208;1 protease by pulsed Q&#8208;band double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy to measure distances between nitroxide labels introduced at surface&#8208;engineered cysteine residues. The data suggest that the flexible, exposed linker between the RNaseH and connection domains in the open state of the p66&#8242; subunit binds to the active site of protease in a configuration that is similar to that of extended peptide substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Convergent Evolution of Fungal Cysteine Dioxygenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Synchronicity: Numerous agaricomycetes contain an unusual cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) that emerged by gene duplication and adaptation from an ergothioneine biosynthetic sulfoxide synthase. It is unrelated to the thiol dioxygenases that occur in animals, plants, and bacteria. The activity of type II CDOs depends on the presence of TMH, thus synchronizing cellular cysteine oxidation with ergothioneine production. OK!







Abstract
Cupin&#8208;type cysteine dioxygenases (CDOs) are non&#8208;heme iron enzymes that occur in animals, plants, bacteria and in filamentous fungi. In this report, we show that agaricomycetes contain an entirely unrelated type of CDO that emerged by convergent evolution from enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine. The activity of this CDO type is dependent on the ergothioneine precursor N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine. The metabolic link between ergothioneine production and cysteine oxidation suggests that the two processes might be part of the same chemical response in fungi, for example against oxidative stress.

      <title>Analysis of Modified Nucleotide Aptamer Library Generated by Thermophilic DNA Polymerases</title>
      <dc:description>
To select aptamers with modified nucleotides, the appropriate DNA polymerase must be designated. We studied eight polymerases and demonstrated that incorporating a tryptophan&#8208;like nucleotide into aptamer libraries by emulsion PCR and KOD XL had an insignificant effect on the PCR bias and did not distort the sequence space, thus making this approach the method of choice.







Abstract
One of the pivotal steps in aptamer selection is the amplification of target&#8208;specific oligonucleotides by thermophilic DNA polymerases; it can be a challenging task if nucleic acids possessing modified nucleotides are to be amplified. Hence, the identification of compatible DNA polymerase and modified nucleotide pairs is necessary for effective selection of aptamers with unnatural nucleotides. We present an in&#8208;depth study of using 5&#8208;indolyl&#8208;AA&#8208;dUTP (TAdUTP) to generate oligonucleotide libraries for aptamer selection. We found that, among the eight studied DNA polymerases, only Vent(exo&#8208;) and KOD XL are capable of adapting TAdUTP, and that replacing dTTP did not have a significant effect on the productivity of KOD XL. We demonstrated that water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion PCR is suitable for the generation of aptamer libraries of modified nucleotides. Finally, high&#8208;throughput sequence analysis showed that neither the error rate nor the PCR bias was significantly affected by using TAdUTP. In summary, we propose that KOD XL and TAdUTP could be effectively used for aptamer selection without distorting the sequence space of random oligonucleotide libraries.

      <title>The Rieske Oxygenase SnoT Catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxylation of l&#8208;Rhodosamine in Nogalamycin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Order! The binding of nogalamycin to DNA is facilitated by its carbohydrate units. The 2&#8220;&#8208; and 4&#8221;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine are particularly important for the bioactivity due to hydrogen bonding interactions. We have elucidated the biosynthetic steps for l&#8208;nogalamine formation and show that SnoT installs the 2&#8220;&#8208;hydroxy group, followed by 2&#8211;5&#8221;&#8208;carbocyclization and 4&#8220;&#8208;epimerization by SnoK and SnoN, respectively.







Abstract
Nogalamycin is an anthracycline anti&#8208;cancer agent that intercalates into the DNA double helix. The binding is facilitated by two carbohydrate units, l&#8208;nogalose and l&#8208;nogalamine, that interact with the minor and major grooves of DNA, respectively. However, recent investigations have shown that nogalamycin biosynthesis proceeds through the attachment of l&#8208;rhodosamine (2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;l&#8208;nogalamine) to the aglycone. Herein, we demonstrate that the Rieske enzyme SnoT catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation of l&#8208;rhodosamine as an initial post&#8208;glycosylation step. Furthermore, we establish that the reaction order continues with 2&#8211;5&#8242;&#8242; carbocyclization and 4&#8242;&#8242; epimerization by the non&#8208;heme iron and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent enzymes SnoK and SnoN, respectively. These late&#8208;stage tailoring steps are important for the bioactivity of nogalamycin due to involvement of the 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine in hydrogen bonding interactions with DNA.

      <title>Insight into Isoprenoid Biosynthesis by Functional Analysis of Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthases from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
      <dc:description>
Analysis of E&#8208;IDSs from Mycobacterium species has clarified their functions: Mv0992 and Mv1577 would be E&#8208;C45 and E&#8208;C20 synthases, respectively; Mv3536 (an E&#8208;C10&#8211;20 synthase) released an E&#8208;C10 intermediate during continuous condensation; Rv0562 and Rv2173 had similar functions to Mv0992 and Mv3536, respectively; and reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as a substrate for Z&#8208;IDS (Mv3822).







Abstract
Comprehensive functional analyses of E&#8208;isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (E&#8208;IDSs) from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium vanbaalenii have been performed. Mv0992 and Mv1577 represent a nonaprenyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C45) synthase and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C20) synthase, respectively. Although Mv3536 was identified as an E&#8208;C20 synthase using a single enzyme, co&#8208;incubation of Mv3536 and Z&#8208;IDSs (Mv4662 and Mv3822) strongly suggested it releases an intermediate geranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C10) during a continuous condensation reaction. Mv0992 and Mv3536 functions differed from those of the previously reported pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis homologues Rv0562 and Rv2173, respectively. Re&#8208;analysis of Rv0562 and Rv2173 demonstrated that their functions were similar to those of Mv0992 and Mv3536 (Rv0562: E&#8208;C45 synthase; Rv2173: E&#8208;C10&#8211;15 synthase). The newly proposed functions of Rv0562 and Rv2173 would be in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and glycosyl carrier lipids essential for growth. Furthermore, a reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as the Z&#8208;IDS of the Mv3822 substrate, thereby introducing a potentially novel pathway of cyclic sesquarterpene biosynthesis.

      <title>Photochemical RNA Editing of C to U by Using Ultrafast Reversible RNA Photo&#8208;crosslinking in DNA/RNA Duplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Pinpoint C to U conversion: We evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The most hydrophilic photo&#8208;crosslinker induced the fastest deamination of cytosine. Inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing.

RNA editing, which is used to edit nucleobases in RNA strands; is more feasible for use in medical applications than DNA editing. We previously reported the photochemical conversion of cytosine to uracil, which required photo&#8208;crosslinking, deamination, and photo&#8208;splitting. Here, we evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The photo&#8208;crosslinker 3&#8208;carboxyvinylcarbazole(OHVK), which is more hydrophilic than 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole(CNVK), 3&#8208;carboxyamidevinylcarbazole(NH2VK), and 3&#8208;methoxy carbonylvinylcarbazole(OMeVK), induced faster deamination of cytosine. Furthermore, inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing. Upon evaluation of the conversion from cytosine to uracil in RNA, the use of oligodeoxynucleotides containing OHVK and inosine and the polarity of the bases surrounding the target cytosine were found to be crucial.

      <title>Cofactors as Molecular Fossils To Trace the Origin and Evolution of Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Mutual support: Cofactors play important roles in the origin and evolution of proteins. Nucleotide&#8208;containing cofactors might have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from random amino acid sequences. Metallic cofactors also link protein evolution with geochemical variations; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry.







Abstract
Due to their early origin and extreme conservation, cofactors are valuable molecular fossils for tracing the origin and evolution of proteins. First, as the order of protein folds binding with cofactors roughly coincides with protein&#8208;fold chronology, cofactors are considered to have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from pools of random amino acid sequences. Second, in the subsequent evolution of proteins, cofactors still played an important role. More interestingly, as metallic cofactors evolved with geochemical variations, some geochemical events left imprints in the chronology of protein architecture; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry. In this paper, we attempt to review the molecular fossils used in tracing the origin and evolution of proteins, with a special focus on cofactors.

      <title>Towards Zwitterionic Oligonucleotides with Improved Properties: the NAA/LNA&#8208;Gapmer Approach</title>
      <dc:description>Oligonucleotides (ON) are promising therapeutic candidates, for instance by blocking endogenous mRNA (antisense mechanism). However, ON usually require structural modifications of the native nucleic acid backbone to ensure satisfying pharmacokinetic properties. One such strategy to design novel antisense oligonucleotides is the replacement of native phosphate diester units by positively charged artificial linkages, thus leading to (partially) zwitterionic backbone structures. Herein, we report a gapmer architecture comprised of one zwitterionic central segment ('gap') containing nucleosyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;modifications and two outer segments of locked nucleic acid (LNA). This NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach furnished a partially zwitterionic ON with optimised properties: (i) the formation of stable ON&#8208;RNA duplexes with base&#8208;pairing fidelity and superior target selectivity at 37 &#176;C; and (ii) excellent stability in complex biological media. Overall, the NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach is thus established as a strategy to design partially zwitterionic ON for the future development of novel antisense agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Macrocyclization of a ligand targeting a toxic RNA dramatically improves potency</title>
      <dc:description>RNA molecules both contribute to and are causative of many human diseases. One method to perturb RNA function is to target its structure with small molecules. However, discovering bioactive ligands for RNA targets is challenging. Here, we show that the bioactivity of a linear dimeric ligand that inactivates the RNA trinucleotide repeat expansion that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 [DM1; r(CUG)exp] can be improved by macrocyclization. Indeed, the macrocyclic compound is 10&#8208;fold more potent than the linear compound for improving DM1&#8208;associated defects in cells, including in patient&#8208;derived myotubes (muscle cells). This enhancement in potency is due to the macrocycle&#8217;s increased affinity and selectivity for the target, thereby inhibiting r(CUG)exp&#8217;s toxic interaction with muscleblind&#8208;like 1 (MBNL1), and its superior cell permeability. Macrocyclization may prove an effective way to enhance the bioactivity of modularly assembled ligands targeting RNA.</dc:description>

      <title>Multivalent Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Macromolecules: Linking Increased Binding Affinity with Enhanced Innate Immune Killing</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the line of fire: Macromolecular antibody recruiting molecules can bind though multivalent interaction with endogenous antibodies and draw these to the surface of target cells or pathogen, thereby marking the latter for innate immune destruction.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) are a novel class of immunotherapeutics. They are capable of introducing antibodies onto disease&#8208;relevant targets such as cancer cells, bacterial cells or viruses. This can induce antibody&#8208;mediated immune responses such as antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody&#8208;dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), which can kill the pathogen. In contrast to the classic ARMs, multivalent ARMs could offer the advantage of increasing the efficiency of antibody recruitment and subsequent innate immune killing. Such compounds consist of multiple target&#8208;binding termini (TBT) and/or antibody&#8208;binding termini (ABT). Those multivalent interactions are able to convert low binding affinities into increased binding avidities. This minireview summarizes the current status of multivalent ARMs and gives insight into possible benefits, hurdles still to be overcome and future perspectives.

      <title>Exploring the Chemoselectivity towards Cysteine Arylation by Cyclometallated AuIII Compounds: New Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting your gold right: Cyclometallated AuIII complexes with bidentate C^N&#8208;donor ligands enable chemoselective cysteine modification of peptides by C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination. By using combined high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and QM/MM studies, further understanding of the mechanisms of AuIII&#8208;templated cross&#8208;coupling leading to cysteine arylation was achieved; this is essential to design selective gold compounds for bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions.







Abstract
To gain more insight into the factors controlling efficient cysteine arylation by cyclometallated AuIII complexes, the reaction between selected gold compounds and different peptides was investigated by high&#8208;resolution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR&#8208;LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS). The deduced mechanisms of C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling, also supported by density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, evidenced the key role of secondary peptidic gold binding sites in favouring the process of reductive elimination.

      <title>Increased Lipophilicity of Halogenated Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Leads to Decreased Phototoxicity in&#8197;vitro when Used as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
One up, one down: RuII polypyridyl complexes are prime candidates for the development of new photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. Increasing their lipophilicity could result in improved pharmacological properties. The relationship between lipophilicity and in&#8197;vitro phototoxicity of halogenated RuII complexes was investigated.







Abstract
In the fight against cancer, photodynamic therapy is generating great interest thanks to its ability to selectively kill cancer cells without harming healthy tissues. In this field, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, and more specifically, complexes with dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz) as a ligand are of particular interest due to their DNA&#8208;binding and photocleaving properties. However, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes can sometimes suffer from low lipophilicity, which hampers cellular internalisation through passive diffusion. In this study, four new [Ru(dppz&#8208;X2)3]2+ complexes (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I) were synthesized and their lipophilicity (logP), cytotoxicity and phototoxicity on cancerous and noncancerous cell lines were assessed. This study shows that, counterintuitively, the phototoxicity of these complexes decreases as their lipophilicity increases; this could be due solely to the atomic radius of the halogen substituents.

      <title>Chemical Knockdown of MicroRNA with Small&#8208;Molecule Chimeras</title>
      <dc:description>
Targeting &#8220;undruggable&#8221; RNA: In this concept article, we introduce the development and application of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) to the targeted degradation of microRNAs. Due to their high specificity and potency, SMCs present an unprecedented chemical approach to knock down endogenous miRNAs, and thus should contribute to both biological discovery and therapeutic development.







Abstract
This concept article introduces the emerging area of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) for knocking down microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous gene silencers involved in diverse pathological processes. Compared with agents for genetic knockdown, small&#8208;molecules hold significant promise in this field due to their ideal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The SMCs introduced here are hetero&#8208;bifunctional molecules comprising small&#8208;molecule binders (SMBs) of miRNAs and chemical functionalities that either directly cleave RNAs or recruit ribonucleases to destroy RNAs. Binding of SMBs to miRNAs brings SMCs&#8217; chemical functionalities close to the miRNA, eventually causing miRNA degradation. Compared with parent SMBs, SMCs exhibit remarkably enhanced potency and specificity in miRNA inhibition. The development and application of SMCs for miRNAs will be discussed.

      <title>Nonhydrolyzable Heptose Bis&#8208; and Monophosphate Analogues Modulate Pro&#8208;inflammatory TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Small change, big difference: A series of nonhydrolyzable analogues of bacterial heptosides has been synthesized and assayed on whole cells. Interestingly, depending on the functional groups at the 7&#8208;position of the heptose scaffold and in the vicinity of the anomeric position, some molecules could trigger an inflammatory response whereas others were antagonists of heptose&#8208;1,7&#8208;bisphosphate.







Abstract
d&#8208;Glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;,7&#8208;bisphosphate (HBP) and d&#8208;glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;&#8208;phosphate (H1P) are bacterial metabolites that were recently shown to stimulate inflammatory responses in host cells through the activation of the TIFA&#8208;dependent NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway. To better understand structure&#8208;based activity in relation to this process, a family of nonhydrolyzable phosphonate analogues of HBP and H1P was synthesized. The inflammation modulation by which these molecules induce the TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signal axis was evaluated in&#8197;vivo at a low&#8208;nanomolar concentration (6&#8197;nM) and compared to that of the natural metabolites. Our data showed that three phosphonate analogues had similar stimulatory activity to HBP, whereas two phosphonates antagonized HBP&#8208;induced TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. These results open new horizons for the design of pro&#8208;inflammatory and innate immune modulators that could be used as vaccine adjuvant.

      <title>Crossing the Border: From Keto&#8208; to Imine Reduction in Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases</title>
      <dc:description>
Willing to learn: In the context of enzymatic asymmetric reduction SDRs are mainly known for their ability to reduce ketones, rather than imines. However, both activities are based on the same catalytic triad. Using a rational approach inspired by two imine&#8208;reducing SDRs, the keto&#8208;reducing M77_SDR was equipped with imine&#8208;reducing capability.







Abstract
The family of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent short&#8208;chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) comprises numerous biocatalysts capable of C=O or C=C reduction. The highly homologous noroxomaritidine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus and Zt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae, however, are SDRs with an extended imine substrate scope. Comparison with a similar SDR from Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR) exhibiting keto&#8208;reducing activity, yet negligible imine&#8208;reducing capability, and mining the Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Engineering Database indicated that NR and Zt_SDR possess a unique active&#8208;site composition among SDRs. Adapting the active site of Ao_SDR accordingly improved its imine&#8208;reducing capability. By applying the same strategy, an unrelated SDR from Methylobacterium sp. 77 (M77_SDR) with distinct keto&#8208;reducing activity was engineered into a promiscuous enzyme with imine&#8208;reducing activity, thereby confirming that the ability to reduce imines can be rationally introduced into members of the &#8220;classical&#8221; SDR enzyme family. Thus, members of the SDR family could be a promising starting point for protein approaches to generate new imine&#8208;reducing enzymes.

      <title>First Ring&#8208;Expanded Maytansin Lactone Accessed by a New Mutasynthetic Variant</title>
      <dc:description>
Make it larger! A new variant of the chemo&#8208;biosynthetic concept of mutasynthesis using a multiblocked strain of the ansamitocin producer A. pretiosum yielded new macrolactam proansamitocins as well as the first ring&#8208;expanded maytansin macrolactone.







Abstract
A multiblocked mutant strain (&#916;AHBA and &#916;asm12, asm21) of Actinosynnema pretiosum, the producer of the highly toxic maytansinoid ansamitocin, has been used for the mutasynthetic production of new proansamitocin derivatives. The use of mutant strains that are blocked in the biosynthesis of an early building block as well as in the expression of two tailoring enzymes broadens the scope of chemo&#8208;biosynthetic access to new maytansinoids. Remarkably, a ring&#8208;expanded macrolactone derived from ansamitocin was created for the first time.

      <title>Molecular Recognition in C&#8208;Type Lectins: The Cases of DC&#8208;SIGN, Langerin, MGL, and L&#8208;Sectin</title>
      <dc:description>
Fine specificity: The interaction of glycans with C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs) mediates the dissemination of infections and is strongly related to the immune response. In this review, we emphasize the molecular recognition features of four of the most studied CLRs of group II: DC&#8208;SIGN, Langerin, MGL and LSECtin







Abstract
Carbohydrates play a pivotal role in intercellular communication processes. In particular, glycan antigens are key for sustaining homeostasis, helping leukocytes to distinguish damaged tissues and invading pathogens from healthy tissues. From a structural perspective, this cross&#8208;talk is fairly complex, and multiple membrane proteins guide these recognition processes, including lectins and Toll&#8208;like receptors. Since the beginning of this century, lectins have become potential targets for therapeutics for controlling and/or avoiding the progression of pathologies derived from an incorrect immune outcome, including infectious processes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of these receptors is mandatory for the development of specific treatments. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about four key C&#8208;type lectins whose importance has been steadily growing in recent years, focusing in particular on how glycan recognition takes place at the molecular level, but also looking at recent progresses in the quest for therapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fine specificity&lt;/b&gt;: The interaction of glycans with C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs) mediates the dissemination of infections and is strongly related to the immune response. In this review, we emphasize the molecular recognition features of four of the most studied CLRs of group II: DC&#8208;SIGN, Langerin, MGL and LSECtin

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates play a pivotal role in intercellular communication processes. In particular, glycan antigens are key for sustaining homeostasis, helping leukocytes to distinguish damaged tissues and invading pathogens from healthy tissues. From a structural perspective, this cross&#8208;talk is fairly complex, and multiple membrane proteins guide these recognition processes, including lectins and Toll&#8208;like receptors. Since the beginning of this century, lectins have become potential targets for therapeutics for controlling and/or avoiding the progression of pathologies derived from an incorrect immune outcome, including infectious processes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of these receptors is mandatory for the development of specific treatments. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about four key C&#8208;type lectins whose importance has been steadily growing in recent years, focusing in particular on how glycan recognition takes place at the molecular level, but also looking at recent progresses in the quest for therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeted Discovery of Tetrapeptides and Cyclic Polyketide&#8208;Peptide Hybrids from a Fungal Antagonist of Farming Termites</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical treasures of a fungal stowaway: Structural analysis of six new chemical features revealed four linear tetrapeptides and two cyclic NRPS&#8208;polyketide&#8208;derived natural products from the fungal antagonist Pseudoxylaria sp. X187 of fungus&#8208;growing termites.







Abstract
Herein, we report the targeted isolation and characterization of four linear nonribosomally synthesized tetrapeptides (pseudoxylaramide A&#8211;D) and two cyclic nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase&#8208;derived natural products (xylacremolide A and B) from the termite&#8208;associated stowaway fungus Pseudoxylaria sp. X187. The fungal strain was prioritized for further metabolic analysis based on its taxonomical position and morphological and bioassay data. Metabolic data were dereplicated based on high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and global molecular networking analysis. The structure of all six new natural products was elucidated based on a combination of 1D and 2D NMR analysis, Marfey's analysis and X&#8208;ray crystallography.

      <title>2,3&#8208;Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Decarboxylase from Fusarium oxysporum: Crystal Structures and Substrate Recognition Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
It depends on your position: Crystal structure and mutation studies reveal that R233&#916; plays an important role in the substrate recognition of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase (DHBD) from Fusarium oxysporum, as well as the molecular basis for this enzyme being a 2,3&#8208;DHBD with different substrate preference from known 2,6&#8208;DHBDs and salicylic acid decarboxylases.







Abstract
A 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Fusarium oxysporum (2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo) has a relatively high catalytic efficiency for the decarboxylation of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and carboxylation of catechol, thus it has a different substrate spectrum from other benzoic acid decarboxylases. We have determined the structures of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo in its apo form and complexes with catechol or 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid at 1.55, 1.97, and 2.45&#8197;&#197; resolution, respectively. The crystal structures of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo show that the enzyme exists as a homotetramer, and each active center has a Zn2+ ion coordinated by E8, H167, D291 and three water molecules. This is different from 2,6&#8208;DHBD from Rhizobium sporomusa, in which the Zn2+ ion is also coordinated with H10. Surprisingly, mutation of A10 of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo to His resulted in almost complete loss of the enzyme activity. Enzyme&#8208;substrate docking and site&#8208;directed mutation studies indicate that residue R233&#916; interacts with the 3&#8208;hydroxy group of 2,3&#8208;DHBA, and plays an important role in substrate recognition for this enzyme, thus revealing the molecular basis 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase.

      <title>Reexamination of the Ergothioneine Biosynthetic Methyltransferase EgtD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a Protein Kinase Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>
Conformer conundrum: The histidine methyltransferase EgtD produces N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine as the first intermediate of ergothioneine biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis. This enzyme can be regulated by kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. However, in&#8197;vitro characterization of this process suggests that folded EgtD is a poor substrate for protein kinase D (PknD).







Abstract
Ergothioneine has emerged as a crucial cytoprotectant in the pathogenic lifestyle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Production of this antioxidant from primary metabolites may be regulated by phosphorylation of Thr213 in the active site of the methyltransferase EgtD. The structure of mycobacterial EgtD suggests that this post&#8208;translational modification would require a large&#8208;scale change in conformation to make the active&#8208;site residue accessible to a protein kinase. In this report, we show that, under in&#8197;vitro conditions, EgtD is not a substrate of protein kinase PknD.
