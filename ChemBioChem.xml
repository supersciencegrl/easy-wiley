         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Multi&#8208;Enzyme Synthesis and Purification of Uridine Diphosphate Galactose</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic platform was developed for the synthesis of UDP&#8208;Gal from low&#8208;cost and readily available precursors. The overall process was optimized for efficiency by bypassing time&#8208;consuming and expensive enzyme purification steps followed by a scale&#8208;up into a 1&#8197;L bioreactor. Here, within 23&#8197;h, a total of 23.4&#8197;g/L of UDP&#8208;galactose were produced. Costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;Gal synthesized were 0.26&#8197;&#8364;/g.







Abstract
High costs and low availability of UDP&#8208;galactose hampers the enzymatic synthesis of valuable oligosaccharides such as human milk oligosaccharides. Here, we report the development of a platform for the scalable, biocatalytic synthesis and purification of UDP&#8208;galactose. UDP&#8208;galactose was produced with a titer of 48&#8197;mM (27.2&#8197;g/L) in a small&#8208;scale batch process (200&#8197;&#956;L) within 24&#8197;h using 0.02 genzyme/gproduct. Through in&#8208;situ ATP regeneration, the amount of ATP (0.6&#8197;mM) supplemented was around 240&#8208;fold lower than the stoichiometric equivalent required to achieve the final product yield. Chromatographic purification using porous graphic carbon adsorbent yielded UDP&#8208;galactose with a purity of 92&#8201;%. The synthesis was transferred to 1&#8197;L preparative scale production in a stirred tank bioreactor. To further reduce the synthesis costs here, the supernatant of cell lysates was used bypassing expensive purification of enzymes. Here, 23.4&#8197;g/L UDP&#8208;galactose were produced within 23&#8197;h with a synthesis yield of 71&#8201;% and a biocatalyst load of 0.05 gtotal_protein/gproduct. The costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;galactose synthesized were around 0.26&#8197;&#8364;/g.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right tool can do the trick: A novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis was identified using the computer&#8208;assisted prediction tool Tome, and two variants with altered active sites were constructed based on homology models. All new enzyme variants showed significantly increased thermostability compared with the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens to date. The enzyme variants showed different substrate specificities and different activities in the presence of a range of co&#8208;solvents. The most stable variant was then immobilized and used for continuous production of enantiopure benzoin. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;S. Rabe et&#8197;al.

         <title>Toward an Orthogonal Protein Lysine Acylation and Deacylation System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine acetylation is one of the most basic molecular mechanisms to mediate protein functions in living organisms, and its abnormal regulation has been linked to many diseases. The drug development associated to this process is of great significance but severely hindered by the complex interplay of lysine acetylation and deacetylation in thousands of proteins, and we reasoned that targeting a specific protein acetylation or deacetylation event instead of the related enzymes should be a feasible solution to this issue. Towards this ultimate goal, we devised an orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells. The system includes a genetically encoded acylated lysine (PhOAcK) that is not a substrate of endogenous deacetylases, and an evolved sirtuin (CobB2/CobB3) that displays PhOAcK deacylase activities as well as reduced deacetylase activities. We believe the strategy introduced here holds potential for future in&#8208;depth biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of amino acid substitutions on 70S ribosomal binding, cellular uptake, and antimicrobial activity of oncocin Onc112</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are promising candidates for the treatment of infections caused by high&#8208;priority human pathogens. Their mode of action consists of (I) passive diffusion across the outer membrane, (II) active transport through the inner membrane, and (III) inhibition of protein biosynthesis by blocking the exit tunnel of the 70S ribosome. We tested whether  in vitro  data on ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake could predict the antibacterial activity of PrAMPs against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake rates were measured for 47 derivatives of PrAMP Onc112 and compared to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each peptide. Ribosomal binding was evaluated for ribosome extracts from four Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Bacterial uptake was assessed by quantifying each peptide in the medium supernatants of bacterial cultures. Oncocin analogs with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better than for Onc112. The data suggests a complex mode of action influenced by further factors improving or reducing the antibacterial activity, including diffusion through membranes, transport mechanism, secondary targets, off&#8208;target binding, intracellular distribution, and membrane effects. Relying only on  in vitro  binding and uptake data may not be sufficient for the rational development of more active analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the response of multiple signal network components to acute chemo&#8208;optogenetic perturbations in living cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells process information via signal networks that typically involve multiple components which are interconnected by feedback loops. The combination of acute optogenetic perturbations and microscopy&#8208;based fluorescent response readouts enables the direct investigation of causal links in such networks. However, due to overlaps in spectra of photosensitive and fluorescent proteins, current approaches that combine these methods are limited. Here, we present an improved chemo&#8208;optogenetic approach that is based on switch&#8208;like perturbations induced by a single, local pulse of UV light. We show that this approach can be combined with parallel monitoring of multiple fluorescent readouts to directly uncover relations between signal network components. We present the application of this technique to directly investigate feedback&#8208;controlled regulation in the cell contraction signal network that includes GEF&#8208;H1, Rho and Myosin, and functional interactions of this network with tumor relevant RhoA G17 mutants.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, are 1:1 bioconjugates of the nanoluciferase enzyme linked covalently at its C&#8208;terminus to hairpin forming ssDNA equipped with a dark quencher.&#160; We prepared E&#8208;beacons biocatalytically using HhC, the promiscuous Hedgehog C&#8208;terminal protein&#8208;cholesterol ligase. HhC attached nanoluciferase site&#8208;specifically to mono&#8208;sterylated hairpin oligonucleotides, called steramers. Three E&#8208;beacon dark quenchers were evaluated: Iowa Black, Onyx&#8208;A, and dabcyl.&#160; Each quencher enabled sensitive, sequence&#8208;specific nucleic acid detection through enhanced E&#8208;beacon bioluminescence upon target hybridization. We assembled prototype dabcyl&#8208;quenched E&#8208;beacons specific for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Targeting the E484 codon of the virus Spike protein, E&#8208;beacons (80 &#215; 10&#8208;12 M) reported wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleic acid at &#8805;1 &#215; 10&#8208;9 M by increased bioluminescence of 8&#8208;fold. E&#8208;beacon prepared for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 E484K variant functioned with similar sensitivity.&#160; Both E&#8208;beacons could discriminate their target from the E484Q mutation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Kappa variant.&#160; Along with mismatch specificity, E&#8208;beacons are two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than synthetic molecular beacons.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Enzyme Stringency Masks the Multispecificity of a Lyngbyatoxin (Indolactam Alkaloid) Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolactam alkaloids are potentially valuable molecular tools for modulating the activity of protein kinase C. In an attempt to generate novel lyngbyatoxin (LTX) variants, we mutated the A&#8208;domain of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase, LtxA, in an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain expressing the cyanobacterial LTX pathway. The mutations resulted in the differential production of valine&#8208;, isoleucine&#8208;, and leucine&#8208;derived pathway products.







Abstract
Indolactam alkaloids are activators of protein kinase C (PKC) and are of pharmacological interest for the treatment of pathologies involving PKC dysregulation. The marine cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway for lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis, which we previously expressed in E.&#8197;coli, was studied for its amenability towards the biosynthesis of indolactam variants. Modification of culture conditions for our E.&#8197;coli heterologous expression host and analysis of pathway products suggested the native lyngbyatoxin pathway NRPS does possess a degree of relaxed specificity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of two positions within the adenylation domain (A&#8208;domain) substrate&#8208;binding pocket was performed, resulting in an alteration of substrate preference between valine, isoleucine, and leucine. We observed relative congruence of in&#8197;vitro substrate activation by the LtxA NRPS to in&#8197;vivo product formation. While there was a preference for isoleucine over leucine, the substitution of alternative tailoring domains may unveil the true in&#8197;vivo effects of the mutations introduced herein.

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Fluorination as Modification for Peptide&#8208;Based Fusion Inhibitors against HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3443-3451, December 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated variants of an HIV entry inhibitor inspired by clinically applied T20 were systematically studied. The results reveal six&#8208;helix bundle formation for the fluorine&#8208;containing sequences in the presence of wildtype N&#8208;terminal heptad repeat peptide of gp41. X&#8208;ray crystal structures confirm favorable packing of the fluorinated groups and in&#8197;vitro infection experiments with CEMx174 SEAP cells reveal nanomolar inhibition.







Abstract
With the emergence of novel viruses, the development of new antivirals is more urgent than ever. A key step in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) infection is six&#8208;helix bundle formation within the envelope protein subunit gp41. Selective disruption of bundle formation by peptides has been shown to be effective; however, these drugs, exemplified by T20, are prone to rapid clearance from the patient. The incorporation of non&#8208;natural amino acids is known to improve these pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we evaluate a peptide inhibitor in which a critical Ile residue is replaced by fluorinated analogues. We characterized the influence of the fluorinated analogues on the biophysical properties of the peptide. Furthermore, we show that the fluorinated peptides can block HIV&#8208;1 infection of target cells at nanomolar levels. These findings demonstrate that fluorinated amino acids are appropriate tools for the development of novel peptide therapeutics.

         <title>Modulation of Transaminase Activity by Encapsulation in Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3452-3461, December 10, 2021. </description>

Bacillus megaterium transaminase (BmTA) shows high immobilization efficiency in upper critical solution temperature type poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) (pNAGA) hydrogels, and high activity in the swollen hydrogel. Upon temperature decrease, the hydrogel swelling and enzyme activity decrease. The deactivation tended to be higher for BmTA immobilized in pNAGA compared to free BmTA due to temperature&#8208;induced hydrogel shrinking.







Abstract
Smart hydrogels hold much potential for biocatalysis, not only for the immobilization of enzymes, but also for the control of enzyme activity. We investigated upper critical solution temperature&#8208;type poly N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (pNAGA) hydrogels as a smart matrix for the amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium (BmTA). Physical entrapment of BmTA in pNAGA hydrogels results in high immobilization efficiency (&gt;89&#8201;%) and high activity (97&#8201;%). The temperature&#8208;sensitiveness of pNAGA is preserved upon immobilization of BmTA and shows a gradual deswelling upon temperature reduction. While enzyme activity is mainly controlled by temperature, deactivation tended to be higher for immobilized BmTA (&#8776;62&#8211;68&#8201;%) than for free BmTA (&#8776;44&#8201;%), suggesting a deactivating effect due to deswelling of the pNAGA gel. Although the deactivation in response to hydrogel deswelling is not yet suitable for controlling enzyme activity sufficiently, it is nevertheless a good starting point for further optimization.

Moenomycin A (MoeA)&#8208;based fluorescent probes were developed for imaging the bacterial cell wall through specific labeling of transglycosylases. The strategy provided stunning imaging probes for mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains.







Abstract
The imaging of peptidoglycan (PGN) dynamics in living bacteria facilitates the understanding of PGN biosynthesis and wall&#8208;targeting antibiotics. The main tools for imaging bacterial PGN are fluorescent probes, such as the well&#8208;known PGN metabolic labeling probes. However, fluorescent small&#8208;molecule probes for labeling key PGN&#8208;synthesizing enzymes, especially for transglycosylases (TGases), remain to be explored. In this work, the first imaging probe for labeling TGase in bacterial cell wall studies is reported. We synthesized various fluorescent MoeA&#8208;based molecules by derivatizing the natural antibiotic moenomycin A (MoeA), and used them to label TGases in living bacteria, monitor bacterial growth and division cycles by time&#8208;lapse imaging, and study cell wall growth in the mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains when the &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based probes were unsuitable.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotide Modified with Disulfide Units Induces Efficient Exon Skipping in mdx Myotubes through Enhanced Membrane Permeability and Nucleus Internalization</title>

Enhanced cellular uptake was achieved using a disulfide&#8208;unit&#8208;containing membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotide (MPON). Long&#8208;term incubation enabled their nuclear internalization and subsequent exon skipping.







Abstract
We have found that antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA molecules modified with repeat structures of disulfide units can be directly introduced into the cytoplasm and exhibit a suppressive effect on gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of cellular uptake of these membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotides (MPONs). Time&#8208;course analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the uptake of MPONs from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm reached 50&#8201;% of the total uptake in about 5&#8197;min. In addition, analysis of the plasma membrane proteins to which MPONs bind, identified several proteins, including voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel. Next, we analyzed the behavior of MPONs in the cell and found them to be abundant in the nucleus as early as 24&#8197;h after addition with the amount increasing further after 48 and 72&#8197;h. The amount of MPONs was 2.5&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified oligonucleotides in the nucleus after 72&#8197;h. We also designed antisense oligonucleotides and evaluated the effect of MPONs on mRNA exon skipping using DMD model cells; MPONs caused exon skipping with 69&#8201;% efficiency after 72&#8197;h, which was three times higher than the rate of the control. In summary, the high capacity for intracytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of MPONs is expected to be useful for therapeutic strategies targeting exon skipping.

         <title>Structural Studies Provide New Insights into the Role of Lysine Acetylation on Substrate Recognition by CARM1 and Inform the Design of Potent Peptidomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3469-3476, December 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidomimetics based on the histone H3 tail peptide were used in co&#8208;crystallization studies with coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) to investigate the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. These findings also provide new insights into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation and the development of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of CARM1.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin provides a communication system for the regulation of gene expression. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role that such crosstalk between PTMs plays in chromatin recognition. In this study, (bio)chemical and structural approaches were applied to specifically probe the impact of acetylation of Lys18 in the histone H3 tail peptide on peptide recognition by the protein methyltransferase coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). Peptidomimetics that recapitulate the transition state of protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferases, were designed based on the H3 peptide wherein the target Arg17 was flanked by either a free or an acetylated lysine. Structural studies with these peptidomimetics and the catalytic domain of CARM1 provide new insights into the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. While the co&#8208;crystal structures reveal that lysine acetylation results in minor conformational differences for both CARM1 and the H3 peptide, acetylation of Lys18 does lead to additional interactions (Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) and likely reduces the cost of desolvation upon binding, resulting in increased affinity. Informed by these findings a series of smaller peptidomimetics were also prepared and found to maintain potent and selective CARM1 inhibition. These findings provide new insights both into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation as well as towards the development of peptidomimetic CARM1 inhibitors.

         <title>Visual Detection of Adenosine Triphosphate by Taylor Rising: A Simple Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Method Based on Rolling Circle Amplification</title>

Liquid run! A new point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing method for adenosine triphosphate detection was developed based on Taylor rising. This approach is quite general, includes naked eye quantification and does not require cumbersome equipment.







Abstract
Rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) is an extremely critical mission in practical applications, especially for rigorous military medicine, home health care, and in the third world. Here, we report a visual POCT method for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection based on Taylor rising in the corner of quadratic geometries between two rod surfaces. We discuss the principle of Taylor rising, demonstrating that it is significantly influenced by contact angle, surface tension, and density of the sample, which are controlled by ATP&#8208;dependent rolling circle amplification (RCA). In the presence of ATP, RCA reaction effectively suppresses Taylor&#8208;rising behavior, due to the increased contact angle, density, and decreased surface tension. Without addition of ATP, untriggered RCA reaction is favorable for Taylor rising, resulting in a significant height. With this proposed method, visual sensitive detection of ATP without the aid of other instruments is realized with only a 5 &#956;L droplet, which has good selectivity and a low detection limit (17&#8197;nM). Importantly, this visual method provides a promising POCT tool for user&#8208;friendly molecular diagnostics.

A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz) is reported which was identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. Autophazole was found to disrupt lysosomal function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization&#8208;associated apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
A novel autophagy inhibitor, autophazole (Atz), which promoted cancer cell death via caspase activation, is described. This compound was identified from cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. The results showed that Atz was internalized into lysosomes of cells where it induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). This process generated nonfunctional autolysosomes, thereby inhibiting autophagy. In addition, Atz was found to promote LMP&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Specifically, LMP induced by Atz caused release of cathepsins from lysosomes into the cytosol. Cathepsins in the cytosol cleaved Bid to generate tBid, which subsequently activated Bax to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This event led to cancer cell death via caspase activation. Overall, the findings suggest that Atz will serve as a new chemical probe in efforts aimed at gaining a better understanding of the autophagic process.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Mesophilic CTP&#8208;Dependent Riboflavin Kinase and Rational Engineering to Create Its Thermostable Homologues**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3414-3424, December 10, 2021. </description>

Kinases typically use ATP to phosphorylate their substrates. But not this one! Archaeal riboflavin kinases (RibK), characterized by a unique structural fold, select CTP over all other nucleotides for phosphorylating riboflavin (Vitamin B2) to produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we report the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal RibK from Methanococcus maripaludis. Further, using structural bioinformatics and computational studies, we determined the molecular determinants that confer thermostability to MmpRibK, making this class of enzymes amenable to bioengineering applications.







Abstract
Flavins play a central role in metabolism as molecules that catalyze a wide range of redox reactions in living organisms. Several variations in flavin biosynthesis exist among the domains of life, and their analysis has revealed many new structural and mechanistic insights till date. The cytidine triphosphate (CTP)&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase in archaea is one such example. Unlike most kinases that use adenosine triphosphate, archaeal riboflavin kinases utilize CTP to phosphorylate riboflavin and produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we present the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal CTP&#8208;utilizing riboflavin kinase homologue from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmpRibK), which is linked closely in sequence to the previously characterized thermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii homologue. We reconstitute the activity of MmpRibK, determine its kinetic parameters and molecular factors that contribute to its unique properties, and finally establish the residues that improve its thermostability using computation and a series of experiments. Our work advances the molecular understanding of flavin biosynthesis in archaea by the characterization of the first mesophilic CTP&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase. Finally, it validates the role of salt bridges and rigidifying amino acid residues in imparting thermostability to this unique structural fold that characterizes archaeal riboflavin kinase enzymes, with implications in enzyme engineering and biotechnological applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kinases&lt;/b&gt; typically use ATP to phosphorylate their substrates. But not this one! Archaeal riboflavin kinases (RibK), characterized by a unique structural fold, select CTP over all other nucleotides for phosphorylating riboflavin (Vitamin B2) to produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we report the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal RibK from &lt;i&gt;Methanococcus maripaludis&lt;/i&gt;. Further, using structural bioinformatics and computational studies, we determined the molecular determinants that confer thermostability to &lt;i&gt;Mmp&lt;/i&gt;RibK, making this class of enzymes amenable to bioengineering applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavins play a central role in metabolism as molecules that catalyze a wide range of redox reactions in living organisms. Several variations in flavin biosynthesis exist among the domains of life, and their analysis has revealed many new structural and mechanistic insights till date. The cytidine triphosphate (CTP)-dependent riboflavin kinase in archaea is one such example. Unlike most kinases that use adenosine triphosphate, archaeal riboflavin kinases utilize CTP to phosphorylate riboflavin and produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we present the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal CTP-utilizing riboflavin kinase homologue from &lt;i&gt;Methanococcus maripaludis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mmp&lt;/i&gt;RibK), which is linked closely in sequence to the previously characterized thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Methanocaldococcus jannaschii&lt;/i&gt; homologue. We reconstitute the activity of &lt;i&gt;Mmp&lt;/i&gt;RibK, determine its kinetic parameters and molecular factors that contribute to its unique properties, and finally establish the residues that improve its thermostability using computation and a series of experiments. Our work advances the molecular understanding of flavin biosynthesis in archaea by the characterization of the first mesophilic CTP-dependent riboflavin kinase. Finally, it validates the role of salt bridges and rigidifying amino acid residues in imparting thermostability to this unique structural fold that characterizes archaeal riboflavin kinase enzymes, with implications in enzyme engineering and biotechnological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The pathway for vitamin B2 (riboflavin) biosynthesis in archaea contains several novel enzymes and reactions. The archaeal riboflavin kinase, RibK, is one such example &#8211; it has a unique structural fold, and phosphorylates B2 using CTP. Here, we characterize a new mesophilic archaeal RibK, compare its structure and function with a closely linked thermophilic homologue, and determine the molecular factors that confer thermal stability to this enzyme's characteristic structural fold.

A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz), identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library, is reported. Autophazole is mainly internalized into lysosomes and disrupts their function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces LMP&#8208;mediated caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. We anticipate that Atz will be a useful chemical probe for elucidating details about the autophagic process and understanding the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis.

         <title>Exosomes as Targeted Delivery Platform of CRISPR/Cas9 for Therapeutic Genome Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3360-3368, December 10, 2021. </description>

Granting CRISPR/Cas9 molecules a protecting shield and a guiding &#8220;GPS&#8221;, engineered exosomes enable genome editing selectively in targeted cells or tissues. These natural vehicles also encompass rich functional molecules which their synthetic counterparts do not have, making them an appealing tool for both basic research and translational medicine.







Abstract
Therapeutic genome editing harnesses the power of genome editing tools to correct erroneous genes associated with disease pathology. To bring the CRISPR/Cas9 tool from the bench to the bedside, a critical hurdle is the safe and efficient delivery of this nucleic acid tool to the desired type of cells in patients. This review discusses the use of natural carriers, extracellular vesicles (EVs), in particular exosomes, to fill the gap. Exosomes are lipid&#8208;containing nanovesicle released by various types of cells to mediate cell&#8208;cell communications. Their inherent long&#8208;distance transportation capability, biocompatibility, and engineerability have made EVs potential vehicles for delivering therapeutic drugs. We summarize the recent progress of harnessing exosomes as delivery vehicles for the CRISPR/Cas system to achieve therapeutic gene editing for disease treatment, with a focus on various strategies to achieve selective delivery to a particular type of cell and efficient packaging of the genome editing tools in the vesicles. Critical issues and possible solutions in the design and engineering of the targeting vehicles are highlighted. Taken together, we demonstrate EV/exosome&#8208;mediated packaging of the nucleic acid/protein tools and the cell/tissue&#8208;targeted delivery to be a viable way towards the clinical translation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

Nanorobots are considered an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming option for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. We classified nanorobots into two types: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. One is equipped with self&#8208;propulsion and dynamic control ability while the other can detect the biological signal and perform controlled drug release. Moreover, prospects and challenges of nanorobots are discussed, intending to promote their clinical translation.







Abstract
Nanotechnology has been widely applied to the fabrication of drug delivery systems in the past decades. Recently, with the progress made in microfabrication approaches, nanorobots are steadily becoming a promising means for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. In general, nanorobots can be divided into two categories: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. Nanomotors are nanoscale systems with the ability to convert surrounding energies into mechanical motion, whereas stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are featured with activatable capacity in response to various endogenous and exogenous stimulations. In this minireview, the dynamic control of nanomotors and the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are overviewed, with particular emphasis on their contribution to tumor&#8208;targeting therapy. Moreover, challenges and perspectives associated with the future development of nanorobots are presented.

         <title>B4GALNT2 Controls Sda and SLex Antigen Biosynthesis in Healthy and Cancer Human Colon</title>

This review summarizes the progress made in understanding the various regulatory mechanisms underpinning Sda and SLex expression in the human gastrointestinal tract.







Abstract
The Sda carbohydrate antigen and the corresponding biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 are primarily expressed in human normal colonic mucosa and are down&#8208;regulated to variable degrees in colon cancer. On the other hand, the tumor associated antigen SLex is not detected in the healthy colon and is upregulated in colon cancer. High level of B4GALNT2 gene expression appears to be a good marker of prognosis in colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating these carbohydrate antigens&#8217; expression are still poorly understood. We review here the most recent progress made towards understanding this balanced expression of blood group carbohydrate epitopes Sda and SLex. In particular in recent years, we have attained a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of the B4GALNT2 gene and of the subcellular fate of B4GALNT2 isoforms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sd&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; carbohydrate antigen and the corresponding biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 are primarily expressed in human normal colonic mucosa and are down-regulated to variable degrees in colon cancer. On the other hand, the tumor associated antigen SLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; is not detected in the healthy colon and is upregulated in colon cancer. High level of &lt;i&gt;B4GALNT2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression appears to be a good marker of prognosis in colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating these carbohydrate antigens&#8217; expression are still poorly understood. We review here the most recent progress made towards understanding this balanced expression of blood group carbohydrate epitopes Sd&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; and SLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular in recent years, we have attained a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of the &lt;i&gt;B4GALNT2&lt;/i&gt; gene and of the subcellular fate of B4GALNT2 isoforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HaloTag Engineering for Enhanced Fluorogenicity and Kinetics with a Styrylpyridium Dye</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3398-3401, December 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein engineering techniques were implemented to improve the fluorogenicity and kinetics of an accessible dye&#8208;HaloTag construct. The engineered protein showed dramatically improved fluorescent properties with purified HaloTag and enabled live&#8208;cell imaging in mammalian cells.







Abstract
HaloTag is a small self&#8208;labeling protein that is frequently used for creating fluorescent reporters in living cells. The small&#8208;molecule dyes used with HaloTag are almost exclusively based on rhodamine scaffolds, which are often expensive and challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report the engineering of HaloTag for use with a chemically accessible, inexpensive fluorophore based on the dimethylamino&#8208;styrylpyridium dye. Through directed evolution, the maximum fluorogenicity and the apparent second&#8208;order bioconjugation rate constants could be improved up to 4&#8208;fold and 42&#8208;fold, respectively. One of the top variants, HT&#8208;SP5, enabled reliable imaging in mammalian cells, with a 113&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement over the parent protein. Additionally, crystallographic characterization of selected mutants suggests the chemical origin of the fluorescent enhancement. The improved dye system offers a valuable tool for imaging and illustrates the viability of engineering self&#8208;labeling proteins for alternative fluorophores.

         <title>Mitochondrial Membrane Disrupting Molecules for Selective Killing of Senescent Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3391-3397, December 10, 2021. </description>

Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here, we showcase the importance of hydrophobicity and charge during the design of new mitochondria&#8208;targeted small molecules as a senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.







Abstract
Cellular senescence, a stable form of cell cycle arrest, facilitates protection from tumorigenesis and aids in tissue repair as they accumulate in the body at an early age. However, long&#8208;term retention of senescent cells causes inflammation, aging of the tissue, and progression of deadly diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Various attempts have been made to achieve selective elimination of senescent cells from the body, yet little has been explored in designing the mitochondria&#8208;targeted senolytic agent. Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here we have designed a library of alkyl&#8208;monoquaternary ammonium&#8208;triphenyl phosphine (TPP) and alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP of varying alkyl chain lengths, which target the mitochondria; we also studied their senolytic properties. It was observed that the alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP with the longest chain length induced apoptosis in senescent cells selectively via an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane disruption. This study demonstrates that mitochondria could be a potential target for designing new small molecules as senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Phage&#8208;Displayed Helix&#8208;Loop&#8208;Helix Peptides to Construct Kinase&#8208;Focused Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3406-3409, December 10, 2021. </description>

Expanding helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptide libraries: A phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptide library was chemically modified with adenosine as an anchor molecule for binding to the ATP binding site of protein kinase. This approach to the construction of target&#8208;focused HLH peptide libraries would enable the efficient generation of selective inhibitors not only for protein kinases, but also for other proteins of interest.







Abstract
Conformationally constrained peptides hold promise as molecular tools in chemical biology and as a new modality in drug discovery. The construction and screening of a target&#8208;focused library could be a promising approach for the generation of de novo ligands or inhibitors against target proteins. Here, we have prepared a protein kinase&#8208;focused library by chemically modifying helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptides displayed on phage and subsequently tethered to adenosine. The library was screened against aurora kinase A (AurA). The selected HLH peptide Bip&#8208;3 retained the &#945;&#8208;helical structure and bound to AurA with a KD value of 13.7&#8197;&#956;M. Bip&#8208;3 and the adenosine&#8208;tethered peptide Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc provided IC50 values of 103&#8197;&#956;M and 7.7&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, suggesting that Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc bivalently inhibited AurA. In addition, the selectivity of Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc to several protein kinases was tested, and was highest against AurA. These results demonstrate that chemical modification can enable the construction of a kinase&#8208;focused library of phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptides.

         <title>On the Weak Binding and Spectroscopic Signature of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 Interaction with RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 24, Page 3410-3413, December 10, 2021. </description>

The interaction of nsp14 protein with nascent RNA for the removal of mismatched nucleotide from the newly synthesized RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is reported.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 non&#8208;structural protein 14 (nsp14), known as exoribonuclease is encoded from the large polyprotein of viral genome and is a major constituent of the transcription replication complex (TRC) machinery of the viral RNA synthesis. This protein is highly conserved among the coronaviruses and is a potential target for the development of a therapeutic drug. Here, we report the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 expression, show its structural characterization, and ss&#8208;RNA exonuclease activity through vibrational and electronic spectroscopies. The deconvolution of amide&#8208;I band in the FTIR spectrum of the protein revealed a composition of 35&#8201;% &#945;&#8208;helix and 25&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;sheets. The binding between protein and RNA is evidenced from the spectral changes in the amide&#8208;I region of the nsp14, showing protein conformational changes during the binding process. A value of 20.60&#177;3.81&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 of the binding constant (KD) is obtained for nsp14/RNA complex. The findings reported here can motivate further studies to develop structural models for better understanding the mechanism of exonuclease enzymes for correcting the viral genome and can help in the development of drugs against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>The Inhibition Effect of Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking between Probes in Photo&#8208;Induced Double Duplex Invasion DNA</title>

Photo&#8208;induced double duplex invasion (pDDI) was enabled by ultrafast DNA photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK) and photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitor, 5&#8208;cyanouracil(CNU). In this study, we evaluated the effect on pDDI efficiency using spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS), which are considered to have photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability, similar to CNU. As a result, CNU had the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were found to be not very different.







Abstract
Double duplex invasion (DDI) DNA is a useful antigene method that inhibits expression of genomic DNA. We succeeded in performing photoinduced&#8208;DDI (pDDI) using ultrafast photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking. 5&#8208;Cyanouracil (CNU) has been used in pDDI to inhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking between probes, but its importance has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS) that exhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability similar to that of CNU. CNU exhibited the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were not very different. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect was better with S and dS than with thymidine (T). Conversely, the thermal stability was significantly lower with S and dS than with T. The results suggest that the pDDI efficiency is determined by the balance between the photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and the thermal stability, which is the introduction efficiency for double&#8208;stranded DNA. Therefore, CNU, which has a photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and a high Tm value, showed the highest inhibitory efficiency.

         <title>Substrate Enolate Intermediate and Mimic Captured in the Active Site of Streptomyces coelicolor Methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA Epimerase**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising route to novel polyketides is through malonyl&#8208;CoA synthetases generating non&#8208;natural extender units. Yet, synthetases make extenders with (2R) stereocenters and polyketide synthases accept (2S). Engineered methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerases can overcome this incompatibility. Here we solve structures of methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerase to examine the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity determinants and find some unexpected interactions.







Abstract
Methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerase (MMCE) is proposed to use general acid&#8208;base catalysis, but the proposed catalytic glutamic acids are highly asymmetrical in the active site unlike many other racemases. To gain insight into the puzzling relationships between catalytic mechanism, structure, and substrate preference, we solved Streptomyces coelicolor MMCE structures with substrate or 2&#8208;nitropropionyl&#8208;CoA, an intermediate/transition state analogue. Both ligand bound structures have a planar methylmalonate/2&#8208;nitropropionyl moiety indicating a deprotonated C2 with &#8805;4&#8197;&#197; distances to either catalytic acid. Both glutamates interact with the carboxylate/nitro group, either directly or through other residues. This suggests the proposed catalytic acids sequentially catalyze proton shifts between C2 and carboxylate of the substrate with an enolate intermediate. In addition, our structures provide a platform to design mutations for expanding substrate scope to support combinatorial biosynthesis.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. The results show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages. These results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia &#8211; the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens that rely on this mechanism to obtain PLP. For this reason, Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases. The results obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i)&#8197;activation of Cys87, (ii)&#8197;deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii)&#8197;hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv)&#8197;enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature (19.1&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) agree very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step (18.2&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;11), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site. This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)&#8197;it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)&#8197;the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii) Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process. Together, these results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.

         <title>Novel Quinic Acid Glycerates from Tussilago farfara Inhibit Polypeptide GalNAc&#8208;Transferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate isolated from T.&#8197;farfara, was found to inhibit the activity of GalNAc&#8208;T2.







Abstract
The discovery of a bioactive inhibitor tool for human polypeptide N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyl transferases (GalNAc&#8208;Ts), the initiating enzyme for mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation, remains challenging. In the present study, we identified an array of quinic acid derivatives, including four new glycerates (1&#8211;4) from Tussilago farfara, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, as active inhibitors of GalNAc&#8208;T2 using a combined screening approach with a cell&#8208;based T2&#8208;specific sensor and purified enzyme assay. These inhibitors dose&#8208;dependently inhibited human GalNAc&#8208;T2 but did not affect O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), the other type of glycosyltransferase. Importantly, they are not cytotoxic and retain inhibitory activity in cells lacking elongated O&#8208;glycans, which are eliminated by the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study unveiled a novel quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate pharmacophore that directs inhibition. Overall, these new natural product inhibitors could serve as a basis for developing an inhibitor tool for GalNAc&#8208;T2.

         <title>A Specialized Dehydrogenase Provides l&#8208;Phenyllactate for FR900359 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenase FrsC is involved in biosynthesis of the Gq protein inhibiting natural product FR900359. Here, we biochemically characterized FrsC, catalyzing the formation of l&#8208;phenyllactate, and its subsequent incorporation into the FR assembly line followed by epimerization. A detailed bioinformatic analysis revealed that FrsC has evolved from primary metabolic enzymes to a specialized reductase accepting only aromatic substrates.







Abstract
d&#8208;Phenyllactate (PLA) is a component of the selective Gq protein inhibitor and nonribosomal cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). Here we report a detailed biochemical investigation of PLA biosynthesis and its incorporation into the natural product FR. The enzyme FrsC, member of the lactate/malate dehydrogenase superfamily, was shown to catalyze the formation of l&#8208;PLA from phenylpyruvate. FrsC was kinetically characterized and its substrate specificity determined. Incorporation of l&#8208;PLA was probed by assaying the adenylation domain FrsE&#8208;A3 and feeding studies with a Chromobacterium vaccinii &#916;frsC mutant, confirming preferred activation of l&#8208;PLA followed by on&#8208;line epimerization to d&#8208;PLA. Finally, detailed bioinformatic analyses of FrsC revealed its close relation to malate dehydrogenases from primary metabolism and suggest extensions in the substrate binding loop to be responsible for its adaptation to accepting larger aromatic substrates with high specificity.

         <title>New Insights into Tolytoxin Effect in Human Cancer Cells: Apoptosis Induction and the Relevance of Hydroxyl Substitution of Its Macrolide Cycle on Compound Potency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scytophycins are actin&#8208;binding macrolides with a high potency on cancer cell lines, however, the cellular fate after scytophycin treatment is not known. We show that scytophycins induce apoptosis, an essential feature of anticancer drugs. We also demonstrate substituents on the macrolide cycle affect the compound potency which was not previously considered. Thus, scytophycins are strong candidates for targeted drug delivery and structure&#8208;activity studies.







Abstract
Scytophycins, including tolytoxin, represent a class of actin disrupting macrolides with strong antiproliferative effects on human cells. Despite intense research, little attention has been paid to scytophycin&#8208;induced cell death or the structural features affecting its potency. We show that tolytoxin and its natural analogue, 7&#8208;O&#8208;methylscytophycin B, lacking the hydroxyl substitution in its macrolactone ring, differ substantially in their cytotoxic effect. Both compounds increase the level of caspases 3/7, which are the main executioner proteases during apoptosis, in HeLa wild&#8208;type (WT) cells. However, no caspase activity was detected in HeLa cells lacking Bax/Bak proteins crucial for caspase activation via the mitochondrial pathway. Obtained data strongly suggests that scytophycins are capable of inducing mitochondria&#8208;dependent apoptosis. These findings encourage further research in structure&#8208;activity relationships in scytophycins and highlight the potential of these compounds in targeted drug delivery.

         <title>Ni2+ Catalyzed Cleavage of TrpLE&#8208;Fused Small Transmembrane Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;specific nickel&#8208;assisted cleavage (SNAC) of TrpLE&#8208;fused transmembrane (TM) peptides avoids the usage of toxic cyanogen bromide and produces small TM peptides in a highly efficient way under mild conditions.







Abstract
In addition to a membrane anchor, the transmembrane domain (TMD) of single&#8208;pass transmembrane proteins (SPTMPs) recently has shown essential roles in the cross&#8208;membrane activity or receptor assembly/clustering. However, these small TMD peptides are generally hydrophobic and dynamic, difficult to be expressed and purified. Here, we have integrated the power of TrpLE fusion protein and a sequence&#8208;specific nickel&#8208;assisted cleavage (SNAC)&#8208;tag to produce small TMD peptides in a highly efficient way under mild conditions, which uses Ni2+ as the cleavage reagent, avoiding the usage of toxic cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Furthermore, this method simplifies the downstream protein purification and reconstitution. Two representative TMDs, including the Spike&#8208;TMD from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS2), were successfully produced with high&#8208;quality nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Therefore, our study provides a more efficient and practical approach for general structural characterization of the small TM proteins.

         <title>Characterization of Structure and Dynamics of the Guanidine&#8208;II Riboswitch from Escherichia coli by NMR Spectroscopy and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gdn&#8208;II riboswitch aptamer from E.&#8197;coli with wild&#8208;type and loop&#8208;mutated constructs were investigated in the context of ligand interactions. Based on NMR spectroscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data, previous crystal structures were confirmed, and an intermolecular ligand binding mechanism with the P1 loop as interaction interface instead of the postulated (intramolecular) P1&#8208;P2 kissing loop was found.







Abstract
Riboswitches are regulatory RNA elements that undergo functionally important allosteric conformational switching upon binding of specific ligands. The here investigated guanidine&#8208;II riboswitch binds the small cation, guanidinium, and forms a kissing loop&#8208;loop interaction between its P1 and P2 hairpins. We investigated the structural changes to support previous studies regarding the binding mechanism. Using NMR spectroscopy, we confirmed the structure as observed in crystal structures and we characterized the kissing loop interaction upon addition of Mg2+ and ligand for the riboswitch aptamer from Escherichia coli. We further investigated closely related mutant constructs providing further insight into functional differences between the two (different) hairpins P1 and P2. Formation of intermolecular interactions were probed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR DOSY data. All data are consistent and show the formation of oligomeric states of the riboswitch induced by Mg2+ and ligand binding.

         <title>Sulfation Pattern Dependent Iron(III) Mediated Interleukin&#8208;8 Glycan Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of hyaluronan sulfation degree and metal ion on interleukin&#8208;8 binding was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations.







Abstract
Cytokines such as interleukin&#8208;8 activate the immune system during infection and interact with sulfated glycosaminoglycans with specific sulfation patterns. In some cases, these interactions are mediated by metal ion binding which can be used to tune surface&#8208;based glycan&#8208;protein interactions. We evaluated the effect of both hyaluronan sulfation degree and Fe3+ on interleukin&#8208;8 binding by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations. Our results show that sulfation degree and metal ion interactions have a synergistic effect in tuning the electrochemical response of the glycated surfaces to the cytokine.

         <title>Toward engineered biosynthesis of drugs in human cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biosynthetic genes are not only responsible for the formation of bioactive substances but also suited for other applications including gene therapy. To test the feasibility of human cells producing antibiotics in situ when provided with a heterologous biosynthetic gene, we focused on cytochrome P450, the class of enzymes important in conferring bioactivity to natural product precursors. We selected Fma&#8208;P450 that plays a central role in the fumagillin antimicrobial biosynthesis in&#160;Aspergillus fumigatus&#160;to examine fungal metabolite production by HeLa cells that express&#160;fma&#8208;P450&#160;heterologously. Here we show that HeLa cells harboring&#160;fma&#8208;P450&#160;can biosynthesize 5&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamoten and cytotoxic 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demethoxyfumagillol when supplemented with the non&#8208;toxic precursor &#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamotene. While the production level was insufficient to effect cell death, we demonstrated programming human cells to auto&#8208;generate antibiotics by introducing a heterologous biosynthetic gene is feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorobenzene Nucleobase Analogues for Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,4&#8208;Difluorotoluene is a nonpolar isostere of thymidine that has been used as a powerful mechanistic probe to study the role of hydrogen bonding in nucleic acid recognition and interactions with polymerases. In the present study, we evaluated five fluorinated benzenes as nucleobase analogues in peptide nucleic acids designed for triple helical recognition of double helical RNA. We found that analogues having ortho fluorine substitution patterns (as in 2,4&#8208;difluorotoluene) selectively stabilized Hoogsteen triplets with A&#8208;U base pairs. The results were consistent with attractive electrostatic interactions akin to non&#8208;canonical F to H&#8208;N and C&#8208;H to N hydrogen bonding. The fluorinated nucleobases were not able to stabilize Hoogsteen&#8208;like triplets with pyrimidines in either C&#8208;G or U&#8208;A base pairs. Our results illustrate the ability of fluorine to engage in non&#8208;canonical base pairing and provide insights into triple helical recognition of RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification and Analysis of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus, was identified. It has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases, which consist of eight modules. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of compounds accumulated in the mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in Streptomyces remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus. The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total. In&#8197;vitro analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl&#8208;CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.

         <title>Prebiotic membranes and micelles do not inhibit peptide formation during dehydration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycles of dehydration and rehydration could have enabled formation of peptides and RNA in otherwise unfavorable conditions on the early Earth.&#160; Development of the first protocells would have hinged upon colocalization of these biopolymers with fatty acid membranes. Using atomic force microscopy, we find that a prebiotic fatty acid (decanoic acid) forms stacks of membranes after dehydration.&#160; Using LC&#8208;MS&#8208;MS (liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry) with isotope internal standards, we measure the rate of formation of serine dipeptides. We find that dipeptides form during dehydration at moderate temperatures (55&#176;C) at least as fast in the presence of decanoic acid membranes as in the absence of membranes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that protocells could have formed within evaporating environments on the early Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Immunostimulatory Activity of Covalent DNA Dendrons</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study focused on the design and synthesis of covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) that can stimulate immune system through the activation of TLR9. These dendrons were synthesized using branching trebler phosphoramidite containing three identical protecting groups that enabled the simultaneous synthesis of multiple strands on a single molecule. Compared with linear ODNs, covalent DNA dendrons were found to be more resistant to nuclease degradation and were more efficiently taken up by macrophage&#8208;like RAW264.7 cells. Cellular uptake was suggested to be mediated by macrophage scavenger receptors. The covalent DNA dendrons composed of multivalent immunostimulatory branches enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945; and IL&#8208;6 from RAW264.7 cells, and 9&#8208;branched DNA dendrons showed the highest enhancement. Given their enhanced efficacy, we expect covalent DNA dendrons to be useful structures of oligonucleotide medicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Selection of M2+&#8208;independent RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes with Sidechains Mimicking Arginine and Lysine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of RNA by nucleic acid catalysts in the absence of a divalent metal cation (M  2+  ) has remained an important goal in biomimicry with potential therapeutic applications. Given the lack of functional group diversity in canonical nucleotides, modified nucleotides with amino acid&#8208;like side chains were used to enhance self&#8208;cleavage rates at a single embedded ribonucleoside site. Previous works relied on three functional groups: an amine, a guanidine and an imidazole ensconced on three different nucleosides. However, to date, few studies have systematically addressed the necessity of all three modifications, as the value of any single modified nucleoside is contextualized at the outset of selection. Herein, we report on the use of only two modified dNTPs, excluding an imidazole, i.e. 5&#8208;(3&#8208;guanidinoallyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;dUTP (dU  ga  TP) and 5&#8208;aminoallyl&#8208;2'&#8208;dCTP (dC  aa  TP), to select  in&#8208;vitro  self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes that cleave in the absence of M  2+  in a pH&#8208;independent fashion. Cleavage shows biphasic kinetics with rate constants that are significantly higher than in unmodified DNAzymes and compare favorably to certain DNAzymes involving an imidazole. This work is the first report of a M2+&#8208;independent DNAzyme with two cationic modifications; as such it shows appreciable self&#8208;cleaving activity in the absence of an imidazole modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Cu Chelator that Mitigates Cu&#8208;Induced ROS Production by Amyloid Beta</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease severely perturbs the transition metal homeostasis in the brain leading to the accumulation of excess metals in extracellular and intraneuronal locations. The amyloid beta protein binds these transition metals, ultimately causing severe oxidative stress in the brain. Metal chelation therapy is an approach to sequester metals from amyloid beta and relieve the oxidative stress. Here we have designed a mixed N/O donor Cu chelator inspired by the proposed ligand set of Cu in amyloid beta. We demonstrate that the chelator effectively removes Cu from amyloid beta and suppresses ROS production by redox silencing and radical scavenging both in vitro and in cellulo. The impact of ROS on the extent of oxidation of the different aggregated forms of the peptide is studied by mass spectrometry, which, along with other ROS assays, shows that the oligomers are pro&#8208;oxidants in nature. The aliphatic Leu34, which was previously unobserved, has been identified as a new oxidation site.</dc:description>

         <title>The Small Open Reading Frame&#8208;Encoded Peptides: Advances in Methodologies and Functional Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small open reading frames (sORFs) were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of sORFs&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.







Abstract
Small open reading frames (sORFs) are an important class of genes with less than 100 codons. They were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that sORFs could encode a considerable number of polypeptides, many of which play important roles in both physiology and disease pathology. However, it has been technically challenging to directly detect sORF&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here, we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Acetyl neuraminic acid (sialic acid, Neu5Ac) is one of a large, diverse family of nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharides that play roles in many biological functions such as immune response. Neu5Ac has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for the presence and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer. More recent research has highlighted acetylated sialic acid derivatives specifically Neu5,9Ac 2 as biomarkers for oral and breast cancers, but advances in analysis have been hampered due to a lack of commercially available quantitative standards. We report here the synthesis of 9&#8208; O &#8208;acetyl and 4&#8208; O &#8208;acetyl sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu4,5Ac 2 ) with optimisation of previously reported synthetic routes. Neu5,9Ac 2 was synthesised in 1 step in 68% yield. Neu4,5Ac 2 was synthesised in 4 steps in 39% overall yield. Synthesis was followed by analysis of these standards via quantitative NMR (QNMR). Their utilisation for the identification and quantification of specific acetylated sialic acid derivatives in biological samples is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Sequencing of a Systematic Peptide Library Reveals Conformationally&#8208;Constrained Protein Interface Peptides that Disrupt a Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. We utilized high throughput oligonucleotide synthesis, peptide phage display library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing to show a peptide library encompassing a binding partner in a protein&#8208;protein interaction can serve as a source of peptides that mimic the interface and provide a starting point for developing inhibitors that block the interface.







Abstract
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. The BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II proteins are unrelated in sequence and structure and yet each potently inhibit &#946;&#8208;lactamases. High&#8208;throughput oligonucleotide synthesis was used to construct a 12,470&#8208;member library containing overlapping linear and cyclic peptides ranging in size from 6 to 21 amino acids that scan through the sequences of BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II. Phage display affinity selections and deep sequencing revealed that, despite the differences in interaction surfaces with &#946;&#8208;lactamases, rapid enrichment of consensus peptide regions originating from both BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II contact residues in the binding interface occurred. BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II peptides that were enriched by affinity selection were shown to bind &#946;&#8208;lactamases and disrupt the BLIP/&#946;&#8208;lactamase interaction. The results suggest that peptides that bind at and disrupt PPI interfaces can be identified through systematic peptide library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing.

Abstract
Development of versatile probes that can enable the study of different conformations and recognition properties of therapeutic nucleic acid motifs by complementing biophysical techniques can greatly aid nucleic acid analysis and therapy. Here, we report the design, synthesis and incorporation of an environment&#8208;sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two&#8208;channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy techniques. The nucleoside analogue is based on a 5&#8208;fluorobenzofuran&#8208;uracil core and its fluorescence and 19F NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to changes in solvent polarity and viscosity. Notably, the modified ribonucleotide and phosphoramidite substrates can be efficiently incorporated into RNA oligonucleotides (ONs) by in&#8197;vitro transcription and standard solid&#8208;phase ON synthesis protocol, respectively. Fluorescence and 19F readouts of the nucleoside incorporated into model RNA ONs are sensitive to the neighbouring base environment. The responsiveness of the probe was aptly utilized in detecting and quantifying the metal ion&#8208;induced conformational change in an internal ribosome entry site RNA motif of hepatitis C virus, which is an important therapeutic target. Taken together, our probe is a good addition to the nucleic acid analysis toolbox with the advantage that it can be used to study nucleic acid conformation and recognition simultaneously by two biophysical techniques.

         <title>Oligo Pools as an Affordable Source of Synthetic DNA for Cost&#8208;Effective Library Construction in Protein&#8208; and Metabolic Pathway Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of large variant libraries is critical for rational protein engineering, directed evolution, and protein de novo design, but is constrained by the relatively high cost of DNA synthesis. Here, we consolidate methods that allow using array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools as DNA input &#8211; a cheap but error&#8208;prone source of DNA.







Abstract
The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user&#8208;defined sequences (up to &#8764;350&#8197;bases in length) have emerged as a low&#8208;cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost &#8804;10&#8201;% (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next&#8208;generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence&#8208;function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de&#8208;novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.

         <title>Mammalian Chemical Genomics towards Identifying Targets and Elucidating Modes&#8208;of&#8208;Action of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical genomic screens using shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA libraries in mammalian cultured cells play central roles in identifying modes of action of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances of chemical genomic approaches in mammalian cultured cells to identify the molecular target, modes of action, and synthetic lethal pathways of compounds of interest, with a focus on recent examples including our results are discussed.







Abstract
The step of identifying target molecules and elucidating the mode of action of bioactive compounds is a major bottleneck for drug discovery from phenotypic screening. Genetic screening for genes that affect drug sensitivity or phenotypes of mammalian cultured cells is a powerful tool to obtain clues to their modes of action. Chemical genomic screening systems for comprehensively identifying such genes or genetic pathways have been established using shRNA libraries for RNA interference&#8208;mediated mRNA knockdown or sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene knockout. The combination of chemical genomic screening in mammalian cells with other approaches such as biochemical searches for target molecules, phenotypic profiling, and yeast genetics provides a systematic way to elucidate the mode of action by converging various pieces of information regarding target molecules, target pathways, and synthetic lethal pathways.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hydrogel Nanoparticles: Synthetic Antibodies for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), accounted for 10 million deaths in 2020. Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness&#8230;), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells. In this review, we describe an emerging class of targeting ligands, molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles for their application in the early detection of disease, with the aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>The Application of Biocatalysis in the Preparation and Resolution of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adducts and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction is an important carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reaction in organic synthesis. A new stereogenic centre is created in this reaction and much effort has been invested over the years into finding methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman products. In this review, the contribution of biocatalysis towards achieving this goal is discussed.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction affords highly functionalised allylic alcohols containing a new stereogenic centre. These MBH adducts are very versatile and have been transformed into a large range of products, some of which have medicinal potential. Several examples of asymmetric syntheses of MBH adducts have been reported, although a generally applicable method remains to be developed. Biocatalytic approaches for the synthesis and enzymatic kinetic resolution of MBH adducts have been reported, and are discussed in detail in this review. Enzymes able to catalyse the asymmetric MBH reaction have been identified, but selectivity and efficiency have generally been low. Lipases, esterases and nitrile&#8208;converting enzymes have all been successfully applied in the resolution of MBH adducts, with excellent selectivity being realised in most cases.

         <title>Selective Capture of Anti&#8208;N&#8208;glucosylated NTHi Adhesin Peptide Antibodies by a Multivalent Dextran Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;based tentacles were decorated with peptide antigens as a way to increase the ability to capture circulating IgM antibodies in multiple sclerosis patient sera as disease biomarkers. A novel peptide&#8208;dextran conjugate bearing multiple copies of a selected epitope of the non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus Influenzae adhesin protein was synthesis and characterized. Immunological experiments provide the proof&#8208;of concept for the identification and capture of specific IgM antibodies in patient sera.







Abstract
Tentacle&#8208;like polymers decorated with several copies of peptide antigens can be interesting tools for increasing the ability to capture circulating antibodies in patient sera, using cooperative effects for stronger avidity. We previously showed that antibodies from multiple sclerosis (MS) patient sera preferentially recognize hyperglucosylated adhesin protein HMW1ct of non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). We selected the C&#8208;terminal HMW1ct(1347&#8211;1354) minimal epitope and prepared the diglucosylated analogue Ac&#8208;KAN(Glc)VTLN(Glc)TTG&#8208;K(N3)&#8208;NH2 to graft a 40&#8197;kDa dextran scaffold modified with glycidyl&#8208;propargyl moieties to perform a copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide coupling reaction (CuAAC). Quantitative NMR measurements allowed the characterization of the peptide loading (19.5&#8201;%) on the multivalent dextran conjugate. This novel polymeric structure displayed optimal capturing properties of both IgG and, more interestingly, IgM antibodies in MS sera. Specific antibodies from a representative MS serum, were successfully depleted using a Sepharose resin bearing the new glucosylated multivalent conjugate, as confirmed by ELISA. These results may offer a promising proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the selective purification of high affinity autoantibodies from sera of autoimmune patients, in general, and of specific high affinity antibodies against a minimally glcosylated epitope Asn(Glc) from sera of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in particular.

We selected the C-terminal HMW1ct(1347&#8211;1354) minimal epitope and prepared the diglucosylated analogue Ac-KAN(Glc)VTLN(Glc)TTG-K(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to graft a 40&#8197;kDa dextran scaffold modified with glycidyl-propargyl moieties to perform a copper catalyzed alkyne-azide coupling reaction (CuAAC). Quantitative NMR measurements allowed the characterization of the peptide loading (19.5&#8201;%) on the multivalent dextran conjugate. This novel polymeric structure displayed optimal capturing properties of both IgG and, more interestingly, IgM antibodies in MS sera. Specific antibodies from a representative MS serum, were successfully depleted using a Sepharose resin bearing the new glucosylated multivalent conjugate, as confirmed by ELISA. These results may offer a promising proof-of-concept for the selective purification of high affinity autoantibodies from sera of autoimmune patients, in general, and of specific high affinity antibodies against a minimally glcosylated epitope Asn(Glc) from sera of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Urea and Acetamide Rich Solutions Circumvent the Strand Inhibition Problem to Allow Multiple Rounds of DNA and RNA Copying</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copying of nucleic acids under prebiotic conditions has been hard to achieve because of a problem known as strand inhibition. This problem can be overcome using solvents composed of molecules abundant in the early Earth, allowing for multiple rounds of information transfer of DNA and RNA duplexes under simulated prebiotic conditions through temperature and hydration cycles.







Abstract
For decades prebiotic chemists have attempted to achieve replication of RNA under prebiotic conditions with only limited success. One of the long&#8208;recognized impediments to achieving true replication of a duplex (copying of both strands) is the so&#8208;called strand inhibition problem. Specifically, while the two strands of an RNA (or DNA) duplex can be separated by heating, upon cooling the strands of a duplex will reanneal before mononucleotide or oligonucleotide substrates can bind to the individual strands. Here we demonstrate that a class of plausible prebiotic solvents, when coupled with thermal cycling and varying levels of hydration, circumvents the strand inhibition problem, and allows multiple rounds of information transfer from both strands of a duplex (replication). Replication was achieved by simultaneous ligation of oligomers that bind to their templates with the aid of the solvents. The solvents used consisted of concentrated solutions of urea and acetamide in water (UAcW), components that were likely abundant on the early Earth. The UAcW solvent system favors the annealing of shorter strands over the re&#8208;annealing of long strands, thereby circumventing strand inhibition. We observed an improvement of DNA and RNA replication yields by a factor of 100&#215; over aqueous buffer. Information transfer in the UAcW solvent system is robust, being achieved for a range of solvent component ratios, various drying conditions, and in the absence or presence of added salts.

         <title>A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for the biosynthesis of AICA ribonucleoside di&#8208; and triphosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AICA (5'&#8208;Aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide) ribonucleotides with different phosphorylation levels are the pharmaceutically active metabolites of AICA nucleoside&#8208;based drugs. The chemical synthesis of AICA ribonucleotides with defined phosphorylation is challenging and expensive. In this study, we describe two enzymatic cascades to synthesize AICA derivatives with defined phosphorylation levels from the corresponding nucleobase and the co&#8208;substrate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The cascades are composed of an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from  Escherichia coli  (EcAPT) and different polyphosphate kinases: polyphosphate kinase from  Acinetobacter johnsonii. (AjPPK) and polyphosphate kinase from  Meiothermus ruber  (MrPPK). The role of the  EcAPT is to bind the nucleobase to the sugar moiety, while the kinases are responsible for further phosphorylation of the nucleotide to produce the desired phosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide. The selected enzymes were characterized, and conditions were established for two enzymatic cascades. The diphosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide derivative ZDP, synthesized from the cascade  EcAPT/AjPPK, was produced with a conversion up to 91%. The  EcAPT/MrPPK cascade yielded ZTP with conversion up to 65% with ZDP as a side product.</dc:description>

         <title>Optochemical Control of Bacterial Gene Expression: Novel Photocaged Compounds for Different Promoter Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel optochemical tools for controlling gene expression in E. coli were investigated. Six photocaged carbohydrates with redshifted absorption and a photocaged salicylic acid derivative were synthesized, photochemically characterized and applied in&#8197;vivo for light&#8208;mediated target gene expression. The potential challenges during the establishment of a new optochemically controllable system and sufficient solutions are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Photocaged compounds are applied for implementing precise, optochemical control of gene expression in bacteria. To broaden the scope of UV&#8208;light&#8208;responsive inducer molecules, six photocaged carbohydrates were synthesized and photochemically characterized, with the absorption exhibiting a red&#8208;shift. Their differing linkage through ether, carbonate, and carbamate bonds revealed that carbonate and carbamate bonds are convenient. Subsequently, those compounds were successfully applied in&#8197;vivo for controlling gene expression in E. coli via blue light illumination. Furthermore, benzoate&#8208;based expression systems were subjected to light control by establishing a novel photocaged salicylic acid derivative. Besides its synthesis and in&#8197;vitro characterization, we demonstrate the challenging choice of a suitable promoter system for light&#8208;controlled gene expression in E. coli. We illustrate various bottlenecks during both photocaged inducer synthesis and in&#8197;vivo application and possibilities to overcome them. These findings pave the way towards novel caged inducer&#8208;dependent systems for wavelength&#8208;selective gene expression.

         <title>Targeting the Central Pocket of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectin LecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ligand binding pocket for additional pharmacophores in inhibitors of the bacterial lectin and virulence factor LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified and successfully targeted, using a suite of modelling, chemical synthesis, and biophysical analyses. The crystal structure of LecA with one ligand targeting this central pocket was solved, and validated the concept.







Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen that produces two lectins, LecA and LecB, as part of its large arsenal of virulence factors. Both carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are central to the initial and later persistent infection processes, i.&#8201;e. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The biofilm matrix is a major resistance determinant and protects the bacteria against external threats such as the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the development of drugs against the P. aeruginosa biofilm is of particular interest to restore efficacy of antimicrobials. Carbohydrate&#8208;based inhibitors for LecA and LecB were previously shown to efficiently reduce biofilm formations. Here, we report a new approach for inhibiting LecA with synthetic molecules bridging the established carbohydrate&#8208;binding site and a central cavity located between two LecA protomers of the lectin tetramer. Inspired by in silico design, we synthesized various galactosidic LecA inhibitors with aromatic moieties targeting this central pocket. These compounds reached low micromolar affinities, validated in different biophysical assays. Finally, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the interactions of this compound class with LecA. This new mode of action paves the way to a novel route towards inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilms.

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of DNA Containing Iodinated Pyrimidine or 7&#8208;Deazapurine Nucleobases and Their Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications through the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodinated pyrimidine or 7&#8208;deazapurine 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were found to be excellent substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic construction of oligonucleotide (ONs) or DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications through Suzuki cross&#8208;couplings worked in the terminal positions or single&#8208;stranded ONs but not in internal positions of double&#8208;stranded DNA.







Abstract
All four iodinated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) derived from 5&#8208;iodouracil, 5&#8208;iodocytosine, 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine and 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine were prepared and studied as substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase. All of the nucleotides were readily incorporated by primer extension and by PCR amplification to form DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. Systematic study of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with two bulkier arylboronic acids revealed that the 5&#8208;iodopyrimidines were more reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products both in the terminal or internal position in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides (ssONs) and in the terminal position of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA), whereas the 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurines were less reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products only in the terminal position. None of the four iodinated bases reacted in an internal position of dsDNA. These findings are useful for the use of the iodinated nucleobases for post&#8208;synthetic modification of DNA with functional groups for various applications.

     alt="Polymerase Synthesis of DNA Containing Iodinated Pyrimidine or 7-Deazapurine Nucleobases and Their Post-synthetic Modifications through the Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iodinated pyrimidine&lt;/b&gt; or 7-deazapurine 2&#8242;-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were found to be excellent substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic construction of oligonucleotide (ONs) or DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. The post-synthetic modifications through Suzuki cross-couplings worked in the terminal positions or single-stranded ONs but not in internal positions of double-stranded DNA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four iodinated 2&#8242;-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) derived from 5-iodouracil, 5-iodocytosine, 7-iodo-7-deazaadenine and 7-iodo-7-deazaguanine were prepared and studied as substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase. All of the nucleotides were readily incorporated by primer extension and by PCR amplification to form DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. Systematic study of the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions with two bulkier arylboronic acids revealed that the 5-iodopyrimidines were more reactive and gave cross-coupling products both in the terminal or internal position in single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssONs) and in the terminal position of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), whereas the 7-iodo-7-deazapurines were less reactive and gave cross-coupling products only in the terminal position. None of the four iodinated bases reacted in an internal position of dsDNA. These findings are useful for the use of the iodinated nucleobases for post-synthetic modification of DNA with functional groups for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavonoids are secondary metabolites ubiquitously found in plants. Their antioxidant properties make them highly interesting natural compounds to be used in pharmacology. Therefore, unravelling the mechanisms of flavonoids biosynthesis is a current hot challenge for the scientific community. Among all the enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway, DihydroFlavonol&#8208;4&#8208;Reductase (DFR) plays a key role on the way to the production of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Here, we provide new information on the mechanism of action of this enzyme by using QM/MM&#8208;MD simulations applied to both dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and dihydrokaempferol (DHK) substrates. The consideration of these very similar compounds shed light on the major role played by the enzyme on the stabilization of the transition state but also on the activation of the substrate before the reaction through Near&#8208;Attack Conformer effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A conformationally stable acyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold tolerating the incorporation of poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone amino acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;hairpin is a structural element of native proteins, but it is also a useful artificial scaffold for finding lead compounds to convert into peptidomimetics or non&#8208;peptide structures for drug discovery. Since linear peptides are synthetically more easily accessible than cyclic ones, but are structurally less well&#8208;defined, we propose XWXWXpPXK(/R)X(R) as an acyclic but still rigid &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold that is robust enough to accommodate different types of side chains, regardless of the secondary&#8208;structure propensity of the X residues. The high conformational stability of the scaffold results from tight contacts between cross&#8208;strand cationic and aromatic side chains, combined with the strong tendency of the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro dipeptide to induce a type II' &#946;&#8208;turn. To demonstrate the robustness of the scaffold, we elucidated the NMR structures and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of peptides displaying mainly non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;branched, poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone residues at the X positions. Both the NMR and MD data confirm that our acyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is highly versatile as regards the amino&#8208;acid composition of the &#946;&#8208;sheet face opposite to the cationic&#8208;aromatic one.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Reversible Nanoassemblies of G&#8208;Triplexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible dimeric G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies were developed using a ligand &#8211; an alkaloid of sanguinarine &#8211; as &#8216;glue&#8217;. The glue's adhesivity can be dynamically tuned by prevalent factors including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2, to efficiently regulate the G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies. However, the G&#8208;quadruplex counterpart does not respond to give nanoassemblies. Our work provides new perspectives in developing G&#8208;triplex&#8208;based nanodevices.







Abstract
G&#8208;triplex (G3) structures formed with three consecutive G&#8208;tracts have recently been identified as a new emerging guanine&#8208;rich DNA fold. There could likely be a wide range of biological functions for G3s as occurring for G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures formed with four consecutive G&#8208;tracts. However, in comparison to the many reports on G4 nanoassemblies that organize monomers together in a controllable manner, G3&#8208;favored nanoassemblies have yet to be explored. In this work, we found that a natural alkaloid of sanguinarine can serve as a dynamic ligand glue to reversibly switch the dimeric nanoassemblies of the thrombin binding aptamer G3 (TBA&#8208;G3). The glue planarity was considered to be a crucial factor for realizing this switching. More importantly, external stimuli including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2 can be employed as common regulators to easily modulate the glue's adhesivity for constructing and destructing the G3 nanoassemblies as a result of the ligand converting between isoforms. However, this assembly behavior does not occur with the counterpart TBA&#8208;G4. Our work demonstrates that higher&#8208;order G3 nanoassemblies can be reversibly operated by manipulating ligand adhesivity. This provides an alternative understanding of the unique behavior of guanine&#8208;rich sequences and focuses attention on the G3 fold since the nanoassembly event investigated herein might occur in living cells.

         <title>Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharide Supplementation Modulates Pathogen&#8208;Commensal Competition between Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus salivarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of the infant microbiome and how the microbiota is affected by feeding choice has recently gained interest. We designed a two&#8208;species microbiome in which a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, is cultured with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that the common infant formula supplement, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides are able to reverse the effects of S. salivarius growth suppression by S. agalactiae.







Abstract
The members of the infant microbiome are governed by feeding method (breastmilk vs. formula). Regardless of the source of nutrition, a competitive growth advantage can be provided to commensals through prebiotics &#8211; either human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) or plant oligosaccharides that are supplemented into formula. To characterize how prebiotics modulate commensal &#8211; pathogen interactions, we have designed and studied a minimal microbiome where a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae engages with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that while S. agalactiae suppresses the growth of S. salivarius via increased lactic acid production, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation reverses the effect. This result has major implications in characterizing how single species survive in the gut, what niche they occupy, and how they engage with other community members.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Natural Proteins and Their Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive natural proteins have been widely investigated and show great potential for their application in various fields. This minireview highlights the recent advances in natural proteins with specific stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, including temperature, light, force, electric field, and magnetic field.







Abstract
Natural proteins are essential biomacromolecules that fulfill versatile functions in the living organism, such as their usage as cytoskeleton, nutriment transporter, homeostasis controller, catalyzer, or immune guarder. Due to the excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility/biodegradability, natural protein&#8208;based biomaterials are well equipped for prospective applications in various fields. Among these natural proteins, stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins can be reversibly and precisely manipulated on demand, rendering the protein&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for numerous applications, including disease detection, drug delivery, bio&#8208;sensing, and regenerative medicine. Therefore, we present some typical natural proteins with diverse physical stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, including temperature, light, force, electrical, and magnetic sensing in this review.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stimuli-responsive&lt;/b&gt; natural proteins have been widely investigated and show great potential for their application in various fields. This minireview highlights the recent advances in natural proteins with specific stimuli-responsive characteristics, including temperature, light, force, electric field, and magnetic field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural proteins are essential biomacromolecules that fulfill versatile functions in the living organism, such as their usage as cytoskeleton, nutriment transporter, homeostasis controller, catalyzer, or immune guarder. Due to the excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility/biodegradability, natural protein-based biomaterials are well equipped for prospective applications in various fields. Among these natural proteins, stimuli-responsive proteins can be reversibly and precisely manipulated on demand, rendering the protein-based biomaterials promising candidates for numerous applications, including disease detection, drug delivery, bio-sensing, and regenerative medicine. Therefore, we present some typical natural proteins with diverse physical stimuli-responsive properties, including temperature, light, force, electrical, and magnetic sensing in this review. The structure-function mechanism of these proteins is discussed in detail. Finally, we give a summary and perspective for the development of stimuli-responsive proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A NIR Emitting Cyanine with Large Stokes&#8217; Shift for Mitochondria and Identification of their Membrane Potential Disruption</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visualization of cellular mitochondria plays a key role in understanding their dynamics and functions. An NIR&#8208;emitting, highly biocompatible fluorescent probe was successfully developed and utilized for tracking mitochondrial dysfunction in cells via fluorescence confocal microscopy. The probe exhibited excellent biocompatibility and high selectivity for long&#8208;term imaging.







Abstract
An NIR emitting (&#955;em&#8776;730&#8197;nm) cyanine probe ExCy was synthesized in good yields by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length (i.&#8201;e., with furan moiety) to the donor&#8208;accepter system. ExCy exhibited a large Stokes&#8217; shift (&#916;&#955;&#8776;100&#8197;nm) due to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl&#8776;0.47 in DCM). Due to its low fluorescence in an aqueous environment (&#934;fl&#8776;0.007 in H2O), the probe exhibited the potential of achieving a large fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon entering a hydrophobic cellular environment. Fluorescence confocal microscopy studies revealed that ExCy was readily excitable with a far&#8208;red laser line (i.&#8201;e., 640&#8197;nm) while the corresponding emission was collected in the NIR region. ExCy exhibited excellent selectivity towards live cell mitochondria according to the co&#8208;localization studies. The probe also exhibited high photostability, long&#8208;term imaging ability and wash&#8208;free staining ability, when being applied to live cells. Our studies indicated that the mitochondrial localization of ExCy was dependent on the membrane potential of the mitochondria. ExCy was successfully utilized as a mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction indicator to visually identify cells with mitochondrial dysfunction via fluorescence confocal microscopy. ExCy was further examined for potential in&#8197;vivo imaging of zebrafish.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Unprotected Dipeptides into Hydrogels: Water&#8208;Channels Make the Difference</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembling behaviour of the distinct stereoisomers of Ile&#8208;Phe and Phe&#8208;Ile was studied in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and found to form hydrogels. Single&#8208;crystal XRD data of the four non&#8208;enantiomeric dipeptides revealed water&#8208;channels as a distinctive feature only for the heterochiral hydrogelator D&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Ile.







Abstract
Unprotected dipeptides are attractive building blocks for environmentally friendly hydrogel biomaterials by virtue of their low&#8208;cost and ease of preparation. This work investigates the self&#8208;assembling behaviour of the distinct stereoisomers of Ile&#8208;Phe and Phe&#8208;Ile in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to form hydrogels, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), circular dichroism (CD), and oscillatory rheometry. Each peptide purity and identity was also confirmed by 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and HPLC&#8208;MS. Finally, single&#8208;crystal XRD data allowed the key interactions responsible for the supramolecular packing into amphipathic layers or water&#8208;channels to be revealed. The presence of the latter in the crystal structure is a distinctive feature of the only gelator of this work that self&#8208;organizes into stable hydrogels, with fast kinetics and the highest elastic modulus amongst its structural isomers and stereoisomers.

         <title>Polyether Cyclization Cascade Alterations in Response to Monensin Polyketide Synthase Mutations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate promiscuity of the polyether cyclisation cascade enzymes in monensin biosynthesis in the conversion of redox derivatives of the nascent polyketide chain was studies. The post&#8208;polyketide synthase enzymes were found to have remarkable flexibility. They acted on derivatized polyketide backbones based on the three possible polyketide redox states within two different modules and gave rise to an altered polyether structure.







Abstract
The targeted manipulation of polyketide synthases has in recent years led to numerous new&#8208;to&#8208;nature polyketides. For type&#8197;I polyketide synthases the response of post&#8208;polyketide synthases (PKS) processing enzymes onto the most frequently polyketide backbone manipulations is so far insufficiently studied. In particular, complex processes such as the polyether cyclisation in the biosynthesis of ionophores such as monensin pose interesting objects of research. We present here a study of the substrate promiscuity of the polyether cyclisation cascade enzymes in monensin biosynthesis in the conversion of redox derivatives of the nascent polyketide chain. LC&#8208;HRMS/MS2&#8208;based studies revealed a remarkable flexibility of the post&#8208;PKS enzymes. They acted on derivatized polyketide backbones based on the three possible polyketide redox states within two different modules and gave rise to an altered polyether structure. One of these monensin derivatives was isolated and characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, crystallography, and bioactivity studies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembling Properties and Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells of Chemically Synthesized Mannosylerythritol Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling properties and recovery effects on damaged skin cells using chemically synthesized mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) were investigated. Synthetic and homogeneous MELs exhibited significant self&#8208;assembling properties to form droplets or giant vesicles. In addition, a small difference in the length of the fatty acid chains of the MELs significantly affected their recovery effects on the damaged skin cells.







Abstract
Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), which are one of the representative sugar&#8208;based biosurfactants (BSs) produced by microorganisms, have attracted much attention in various fields in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) era. However, they are inseparable mixtures with respect to the chain length of the fatty acids. In this study, self&#8208;assembling properties and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of recovery effects on damaged skin cells using chemically synthesized MELs were investigated. It was revealed, for the first time, that synthetic and homogeneous MELs exhibited significant self&#8208;assembling properties to form droplets or giant vesicles. In addition, a small difference in the length of the fatty acid chains of the MELs significantly affected their recovery effects on the damaged skin cells. MELs with medium or longer length alkyl chains exhibited much higher recovery effects than that of C18&#8208;ceramide NP.

         <title>A Modular System for the Rapid Comparison of Different Membrane Anchors for Surface Display on Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highway to optimized surface display: A modular surface display system, employing the SpyCatcher/SpyTag bioconjugation system, is used for rapid comparison of the membrane anchors Lpp&#8208;OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA&#8208;I with respect to their performance for surface display of the model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3. The described combinatorial screening method helps to minimize the workload required for identifying the most suitable membrane anchor for a given application.







Abstract
Comparison of different membrane anchor motifs for the surface display of a protein of interest (passenger) is crucial for achieving the best possible performance. However, generating genetic fusions of the passenger to various membrane anchors is time&#8208;consuming. We herein employ a recently developed modular display system, in which the membrane anchor and the passenger are expressed separately and assembled in&#8197;situ via SpyCatcher and SpyTag interaction, to readily combine a model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3) with four different membrane anchors (Lpp&#8208;OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA&#8208;I). This approach has the significant advantage that passengers and membrane anchors can be freely combined in a modular fashion without the need to generate direct genetic fusion constructs in each case. We demonstrate that the membrane anchors impact not only cell growth and membrane integrity, but also the BM3 surface display capacity and whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic activity. The previously used Lpp&#8208;OmpA as well as PgsA were found to be efficient for the display of BM3 via SpyCatcher/SpyTag interaction. Our strategy can be transferred to other user&#8208;defined anchor and passenger combinations and could thus be used for acceleration and improvement of various applications involving cell surface display.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highway to optimized surface display&lt;/b&gt;: A modular surface display system, employing the SpyCatcher/SpyTag bioconjugation system, is used for rapid comparison of the membrane anchors Lpp-OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA-I with respect to their performance for surface display of the model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3. The described combinatorial screening method helps to minimize the workload required for identifying the most suitable membrane anchor for a given application.

         <title>New Trends and Future Opportunities in the Enzymatic Formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds</title>

Recent research on the biocatalytic formation of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O is surveyed in this review to provide an overview of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field as well as future perspectives.







Abstract
Organic chemistry provides society with fundamental products we use daily. Concerns about the impact that the chemical industry has over the environment is propelling major changes in the way we manufacture chemicals. Biocatalysis offers an alternative to other synthetic approaches as it employs enzymes, Nature's catalysts, to carry out chemical transformations. Enzymes are biodegradable, come from renewable sources, operate under mild reaction conditions, and display high selectivities in the processes they catalyse. As a highly multidisciplinary field, biocatalysis benefits from advances in different areas, and developments in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering have accelerated the extension of the range of available transformations (E.&#8197;L. Bell et&#8197;al., Nat. Rev. Meth. Prim. 2021, 1, 1&#8211;21). Recently, we surveyed advances in the expansion of the scope of biocatalysis via enzyme discovery and protein engineering (J.&#8197;R. Marshall et&#8197;al., Tetrahedron 2021, 82, 131926). Herein, we focus on novel enzymes currently available to the broad synthetic community for the construction of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bonds, with the purpose of providing the non&#8208;specialist with new and alternative tools for chiral and sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Structures of the Human SPAK and OSR1 Conserved C&#8208;Terminal (CCT) Domains**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibition of SPAK and OSR1 kinases binding to their upstream WNK kinases has been identified as a plausible strategy for inhibiting the WNK&#8208;activation of SPAK and OSR1 kinases. To facilitate the discovery of SPAK and OSR1 kinase inhibitors as potential therapeutics, we report the crystal structures of the highly conserved C&#8208;terminal domains of human SPAK and OSR1, which mediate the binding to, and activation, by their upstream WNK kinases.







Abstract
STE20/SPS1&#8208;related proline/alanine&#8208;rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress responsive 1 (OSR1) kinase are two serine/threonine protein kinases that regulate the function of ion co&#8208;transporters through phosphorylation. The highly conserved C&#8208;terminal (CCT) domains of SPAK and OSR1 bind to RFx[V/I] peptide sequences from their upstream &#8216;With No Lysine Kinases (WNKs), facilitating their activation via phosphorylation. Thus, the inhibition of SPAK and OSR1 binding, via their CCT domains, to WNK kinases is a plausible strategy for inhibiting SPAK and OSR1 kinases. To facilitate structure&#8208;guided drug design of such inhibitors, we expressed and purified human SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains and solved their crystal structures. Interestingly, these crystal structures show a highly conserved primary pocket adjacent to a flexible secondary pocket. We also employed a biophysical strategy and determined the affinity of SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains to short peptides derived from WNK4 and NKCC1. Together, this work provides a platform that facilitates the design of CCT domain specific small molecule binders that inhibit SPAK&#8208; and OSR1&#8208;activation by WNK kinases, and these could be useful in treating hypertension and ischemic stroke.

         <title>Rapid Estimation of Membrane Protein Orientation in Liposomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid fluorescence&#8208;based method for the estimation of membrane protein (MP) orientation in liposomes was developed. For the determination of MP orientation, the fluorescence of site&#8208;specifically labeled mutants was monitored. Outside&#8208;oriented fluorophores are quenched with membrane&#8208;impermeable corresponding quencher, before solubilization of liposomes by detergent, leading to maximal quench. MP orientation corresponds to the ratio of first to full quench.







Abstract
The topological organization of proteins embedded in biological membranes is crucial for the tight interplay between these enzymes and their accessibility to substrates in order to fulfil enzymatic activity. The orientation of a membrane protein reconstituted in artificial membranes depends on many parameters and is hardly predictable. Here, we present a convenient approach to assess this important property independent of the enzymatic activity of the reconstituted protein. Based on cysteine&#8208;specific chemical modification of a target membrane protein with a cyanine fluorophore and a corresponding membrane&#8208;impermeable fluorescence quencher, the novel strategy allows rapid evaluation of the distribution of the two orientations after reconstitution. The assay has been tested for the respiratory complexes bo3 oxidase and ATP synthase of Escherichia coli and the results agree well with other orientation determination approaches. Given the simple procedure, the proposed method is a powerful tool for optimization of reconstitution conditions or quantitative orientation information prior to functional measurements.

         <title>Binding Methylarginines and Methyllysines as Free Amino Acids: A Comparative Study of Multiple Host Classes**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparative binding studies for three different host classes (calixarenes, acyclic cucurbiturils and other cleft&#8208;like hosts) are presented. Each was studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships. Molecular modelling was used to gain insight on the preferences of the different hosts.







Abstract
Methylated free amino acids are an important class of targets for host&#8208;guest chemistry that have recognition properties distinct from those of methylated peptides and proteins. We present comparative binding studies for three different host classes that are each studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships. The hosts studied are all anionic and include three calixarenes, two acyclic cucurbiturils, and two other cleft&#8208;like hosts, a clip and a tweezer. We determined the binding association constants for a panel of methylated amino acids using indicator displacement assays. The acyclic cucurbiturils display stronger binding to the methylated amino acids, and some unique patterns of selectivity. The two other cleft&#8208;like hosts follow two different trends, shallow host (clip) following similar trends to the calixarenes, and the other more closed host (tweezer) binding certain less&#8208;methylated amino acids stronger than their methylated counterparts. Molecular modelling sheds some light on the different preferences of the various hosts. The results identify hosts with new selectivities and with affinities in a range that could be useful for biomedical applications. The overall selectivity patterns are explained by a common framework that considers the geometry, depth of binding pockets, and functional group participation across all host classes.

         <title>Direct Enzymatic Synthesis of Fatty Amines from Renewable Triglycerides and Oils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils was achieved with an enzyme cascade comprised of a lipase, a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA). Multiple amines were successfully synthesized in one pot, with analytical yields as high as 97&#8201;%. Moreover, a 75&#8197;mL scale preparative scale reaction was carried out for trilaurin, obtaining 73&#8201;% isolated yield to the corresponding amine.







Abstract
Fatty amines represent an important class of commodity chemicals which have broad applicability in different industries. The synthesis of fatty amines starts from renewable sources such as vegetable oils or animal fats, but the process has multiple drawbacks that compromise the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the synthesis. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biocatalytic alternative towards the synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils. By coupling a lipase with a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA), we have accomplished the direct synthesis of multiple medium and long chain primary fatty amines in one pot with analytical yields as high as 97&#8201;%. We have also performed a 75&#8197;mL preparative scale reaction for the synthesis of laurylamine from trilaurin, obtaining 73&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Discovery of Two Novel Oxidases Using a High&#8208;Throughput Activity Screen</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In search of novel enzymatic activities: Application of a high&#8208;throughput activity screening platform has led to the discovery of two novel enzymes: N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;hexosamine oxidase, a previously orphan enzyme, and a novel type of long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase, a non&#8208;homologous isofunctional enzyme (NISE) to known enzymes with this activity.







Abstract
Discovery of novel enzymes is a challenging task, yet a crucial one, due to their increasing relevance as chemical catalysts and biotechnological tools. In our work we present a high&#8208;throughput screening approach to discovering novel activities. A screen of 96 putative oxidases with 23 substrates led to the discovery of two new enzymes. The first enzyme, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;hexosamine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.29) from Ralstonia solanacearum, is a vanillyl alcohol oxidase&#8208;like flavoprotein displaying the highest activity with N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. Before our discovery of the enzyme, its activity was an orphan one &#8208; experimentally characterized but lacking the link to amino acid sequence. The second enzyme, from an uncultured marine euryarchaeota, is a long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase (LCAO, EC 1.1.3.20) active with a range of fatty alcohols, with 1&#8208;dodecanol being the preferred substrate. The enzyme displays no sequence similarity to previously characterised LCAOs, and thus is a completely novel representative of a protein with such activity.

         <title>The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Yariv reagents are a class of tris&#8208;azo dyes, some of which stain and precipitate arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), plant cell wall proteoglycans. These dyes form supramolecular aggregates in solution. In this study, CD spectroscopy revealed that the aggregates exhibit helical chirality. Only those aggregates with right&#8208;handed helicity have a fertile interaction with AGP, while those with left&#8208;handed helicity do not bind. Artwork credit: D. Caianiello and M. Bohne.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A useful fluorinated NMR probe: &#945;&#8208;Quaternarized (R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) is a good tool for providing convenient and accurate 19F NMR&#8208;based monitoring of trypsin proteolytic activity and increases resistance towards pepsin degradation.







Abstract
Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are useful tools for improving the bioavailability of peptides but can also serve as fluorinated probes in 19F NMR&#8208;based enzymatic assays. We report herein that the use of the non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;quaternarized (R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine ((R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) provides convenient and accurate monitoring of trypsin proteolytic activity and increases resistance towards pepsin degradation.

         <title>Strong and Specific Recognition of CAG/CTG Repeat DNA (5&#8217;&#8208;dWGCWGCW&#8208;3&#8217;) by a Cyclic Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide, which binds to the CAG/CTG repeat sequence with high specificity and affinity, is reported.







Abstract
Abnormally expanded CAG/CTG repeat DNA sequences lead to a variety of neurological diseases, such as Huntington's disease. Here, we synthesized a cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide (cPIP), which can bind to the minor groove of the CAG/CTG DNA sequence. The double&#8208;stranded DNA melting temperature (Tm) and surface plasmon resonance assays revealed the high binding affinity of the cPIP. In addition, next&#8208;generation sequencing showed that the cPIP had high specificity for its target DNA sequence.

         <title>Scalable and Selective &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis Catalyzed by Promiscuous l&#8208;Threonine Transaldolase ObiH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ObiH is an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase which catalyzes the diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. We have demonstrated the synthetic utility of this enzyme through preparative scale reactions to selectively generate a structurally diverse array of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, as well as downstream functionalization to generate important organic building blocks, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;keto acids.







Abstract
Enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways possess broad potential for the selective synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. However, the practical application of these enzymes for organic synthesis is dependent on the development of efficient, economical, operationally simple, and well&#8208;characterized systems for preparative scale reactions. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap for the selective biocatalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, which are important synthetic building blocks. To achieve this goal, we demonstrated the ability of ObiH, an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase, to achieve selective milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of a diverse array of non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs) using a scalable whole cell platform. We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids possessing broad functional&#8208;group diversity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ObiH is an &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-threonine transaldolase&lt;/b&gt; which catalyzes the diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids. We have demonstrated the synthetic utility of this enzyme through preparative scale reactions to selectively generate a structurally diverse array of &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids, as well as downstream functionalization to generate important organic building blocks, such as &#946;-chloro-&#945;-amino acids and &#945;-keto acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways possess broad potential for the selective synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. However, the practical application of these enzymes for organic synthesis is dependent on the development of efficient, economical, operationally simple, and well-characterized systems for preparative scale reactions. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap for the selective biocatalytic synthesis of &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids, which are important synthetic building blocks. To achieve this goal, we demonstrated the ability of ObiH, an &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-threonine transaldolase, to achieve selective milligram-scale synthesis of a diverse array of non-standard amino acids (nsAAs) using a scalable whole cell platform. We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re-entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH-catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids possessing broad functional-group diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ObiH-generated &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids could be modified through additional transformations to access important motifs, such as &#946;-chloro-&#945;-amino acids and substituted &#945;-keto acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Varying the Directionality of Protein Catalysts for Aldol and Retro&#8208;Aldol Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein catalysts with varied levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions were generated using the same protein scaffold.







Abstract
Natural aldolase enzymes and created retro&#8208;aldolase protein catalysts often catalyze both aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions depending on the concentrations of the reactants and the products. Here, we report that the directionality of protein catalysts can be altered by replacing one amino acid. The protein catalyst derived from a scaffold of a previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst, catalyzed aldol reactions more efficiently than the previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst. The retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst efficiently catalyzed the retro&#8208;aldol reaction but was less efficient in catalyzing the aldol reaction. The results indicate that protein catalysts with varying levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions can be generated from the same protein scaffold.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Up Sugars: Glycosyltransferase Cross&#8208;Reactivity in Cancerous Tissues and Their Therapeutic Targeting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically incompatible and/or cryptic glycans can be expressed in cancer. In humans, both humoral and cellular natural immunity exists against these glycans. The fact that tumors expressing these glycans grow indicates that immunity is not strong enough. However, it can be enhanced by active/passive immunization, for example, using mini&#8208;transfusion of glycan&#8208;expressing red blood cells, which may have the potential to be used for novel cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
The main categories of glycan changes in cancer are: (1)&#8197;decreased expression of histo&#8208;blood group A and/or B antigens and increased Lewis&#8208;related antigens, (2)&#8197;appearance of cryptic antigens, such as Tn and T, (3)&#8197;emergence of genetically incompatible glycans, such as A antigen expressed in tumors of individuals of group B or O and heterophilic expression of Forssman antigen (FORS1), and (4)&#8197;appearance of neoglycans. This review focuses on the expression of genetically incompatible A/B/FORS1 antigens in cancer. Several possible molecular mechanisms are exemplified, including missense mutations that alter the sugar specificity of A and B glycosyltransferases (AT and BT, respectively), restoration of the correct codon reading frame of O alleles, and modification of acceptor specificity of AT to synthesize the FORS1 antigen by missense mutations and/or altered splicing. Taking advantage of pre&#8208;existing natural immunity, the potential uses of these glycans for immunotherapeutic targeting will also be discussed.

         <title>Interfacial Interactions within Amyloid Protein Corona Based on 2D MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer can be adsorbed to the surface of the MoS2 nanosheet through van der Waals forces. Especially the hIAPP (human islet amyloid peptide) pentamer can attach to the surface in a stable standing mode. The entire parallel surface of the &#946;&#8208;pleated structure greatly contributes to the interaction with the neighboring protein molecules, and further enhances the probability of amyloid formation.







Abstract
The interfacial interaction within the amyloid protein corona based on MoS2 nanomaterial is crucial, both for understanding the biological effects of MoS2 nanomaterial and the evolution of amyloid diseases. The specific nano&#8208;bio interface phenomenon of human islet amyloid peptide (hIAPP) and MoS2 nanosheet was investigated by using theoretical and experimental methods. The MoS2 nanosheet enables the attraction of hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer on its surface through van der Waals forces. Especially, the means of interaction between two hIAPP peptides might be changed by MoS2 nanosheet. In addition, it is interesting to find that the hIAPP oligomer can stably interact with the MoS2 nanosheet in one unique &#8220;standing&#8221; binding mode with an entire exposed &#946;&#8208;sheet surface. All the interaction modes on the surface of MoS2 nanosheet can be the essence of amyloid protein corona that may provide the venue to facilitate the fibrillation of hIAPP proteins. Further, it was verified experimentally that MoS2 nanosheets could accelerate the fibrillation of hIAPP at a certain concentration mainly based on the newly formed nano&#8208;bio interface. In general, our results provide insight into the molecular interaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;bio interface within the amyloid protein corona, and shed light on the pathway of amyloid protein aggregation that is related to the evolution of amyloid diseases.

Various nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, and differentiate. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool.







Abstract
At the cellular level, numerous nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, differentiate, etc. Understanding and manipulating the cellular functions in&#8197;vitro, necessitates the elucidation of these nanocues provided to the cells by the extracellular matrix (ECM), neighbouring cells or in the form of ligands. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool. We also provide a brief outlook on the current challenges and the future potentials of these DNA&#8208;based nanostructures so as to inspire novel innovations in the field.

         <title>Controlling Enzymatic Activity by Modulating the Oligomerization State via Chemical Rescue and Optical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching activity by switching the oligomerization state: The cover feature illustrates the switching of an enzyme's activity by modulating its oligomerization state using light. A photo&#8208;sensitive unnatural amino acid (UAA) was incorporated into the oligomerization interface of the enzyme, leading to disassembly of the native hexamer into dimers. This was associated with a loss of activity, symbolized by the red dots at the active sites. Upon light exposure, the UAA was cleaved, which led to hexamer reformation and recovery of activity (green dots at the active sites). More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Kropp, A. Bruckmann, and P. Babinger.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switching activity by switching the oligomerization state&lt;/b&gt;: The cover feature illustrates the switching of an enzyme's activity by modulating its oligomerization state using light. A photo-sensitive unnatural amino acid (UAA) was incorporated into the oligomerization interface of the enzyme, leading to disassembly of the native hexamer into dimers. This was associated with a loss of activity, symbolized by the red dots at the active sites. Upon light exposure, the UAA was cleaved, which led to hexamer reformation and recovery of activity (green dots at the active sites).

         <title>Recent Advances in Small Molecule&#8208;Based Intracellular pH Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular pH plays a significant role in many pathological and biological processes. Abnormal physiological pH is an indication of many health disorders. Small molecule (quinoline, coumarin, rhodamine, indolium, BODIPY)&#8208;based fluorescent probes are found to be an effective tool for the determination of biological pH through cell imaging studies. This review article is focused on recent advances in small&#8208;molecule based biological pH probes.







Abstract
Intracellular pH plays an important role in many biological and pathological processes. Small&#8208;molecule based pH probes are found to be the most effective for pH sensing because of ease of preparation, high sensitivity, and quick response. They have many advantages such as small perturbation to the functions of the target, functional adaptability, cellular component&#8208;specific localization, etc. The present review highlights the flurry of recent activity in the development of such probes. The probes are categorized based on the type of fluorophore used like quinoline, coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, indolium, naphthalimide, etc., and their analytical performance is discussed.

         <title>The Conversion of Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by Nitrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogenases reduce inert dinitrogen to bioavailable ammonia and thus &#8216;feed&#8217; the Earth's biosphere. To catalyze this challenging reaction, nitrogenases are equipped with a complex reduction machinery that also permits the remarkable conversion of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In particular, the formation of methane and hydrocarbons opens up the prospect of future biotechnological processes for carbon capture and utilization by nitrogenases.







Abstract
Nitrogenases are the only known family of enzymes that catalyze the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3). The N2 reduction drives biological nitrogen fixation and the global nitrogen cycle. Besides the conversion of N2, nitrogenases catalyze a whole range of other reductions, including the reduction of the small gaseous substrates carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to hydrocarbons. However, it remains an open question whether these &#8216;side reactivities&#8217; play a role under environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these reactivities and particularly the formation of hydrocarbons have spurred the interest in nitrogenases for biotechnological applications. There are three different isozymes of nitrogenase: the molybdenum and the alternative vanadium and iron&#8208;only nitrogenase. The isozymes differ in their metal content, structure, and substrate&#8208;dependent activity, despite their homology. This minireview focuses on the conversion of CO and CO2 to methane and higher hydrocarbons and aims to specify the differences in activity between the three nitrogenase isozymes.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a Stable Isostere of Malonyllysine**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal&#8208;induced decarboxylation property of lysine malonylation may impose potential challenges to its study. Our study demonstrated that malonyltetrazole&#8208;modified lysine outstands as a stable bioisostere of malonyllysine to address such challenges. Enzymology data also verified that malonyl and malonyltetrazole share similar molecular interaction surfaces for receptor recognition.







Abstract
Lysine malonylation is a recently characterized post&#8208;translational modification involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and gene expression. One unique feature of this post&#8208;translational modification is its potential susceptibility to decarboxylation, which poses possible challenges to its study. As a step towards addressing these challenges, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a stable isostere of malonyllysine. First, we find that synthetic substitution of the malonyl group with a tetrazole isostere results in amino acid's resistant to thermal decarboxylation. Next, we demonstrate that protected variants of this amino acid are readily incorporated into peptides. Finally, we show that tetrazole isosteres of malonyllysine can be recognized by anti&#8208;malonyllysine antibodies and histone deacylases, validating their ability to mimic features of the endogenous lysine modification. Overall, this study establishes a new chemical strategy for stably mimicking a metabolite&#8208;derived post&#8208;translational modification, providing a foothold for tool development and functional analyses.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chalcogen bonds involving selenium and sulfur are prevalent in proteins. The work presented herein is the first extensive report on chalcogen bonds in proteins. Quantum mechanical calculations suggest that these interactions are highly directional and quite strong noncovalent interactions; the interaction energy can be as much as &#8722;15&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
The importance of selenium&#8208;centered noncovalent chalcogen bonds represented as Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;A (A=O/S) has been explored for short directional contacts in small molecules and proteins. In addition, S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O centered contacts have been analyzed. Computational analyses involving the quantitative assessment of the associated energetics, the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP), and electron density derived topological parameters, namely, quantum theory of atom in molecules (QTAIM) analyses, and NBO (natural bond orbital) based calculations, have been performed to unequivocally establish the strength, stability, and attractive role of chalcogen bonds in the solid&#8208;state. This investigation has been performed in molecules from both the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and Protein Data Bank (PDB). Thus futuristic materials may be designed keeping in mind the significance of these interactions, including their relevance in biology.

         <title>Engineering of a Plant Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthase for Development of Irregular Coupling Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side activity of a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase results in two non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail terpene structures. For one of them, a cyclobutane planococcyl diphosphate, this is the first example of an efficient enzymatic synthesis. Rational design of the protein allowed for a considerable increase of the irregular activity. The engineered enzyme can be implicated in the sustainable production of insect pheromones for environment&#8208;friendly pest control.







Abstract
We performed mutagenesis on a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (IDS), neryl diphosphate synthase from Solanum lycopersicum (SlNPPS), that has a structurally related analogue performing non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling of two dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) units, lavandulyl diphosphate synthase from Lavandula x intermedia (LiLPPS). Wild&#8208;type SlNPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in cis&#8208;orientation resulting in the formation of neryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able to catalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregular monoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis of their dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The second compound is the trans&#8208;isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregular cyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregular activity of SlNPPS constitutes 0.4&#8201;% of its regular activity and is revealed only if the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in the absence of IPP. The exchange of asparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling. While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutant reaches 13.1&#8201;% of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regular IDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at the development of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.

Wild-type &lt;i&gt;Sl&lt;/i&gt;NPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-orientation resulting in the formation of neryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able to catalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregular monoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis of their dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The second compound is the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregular cyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregular activity of &lt;i&gt;Sl&lt;/i&gt;NPPS constitutes 0.4&#8201;% of its regular activity and is revealed only if the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in the absence of IPP. The exchange of asparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non-head-to-tail coupling. While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutant reaches 13.1&#8201;% of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regular IDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at the development of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Spike Protein Mutations in the Infectious Power of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Variants: A Molecular Interaction Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The infectious power of several SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 variants, commonly described by R0, are rationalized under a molecular interaction perspective using molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanical descriptors of the nature of bonding interactions, and calculated spectral features of the specific mutations in the spike protein and the interactions of the replaced residues with the ACE2 receptor. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Cappelli, A. Restrepo et&#8197;al.

         <title>Design of a Full&#8208;Consensus Glutamate Decarboxylase and Its Application to GABA Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a remarkable biocatalyst for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acid (GABA) from l&#8208;glutamate. In this study, artificial GAD named FcGAD (full consensus glutamate decarboxylase) was designed by consensus protein design. FcGAD exhibits suitable properties for application in GABA biosynthesis. This Front Cover (created by Takashi Tsujino, Science Graphics. Co., Ltd.) highlights the design concept and application of FcGAD to the biosynthesis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Nakano, S. Ito et&#8197;al.

         <title>Orthogonal Peptide&#8208;Templated Labeling Elucidates Lateral ETAR/ETBR Proximity and Reveals Altered Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidation of protein interactions in living cells is a critical step in deciphering pharmacological targets. Here, we apply an orthogonal labeling approach to G protein&#8208;coupled receptors by two peptide pairs, interacting through coiled&#8208;coil motifs. The rapid reporter introduction in a one&#8208;pot reaction allows the investigation of transient and proximity&#8208;dependent interplay of different receptor proteins at the cell membrane. Focusing on prominent cardiovascular receptors, present in heart and blood vessel tissue, distinct receptor&#8211;receptor interactions have been identified that modulate intracellular signaling cascades. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;G. Beck&#8208;Sickinger et&#8197;al.

         <title>Xanthopsin&#8208;Like Systems via Site&#8208;Specific Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Retinoic Acid Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed in the irreversible site&#8208;specific and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket. This research opens the way to the preparation of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors, potentially useful for both optogenetic and &#8220;lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule&#8221; tools.







Abstract
The use of light&#8208;responsive proteins to control both living or synthetic cells, is at the core of the expanding fields of optogenetics and synthetic biology. It is thus apparent that a richer reaction toolbox for the preparation of such systems is of fundamental importance. Here, we provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration that Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed to perform a facile site&#8208;specific, irreversible and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket and yielding an unnatural chromophore with an extended &#960;&#8208;system. In doing so we effectively open the path to the in&#8197;vitro preparation of a library of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors. We argue that such a library, made of variable unnatural chromophores inserted in an easy&#8208;to&#8208;mutate and crystallize retinoic acid transporter, significantly expand the scope of the recently introduced rhodopsin mimics as both optogenetic and &#8220;lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule&#8221; tools.

         <title>Predictive Engineering of Class I Terpene Synthases Using Experimental and Computational Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a remarkable lack of sequence&#8208;function relationship within the terpene synthase family making product&#8208;outcome predictions from sequences alone challenging. Engineering of designer terpene synthases is enabled via integration of multidisciplinary approaches, including generation of sequence diversity, genome mining, high&#8208;throughput product profiling, modelling and computational chemistry, and data&#8208;driven computational tools.







Abstract
Terpenoids are a highly diverse group of natural products with considerable industrial interest. Increasingly, engineered microbes are used for the production of terpenoids to replace natural extracts and chemical synthesis. Terpene synthases (TSs) show a high level of functional plasticity and are responsible for the vast structural diversity observed in natural terpenoids. Their relatively inert active sites guide intrinsically reactive linear carbocation intermediates along one of many cyclisation paths via exertion of subtle steric and electrostatic control. Due to the absence of a strong protein interaction with these intermediates, there is a remarkable lack of sequence&#8208;function relationship within the TS family, making product&#8208;outcome predictions from sequences alone challenging. This, in combination with the fact that many TSs produce multiple products from a single substrate hampers the design and use of TSs in the biomanufacturing of terpenoids. This review highlights recent advances in genome mining, computational modelling, high&#8208;throughput screening, and machine&#8208;learning that will allow more predictive engineering of these fascinating enzymes in the near future.

         <title>Peptides Derived from Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B Show Potent Binding to Neuropilin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VEGF&#8208;B binds to the b1 domain of neuropilin&#8208;1. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides show potent binding to neuropilin&#8208;1 (KD=0.13 to 9.55&#8197;&#956;M) and inhibit binding of VEGF&#8208;A in a cell&#8208;based assay (IC50=0.3 to 2.0&#8197;&#956;M). Peptide lipidation increased binding and plasma half&#8208;lives.







Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate significant pathways in angiogenesis, myocardial and neuronal protection, metabolism, and cancer progression. The VEGF&#8208;B growth factor is involved in cell survival, anti&#8208;apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms, through binding to VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin&#8208;1 (NRP1). We employed surface plasmon resonance technology and X&#8208;ray crystallography to analyse the molecular basis of the interaction between VEGF&#8208;B and the b1 domain of NRP1, and developed VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus derived peptides to be used as chemical tools for studying VEGF&#8208;B &#8208; NRP1 related pathways. Peptide lipidation was used as a means to stabilise the peptides. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides containing a C&#8208;terminal arginine show potent binding to NRP1&#8208;b1. Peptide lipidation increased binding residence time and improved plasma stability. A crystal structure of a peptide with NRP1 demonstrated that VEGF&#8208;B peptides bind at the canonical C&#8208;terminal arginine binding site. VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus imparts higher affinity for NRP1 than the corresponding VEGF&#8208;A165 region. This tight binding may impact on the activity and selectivity of the full&#8208;length protein. The VEGF&#8208;B167 derived peptides were more effective than VEGF&#8208;A165 peptides in blocking functional phosphorylation events. Blockers of VEGF&#8208;B function have potential applications in diabetes and non&#8208;alcoholic fatty liver disease.

         <title>Reactivity Analysis of New Multivalent Electrophilic Probes for Affinity Labeling of Carbohydrate Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle&#8208;based affinity labeling probes displaying electrophilic groups and a carbohydrate ligand were synthesized and their reactivity toward carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins was evaluated. The cover feature shows a cartoon scene where a carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein, displayed as a nobility&#8208;like figure, is seated on a carbohydrate ligand and is receiving guests, each offering an electrophilic group as a gift. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Sakurai et&#8197;al.

         <title>From Basic Biology Discovery to Translational Impact: The Boundless Roles of Chemical Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As academia and industry push the boundaries of chemical biology more and more from basic science into impacting human health, we asked experts in the field what uniquely positions chemical biology as a translational science, how and when to maximize its potential, and where the field is headed. We also reflect personally on how chemical biology has impacted our careers in industry and academia.

         <title>Progress on the Physiological Function of Mitochondrial DNA and Its Specific Detection and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and status quo of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) imaging and detection are highlighted in this minireview, and insights for designing excellent mtDNA probes are provided. New treatments for mtDNA&#8208;related diseases are also discussed.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the genetic information of mitochondrion, and its structure is circular double&#8208;stranded. Despite the diminutive size of the mitochondrial genome, mtDNA mutations are an important cause of mitochondrial diseases which are characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial diseases are involved in multiple systems, particularly in the organs that are highly dependent on aerobic metabolism. The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is more complicated since mtDNA mutations can cause various clinical symptoms. To realize more accurate diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial diseases, the detection of mtDNA and the design of drugs acting on it are extremely important. Over the past few years, many probes and therapeutic drugs targeting mtDNA have been developed, making significant contributions to fundamental research including elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases at the genetic level. In this review, we summarize the structure, function, and detection approaches for mtDNA. The most current topics in this field, such as mechanistic exploration and treatment of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related disorders, are also reviewed. Specific attention is given to discussing the design and development of these probes and drugs for mtDNA. We hope that this review will provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the importance of mtDNA, and promote the development of effective molecules for theragnosis of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Creation of an engineered amide synthetase biocatalyst by the rational separation of a two&#8208;step nitrile synthetase.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly&#8208;used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitriles synthetases (NSs) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The B. subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is a NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly&#8208;conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.</dc:description>
