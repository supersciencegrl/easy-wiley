         <title>Predictive Engineering of Class I Terpene Synthases Using Experimental and Computational Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a remarkable lack of sequence&#8208;function relationship within the terpene synthase family making product&#8208;outcome predictions from sequences alone challenging. Engineering of designer terpene synthases is enabled via integration of multidisciplinary approaches, including generation of sequence diversity, genome mining, high&#8208;throughput product profiling, modelling and computational chemistry, and data&#8208;driven computational tools.







Abstract
Terpenoids are a highly diverse group of natural products with considerable industrial interest. Increasingly, engineered microbes are used for the production of terpenoids to replace natural extracts and chemical synthesis. Terpene synthases (TSs) show a high level of functional plasticity and are responsible for the vast structural diversity observed in natural terpenoids. Their relatively inert active sites guide intrinsically reactive linear carbocation intermediates along one of many cyclisation paths via exertion of subtle steric and electrostatic control. Due to the absence of a strong protein interaction with these intermediates, there is a remarkable lack of sequence&#8208;function relationship within the TS family, making product&#8208;outcome predictions from sequences alone challenging. This, in combination with the fact that many TSs produce multiple products from a single substrate hampers the design and use of TSs in the biomanufacturing of terpenoids. This review highlights recent advances in genome mining, computational modelling, high&#8208;throughput screening, and machine&#8208;learning that will allow more predictive engineering of these fascinating enzymes in the near future.

         <title>From Basic Biology Discovery to Translational Impact: The Boundless Roles of Chemical Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As academia and industry push the boundaries of chemical biology more and more from basic science into impacting human health, we asked experts in the field what uniquely positions chemical biology as a translational science, how and when to maximize its potential, and where the field is headed. We also reflect personally on how chemical biology has impacted our careers in industry and academia.

         <title>Peptides Derived from Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B Show Potent Binding to Neuropilin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VEGF&#8208;B binds to the b1 domain of neuropilin&#8208;1. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides show potent binding to neuropilin&#8208;1 (KD=0.13 to 9.55&#8197;&#956;M) and inhibit binding of VEGF&#8208;A in a cell&#8208;based assay (IC50=0.3 to 2.0&#8197;&#956;M). Peptide lipidation increased binding and plasma half&#8208;lives.







Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate significant pathways in angiogenesis, myocardial and neuronal protection, metabolism, and cancer progression. The VEGF&#8208;B growth factor is involved in cell survival, anti&#8208;apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms, through binding to VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin&#8208;1 (NRP1). We employed surface plasmon resonance technology and X&#8208;ray crystallography to analyse the molecular basis of the interaction between VEGF&#8208;B and the b1 domain of NRP1, and developed VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus derived peptides to be used as chemical tools for studying VEGF&#8208;B &#8208; NRP1 related pathways. Peptide lipidation was used as a means to stabilise the peptides. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides containing a C&#8208;terminal arginine show potent binding to NRP1&#8208;b1. Peptide lipidation increased binding residence time and improved plasma stability. A crystal structure of a peptide with NRP1 demonstrated that VEGF&#8208;B peptides bind at the canonical C&#8208;terminal arginine binding site. VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus imparts higher affinity for NRP1 than the corresponding VEGF&#8208;A165 region. This tight binding may impact on the activity and selectivity of the full&#8208;length protein. The VEGF&#8208;B167 derived peptides were more effective than VEGF&#8208;A165 peptides in blocking functional phosphorylation events. Blockers of VEGF&#8208;B function have potential applications in diabetes and non&#8208;alcoholic fatty liver disease.

         <title>Reactivity Analysis of New Multivalent Electrophilic Probes for Affinity Labeling of Carbohydrate Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle&#8208;based affinity labeling probes displaying electrophilic groups and a carbohydrate ligand were synthesized and their reactivity toward carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins was evaluated. The cover feature shows a cartoon scene where a carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein, displayed as a nobility&#8208;like figure, is seated on a carbohydrate ligand and is receiving guests, each offering an electrophilic group as a gift. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Sakurai et&#8197;al.

         <title>Structural Basis for The Recognition of Deaminated Nucleobases by An Archaeal DNA Polymerase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 21, Page 3060-3066, November 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their life in hot environments, archaea are increasingly affected by deamination of the bases cytosine and adenine. To prevent mutations, archaeal DNA polymerases seem to recognize these base changes by a so&#8208;called &#8220;read&#8208;ahead&#8221; mechanism and react accordingly. Here we show by means of crystal structures how Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase binds uracil and hypoxanthine in a special binding pocket and thus can recognize these bases on the single stranded template overhang already six nucleotides before the active site.







Abstract
With increasing temperature, nucleobases in DNA become increasingly damaged by hydrolysis of exocyclic amines. The most prominent damage includes the conversion of cytosine to uracil and adenine to hypoxanthine. These damages are mutagenic and put the integrity of the genome at risk if not repaired appropriately. Several archaea live at elevated temperatures and thus, are exposed to a higher risk of deamination. Earlier studies have shown that DNA polymerases of archaea have the property of sensing deaminated nucleobases in the DNA template and thereby stalling the DNA synthesis during DNA replication providing another layer of DNA damage recognition and repair. However, the structural basis of uracil and hypoxanthine sensing by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases is sparse. Here we report on three new crystal structures of the archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase in complex with primer and template strands that have extended single stranded DNA template 5&#8217;&#8208;overhangs. These overhangs contain either the canonical nucleobases as well as uracil or hypoxanthine, respectively, and provide unprecedented structural insights into their recognition by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases.

         <title>Development of Tyrphostin Analogues to Study Inhibition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pup Proteasome System**

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like (pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development. In this study a screen was performed identifying Tyrphostins as low micromolar inhibitors of the Mtb protease Dop. To gain insight in the important functional aspects of these inhibitors, 25 new analogues were prepared and validated, in&#8197;vitro. Several new compounds were able to inhibit both the depupylating activity of Dop as well as the pupylating activity of de pup ligase PafA.







Abstract
Tuberculosis is a global health problem caused by infection with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacteria. Although antibiotic treatment has dramatically reduced the impact of tuberculosis on the population, the existence and spreading of drug resistant strains urgently demands the development of new drugs that target Mtb in a different manner than currently used antibiotics. The prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (Pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development as it is unique to Mtb and related bacterial genera. Using a Pup&#8208;based fluorogenic substrate, we screened for inhibitors of Dop, the Mtb depupylating protease, and identified I&#8208;OMe&#8208;Tyrphostin AG538 (1) and Tyrphostin AG538 (2). The hits were validated and determined to be fast&#8208;reversible, non&#8208;ATP competitive inhibitors. We synthesized &gt;25 analogs of 1 and 2 and show that several of the synthesized compounds also inhibit the depupylation actions of Dop on native substrate, FabD&#8208;Pup. Importantly, the pupylation activity of PafA, the sole Pup ligase in Mtb, was also inhibited by some of these compounds.

         <title>Chimeric Flaviviral RNA&#8722;siRNA Molecules Resist Degradation by The Exoribonuclease Xrn1 and Trigger Gene Silencing in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 21, Page 3099-3106, November 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules comprising an Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA motif (xrRNA) and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex were engineered. The molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in mammalian cells. This work sets the stage for further investigations into using xrRNA motifs as building blocks in RNA&#8208;based nanotechnology.







Abstract
RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery, but the susceptibility of RNA to nuclease degradation remains a major barrier to its implementation in&#8197;vivo. Here, we engineered flaviviral Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA (xrRNA) motifs to host small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. The xrRNA&#8208;siRNA molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in 293T cells. The resistance of the molecules to Xrn1 does not translate to stability in blood serum. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that flavivirus&#8208;derived xrRNA motifs can confer Xrn1 resistance on a model therapeutic payload and set the stage for further investigations into using the motifs as building blocks in RNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Xylose&#8208;Configured Cyclophellitols as Selective Inhibitors for Glucocerebrosidase</title>

New selective GBA inhibitor: We show that the &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylose configured epoxide and aziridine are potent selective inhibitors towards GBA in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and their selectivity and inhibitory effect towards GBA are superior to the widely used GBA inhibitor Conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE).







Abstract
Glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidase, has recently been shown to hydrolyze &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides and to transxylosylate cholesterol. Genetic defects in GBA cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD), and also constitute a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. GBA and other retaining glycosidases can be selectively visualized by activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) using fluorescent probes composed of a cyclophellitol scaffold having a configuration tailored to the targeted glycosidase family. GBA processes &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides in addition to &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosides, this in contrast to the other two mammalian cellular retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidases, GBA2 and GBA3. Here we show that the xylopyranose preference also holds up for covalent inhibitors: xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridines selectively react with GBA over GBA2 and GBA3 in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and that the xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol is more potent and more selective for GBA than the classical GBA inhibitor, conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE). Both xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridine cause accumulation of glucosylsphingosine in zebrafish embryo, a characteristic hallmark of GD, and we conclude that these compounds are well suited for creating such chemically induced GD models.

         <title>Surface Density of Ligands Controls In&#8208;Plane and Aggregative Modes of Multivalent Glycovesicle&#8208;Lectin Recognitions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 21, Page 3075-3081, November 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of inter&#8208; and intracellular carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions that determine an inhibitory or productive biological function was investigated using glycovesicles as a synthetic membrane system. The ligand densities hold the key to the interactions occurring through either intramolecular or aggregative modes of binding. Nanomolar binding affinities govern these modes, within which the in&#8208;plane mode is more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.







Abstract
Glycovesicles are ideal tools to delineate finer mechanisms of the interactions at the biological cell membranes. Multivalency forms the basis which, in turn, should surpass more than one mechanism in order to maintain multiple roles that the ligand&#8208;lectin interactions encounter. Ligand densities hold a prime control to attenuate the interactions. In the present study, mannose trisaccharide interacting with a cognate receptor, namely, Con A, is assessed at the vesicle surface. Synthetic (1&#8594;3)(1&#8594;6)&#8208;branched mannose trisaccharides tethered with a diacetylene monomer and glycovesicles of varying sugar densities were prepared. The polydiacetylene vesicles were prepared by maintaining uniform lipid concentrations. The interactions of the glycovesicles with the lectin were probed through dynamic light scattering and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy techniques. Binding efficacies were assessed by surface plasmon resonance. Aggregative and in&#8208;plane modes of interactions show ligand&#8208;density dependence at the vesicle surface. Vesicles with sparsely populated ligands engage lectin in an aggregative mode (trans&#8208;), leading to a cross&#8208;linked complex formation. Whereas glycovesicles embedded with dense ligands engage lectin interaction in an in&#8208;plane mode intramolecularly (cis&#8208;). Sub&#8208;nanomolar dissociation constants govern the intramolecular interaction occurring within the plane of the vesicle, and are more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.

Assemble the puzzle: Replacing the N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in classical fluorophores with a four membered azetidine ring provides improved quantum yields. This strategy was extended to four types of bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and its differential effect was evaluated. Among them, the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from azetidine substitution and showed improvements of in fluorescence and bioluminescence emission.







Abstract
Replacing an N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in a classical fluorophore with a four membered azetidine ring provides an improved luminescence quantum yield. Herein, we extended this strategy to bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and evaluated its general validity. For this purpose, four types of luciferin cores were employed, and a total of eight analogues were evaluated. Among these analogues, unexpectedly, only the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from an azetidine substitution and showed enhanced bioluminescence. In addition, fluorescence measurements revealed that an azetidine substitution improved the fluorescence quantum yield by 2.3&#8208;times compared to a N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group. These findings clarify the differential effects of azetidine substituents in luciferins and present one possible strategy for enhancing photon output in benzothiazole type luciferins through a synthetic approach.

         <dc:description>
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. We employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify Tau binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides prevent the formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich Tau fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. They might be interesting for AD therapy.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Therefore, inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. Two hexapeptides within Tau, designated PHF6* (275&#8208;VQIINK&#8208;280) and PHF6 (306&#8208;VQIVYK&#8208;311), are known to promote Tau aggregation. Recently, the PHF6* segment has been described as the more potent driver of Tau aggregation. We therefore employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptide MMD3 and its retro&#8208;inverso form, designated MMD3rev, inhibited in&#8197;vitro fibrillization of the PHF6* peptide, the repeat domain of Tau as well as full&#8208;length Tau. Dynamic light scattering, pelleting assays and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that MMD3 prevents the formation of tau &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. NMR data suggest that the D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides bound to Tau monomers with rather low affinity, but ELISA (enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) data demonstrated binding to PHF6* and full length Tau fibrils. In addition, molecular insight into the binding mode of MMD3 to PHF6* fibrils were gained by in silico modelling. The identified PHF6*&#8208;targeting peptides were able to penetrate cells. The study establishes PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids as potential molecules for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in AD research.

Few methods exist to site&#8208;specifically label loops of globular proteins without interfering with the function of the protein. A modular &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive perfluoro&#8208;aromatic probe was synthesized in only two&#8208;steps and used to selectively modify an internal, surface exposed loop of the major capsid protein of JC polyomavirus (VP1). The perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl probe reacts selectively with the cysteine in the &#960;&#8208;clamp (Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe) over 6 native cysteines present in VP1. Using microscopy, fluorescently labeled &#960;&#8208;clamp VP1 can be observed binding and entering human glial cells. More information can be found in the Communication by F.&#8197;M. Rossi, C.&#8197;D.&#8197;S. Nelson et&#8197;al.

Diamidophosphate (DAP) is a dinitrogenous derivative of orthophosphate with demonstrated prebiotic phosphorylation capabilities in aqueous medium. The ability of DAP to facilitate phosphorylation&#8208;mediated transformation of a range of abiotic and biotic molecules warrants a deeper scrutiny of: (a)&#8197;its plausible geochemical provenance on the early Earth, (b)&#8197;its prospects for synthetic and bioorganic chemistry applications, and (c)&#8197;its potential role in transforming various classes of molecules leading to systems with emergent properties capable of exhibiting life&#8208;like behavior (synthetic biology).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diamidophosphate (DAP)&lt;/b&gt; is a dinitrogenous derivative of orthophosphate with demonstrated prebiotic phosphorylation capabilities in aqueous medium. The ability of DAP to facilitate phosphorylation-mediated transformation of a range of abiotic and biotic molecules warrants a deeper scrutiny of: (a)&#8197;its plausible geochemical provenance on the early Earth, (b)&#8197;its prospects for synthetic and bioorganic chemistry applications, and (c)&#8197;its potential role in transforming various classes of molecules leading to systems with emergent properties capable of exhibiting life-like behavior (synthetic biology).

         <title>X&#8208;rays Actuate Anticancer Drugs: Opening New Vistas in Prodrug Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 21, Page 2998-3000, November 3, 2021. </description>

The prodrug approach has emerged as a promising strategy for alleviating important limitations of small&#8208;molecule blockbuster chemotherapeutic drugs. Efficient and precise activation of a prodrug is the key for achieving the full potential of this strategy. Herein, we highlight the potential of X&#8208;rays for activating a prodrug locally in deep&#8208;seated tumors and point out its advantage over other activation triggers such as light.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality employed in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. Despite proven clinical success, adverse side effects are one of the drawbacks of this approach. The prodrug strategy has emerged as an alternative approach with the aim of alleviating these drawbacks. Prodrug activation is typically achieved by either endogenous or exogenous triggers. Exogenous triggers like light are appealing as they are independent of inherent patient and/or cancer&#8208;type variations. However, tissue penetration depth remains the Achilles&#8217; heel of this approach. In this context, usage of X&#8208;rays as the external trigger with infinite tissue penetration depth opens up exciting prospects in prodrug activation strategies.

New exciting strategies are being used to study and control O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, an overview of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided.







Abstract
The attachment of a single O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of numerous proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and plays an important role as a regulator of various cellular processes in both healthy and disease states. Advances in strategies and tools that allow for the detection of dynamic O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins have helped to enhance our initial and ongoing understanding of its dynamic effects on cellular stimuli and given insights into its link to the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases. Furthermore, chemical genetic strategies and related tools have been successfully applied to a myriad of biological systems with a new level of spatiotemporal and molecular precision. These strategies have started to be used in studying and controlling O&#8208;GlcNAcylation both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, overviews of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided. In addition, chemical genetic strategies that have already been applied or are potentially usable in O&#8208;GlcNAc functional are also discussed.

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP): A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 21, Page 3001-3009, November 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate (DAP), a di&#8208;nitrogenous analogue of orthophosphate, is a versatile phosphorylating&#8208;activating reagent and amine source in the context of aqueous prebiotic chemistry compatible with both prebiotic&#8208; and bio&#8208;molecules. The promising potential of this reagent, enabling a continuous transition from abiotic&#8208;to&#8208;biotic needs to be investigated both from its geochemical provenance and its applicability to (bio)organic transformations.







Abstract
Known since the 1890s, diamidophosphate (DAP) has been investigated within the context of its inorganic chemistry. In 1999 &#8211; with the demonstration of DAP's potential as a&#8197;phosphorylating agent of sugars in aqueous medium &#8211; began the exciting phase of research about DAP's role as a&#8197;plausible prebiotic phosphorylating agent. More recently, in the last five years, there has been a steady increase in the publications that have documented the surprising versatility of DAP enabling the emergence of many classes of biomolecules of life, such as nucleic acids, peptides and protocells. Thus, though in its infancy, DAP seems to be uniquely positioned to play a central role in modelling abiotic&#8208; to prebiotic&#8208;chemical evolution. In this context, there is a need for systematic investigations for: (a)&#8197;establishing DAP's likely availability on the early Earth, and (b)&#8197;developing DAP's potential as a tool for use in synthetic and bioorganic chemistry.

Azaphilones are a polyketide&#8208;based family of fungal natural products with a highly oxygenated bicyclic pyrone&#8208;quinone structure, many of which have useful and interesting bioactivities. This minireview reveals the common steps in azaphilone biosynthetic pathways to aid the use of genome mining to identify orphan azaphilone biosynthetic gene clusters.







Abstract
Azaphilones are a family of polyketide&#8208;based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This minireview explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome&#8208;mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.

Functional protein nanotechnology: We have combined in&#8208;house developed micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology with N&#8208;terminal protein bioconjugation to synthesize diverse protein nanoparticles with advanced functions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric protease to form a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex &#8220;proteasome&#8221; enables targeted protein degradation in living cells. Naturally occurring proteasomes serve as an inspiration and blueprint for the design of artificial protein&#8208;based nanoreactors. Here we disclose a general chemical strategy for the design of proteasome&#8208;like nanoreactors. Micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology along with the N&#8208;terminal bioconjugation strategy is utilized for the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined monodisperse self&#8208;assembling semi&#8208;synthetic protease. The designed protein is programmed to self&#8208;assemble into a proteasome&#8208;like nanostructure which preserves the functional properties of native protease.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly of a monomeric protease to form a multi-subunit protein complex &#8220;proteasome&#8221; enables targeted protein degradation in living cells. Naturally occurring proteasomes serve as an inspiration and blueprint for the design of artificial protein-based nanoreactors. Here we disclose a general chemical strategy for the design of proteasome-like nanoreactors. Micelle-assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology along with the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal bioconjugation strategy is utilized for the synthesis of a well-defined monodisperse self-assembling semi-synthetic protease. The designed protein is programmed to self-assemble into a proteasome-like nanostructure which preserves the functional properties of native protease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>

This communication advances the recently developed &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;(Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe)&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for fluorescent labeling of JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV) pentamers. We show a concise (two steps) synthesis of a small molecule &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive probe that is easily tunable for a broad set of fluorescent reporters, solubility, and fluorophore distance from the modification site. With this probe we demonstrate labeling in a structured loop region of a protein and visualize cellular entry of JCPyV viral particles.







Abstract
The major capsid protein VP1 of JC Polyomavirus assembles into pentamers that serve as a model for studying viral entry of this potentially severe human pathogen. Previously, labeling of viral proteins utilized large fusion proteins or non&#8208;specific amine&#8208; or cysteine&#8208;functionalization with fluorescent dyes. Imaging of these sterically hindered fusion proteins or heterogeneously labeled virions limits reproducibility and could prevent the detection of subtle trafficking phenomena. Here we advance the &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for site&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of VP1&#8208;pentamers. We demonstrate a one&#8208;step synthesis of a probe consisting of a bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry handle bridged to a perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive electrophile by a polyethylene glycol linker. We expand the scope of the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation by demonstrating selective labeling of an internal, surface exposed loop in VP1. Thus, the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation offers a general method to selectively bioconjugate tags&#8208;of&#8208;interest to viral proteins without impeding their ability to bind and enter cells.

         <title>Structures of the Human SPAK and OSR1 Conserved C&#8208;Terminal (CCT) Domains</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>STE20/SPS1&#8208;related proline/alanine&#8208;rich kinase (SPAK) and Oxidative Stress Responsive 1 (OSR1) kinase are two serine/threonine protein kinases that regulate the function of ion co&#8208;transporters through phosphorylation. The highly conserved&#160;  C  &#8208;terminal (CCT) domains of SPAK and OSR1 bind to RFx[V/I] peptide sequences from their upstream With No Lysine Kinases (WNKs), facilitating their activation via phosphorylation. Thus, the inhibition of SPAK and OSR1 binding, via their CCT domains, to WNK kinases is a plausible strategy for inhibiting SPAK and OSR1 kinases. To facilitate structure&#8208;guided drug design of such inhibitors, we expressed and purified human SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains and solved their crystal structures. Interestingly, these crystal structures show a highly conserved primary pocket adjacent to a flexible secondary pocket. We also employed a biophysical strategy and determined the affinity of SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains to short peptides derived from WNK4 and NKCC1. Together, this work provides a platform that facilitates the design of CCT domain specific small molecule binders that inhibit SPAK&#8208; and OSR1&#8208;activation by WNK kinases, and these could be useful in treating hypertension and ischemic stroke.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct enzymatic synthesis of fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatty amines represent an important class of commodity chemicals which have broad applicability in different industries. The synthesis of fatty amines starts from renewable sources such as vegetable oils or animal fats, but the process has multiple drawbacks that compromise the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the synthesis. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biocatalytic alternative towards the synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils. By coupling a lipase with a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA), we have accomplished the direct synthesis of multiple medium and long chain primary fatty amines in one pot with analytical yields as high as 97%. We have also performed a 75 mL preparative scale reaction for the synthesis of laurylamine from trilaurin, obtaining 73% isolated yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;up sugars: Glycosyltransferase cross&#8208;reactivity in cancerous tissues and their therapeutic targeting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main categories of glycan changes in cancer are: (1) decreased expression of histo&#8208;blood group A and/or B antigens and increased Lewis&#8208;related antigens, (2) appearance of cryptic antigens, such as Tn and T, (3) emergence of genetically incompatible glycans, such as A antigen expressed in tumors of individuals of group B or O and heterophilic expression of Forssman antigen (FORS1), and (4) appearance of neoglycans. This review focuses on the expression of genetically incompatible A/B/FORS1 antigens in cancer. Several possible molecular mechanisms are exemplified, including missense mutations that alter the sugar specificity of A and B glycosyltransferases (AT and BT, respectively), restoration of the correct codon reading frame of O alleles, and modification of acceptor specificity of AT to synthesize the FORS1 antigen by missense mutations and/or altered splicing. Taking advantage of pre&#8208;existing natural immunity, the potential uses of these glycans for immunotherapeutic targeting will also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial interactions within amyloid protein corona based on 2D MoS2 nanosheets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interfacial interaction within the amyloid protein corona based on MoS  2  &#160;nanomaterial is crucial, both for understanding the biological effects of MoS  2  &#160;nanomaterial and the evolution of amyloid diseases. The specific nano&#8208;bio interface phenomenon of human islet amyloid peptide (hIAPP) and MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet was investigated by using theoretical&#160;and experimental methods. The MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet enables to attract the hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer on its surface through the van der Waals force between them. Especially, the interaction way between two hIAPP peptides might be changed by the MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet. In addition, it is interesting to find that the hIAPP oligomer can stably interact with the MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet in one unique &#8220;standing&#8221; binding mode with an entire exposed &#946;&#8208;sheet surface. All the interaction modes on the surface of MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet can be the essence of amyloid protein corona that may provide the venues to facilitate the fibrillation of hIAPP proteins. Further, it was verified experimentally that MoS  2  &#160;nanosheets could accelerate the fibrillation of hIAPP at a certain concentration mainly based on the newly formed nano&#8208;bio interface.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The interfacial interaction within the amyloid protein corona based on MoS  2  &#160;nanomaterial is crucial, both for understanding the biological effects of MoS  2  &#160;nanomaterial and the evolution of amyloid diseases. The specific nano-bio interface phenomenon of human islet amyloid peptide (hIAPP) and MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet was investigated by using theoretical&#160;and experimental methods. The MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet enables to attract the hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer on its surface through the van der Waals force between them. Especially, the interaction way between two hIAPP peptides might be changed by the MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet. In addition, it is interesting to find that the hIAPP oligomer can stably interact with the MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet in one unique &#8220;standing&#8221; binding mode with an entire exposed &#946;-sheet surface. All the interaction modes on the surface of MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet can be the essence of amyloid protein corona that may provide the venues to facilitate the fibrillation of hIAPP proteins. Further, it was verified experimentally that MoS  2  &#160;nanosheets could accelerate the fibrillation of hIAPP at a certain concentration mainly based on the newly formed nano-bio interface. In general, our results provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of the nano-bio interface within the amyloid protein corona,&#160;and further, it shed light on the pathway of amyloid protein aggregation that is related to the evolution of amyloid diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of two novel oxidases using a high&#8208;throughput activity screen</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of novel enzymes is a challenging task, yet a crucial one, due to their increasing relevance as chemical catalysts and biotechnological tools. In our work we present a high&#8208;throughput screening approach to discovering novel activities. A screen of 96 putative oxidases with 23 substrates led to the discovery of two new enzymes. The first enzyme, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;hexosamine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.29) from  Ralstonia solanacearum,  is a vanillyl alcohol oxidase&#8208;like flavoprotein displaying the highest activity with N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. Before our discovery of the enzyme, its activity was an orphan one &#8208; experimentally characterized but lacking the link to amino acid sequence. The second enzyme, from an uncultured marine euryarchaeota, is a long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase (LCAO, EC 1.1.3.20) active with a range of fatty alcohols, with 1&#8208;dodecanol being the preferred substrate. The enzyme displays no sequence similarity to previously characterised LCAOs, and thus is a completely novel representative of a protein with such activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress on the Physiological Function of Mitochondrial DNA and Its Specific Detection and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and status quo of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) imaging and detection are highlighted in this minireview, and insights for designing excellent mtDNA probes are provided. New treatments for mtDNA&#8208;related diseases are also discussed.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the genetic information of mitochondrion, and its structure is circular double&#8208;stranded. Despite the diminutive size of the mitochondrial genome, mtDNA mutations are an important cause of mitochondrial diseases which are characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial diseases are involved in multiple systems, particularly in the organs that are highly dependent on aerobic metabolism. The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is more complicated since mtDNA mutations can cause various clinical symptoms. To realize more accurate diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial diseases, the detection of mtDNA and the design of drugs acting on it are extremely important. Over the past few years, many probes and therapeutic drugs targeting mtDNA have been developed, making significant contributions to fundamental research including elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases at the genetic level. In this review, we summarize the structure, function, and detection approaches for mtDNA. The most current topics in this field, such as mechanistic exploration and treatment of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related disorders, are also reviewed. Specific attention is given to discussing the design and development of these probes and drugs for mtDNA. We hope that this review will provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the importance of mtDNA, and promote the development of effective molecules for theragnosis of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Design of a Full&#8208;Consensus Glutamate Decarboxylase and Its Application to GABA Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;based protein design has the potential to generate highly functional enzymes. A full consensus glutamate decarboxylase, FcGAD, has high thermal stability and catalytic rate, which can be used in the synthesis of gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA). Utilizing E. coli which express FcGAD as biocatalyst, we achieved the synthesis of GABA at gram scale in a one&#8208;pot reaction.







Abstract
Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyses the decarboxylation of L&#8208;glutamate to gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA). Improvement of the enzymatic properties of GAD is important for the low&#8208;cost synthesis of GABA. In this study, utilizing sequences of enzymes homologous with GAD from lactic acid bacteria, highly mutated GADs were designed using sequence&#8208;based protein design methods. Two mutated GADs, FcGAD and AncGAD, generated by full&#8208;consensus design and ancestral sequence reconstruction, had more desirable properties than native GADs. With respect to thermal stability, the half&#8208;life of the designed GADs was about 10&#8201;&#176;C higher than that of native GAD. The productivity of FcGAD was considerably higher than those of known GADs; more than 250&#8197;mg/L of purified enzyme could be produced in the E. coli expression system. In a production test using 26.4&#8197;g of l&#8208;glutamate and 3.0&#8197;g of resting cells, 17.2&#8197;g of GABA could be prepared within one hour, without purification, in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.

         <title>The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted supramolecular recognition? CD spectroscopy of Yariv reagent dyes identifies a correlation between positive couplets in CD spectra, indicative of helical chirality, and the ability of the dyes to bind arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs).







Abstract
Yariv reagents are glycosylated triphenylazo dyes that bind to arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), proteoglycans found in plant cell walls that are integral for plant growth and development. Yariv reagents are widely utilized as imaging, purification, and quantification tools for AGPs and represent the only small molecule probe for interrogating AGP function. The ability of Yariv reagents to bind to AGPs is dependent on the structure of the terminal glycoside on the dye. The reason for this selectivity has not been understood until the present work. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the Yariv reagents form supramolecular aggregates with helical chirality. More significantly, the ability of the Yariv reagent to bind AGPs is correlated with this helical chirality. This finding paves the way towards developing a more detailed understanding of the nature of the Yariv&#8208;AGP complex, and the design of AGP&#8208;binding reagents with higher affinities and selectivities.

         <title>Scalable and selective &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid synthesis catalyzed by promiscuous L&#8208;threonine transaldolase ObiH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways possess broad potential for the selective synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. However, the practical application of these enzymes for organic synthesis is dependent on the development of efficient, economical, operationally&#8208;simple and well&#8208;characterized systems for preparative scale reactions. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap for the selective biocatalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, which are important synthetic building blocks. To achieve this goal, we demonstrated the ability of ObiH, an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase, to achieve selective milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of a diverse array of non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs) using a scalable whole cell platform. We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids possessing broad functional&#8208;group diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ObiH&#8208;generated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids could be modified through additional transformations to access important motifs, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and substituted &#945;&#8208;keto acids.</dc:description>

We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re-entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH-catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids possessing broad functional-group diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ObiH-generated &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids could be modified through additional transformations to access important motifs, such as &#946;-chloro-&#945;-amino acids and substituted &#945;-keto acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Creation of an engineered amide synthetase biocatalyst by the rational separation of a two&#8208;step nitrile synthetase.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly&#8208;used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitriles synthetases (NSs) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The B. subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is a NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly&#8208;conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Head Comparison of Selected Extra&#8208; and Intracellular CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules on Their CO&#8208;Releasing and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beneficial anti&#8208;inflammatory effects of carbon monoxide were studied using differently triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs). In particular, some acyloxy&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes acting as enzyme&#8208;triggered CORMs showed pronounced cellular effects regardless of whether CO release was intra&#8208; or extracellular.







Abstract
Over the past decade, a variety of carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed and tested. Some CORMs spontaneously release CO once in solution, while others require a trigger mechanism to release the bound CO from its molecular complex. The modulation of biological systems by CORMs depends largely on the spatiotemporal release of CO, which likely differs among the different types of CORMs. In spontaneously releasing CORMs, CO is released extracellularly and crosses the cell membrane to interact with intracellular targets. Other CORMs can directly release CO intracellularly, which may be a more efficient method to modulate biological systems. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of extracellular and intracellular CO&#8208;releasing CORMs that either release CO spontaneously or require an enzymatic trigger. The efficacy of such CORMs to modulate HO&#8208;1 and VCAM&#8208;1 expression in TNF&#8208;&#945;&#8208;stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was evaluated.

         <title>Orthogonal Peptide&#8208;Templated Labeling Elucidates Lateral ETAR/ETBR Proximity and Reveals Altered Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GPCR&#8208;GPCR interactions can influence signaling events but are difficult to investigate in live cell setups. Here, we report on an orthogonal labeling approach, which excludes intracellular background signals and allows the installment of different dyes. Using this technique, the interaction of homo&#8208;receptors demonstrated for different GPCRs, but hetero&#8208;interaction was limited to ETAR/ETBR. For the latter, impaired ETBR signaling was shown.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that lateral GPCR interactions in the cell membrane can impact signaling profiles. Here, we report on a one&#8208;step labeling method of multiple membrane&#8208;embedded GPCRs. Based on short peptide tags, complementary probes transfer the cargo (e.&#8201;g. a fluorescent dye) by an acyl transfer reaction with high spatial and temporal resolution within 5&#8197;min. We applied this approach to four receptors of the cardiovascular system: the endothelin receptor A and B (ETAR and ETBR), angiotensin II receptor type 1, and apelin. Wild type&#8208;like G protein activation after N&#8208;terminal modification was demonstrated for all receptor species. Using FRET&#8208;competent dyes, a constitutive proximity between hetero&#8208;receptors was limited to ETAR/ETBR. Further, we demonstrate, that ETAR expression regulates the signaling of co&#8208;expressed ETBR. Our orthogonal peptide&#8208;templated labeling of different GPCRs provides novel insight into the regulation of GPCR signaling.

         <title>Novel Antibacterial Targets in Protein Biogenesis Pathways</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial protein biogenesis pathways are attractive antibacterial targets since many of them, or their substrates, are essential for bacterial survival. We review the various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis that show promise as potential antibacterial targets. This information will facilitate rational antibiotic design to help combat antibacterial resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat due to the ability of bacteria to quickly evolve in response to the selection pressure induced by anti&#8208;infective drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against resistant bacteria. In this review, we discuss pathways involving bacterial protein biogenesis as attractive antibacterial targets since many of them are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. We discuss the structural understanding of various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis, which in turn can be utilized for rational antibiotic design. We highlight efforts made towards developing inhibitors of these pathways with insights into future possibilities and challenges. We also briefly discuss other potential targets related to protein biogenesis.

         <title>Varying the Directionality of Protein Catalysts for Aldol and Retro&#8208;aldol Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural aldolase enzymes and created retro&#8208;aldolase protein catalysts often catalyze both aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions depending on the concentrations of the reactants and the products. Here, we report that the directionality of protein catalysts can be altered by replacing one amino acid. The protein catalyst derived from a scaffold of a previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst catalyzed aldol reactions more efficiently than the previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst. The retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst efficiently catalyzed the retro&#8208;aldol reaction but was less efficient in catalyzing the aldol reaction. The results indicated that protein catalysts with varying levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions can be generated from the same protein scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Removable Photocaging Groups Accepted by MjMAT Variant: Structural Basis and Compatibility with DNA and RNA Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MAT (methionine adenosyltransferase) exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red&#8208;shifted ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl (ONB)&#8208;derivatives and is compatible with methyltransferases from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. This enables photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light. The crystal structure reveals details about substrate accommodation.







Abstract
Methylation and demethylation of DNA, RNA and proteins constitutes a major regulatory mechanism in epigenetic processes. Investigations would benefit from the ability to install photo&#8208;cleavable groups at methyltransferase target sites that block interactions with reader proteins until removed by non&#8208;damaging light in the visible spectrum. Engineered methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) have been exploited in cascade reactions with methyltransferases (MTases) to modify biomolecules with non&#8208;natural groups, including first evidence for accepting photo&#8208;cleavable groups. We show that an engineered MAT from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (PC&#8208;MjMAT) is 308&#8208;fold more efficient at converting ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;(ONB)&#8208;homocysteine than the wildtype enzyme. PC&#8208;MjMAT is active over a broad range of temperatures and compatible with MTases from mesophilic organisms. We solved the crystal structures of wildtype and PC&#8208;MjMAT in complex with AdoONB and a red&#8208;shifted derivative thereof. These structures reveal that aromatic stacking interactions within the ligands are key to accommodating the photocaging groups in PC&#8208;MjMAT. The enlargement of the binding pocket eliminates steric clashes to enable AdoMet analogue binding. Importantly, PC&#8208;MjMAT exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red&#8208;shifted ONB&#8208;derivatives enabling photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light.

         <title>Photoactivation of Innate Immunity Receptor TLR8 in Live Mammalian Cells by Genetic Encoding of Photocaged Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic balance between the resting and active states of the immune response is essential for the host defense against invasion. Photocontrol of the innate immunity receptor TLR8 achieved precise regulation and dynamics programming. By genetic encoding of unnatural, photocaged tyrosine into TLR8, the receptor can be regulated by UV light with high spatiotemporal resolution, making it a suitable tool for TLR8 biological studies. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Yin et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>Intracellular pH plays a significantly important role in many biological and pathological processes. The small molecule&#8208;based pH probes are found to be the most effective for pH sensing because of ease of preparation, high sensitivity, and quick response. They have many advantages such as small perturbation to the functions of the target, functional adaptability, cellular component&#8208;specific localization, etc. The present review highlights the flurry of recent activity in the field of development of such probes.. The probes are segregated based on the type of fluorophore used like quinoline, coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, indolium, naphthalimide, etc., and their analytical performance is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Hydrogen Peroxide Responsive Organoborons for Biological and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elevated H2O2 has been observed under various disease conditions. Due to the chemoselective reaction between boron functional groups and H2O2, numerous deactivated organoborons have been developed for H2O2&#8208;mediated activation to form an active hydroxyl product. These include H2O2 bioimaging probes and H2O2&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;prochelators, prodrugs, and theranostic agents.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable reactive oxygen species generated endogenously, participating in numerous physiological processes and abnormal pathological conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that a higher level of H2O2 exists in various disease conditions. Thus, H2O2 functions as an ideal target for site&#8208;specific bioimaging and therapeutic targeting. The unique reactivity of organoborons with H2O2 provides a method for developing chemoselective molecules for biological and biomedical applications. This review highlights the design and application of boron&#8208;derived molecules for H2O2 detection, and the utility of boron moieties toward masking reactive compounds leading to the development of metal prochelators and prodrugs for selectively delivering an active species at the target sites with elevated H2O2 levels. Additionally, the emergence of H2O2&#8208;responsive theranostic agents consisting of both therapeutic and diagnostic moieties in one integrated system are discussed. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of the role of boron&#8208;derived molecules toward biological and pharmacological applications.

Diselenide&#8208;based S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic: This study demonstrates the potential of 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine conjugated with Pro&#8208;His dipeptide as a novel S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic, which catalytically promotes cysteinyl S&#8208;denitrosylation in the presence of a thiol co&#8208;substrate and prevents protein misfolding caused by S&#8208;nitrosylation. The cover image shows how the catalytic cycle involved a highly reactive diselenol species forming a &#947;&#8208;turn structure, and highlights the mystique of the reaction controlled by Selene, goddess of the moon and origin of the name for the element, selenium.

         <title>Defluorination Capability of l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid Dehalogenases in the HAD&#8208;Like Hydrolase Superfamily Correlates with Active Site Compactness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
You have to come close if you want a reaction: Several members of the haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like hydrolases superfamily were found to break carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds. The only features that differentiate between them and other family members unable to achieve this feat were small changes in distance between selected active site residues and protein dynamics leading to tighter interactions between protein and halogen.







Abstract
l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid dehalogenases, industrially and environmentally important enzymes that catalyse cleavage of the carbon&#8208;halogen bond in S&#8208;2&#8208;halocarboxylic acids, were known to hydrolyse chlorinated, brominated and iodinated substrates but no activity towards fluorinated compounds had been reported. A screen for novel dehalogenase activities revealed four l&#8208;2&#8208;haloacid dehalogenases capable of defluorination. We now report crystal structures for two of these enzymes, Bpro0530 and Rha0230, as well as for the related proteins PA0810 and RSc1362, which hydrolyse chloroacetate but not fluoroacetate, all at &#8764;2.2&#8197;&#197; resolution. Overall structure and active sites of these enzymes are highly similar. In molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, only the defluorinating enzymes sample more compact conformations, which in turn allow more effective interactions with the small fluorine atom. Structural constraints, based on X&#8208;ray structures and MD calculations, correctly predict the defluorination activity of the homologous enzyme ST2570.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotide Modified with Disulfide Units Induces Efficient Exon Skipping in mdx Myotubes through Enhanced Membrane Permeability and Nucleus Internalization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced cellular uptake was achieved using a disulfide&#8208;unit&#8208;containing membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotide (MPON). Long&#8208;term incubation enabled their nuclear internalization and subsequent exon skipping.







Abstract
We have found that antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA molecules modified with repeat structures of disulfide units can be directly introduced into the cytoplasm and exhibit a suppressive effect on gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of cellular uptake of these membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotides (MPONs). Time&#8208;course analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the uptake of MPONs from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm reached 50&#8201;% of the total uptake in about 5&#8197;min. In addition, analysis of the plasma membrane proteins to which MPONs bind, identified several proteins, including voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel. Next, we analyzed the behavior of MPONs in the cell and found them to be abundant in the nucleus as early as 24&#8197;h after addition with the amount increasing further after 48 and 72&#8197;h. The amount of MPONs was 2.5&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified oligonucleotides in the nucleus after 72&#8197;h. We also designed antisense oligonucleotides and evaluated the effect of MPONs on mRNA exon skipping using DMD model cells; MPONs caused exon skipping with 69&#8201;% efficiency after 72&#8197;h, which was three times higher than the rate of the control. In summary, the high capacity for intracytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of MPONs is expected to be useful for therapeutic strategies targeting exon skipping.

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Fluorination as Modification for Peptide&#8208;Based Fusion Inhibitors against HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated variants of an HIV entry inhibitor inspired by clinically applied T20 were systematically studied. The results reveal six&#8208;helix bundle formation for the fluorine&#8208;containing sequences in the presence of wildtype N&#8208;terminal heptad repeat peptide of gp41. X&#8208;ray crystal structures confirm favorable packing of the fluorinated groups and in&#8197;vitro infection experiments with CEMx174 SEAP cells reveal nanomolar inhibition.







Abstract
With the emergence of novel viruses, the development of new antivirals is more urgent than ever. A key step in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) infection is six&#8208;helix bundle formation within the envelope protein subunit gp41. Selective disruption of bundle formation by peptides has been shown to be effective; however, these drugs, exemplified by T20, are prone to rapid clearance from the patient. The incorporation of non&#8208;natural amino acids is known to improve these pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we evaluate a peptide inhibitor in which a critical Ile residue is replaced by fluorinated analogues. We characterized the influence of the fluorinated analogues on the biophysical properties of the peptide. Furthermore, we show that the fluorinated peptides can block HIV&#8208;1 infection of target cells at nanomolar levels. These findings demonstrate that fluorinated amino acids are appropriate tools for the development of novel peptide therapeutics.

         <title>The Inhibition Effect of Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking between Probes in Photo&#8208;Induced Double Duplex Invasion DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced double duplex invasion (pDDI) was enabled by ultrafast DNA photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK) and photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitor, 5&#8208;cyanouracil(CNU). In this study, we evaluated the effect on pDDI efficiency using spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS), which are considered to have photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability, similar to CNU. As a result, CNU had the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were found to be not very different.







Abstract
Double duplex invasion (DDI) DNA is a useful antigene method that inhibits expression of genomic DNA. We succeeded in performing photoinduced&#8208;DDI (pDDI) using ultrafast photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking. 5&#8208;Cyanouracil (CNU) has been used in pDDI to inhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking between probes, but its importance has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS) that exhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability similar to that of CNU. CNU exhibited the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were not very different. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect was better with S and dS than with thymidine (T). Conversely, the thermal stability was significantly lower with S and dS than with T. The results suggest that the pDDI efficiency is determined by the balance between the photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and the thermal stability, which is the introduction efficiency for double&#8208;stranded DNA. Therefore, CNU, which has a photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and a high Tm value, showed the highest inhibitory efficiency.

         <title>Target&#8208;Mediated 5&#8217;&#8208;Exonuclease Digestion of DNA Aptamers with RecJ to Modulate Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protect and detect: a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 5&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ followed by introduction of a circular template and phi29 DNA polymerase to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing low picomolar detection limits for a protein (thrombin) and a small molecule (OTA) target.

We report a new method for biosensing based on the target&#8208;mediated resistance of DNA aptamers against 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion, allowing them to act as primers for rolling circle amplification (RCA). A target&#8208;bound DNA strand containing an aptamer region on the 5&#8217;&#8208;end and a primer region on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end is protected from 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ exonuclease in a target&#8208;dependent manner. As the protected aptamer is at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end, the exposed primer on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template to generate a turn&#8208;on sensor. Without target, RecJ digests the primer and prevents RCA from occurring, allowing quantitative fluorescence detection of both thrombin, a protein, and ochratoxin A (OTA), a small molecule, at picomolar concentrations.

         <title>Controlling Enzymatic Activity by Modulating the Oligomerization State via Chemical Rescue and Optical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous control of the association state of enzyme complexes can be used to switch activity. A cation&#8208;&#960; bond in the oligomerization interface was disrupted either by a Lys&#8208;to&#8208;Cys mutation or by incorporation of an unnatural amino acid (UAA), resulting in complex disassembly and loss of activity. For switching activity on again, Lys was chemically rescued or the UAA was decaged by light. The complex was reformed and the activity was fully restored.







Abstract
Selective switching of enzymatic activity has been a longstanding goal in synthetic biology. Drastic changes in activity upon mutational manipulation of the oligomerization state of enzymes have frequently been reported in the literature, but scarcely exploited for switching. Using geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase as a model, we demonstrate that catalytic activity can be efficiently controlled by exogenous modulation of the association state. We introduced a lysine&#8208;to&#8208;cysteine mutation, leading to the breakdown of the active hexamer into dimers with impaired catalytic efficiency. Addition of bromoethylamine chemically rescued the enzyme by restoring hexamerization and activity. As an alternative method, we incorporated the photosensitive unnatural amino acid o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;O&#8208;tyrosine (ONBY) into the hexamerization interface. This again led to inactive dimers, but the hexameric state and activity could be recovered by UV&#8208;light induced cleavage of ONBY. For both approaches, we obtained switching factors greater than 350&#8208;fold, which compares favorably with previously reported activity changes that were caused by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

         <title>Engineering of a plant isoprenyl diphosphate synthase for development of irregular coupling activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We performed mutagenesis on a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (IDS), neryl diphosphate synthase from Solanum lycopersicum (SlNPPS), that has a structurally related analogue performing non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling of two dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) units, lavandulyl diphosphate synthase from Lavandula x intermedia (LiLPPS). Wild&#8208;type SlNPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in cis&#8208;orientation resulting in the formation of neryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able to catalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregular monoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis of their dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The second compound is the trans&#8208;isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregular cyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregular activity of SlNPPS constitutes 0.4% of its regular activity and is revealed only if the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in absence of IPP. The exchange of asparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling. While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutant reaches 13.1 % of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regular IDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at the development of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.</dc:description>

         <title>HaloTag Engineering for Enhanced Fluorogenicity and Kinetics with a Styrylpyridium Dye</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein engineering techniques were implemented to improve the fluorogenicity and kinetics of an accessible dye&#8208;HaloTag construct. The engineered protein showed dramatically improved fluorescent properties with purified HaloTag and enabled live&#8208;cell imaging in mammalian cells.







Abstract
HaloTag is a small self&#8208;labeling protein that is frequently used for creating fluorescent reporters in living cells. The small&#8208;molecule dyes used with HaloTag are almost exclusively based on rhodamine scaffolds, which are often expensive and challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report the engineering of HaloTag for use with a chemically accessible, inexpensive fluorophore based on the dimethylamino&#8208;styrylpyridium dye. Through directed evolution, the maximum fluorogenicity and the apparent second&#8208;order bioconjugation rate constants could be improved up to 4&#8208;fold and 42&#8208;fold, respectively. One of the top variants, HT&#8208;SP5, enabled reliable imaging in mammalian cells, with a 113&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement over the parent protein. Additionally, crystallographic characterization of selected mutants suggests the chemical origin of the fluorescent enhancement. The improved dye system offers a valuable tool for imaging and illustrates the viability of engineering self&#8208;labeling proteins for alternative fluorophores.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Phage&#8208;Displayed Helix&#8208;Loop&#8208;Helix Peptides to Construct Kinase&#8208;Focused Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptide libraries: A phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptide library was chemically modified with adenosine as an anchor molecule for binding to the ATP binding site of protein kinase. This approach to the construction of target&#8208;focused HLH peptide libraries would enable the efficient generation of selective inhibitors not only for protein kinases, but also for other proteins of interest.







Abstract
Conformationally constrained peptides hold promise as molecular tools in chemical biology and as a new modality in drug discovery. The construction and screening of a target&#8208;focused library could be a promising approach for the generation of de novo ligands or inhibitors against target proteins. Here, we have prepared a protein kinase&#8208;focused library by chemically modifying helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptides displayed on phage and subsequently tethered to adenosine. The library was screened against aurora kinase A (AurA). The selected HLH peptide Bip&#8208;3 retained the &#945;&#8208;helical structure and bound to AurA with a KD value of 13.7&#8197;&#956;M. Bip&#8208;3 and the adenosine&#8208;tethered peptide Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc provided IC50 values of 103&#8197;&#956;M and 7.7&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, suggesting that Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc bivalently inhibited AurA. In addition, the selectivity of Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc to several protein kinases was tested, and was highest against AurA. These results demonstrate that chemical modification can enable the construction of a kinase&#8208;focused library of phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptides.

         <title>Harnessing P450 Enzyme for Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attention in synthetic biology and biotechnology. To leverage their catalytic efficiency, different strategies have been developed including substrate engineering, allosteric effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, one&#8208;pot multienzyme reactions (OPME), and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization. These research efforts also have important implications for the study of other enzymes and many fields of application. More information can be found in the Minireview by L. Zhang and Q. Wang.

         <title>Visual Detection of Adenosine Triphosphate by Taylor Rising: A Simple Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Method Based on Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid run! A new point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing method for adenosine triphosphate detection was developed based on Taylor rising. This approach is quite general, includes naked eye quantification and does not require cumbersome equipment.







Abstract
Rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) is an extremely critical mission in practical applications, especially for rigorous military medicine, home health care, and in the third world. Here, we report a visual POCT method for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection based on Taylor rising in the corner of quadratic geometries between two rod surfaces. We discuss the principle of Taylor rising, demonstrating that it is significantly influenced by contact angle, surface tension, and density of the sample, which are controlled by ATP&#8208;dependent rolling circle amplification (RCA). In the presence of ATP, RCA reaction effectively suppresses Taylor&#8208;rising behavior, due to the increased contact angle, density, and decreased surface tension. Without addition of ATP, untriggered RCA reaction is favorable for Taylor rising, resulting in a significant height. With this proposed method, visual sensitive detection of ATP without the aid of other instruments is realized with only a 5 &#956;L droplet, which has good selectivity and a low detection limit (17&#8197;nM). Importantly, this visual method provides a promising POCT tool for user&#8208;friendly molecular diagnostics.

         <title>Chemical Biology Toolbox to Visualize Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical biology methods to visualize protein aggregation in live cells are presented in this review. The methods discussed include fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small molecule probes.







Abstract
Protein misfolding and aggregation is a complex biochemical process and has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. Developing novel chemical and biological tools and approaches to visualize aggregated proteins in live cells is in high demand for mechanistic studies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the recent developments in the chemical biology toolbox applied to protein aggregation studies in live cells. These methods exploited fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small&#8208;molecule probes to visualize the protein&#8208;aggregation process, detect proteome stresses, and quantify the protein homeostasis network capacity. Inspired by these seminal works, we have generalized design principles for the development of new detection methods and probes in the future that will illuminate this important biological process.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a Stable Isostere of Malonyllysine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine malonylation is a recently characterized posttranslational modification involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and gene expression. One unique feature of this posttranslational modification is its potential susceptibility to decarboxylation, which poses possible challenges to its study. As a step towards addressing these challenges, here we report the synthesis and evaluation of a stable isostere of malonyllysine. First, we find that synthetic substitution of the malonyl group with a tetrazole isostere results in amino acids resistant to thermal decarboxylation. Next, we demonstrate that protected variants of this amino acid are readily incorporated into peptides. Finally, we show that tetrazole isosteres of malonyllysine can be recognized by anti&#8208;malonyllysine antibodies and histone deacylases, validating their ability to mimic features of the endogenous lysine modification. Overall, this study establishes a new chemical strategy for stably mimicking a metabolite&#8208;derived posttranslational modification, providing a foothold for tool development and functional analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Weak Binding and Spectroscopic Signature of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 Interaction with RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of nsp14 protein with nascent RNA for the removal of mismatched nucleotide from the newly synthesized RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is reported.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 non&#8208;structural protein 14 (nsp14), known as exoribonuclease is encoded from the large polyprotein of viral genome and is a major constituent of the transcription replication complex (TRC) machinery of the viral RNA synthesis. This protein is highly conserved among the coronaviruses and is a potential target for the development of a therapeutic drug. Here, we report the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 expression, show its structural characterization, and ss&#8208;RNA exonuclease activity through vibrational and electronic spectroscopies. The deconvolution of amide&#8208;I band in the FTIR spectrum of the protein revealed a composition of 35&#8201;% &#945;&#8208;helix and 25&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;sheets.

     alt="On the Weak Binding and Spectroscopic Signature of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 Interaction with RNA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The interaction of nsp14 protein&lt;/b&gt; with nascent RNA for the removal of mismatched nucleotide from the newly synthesized RNA of SARS-CoV-2 is reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), known as exoribonuclease is encoded from the large polyprotein of viral genome and is a major constituent of the transcription replication complex (TRC) machinery of the viral RNA synthesis. This protein is highly conserved among the coronaviruses and is a potential target for the development of a therapeutic drug. Here, we report the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 expression, show its structural characterization, and ss-RNA exonuclease activity through vibrational and electronic spectroscopies. The deconvolution of amide-I band in the FTIR spectrum of the protein revealed a composition of 35&#8201;% &#945;-helix and 25&#8201;% &#946;-sheets. The binding between protein and RNA is evidenced from the spectral changes in the amide-I region of the nsp14, showing protein conformational changes during the binding process. A value of 20.60&#177;3.81&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of the binding constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) is obtained for nsp14/RNA complex. The findings reported here can motivate further studies to develop structural models for better understanding the mechanism of exonuclease enzymes for correcting the viral genome and can help in the development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Studies Provide New Insights into the Role of Lysine Acetylation on Substrate Recognition by CARM1 and Inform the Design of Potent Peptidomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidomimetics based on the histone H3 tail peptide were used in co&#8208;crystallization studies with coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) to investigate the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. These findings also provide new insights into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation and the development of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of CARM1.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin provides a communication system for the regulation of gene expression. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role that such crosstalk between PTMs plays in chromatin recognition. In this study, (bio)chemical and structural approaches were applied to specifically probe the impact of acetylation of Lys18 in the histone H3 tail peptide on peptide recognition by the protein methyltransferase coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). Peptidomimetics that recapitulate the transition state of protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferases, were designed based on the H3 peptide wherein the target Arg17 was flanked by either a free or an acetylated lysine. Structural studies with these peptidomimetics and the catalytic domain of CARM1 provide new insights into the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. While the co&#8208;crystal structures reveal that lysine acetylation results in minor conformational differences for both CARM1 and the H3 peptide, acetylation of Lys18 does lead to additional interactions (Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) and likely reduces the cost of desolvation upon binding, resulting in increased affinity. Informed by these findings a series of smaller peptidomimetics were also prepared and found to maintain potent and selective CARM1 inhibition. These findings provide new insights both into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation as well as towards the development of peptidomimetic CARM1 inhibitors.

         <title>Harnessing Fluorescent Moenomycin A Antibiotics for Bacterial Cell Wall Imaging Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moenomycin A (MoeA)&#8208;based fluorescent probes were developed for imaging the bacterial cell wall through specific labeling of transglycosylases. The strategy provided stunning imaging probes for mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains.







Abstract
The imaging of peptidoglycan (PGN) dynamics in living bacteria facilitates the understanding of PGN biosynthesis and wall&#8208;targeting antibiotics. The main tools for imaging bacterial PGN are fluorescent probes, such as the well&#8208;known PGN metabolic labeling probes. However, fluorescent small&#8208;molecule probes for labeling key PGN&#8208;synthesizing enzymes, especially for transglycosylases (TGases), remain to be explored. In this work, the first imaging probe for labeling TGase in bacterial cell wall studies is reported. We synthesized various fluorescent MoeA&#8208;based molecules by derivatizing the natural antibiotic moenomycin A (MoeA), and used them to label TGases in living bacteria, monitor bacterial growth and division cycles by time&#8208;lapse imaging, and study cell wall growth in the mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains when the &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based probes were unsuitable.

         <title>The Diverse Antimicrobial Activities of Human Milk Oligosaccharides against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exert various activities against Group B Streptococcus (GBS) including inhibition of bacterial growth, enhanced penetrance, and efficacy of antibiotics via bacterial cell permeabilization, and inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation. This review discusses the most recent studies on the interaction between HMOs and GBS.







Abstract
Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathobiont that is the etiological cause of severe perinatal infections. GBS can colonize the vagina of pregnant patients and invade tissues causing ascending infections of the gravid reproductive tract that lead to adverse outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal or fetal demise. Additionally, transmission of GBS during labor or breastfeeding can also cause invasive infections of neonates and infants. However, human milk has also been shown to have protective effects against infection; a characteristic that is likely derived from antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of molecules that comprise human milk. Recent evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), short&#8208;chain sugars that comprise 8&#8211;20&#8201;% of breast milk, have antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and other bacterial pathogens. Additionally, HMOs have been shown to potentiate the activity of antibiotics against GBS. This review presents the most recent published work that studies the interaction between HMOs and GBS.

         <title>Xanthopsin&#8208;like Systems via Site&#8208;Specific Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Retinoic Acid Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of light&#8208;responsive proteins to control both living or synthetic cells, is at the core of the expanding fields of optogenetics and synthetic biology. It is thus apparent that a richer reaction toolbox for the preparation of such systems is of fundamental importance. Here, we provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration that Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed to perform a facile site&#8208;specific, irreversible and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket and yielding an unnatural chromophore with an extended &#960;&#8208;system. In doing so we effectively open the path to the in vitro preparation of a library of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors. We argue that such library, made of variable unnatural chromophores inserted in an easy to mutate and crystallize retinoic acid transporter, significantly expand the scope of the recently introduced rhodopsin mimics as both optogenetic and "lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule" tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Transaminase Activity by Encapsulation in Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus megaterium transaminase (BmTA) shows high immobilization efficiency in upper critical solution temperature type poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) (pNAGA) hydrogels, and high activity in the swollen hydrogel. Upon temperature decrease, the hydrogel swelling and enzyme activity decrease. The deactivation tended to be higher for BmTA immobilized in pNAGA compared to free BmTA due to temperature&#8208;induced hydrogel shrinking.







Abstract
Smart hydrogels hold much potential for biocatalysis, not only for the immobilization of enzymes, but also for the control of enzyme activity. We investigated upper critical solution temperature&#8208;type poly N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (pNAGA) hydrogels as a smart matrix for the amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium (BmTA). Physical entrapment of BmTA in pNAGA hydrogels results in high immobilization efficiency (&gt;89&#8201;%) and high activity (97&#8201;%). The temperature&#8208;sensitiveness of pNAGA is preserved upon immobilization of BmTA and shows a gradual deswelling upon temperature reduction. While enzyme activity is mainly controlled by temperature, deactivation tended to be higher for immobilized BmTA (&#8776;62&#8211;68&#8201;%) than for free BmTA (&#8776;44&#8201;%), suggesting a deactivating effect due to deswelling of the pNAGA gel. Although the deactivation in response to hydrogel deswelling is not yet suitable for controlling enzyme activity sufficiently, it is nevertheless a good starting point for further optimization.

The deactivation tended to be higher for &lt;i&gt;Bm&lt;/i&gt;TA immobilized in pNAGA compared to free &lt;i&gt;Bm&lt;/i&gt;TA due to temperature-induced hydrogel shrinking.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can a common synthetic intermediate be transformed by different functional groups to target different cell organelles? We evaluated the structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes synthesized from the same synthetic intermediate to target nuclei, lysosomes, and mitochondria in live microglial cells.







Abstract
Targeting live cell organelles is essential for imaging, understanding, and controlling specific biochemical processes. Typically, fluorescent probes with distinct structural scaffolds are used to target specific cell organelles. Here, we have designed a modular one&#8208;step synthetic strategy using a common reaction intermediate to develop new lysosomal, mitochondrial, and nucleus&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes that are all based on a single boron dipyrromethane scaffold. The divergent cell organelle targeting was achieved by synthesizing probes with specific functional group changes to the central scaffold resulting in differential fluorescence and pKa. Specifically, we show that the functional group transformation of the same scaffold influences cellular localization and specificity of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes in live primary microglial cells with pKa values ranging from &#8764;3.2&#8211;6.0. We introduce a structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) framework to target nuclei (NucShine), lysosomes (LysoShine), and mitochondria (MitoShine) in live microglia. This work will result in future applications of SOR beyond imaging to target and control organelle&#8208;specific biochemical processes in disease&#8208;specific models.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Detection of Enzymatic Alcohol Dehydrogenase Activity in Microfluidic Droplets with a Direct Fluorogenic Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh throughput screening assay of alcohol dehydrogenases in microfluidic droplets becomes possible with substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore. With a 100&#8197;nM detection threshold and no appreciable leaking even after 6 weeks, less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average is robustly detectable.







Abstract
The exploration of large DNA libraries of metagenomic or synthetic origin is greatly facilitated by ultrahigh&#8208;throughput assays that use monodisperse water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets as sequestered reaction compartments. Millions of samples can be generated and analysed in microfluidic devices at kHz speeds, requiring only micrograms of reagents. The scope of this powerful platform for the discovery of new sequence space is, however, hampered by the limited availability of assay substrates, restricting the functions and reaction types that can be investigated. Here, we broaden the scope of detectable biochemical transformations in droplet microfluidics by introducing the first fluorogenic assay for alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in this format. We have synthesized substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore (8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;pyrenetrisulfonic acid, HPTS) when enzymatic turnover occurs. Pyranine is well retained in droplets for &gt;6 weeks (i.&#8201;e. 14&#8208;times longer than fluorescein), avoiding product leakage and ensuring excellent assay sensitivity. Product concentrations as low as 100&#8197;nM were successfully detected, corresponding to less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average. The potential of our substrate design was demonstrated by efficient recovery of a bona fide ADH with an &gt;800&#8208;fold enrichment. The repertoire of droplet screening is enlarged by this sensitive and direct fluorogenic assay to identify dehydrogenases for biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Mitochondrial Membrane Disrupting Molecules for Selective Killing of Senescent Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here, we showcase the importance of hydrophobicity and charge during the design of new mitochondria&#8208;targeted small molecules as a senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.







Abstract
Cellular senescence, a stable form of cell cycle arrest, facilitates protection from tumorigenesis and aids in tissue repair as they accumulate in the body at an early age. However, long&#8208;term retention of senescent cells causes inflammation, aging of the tissue, and progression of deadly diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Various attempts have been made to achieve selective elimination of senescent cells from the body, yet little has been explored in designing the mitochondria&#8208;targeted senolytic agent. Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here we have designed a library of alkyl&#8208;monoquaternary ammonium&#8208;triphenyl phosphine (TPP) and alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP of varying alkyl chain lengths, which target the mitochondria; we also studied their senolytic properties. It was observed that the alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP with the longest chain length induced apoptosis in senescent cells selectively via an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane disruption. This study demonstrates that mitochondria could be a potential target for designing new small molecules as senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.

         <title>&#8220;A Study in Yellow&#8221;: Investigations in the Stereoselectivity of Ene&#8208;Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Elementary, Watson!&#8221; The recent efforts to investigate and understand the stereochemical course of the asymmetric bioreduction of C=C bonds mediated by ene&#8208;reductases are reviewed, covering the literature of the last two decades. A general binding model is presented and successful approaches to stereodivergent reductions are discussed with representative examples.







Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductases from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily are a well&#8208;known and efficient biocatalytic alternative for the asymmetric reduction of C=C bonds. Considering the broad variety of substituents that can be tolerated, and the excellent stereoselectivities achieved, it is apparent why these enzymes are so appealing for preparative and industrial applications. Different classes of C=C bonds activated by at least one electron&#8208;withdrawing group have been shown to be accepted by these versatile biocatalysts in the last decades, affording a vast range of chiral intermediates employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavours, fragrances and fine chemicals. In order to access both enantiomers of reduced products, stereodivergent pairs of OYEs are desirable, but their natural occurrence is limited. The detailed knowledge of the stereochemical course of the reaction can uncover alternative strategies to orient the selectivity via mutagenesis, evolution, and substrate engineering. An overview of the ongoing studies on OYE&#8208;mediated bioreductions will be provided, with particular focus on stereochemical investigations by deuterium labelling.

         <title>NAD(H)&#8208;PEG Swing Arms Improve Both the Activities and Stabilities of Modularly&#8208;Assembled Transhydrogenases Designed with Predictable Selectivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular assembly of synthetic transhydrogenase catalysts is demonstrated using a PEG&#8208;NAD(H) modified formate dehydrogenase (FDH)&#8208;SpyCatcher fusion protein. The front cover highlights how any oxidoreductase enzyme can be outfitted with a simple SpyTag peptide and conjugated to FDH&#8208;SpyCatcher to create new cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalysts driven by formate oxidation. The stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites, emphasizing the functional modularity and predictive nature of this synthetic approach to biocatalyst design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Massad and S. Banta.

         <title>The Conversion of Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by Nitrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenases are the only known family of enzymes that catalyze the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2  ) to ammonia (NH3  ). The N2  reduction drives the biological nitrogen fixation and the global nitrogen cycle. Beside the conversion of N2  , nitrogenases catalyze a whole range of other reductions, including the reduction of the small gaseous substrates carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to hydrocarbons. However, it remains an open question whether these &#8216;side reactivities&#8217; play a role under environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these reactivities and particularly the formation of hydrocarbons have spurred the interest in nitrogenases for biotechnological applications. There are three different isozymes of nitrogenase: the molybdenum and the alternative vanadium and iron&#8208;only nitrogenase. The isozymes differ in their metal content, structure and substrate&#8208;dependent activity despite their homology. This minireview focuses on the conversion of CO and CO2  to methane and higher hydrocarbons and aims to specify the differences in activity between the three nitrogenase isozymes.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High costs and low availability of UDP&#8208;galactose hampers the enzymatic synthesis of valuable oligosaccharides such as human milk oligosaccharides. Here, we report the development of a platform for the scalable, biocatalytic synthesis and purification of UDP&#8208;galactose. UDP&#8208;galactose was produced with a titer of 48 mM (27.2 g/L) in a small&#8208;scale batch process (200 &#181;L) within 24 h using 0.02 g  enzyme  /g  product  . Through  in&#8208;situ  ATP regeneration, the amount of ATP (0.6 mM) supplemented was around 240&#8208;fold lower than the stoichiometric equivalent required to achieve the final product yield. Chromatographic purification using porous graphic carbon adsorbent yielded UDP&#8208;galactose with a purity of 92%. The synthesis was transferred to 1 L preparative scale production in a stirred tank bioreactor. To further reduce the synthesis costs here, the supernatant of cell lysates was used bypassing expensive purification of enzymes. Here, 23.4 g/L UDP&#8208;galactose were produced within 23 h with a synthesis yield of 71% and a biocatalyst load of 0.05 g  total_protein  /g  product  . The costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;galactose synthesized were around 0.26 &#8364;/g.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of Potent Bioactive anti&#8208;TNF&#945; Aptamers by Microbead&#8208;Assisted Capillary Electrophoresis (MACE)&#8208;SELEX</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid identification of high&#8208;affinity aptamers against human TNF&#945;: In vitro selection coupled with microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) separation was performed to rapidly identify anti&#8208;TNF&#945; aptamers; it was completed in only three rounds. Selected Apt14 showed the strongest inhibition activity according to the cell viability assay. Furthermore, by introducing a complementary linker to the aptamers, facile dimerization was performed, resulting in enhanced affinity and inhibition activity compared to that of the monomer.







Abstract
Dysregulation of tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;), a pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine, causes several diseases, making it an important therapeutic target. Here, we identified a novel DNA aptamer against human TNF&#945; using in&#8197;vitro selection, which included a high exclusion pressure process against non&#8208;binding and weak binders through microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) in only three rounds. Among the 15 most enriched aptamers, Apt14 exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for the interaction between TNF&#945; and its cognate receptor in mouse L929 cells. For further improving the bioactivity of the aptamer, dimerization programed by hybridization was evaluated, resulting in the Apt14 dimer exhibited a twofold higher binding affinity and stronger inhibition compared to the monomer counterpart. Rapid identification of bioactive aptamers using MACE in combination with facile dimerization by hybridization accelerates the discovery of novel bioactive aptamers, paving the way toward replacing current monoclonal antibody therapy with the less expensive and non&#8208;immunogenic aptamer therapy.

         <title>Harnessing P450 Enzyme for Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attentions in the synthetic biology and biotechnology areas due to their versatile functions and unique structures. In this article, different strategies that used to leverage P450s catalytic efficiency have been reviewed and discussed, which include substrate engineering, allostery effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, OPME and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization etc.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYPs) catalyze the oxidative transformation of a wide range of organic substrates. Their functions are crucial to xenobiotic metabolism and steroid transformation in humans and other organisms. The enzymes are promising for synthetic biology applications but limited by several drawbacks including low turnover rates, poor stability, the dependance of expensive cofactors and redox partners, and the narrow substrate scope. To conquer these obstacles, emerging strategies including substrate engineering, usage of decoy and decoy&#8208;based small molecules auxiliaries, designing of artificial enzyme cascades and the incorporation of materials have been explored based on the unique properties of P450s. These strategies can be applied to a wide range of P450s and can be combined with protein engineering to improve the enzymatic activities. This minireview will focus on some recent developments of these strategies which have been used to leverage P450 catalysis. Remaining challenges and future opportunities will also be discussed.

To conquer these obstacles, emerging strategies including substrate engineering, usage of decoy and decoy-based small molecules auxiliaries, designing of artificial enzyme cascades and the incorporation of materials have been explored based on the unique properties of P450s. These strategies can be applied to a wide range of P450s and can be combined with protein engineering to improve the enzymatic activities. This minireview will focus on some recent developments of these strategies which have been used to leverage P450 catalysis. Remaining challenges and future opportunities will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification and Composition of Clasper Scent Gland Components of the Butterfly Heliconius erato and Its Relation to Mimicry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scent glands of male Heliconius erato contain up to 350 components with individual compositions. Linear terpenes dominate, either as esters or as long, regular linear isoprene&#8208;oligomers. The high chemical diversity is reflected within the many different mimicry patterns of these butterflies. The compounds were identified by a combination of various methods, including synthesis, which allowed to unravel the underlying biosynthetic pathways used to arrive at these compound bouquets.







Abstract
The butterfly Heliconius erato occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper scent gland releases an anti&#8208;aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)&#8208;analyses, derivatization, and synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3&#8208;oxohexan&#8208;1&#8208;ol and (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol with (S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids, and various alcohols. In addition, linear terpenes with up to seven uniformly connected isoprene units occur, e.&#8201;g. farnesylfarnesol. A large number of the compounds have not been reported before from nature. Discriminant analyses of principal components of the gland contents showed that the iridescent mimicry group differs strongly from the other, mostly also separated, mimicry groups. Comparison with data from other species indicated that Heliconius recruits different biosynthetic pathways in a species&#8208;specific manner for semiochemical formation.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a biomimetic iron (IV)&#8208;oxo complex (the sun) towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates (the orbiting planets) was investigated. The reaction rates (corresponding to the orbital periods) are in very good agreement with the calculated bond dissociation energies. 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU or the dimethylated compounds 1,5dimC and 1,5dimU.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel benzaldehyde lyase for the production of chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones was identified by a machine learning model and two variants with altered substrate scopes were created by rational design. All three variants exhibit significantly higher thermostability compared to the only previously described benzaldehyde lyase. When immobilized in a packed&#8208;bed reactor, the most thermostable variant showed stable substrate turnover over days.







Abstract
Enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are important building blocks of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which can be produced by thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyases, such as benzaldehyde lyase. Here we report the discovery of a novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis R138 (ReBAL). While the overall sequence identity to the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar I (PfBAL) was only 65&#8201;%, comparison of a structural model of ReBAL with the crystal structure of PfBAL revealed only four divergent amino acids in the substrate binding cavity. Based on rational design, we generated two ReBAL variants, which were characterized along with the wild&#8208;type enzyme in terms of their substrate spectrum, thermostability and biocatalytic performance in the presence of different co&#8208;solvents. We found that the new enzyme variants have a significantly higher thermostability (up to 22&#8201;&#176;C increase in T50) and a different co&#8208;solvent&#8208;dependent activity. Using the most stable variant immobilized in packed&#8208;bed reactors via the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, (R)&#8208;benzoin was synthesized from benzaldehyde over a period of seven days with a stable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8208;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;d&#8722;1. Our work expands the important class of benzaldehyde lyases and therefore contributes to the development of continuous biocatalytic processes for the production of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and APIs.

         <title>The Role of Spike Protein Mutations in the Infectious Power of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Variants: A Molecular Interaction Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2&#8201;variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells.







Abstract
Specific S477N, N501Y, K417N, K417T, E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein in the wild type SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus have resulted, among others, in the following variants: B.1.160 (20A or EU2, first reported in continental Europe), B1.1.7 (&#945; or 20I501Y.V1, first reported in the United Kingdom), B.1.351 (&#946; or 20H/501Y.V2, first reported in South Africa), B.1.1.28.1 (&#947; or P.1 or 20J/501Y.V3, first reported in Brazil), and B.1.1.28.2 (&#950;, or P.2 or 20B/S484K, also first reported in Brazil). From the analysis of a set of bonding descriptors firmly rooted in the formalism of quantum mechanics, including Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO), Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and highly correlated energies within the Domain Based Local Pair Natural Orbital Coupled Cluster Method (DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)), and from a set of computed electronic spectral patterns with environmental effects, we show that the new variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells. This results in significantly improved initial virus&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;cell molecular recognition and attachment at the microscopic level, which trigger the infectious cycle.

The incorporation of 4,4&#8208;difluoroproline into the conserved cis prolyl&#8208;peptide bond of the E.&#8197;coli thioredoxin variant Trx1P neither eliminated the bottleneck of the thioredoxin refolding reaction nor had an impact on the attainment of the cis/trans equilibrium in the unfolded state. Our results suggest that the cis/trans isomerisation rates predicted for fluorinated proline analogues in the context of short model peptides are not applicable in the context of tertiary structures.







Abstract
C4&#8208;substituted fluoroprolines (4R)&#8208;fluoroproline ((4R)&#8208;Flp) and (4S)&#8208;fluoroproline ((4S)&#8208;Flp) have been used in protein engineering to enhance the thermodynamic stability of peptides and proteins. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine can bias the pucker of the pyrrolidine ring, influence the conformational preference of the preceding peptide bond, and can accelerate the cis/trans prolyl peptide bond isomerisation by diminishing its double bond character. The role of 4,4&#8208;difluoroproline (Dfp) in the acceleration of the refolding rate of globular proteins bearing a proline (Pro) residue in the cis conformation in the native state remains elusive. Moreover, the impact of Dfp on the thermodynamic stability and bioactivity of globular proteins has been seldom described. In this study, we show that the incorporation of Dfp caused a redox state dependent and position dependent destabilisation of the thioredoxin (Trx) fold, while the catalytic activities of the modified proteins remained unchanged. The Pro to Dfp substitution at the conserved cisPro76 in the thioredoxin variant Trx1P did not elicited acceleration of the rate&#8208;limiting trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization of the Ile75&#8208;Pro76 peptide bond. Our results show that pucker preferences in the context of a tertiary structure could play a major role in protein folding, thus overtaking the rules determined for cis/trans isomerisation barriers determined in model peptides.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Mesophilic CTP&#8208;Dependent Riboflavin Kinase and Rational Engineering to Create Its Thermostable Homologues
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pathway for vitamin B2 (riboflavin) biosynthesis in archaea contains several novel enzymes and reactions. The archaeal riboflavin kinase, RibK, is one such example &#8211; it has a unique structural fold, and phosphorylates B2 using CTP. Here, we characterize a new mesophilic archaeal RibK, compare its structure and function with a closely linked thermophilic homologue, and determine the molecular factors that confer thermal stability to this enzyme's characteristic structural fold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Kumar, R.&#8197;K. Singh, and A.&#8197;B. Hazra.

         <title>Exploration of GH94 Sequence Space for Enzyme Discovery Reveals a Novel Glucosylgalactose Phosphorylase Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of a glucosylgalactose phosphorylase: Although the rapidly expanding sequence space offers excellent opportunities for the discovery of novel enzymes, its rational exploration is key to the effective localization of regions for which no functional information is available. We have applied a binary approach that leverages the strengths of phylogeny and sequence similarity networks and which led to the discovery of the novel 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose phosphorylase.







Abstract
The substantial increase in DNA sequencing efforts has led to a rapid expansion of available sequences in glycoside hydrolase families. The ever&#8208;increasing sequence space presents considerable opportunities for the search for enzymes with novel functionalities. In this work, the sequence&#8208;function space of glycoside hydrolase family 94 (GH94) was explored in detail, using a combined approach of phylogenetic analysis and sequence similarity networks. The identification and experimental screening of unknown clusters led to the discovery of an enzyme from the soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa that acts as a 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose phosphorylase (GGalP), a specificity that has not been reported to date. Detailed characterization of GGalP revealed that its kinetic parameters were consistent with those of other known phosphorylases. Furthermore, the enzyme could be used for production of the rare disaccharides 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose and 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;l&#8208;arabinose. Our current work highlights the power of rational sequence space exploration in the search for novel enzyme specificities, as well as the potential of phosphorylases for rare disaccharide synthesis.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two for one: A straightforward chemoenzymatic synthesis pathway towards valuable chiral alcohols with &#945;&#8208;fluorination in close proximity to the chiral center and a pyridine ring is presented. High conversions with excellent enantioselectivities were found, showing its high synthetic potential.







Abstract
Fluoro&#8208;substituted and heteroaromatic compounds are valuable intermediates for a variety of applications in pharma&#8208; and agrochemistry and synthetic chemistry. This study investigates the chemoenzymatic preparation of chiral alcohols bearing a heteroaromatic ring with an increasing degree of fluorination in &#945;&#8208;position. Starting from readily available picoline derivatives prochiral &#945;&#8208;halogenated acyl moieties were introduced with excellent selectivity and 64&#8211;95&#8201;% yield. The formed carbonyl group was subsequently reduced to the corresponding alcohols using the alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir, yielding an enantiomeric excess of 95&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% and up to 98&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Completely Chemically Synthesized Long DNA Can be Transcribed in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA segments of 78&#8197;bp and 258&#8197;bp in length, were prepared by chemical ligation of chemically synthesized DNA fragments with phosphorothioate and haloacyl terminus groups. The 258&#8197;bp DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a truncated SV promoter sequence, was successfully transcribed and showed full gene silencing effects in human cells.







Abstract
Chemical ligation reaction of DNA is useful for the construction of long functional DNA using oligonucleotide fragments that are prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis. However, the unnatural linkage structure formed by the ligation reaction generally impairs the biological function of the resulting ligated DNA. We achieved the complete chemical synthesis of 78 and 258&#8197;bp synthetic DNAs via multiple chemical ligation reactions with phosphorothioate and haloacyl&#8208;modified DNA fragments. The latter synthetic DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a designed truncated SV promoter sequence, successfully induced the expected gene silencing effect in HeLa cells.

         <title>Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes in Photoredox Catalysis and Photodynamic Therapy: A New Paradigm towards Anticancer Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered Ir(III)&#8208; and Ru(II)&#8208;based organometallic complexes that elicit selective in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo responses to cancerous cells while being nontoxic to normal cells in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photoredox catalysis (PC) are discussed in this Highlight article. We indicate promising avenues in translational research for cancer treatment by examining stable transition&#8208;metal complexes that hold potential for clinical trials in the future.







Abstract
Individually, photoredox catalysis (PC) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are well&#8208;established concepts that have experienced a remarkable resurgence in recent years, leading to significant progress in organic synthesis for PC and clinical approval of anticancer drugs for PDT. But, very recently, new photoredox catalyst systems based on Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes have garnered significant interest because they can simultaneously be used as PDT agents apart from their demonstrated PC activity. This highlight discusses the unique PC behavior of emerging Ir(III)&#8208; and Ru(II)&#8208;based systems while also examining their potential PDT activity in cancer treatment.

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Gly&#8208;His&#8208;Tagged Proteins with Azidogluconolactone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;amino acylation of proteins with N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;HisTags using 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone (6AGDL) is reported. To demonstrate the usefulness of this reaction, we multimerise the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) protein antigen onto virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). The resulting COVID&#8208;19 vaccine candidate induces single&#8208;shot seroconversion, and virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies in mice.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific protein modifications are vital for biopharmaceutical drug development. Gluconoylation is a non&#8208;enzymatic, post&#8208;translational modification of N&#8208;terminal HisTags. We report high&#8208;yield, site&#8208;selective in&#8197;vitro &#945;&#8208;aminoacylation of peptides, glycoproteins, antibodies, and virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) with azidogluconolactone at pH&#8197;7.5 in 1&#8197;h. Conjugates slowly hydrolyse, but diol&#8208;masking with borate esters inhibits reversibility. In an example, we multimerise azidogluconoylated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) onto VLPs via click&#8208;chemistry, to give a COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. Compared to yeast antigen, HEK&#8208;derived RBD was immunologically superior, likely due to observed differences in glycosylation. We show the benefits of ordered over randomly oriented multimeric antigen display, by demonstrating single&#8208;shot seroconversion and best virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies. Azidogluconoylation is simple, fast and robust chemistry, and should accelerate research and development.

         <title>Engineering Leifsonia Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Thermostability and Catalytic Efficiency by Enhancing Subunit Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the subunit interface of Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) yielded thermostability, and catalytic efficiency significantly improved in the mutant T100R/S148I. T100R/S148I can efficiently convert various ketone substrates into nearly optically pure chiral alcohols at elevated temperature in a very low enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;500).







Abstract
Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) is a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. However, limitations of wild&#8208;type LnADH observed for practical application include low activity and poor stability. In this work, protein engineering was employed to improve its thermostability and catalytic efficiency by altering the subunit interfaces. Residues T100 and S148 were identified to be significant for thermostability and activity, and the melting temperature (&#916;Tm) and catalytic efficiency of the mutant T100R/S148I toward ketone substrates was improved by 18.7&#8201;&#176;C and 1.8&#8211;5.5&#8208;fold. Solving the crystal structures of the wild&#8208;type enzyme and T100R/S148L revealed beneficial effects of mutations on stability and catalytic activity. The most robust mutant T100R/S148I is promising for industrial applications and can produce 200&#8197;g&#8201;liter&#8722;1&#8201;day&#8722;1 chiral alcohols at 50&#8201;&#176;C by only a 1&#8201;:&#8201;500 ratio of enzyme to substrate.

         <title>Efficient Linear dsDNA Tagging Using Deoxyuridine Excision**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular barcoding is used to tag nucleic acids with sequence&#8208;encoded identifiers to distinguish between different samples or individual molecules. I describe a one&#8208;pot procedure for efficiently tagging linear dsDNA with molecular barcodes. This approach has potential utility for high&#8208;throughput in&#8197;vitro biochemical experiments that require uniform and quantitative dsDNA tagging.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific strategies for exchanging segments of dsDNA are important for DNA library construction and molecular tagging. Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3&#8217; ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi&#8208;base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT&#8594;dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non&#8208;perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called deoxyUridine eXcision&#8208;tagging (dUX&#8208;tagging), is an efficient one&#8208;pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3&#8217; overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5&#8217; overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX&#8208;tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX&#8208;tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high&#8208;efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial biosynthesis and catabolism of phosphonate natural products is a largely unexplored world of unusual enzyme reactions. Within this world resides Fosfonochlorin, a rare example of a halogenated phosphonate natural product, and a biosynthetic enigma since its discovery in 1988. In this study Gama and co&#8208;workers reveal two key steps in the biosynthesis of this deceptively simple molecule. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Pallitsch, D.&#8197;L. Zechel et&#8197;al.

         <title>Structural Basis of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diene Forming Acyl&#8208;Coenzyme A Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the biocatalytic repertoire: Canonical acyl&#8208;coenzyme dehydrogenases catalyze the 1,2&#8208;dehydrogenation of aliphatic thioesters in a highly conserved manner with a invariant glutamate serving as catalytic base and a flavin as hydride acceptor. By removal of this glutamate and positioning of a novel aspartate base at C3, an 1,4 dehydrogenation activity is achieved, thereby generating a cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building block.







Abstract
The biologically important, FAD&#8208;containing acyl&#8208;coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenases (ACAD) usually catalyze the anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination of a proton and a hydride of aliphatic CoA thioesters. Here, we report on the structure and function of an ACAD from anaerobic bacteria catalyzing the unprecedented 1,4&#8208;elimination at C3 and C6 of cyclohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1CoA) to cyclohex&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1,5CoA) and at C3 and C4 of the latter to benzoyl&#8208;CoA. Based on high&#8208;resolution Ch1CoA dehydrogenase crystal structures, the unorthodox reactivity is explained by the presence of a catalytic aspartate base (D91) at C3, and by eliminating the catalytic glutamate base at C1. Moreover, C6 of Ch1CoA and C4 of Ch1,5CoA are positioned towards FAD&#8208;N5 to favor the biologically relevant C3,C6&#8208; over the C3,C4&#8208;dehydrogenation activity. The C1,C2&#8208;dehydrogenation activity was regained by structure&#8208;inspired amino acid exchanges. The results provide the structural rationale for the extended catalytic repertoire of ACADs and offer previously unknown biocatalytic options for the synthesis of cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building blocks.

         <title>Discovery, Biocatalytic Exploration and Structural Analysis of a 4&#8208;Ethylphenol Oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gc4EO, a new member of the VAO/PCMH family from the actinobacteria Gulosibacter chungangensis was discovered. This oxidase is a very appealing biocatalyst for the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylphenols, exhibiting high conversion yields with an attractive chemoselectivity towards the production of alkenes. Gc4EO showed high activity to produce 4&#8208;vinylphenol, an interesting building block for the synthesis of polyvinylphenol.







Abstract
The vanillyl&#8208;alcohol oxidase (VAO) family is a rich source of biocatalysts for the oxidative bioconversion of phenolic compounds. Through genome mining and sequence comparisons, we found that several family members lack a generally conserved catalytic aspartate. This finding led us to study a VAO&#8208;homolog featuring a glutamate residue in place of the common aspartate. This 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis (Gc4EO) shares 42&#8201;% sequence identity with VAO from Penicillium simplicissimum, contains the same 8&#945;&#8208;N3&#8208;histidyl&#8208;bound FAD and uses oxygen as electron acceptor. However, Gc4EO features a distinct substrate scope and product specificity as it is primarily effective in the dehydrogenation of para&#8208;substituted phenols with little generation of hydroxylated products. The three&#8208;dimensional structure shows that the characteristic glutamate side chain creates a closely packed environment that may limit water accessibility and thereby protect from hydroxylation. With its high thermal stability, well defined structural properties and high expression yields, Gc4EO may become a catalyst of choice for the specific dehydrogenation of phenolic compounds bearing small substituents.

         <title>Remote Photodamaging of DNA by Photoinduced Energy Transport</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far does energy migrate in DNA? DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport is a new pathway to DNA photodamage occurring at remote sites and not locally at the site of excitation by light. Although these distances might be small with regard to a whole gene, the proposal that a site might be damaged other than the site of initial photoexcitation is important to the understanding of mutations that are caused by remote DNA photodamages.







Abstract
Local DNA photodamaging by light is well&#8208;studied and leads to a number of structurally identified direct damage, in particular cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and indirect oxidatively generated damage, such as 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;hydroxyguanine. Similar damages have now been found at remote sites, at least more than 105&#8197;&#197; (30 base pairs) away from the site of photoexcitation. In contrast to the established mechanisms of local DNA photodamaging, the processes of remote photodamage are only partially understood. Known pathways include those to remote oxidatively generated DNA photodamages, which were elucidated by studying electron hole transport through the DNA about 20&#8197;years ago. Recent studies with DNA photosensitizers and mechanistic proposals on photoinduced DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport are summarized in this minireview. These new mechanisms to a new type of remote DNA photodamaging provide an important extension to our general understanding to light&#8208;induced DNA damage and their mutations.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Dual Modulators of A&#946; and Tau Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The screening of a focused library of 52 thiophene molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation identified lead compounds. The potent lead compound effectively rescued neuronal cells from aggregation&#8208;induced toxicity and establish thiophene compound as a dual modulator of A&#946; and Tau aggregation.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A&#946;) and Tau aggregates in the brain, which induces various pathological events resulting in neurodegeneration. There have been continuous efforts to develop modulators of the A&#946; and Tau aggregation process to halt or modify disease progression. A few small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based inhibitors that target both A&#946; and Tau pathology have been reported. Here, we report the screening of a targeted library of small molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation together with their in&#8197;vitro, in&#8197;silico and cellular studies. In&#8197;vitro ThT fluorescence assay, dot blot assay, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results have shown that thiophene&#8208;based lead molecules effectively modulate A&#946; aggregation and inhibit Tau aggregation. In&#8197;silico studies performed by employing molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding&#8208;free energy calculations have helped in understanding the mechanism of interaction of the lead thiophene compounds with A&#946; and Tau fibril targets. In&#8197;cellulo studies revealed that the lead candidate is biocompatible and effectively ameliorates neuronal cells from A&#946; and Tau&#8208;mediated amyloid toxicity.

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs enables efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The cover feature demonstrates how PylT recodes an amber stop codon within a GFP reporter to direct site&#8208;specific incorporation of an ncAA, leading to GFP fluorescence throughout the organoid, as visible by light&#8208;sheet microscopy. The method will help to implement existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies for probing and manipulating proteins in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. van&#8197;Husen et&#8197;al.

         <title>TET&#8208;Like Oxidation in 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and Derivatives: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex 1 towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates was investigated. The reaction rates are in very good agreement with the calculated BDEs. C&#8208;Methylated compounds such as 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU.







Abstract
The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) is an important factor in DNA modification and epigenetics. It can be modified through a three&#8208;step oxidation performed by ten&#8208;eleven&#8208;translocation (TET) enzymes and we have previously reported that the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [Fe(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can oxidize 5mC. Here, we report the reactivity of this iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex towards a wider scope of methylated cytosine and uracil derivatives relevant for synthetic DNA applications, such as 1&#8208;methylcytosine (1mC), 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;iso&#8208;cytosine (5miC) and thymine (T/5mU). The observed kinetic parameters are corroborated by calculation of the C&#8722;H bond energies at the reactive sites which was found to be an efficient tool for reaction rate prediction of 1 towards methylated DNA bases. We identified oxidation products of methylated cytosine derivatives using HPLC&#8208;MS and GC&#8208;MS. Thereby, we shed light on the impact of the methyl group position and resulting C&#8722;H bond dissociation energies on reactivity towards TET&#8208;like oxidation.

         <title>Recent Developments in PROTAC&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation: From Bench to Clinic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past two decades, Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed as a new approach for targeted protein degradation by hijacking the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In this review, we describe recent PROTAC developments, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), an emerging paradigm&#8208;shifting technology, hijacks the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. PROTACs induce ternary complexes between an E3 ligase and POI, and this induced proximity leads to polyUb chain formation on substrates and eventual proteasomal&#8208;mediated POI degradation. PROTACs have shown great therapeutic potential by degrading many disease&#8208;causing proteins, such as the androgen receptor and BRD4. The PROTAC technology has advanced significantly in the last two decades, with the repertoire of PROTAC targets increased tremendously. Herein, we describe recent developments of PROTAC technology, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.
