         <title>Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Containing Simple Dioxo Ligands: a Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study Shows the Importance of the Charge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;activity relationship study on two self&#8208;consistent series of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes with anionic dioxo ligands showed the importance of combining the positive charge of the complex with a highly lipophilic diimine ligand for obtaining good cellular uptake and cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Platinum complexes (i.&#8201;e., cisplatin, carboplatin, and others) are currently heavily used for the treatment of different types of cancer, but unwanted effects occur. Ruthenium complexes have been shown to be potential promising alternatives to these metal&#8208;based drugs. In this work, we performed a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study on two small series of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes of the type [Ru(L1)2(O^O)]Cln (3&#8211;8), where L1 is 4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline (DIP) or 1,10&#8208;phenantroline (phen), and O^O is a symmetrical anionic dioxo ligand: oxalate (ox, n=0), malonate (mal, n=0), or acetylacetonate (acac, n=1). These two self&#8208;consistent series of compounds allowed us to perform a systematic investigation for establishing how the nature of the ligands and the charge affect the anticancer properties of the complexes. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines demonstrated that some of the six compounds 3&#8211;8 have a promising anticancer activity. More specifically, the cationic complex [Ru(DIP)2(&#951;2&#8208;acac)]Cl (4) has IC50 values in the mid&#8208;nanomolar concentration range, lower than those of cisplatin on the same cell lines. Interestingly, [Ru(DIP)2(&#951;2&#8208;acac)]Cl was found to localize mainly in the mitochondria, whereas a smaller fraction was detected in the nucleus. Overall, our SAR investigation demonstrates the importance of combining the positive charge of the complex with the highly lipophilic diimine ligand DIP.

         <title>Native mass spectrometry guided screening identifies hit fragments for HOP&#8208;HSP90 PPI inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contemporary medicinal chemistry considers fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) and inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) as important means of expanding the volume of druggable chemical space. However, the ability to robustly identify valid fragments and PPI inhibitors is an enormous challenge, requiring the application of sensitive biophysical methodology. Accordingly, in this study, we exploited the speed and sensitivity of nano&#8208;electrospray (nano&#8208;ESI) native mass spectrometry to identify a small collection of fragments which bind to the TPR2AB domain of HOP. Follow&#8208;up biophysical assessment of a small selection of binding fragments confirmed binding to the single TPR2A domain, and that this binding translated into PPI inhibitory activity between TPR2A and the HSP90  C  &#8208;terminal domain. An  in&#8208;silico  assessment of binding fragments at the PPI interfacial region, provided valuable structural insight for future fragment elaboration strategies, including the identification of losartan as a weak, albeit dose&#8208;dependent inhibitor of the target PPI.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Activity Relationship of the Stem Peptide in Sortase A mediated Ligation from Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surfaces of most Gram&#8208;positive bacterial cells, including that of  Staphylococcus aureus  (  S. aureus  ), are heavily decorated with proteins that coordinate cellular interactions with the extracellular space. In  S. aureus  , sortase A is the principal enzyme responsible for covalently anchoring proteins, which display the sorting signal LPXTG, onto the peptidoglycan (PG) matrix. Considerable efforts have been made to understand the role of this signal peptide in the sortase&#8208;mediated reaction. In contrast, much less is known about how the primary structure of the other substrate involved in the reaction (PG stem peptide) could impact sortase activity. To assess the sortase activity, a library of synthetic analogs of the stem peptide that mimic naturally existing variations found in the  S. aureus  PG primary sequence were evaluated. Using a combination of two unique assays, we showed that there is broad tolerability of substrate variations that are effectively processed by sortase A. While some of these stem peptide derivatives are naturally found in mature PG, they are not known to be present in the PG precursor, lipid II. These results suggest that sortase A could process both lipid II and mature PG as acyl&#8208;acceptor strands that might reside near the membrane, which has not been previously described.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides as protein helical domain mimetics to manipulate the angiogenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides recently developed in our group have been proven to be a new class of unnatural foldamer with well&#8208;defined helical structure and demonstrated their ability to mimic protein helical domains and disrupt biomedically relevant protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Based the designing concept, in a recent report, we discovered two similar sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides  V2  and  V3  which were designed to mimic the VEGF N&#8208;terminal helix &#945;1 known to directly interact with VEGFRs. Interestingly,  V2  was shown to possess the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect, whereas  V3  was proved to be a potent inhibitor for angiogenesis. We speculated that the distinct angiogenesis signaling was due to the selective binding of the two molecules toward VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, respectively. Together with their remarkable resistance to proteolytic degradation, relatively small sizes, and amenability to modification with diverse functional groups,  V2  and  V3  could serve as lead molecules for the development of potential therapeutic agents and molecular probes. These findings highlighted sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides as an alternative paradigm to mimic the &#945;&#8208;helical domain to modulate a wide variety of PPIs in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Potential G&#8208;quadruplexes within the Promoter Nuclease Hypersensitive Sites of the Heat&#8208;responsive Genes in Rice</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been shown to be involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. Exploring putative G4&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in heat&#8208;responsive genes of rice and their folding structures under different conditions will help to understand the mechanism in response to heat stress. In this work, we discovered a prevalence of PQSs in nuclease hypersensitive sites within the promoters of heat&#8208;responsive genes. Moreover, 50% of the searched G3 PQSs ((G3+L1&#8208;7)3+G3+) locate in heat shock transcription factors. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, thermal difference spectroscopy, and UV melting analysis demonstrated the representative PQSs could adopt stable G4s at physiological temperature and potassium concentration. These PQSs were able to stall Klenow Fragment (KF) DNA polymerase by the formation of G4s. However, the G4s with Tm values around 50 &#8211; 60 oC could be increasingly unwound by KF with the increase of temperatures from 25 to 50 oC, implying these G4s could sense the changes in temperature by structural switch. This work offers fresh clue to understand the potential of G4&#8208;involved functions of PQSs and the molecular events in plants in the response to heat stress.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Detection of Telomerase and Correlated Biomolecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular detection of telomerase is essential for diagnostics and therapeutics. This concept article introduces recent progress of DNA&#8208;based nanoprobes for simultaneous detection of telomerase activity and related molecules, with a focus on circuit&#8208;based multiplexed imaging of telomerase and other biomolecules in living cells and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Telomerase (TE), a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase, is enzymatically activated in most tumor cells and is responsible for promoting tumor progression and malignancy by enabling replicative immortality of cancer cells. TE has become an important hallmark for cancer diagnosis and a potential therapy target. Therefore, accurate in&#8197;situ detection of TE activity, especially the simultaneous imaging of TE activity and its correlated biomolecules, is essential to medical diagnostics and therapeutics. DNA&#8208;based nanoprobes, with their effective cell penetration capability and programmability, are the most advantageous for detection of intracellular TE activity. This concept article introduces the recent strategies for in&#8197;situ sensing and imaging of TE activity, with a focus on simultaneous detection of TE and related biomolecules, and provides challenges and perspectives for the development of new strategies for such correlated imaging.

         <title>Incorporation of an Asymmetric Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S Cluster as an Artificial Cofactor into Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a synthetic asymmetric Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S cluster, [Cp*MoFe5S9(SH)]3&#8722;, into the active site of the cofactor&#8208;free nitrogenase scaffold results a semi&#8208;artificial enzyme that catalytically reduces C2H2 to C2H4, and CN&#8722; into short&#8208;chain hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Nitrogenase employs a sophisticated electron transfer system and a Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S&#8722;C cofactor, designated the M&#8208;cluster [(cit)MoFe7S9C]), to reduce atmospheric N2 to bioaccessible NH3. Previously, we have shown that the cofactor&#8208;free form of nitrogenase can be repurposed as a protein scaffold for the incorporation of a synthetic Fe&#8722;S cluster [Fe6S9(SEt)2]4&#8722;. Here, we demonstrate the utility of an asymmetric Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S cluster [Cp*MoFe5S9(SH)]3&#8722; as an alternative artificial cofactor upon incorporation into the cofactor&#8208;free nitrogenase scaffold. The resultant semi&#8208;artificial enzyme catalytically reduces C2H2 to C2H4, and CN&#8722; into short&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, yet it is clearly distinct in activity from its [Fe6S9(SEt)2]4&#8722;&#8208;reconstituted counterpart, pointing to the possibility to employ molecular design and cluster synthesis strategies to further develop semi&#8208;artificial or artificial systems with desired catalytic activities.

         <title>Synthetic approaches to break the chemical shift degeneracy of glycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR spectroscopy is the leading technique for determining glycans&#8217; three&#8208;dimensional structure and dynamic in solution as well as a fundamental tool to study protein&#8208;glycan interactions. To overcome the severe chemical shift degeneracy of these compounds, synthetic probes carrying NMR&#8208;active nuclei (  e.g.  ,  13  C or  19  F) or lanthanide tags have been proposed. These elegant strategies permitted to simplify the complex NMR analysis of unlabeled analogues, shining light on glycans&#8217; conformational aspects and interaction with proteins. Here, we highlight some key achievements in the synthesis of specifically labeled glycan probes and their contribution towards the fundamental understanding of glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, derivatization and photochemical control of an ortho&#8208;functionalized tetrafluorinated azoben&#173;&#173;&#173;zene&#8208;modified siRNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of an  ortho  &#8208;functionalized tetrafluorinated azobenzene phosphoramidite for its site&#8208;specific incorporation into RNA. The tetrafluorinated azobenzene is embedded within the antisense strand of an siRNA duplex to form an  ortho  &#8208;functionalized tetrafluorinated azobenzene&#8208;containing siRNA (F&#8208;siRNAzo). The F&#8208;siRNAzo is inactivated via  trans  to  cis  conversion with green light (530 nm), and reactivated with blue light (470 nm) via  cis  to  trans  conversion in cell culture. The long half&#8208;life and stability of the tetrafluorinated azobenzene unit allows for reversible control of the F&#8208;siRNAzo in cell culture for up 72 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>An in vitro cytomimetic of in&#8208;cell RNA folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To discover the cytomimetic that accounts for cytoplasmic crowding and sticking on RNA stability, we conducted a two&#8208;dimensional scan of mixtures of artificial crowding and sticking agents, PEG10k and M&#8208;PERTM. As our model RNA, we investigate the fourU RNA thermometer motif of Salmonella, a hairpin&#8211;structured RNA that regulates translation by unfolding and exposing its RBS in response to temperature perturbations. We found that the addition of artificial crowding and sticking agents leads to a stabilization and destabilization of RNA folding, respectively, through the excluded volume effect and surface interactions. FRET&#8208;labels were added to the fourU RNA and Fast Relaxation Imaging (FReI), fluorescence microscopy coupled to temperature&#8208;jump spectroscopy, probed differences between folding stability of RNA inside single living cells and in vitro. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic environment affecting RNA folding is comparable to a combination of 20% v/v M&#8208;PERTM and 150 g/L PEG10k.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Silk fibroin protein is a biomaterial with excellent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity.

These results highlight the power of chemistry under moderate conditions to install unnatural groups onto the silk fibroin surface and will enable further exploration into applications of this versatile biomaterial.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of a Functionalized GFP Nanobody</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of a full&#8208;length nanobody against GFP ready for selective on&#8208;demand functionalization is described. The folded synthetic nanobody is obtained via a native chemical ligation&#8208;desulfurization strategy and converted into probes by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The probes bind their target with high affinity which was validated in pulldown&#8208; and confocal microscopy experiments.







Abstract
Chemical protein synthesis has proven to be a powerful tool to access homogenously modified proteins. The chemical synthesis of nanobodies (Nb) would create possibilities to design tailored Nbs with a range of chemical modifications such as tags, linkers, reporter groups, and subsequently, Nb&#8208;drug conjugates. Herein, we describe the total chemical synthesis of a 123 amino&#8208;acid Nb against GFP. A native chemical ligation&#8208; desulfurization strategy was successfully applied for the synthesis of this GFP Nb, modified with a propargyl (PA) moiety for on&#8208;demand functionalization. Biophysical characterization indicated that the synthetic GFP Nb&#8208;PA was correctly folded after internal disulfide bond formation. The synthetic Nb&#8208;PA was functionalized with a biotin or a sulfo&#8208;cyanine5 dye by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), resulting in two distinct probes used for functional in&#8197;vitro validation in pull&#8208;down and confocal microscopy settings.

         <title>Selective Exoenzymatic Labeling of Lipooligosaccharides of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with &#945;2,6&#8208;Sialoside Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective exoenzymatic labeling (SEEL) can be applied as a glycoengineering technique for the modification of cell surface glycans on live bacteria; in this case the recombinant glycosyltransferase ST6Gal1 installed synthetic &#945;2,6&#8208;sialoside derivatives with a reporter group on the lipooligosaccharides of the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae.







Abstract
The interactions between bacteria and their host often rely on recognition processes that involve host or bacterial glycans. Glycoengineering techniques make it possible to modify and study the glycans on the host's eukaryotic cells, but only a few are available for the study of bacterial glycans. Here, we have adapted selective exoenzymatic labeling (SEEL), a chemical reporter strategy, to label the lipooligosaccharides of the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae, using the recombinant glycosyltransferase ST6Gal1, and three synthetic CMP&#8208;sialic acid derivatives. We show that SEEL treatment does not affect cell viability and can introduce an &#945;2,6&#8208;linked sialic acid with a reporter group on the lipooligosaccharides by Western blot, flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. This new bacterial glycoengineering technique allows for the precise modification, here with &#945;2,6&#8208;sialoside derivatives, and direct detection of specific surface glycans on live bacteria, which will aid in further unravelling the precise biological functions of bacterial glycans.

         <title>A Photochemoenzymatic Hunsdiecker&#8208;Borodin&#8208;Type Halodecarboxylation of Ferulic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halodecarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ferulic acid was achieved by combining photo&#8208;, bio&#8208; and phase transfer catalysis in a biphasic system. Reactive hypobromite was formed in&#8197;situ by combining Blue&#8208;LED and vanadium chloroperoxidase, and efficiently transferred from the aqueous to the organic layer by a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst, improving overall performance and selectivity.







Abstract
A photochemoenzymatic halodecarboxylation of ferulic acid was achieved using vanadate&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase as (bio)catalyst and oxygen and organic solvent as sole stoichiometric reagents in a biphasic system. Performance and selectivity were improved through a phase transfer catalyst, reaching a turnover number of 660.000 for the enzyme.

         <title>Supramolecular host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;driven electrochemical recognition for pyrophosphate and alkaline phosphatase analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an electrochemical biosensor based on the supramolecular host&#8208;guest recognition between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and  L  &#8208;Phenylalanine&#8208;Cu(II) Complex for pyrophosphate (PPi) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) analysis. First,  L  &#8208;Phe&#8208;Cu(II) Complex is simply synthesized by the complexation of Cu(II) (metal node) with  L  &#8208;Phe (bioorganic ligand), which can be immobilized onto CB[7] modified electrode via host&#8208;guest interaction of CB[7] and  L  &#8208;Phe. In this process, the signal of the Complex triggered electro&#8208;catalytic reduction of H  2  O  2  can be captured. Next, in the view of strong chelation between PPi and Cu(II), a biosensing system of the model &#8220;PPi and Cu(II) premixing, then adding  L  &#8208;Phe&#8221; is designed and the platform can be applied for PPi analysis well by hampering the formation of  L  &#8208;Phe&#8208;Cu(II) Complex. Along with ALP introduction, PPi can be hydrolyzed into orthophosphate (Pi), where abundant Cu(II) ions are released to form  L  &#8208;Phe&#8208;Cu(II) Complex, which gives rise to the catalytic reaction of Complex to H  2  O  2  reduction. The quantitative analysis of H  2  O  2  , PPi and ALP activity is achieved successfully and the detection of limits are 0.067 &#956;M, 0.42 &#956;M and 0.09 mU/mL (  S  /  N  =3), respectively. With the merits of high sensitivity and selectivity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and simplification, our developed analytical system has great potential to act on diagnosis and treatment of ALP&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical and Molecular Dynamics Studies of Halide Binding in Flavoenzyme Glucose Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the halide&#8208;free GOX, Cl&#8722; binding results in disappearance of fluorescence. By contrast, F&#8722; binding leads to less efficient, and kinetically more homogeneous, fluorescence quenching. Such contrasting effects are rationalized by the differences in the binding behavior of F&#8722; and Cl&#8722; to the protein active site.







Abstract
Glucose oxidase (GOX), a characteristic flavoprotein oxidase with widespread industrial applications, binds fluoride (F&#8722;) and chloride (Cl&#8722;). We investigated binding properties of halide inhibitors of GOX through time&#8208;resolved spectral characterization of flavin&#8208;related photochemical processes and molecular dynamic simulations. Cl&#8722; and F&#8722; bind differently to the protein active site and have substantial but opposite effects on the population and decay of the flavin excited state. Cl&#8722; binds closer to the flavin, whose excited&#8208;state decays in &lt;100&#8197;fs due to anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such interactions appear absent in F&#8722; binding, which, however, significantly increases the active&#8208;site rigidity leading to more homogeneous, picosecond fluorescence decay kinetics. These findings are discussed in relation to the mechanism of halide inhibition of GOX by occupying the accommodation site of catalytic intermediates and increasing the active&#8208;site rigidity.

         <title>The Fluorescent Enzyme Cascade Detects Low Abundance Protein Modifications Suitable for the Assembly of Functionally Annotated Modificatome Databases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deciphering the &#8216;modificatome&#8217;: We introduce fluorescent enzyme cascades which sensitively detect protein modifications and allow their functional assignment using digital pattern libraries.







Abstract
Pathophysiological functions of proteins critically depend on both their chemical composition, including post&#8208;translational modifications, and their three&#8208;dimensional structure, commonly referred to as structure&#8208;activity relationship. Current analytical methods, like capillary electrophoresis or mass spectrometry, suffer from limitations, such as the detection of unexpected modifications at low abundance and their insensitivity to conformational changes. Building on previous enzyme&#8208;based analytical methods, we here introduce a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme cascade (fEC), which can detect diverse chemical and conformational variations in protein samples and assemble them into digital databases. Together with complementary analytical methods an automated fEC analysis established unique modification&#8208;function relationships, which can be expanded to a proteome&#8208;wide scale, i.&#8201;e. a functionally annotated modificatome. The fEC offers diverse applications, including hypersensitive biomarker detection in complex samples.

         <title>Epipolythiodioxopiperazine&#8208;based natural products: building blocks, biosynthesis and biological activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are fungal secondary metabolites that share a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffold built from two amino acids and bridged by a sulfide moiety. Modifications of the core and the amino acid side chains, for example by methylations, acetylations, hydroxylations, prenylations, halogenations, cyclizations, and truncations create the structural diversity of ETPs and contribute to their biological activity. However, the key feature responsible for the bioactivities of ETPs is their sulfide moiety. Over the last years, combinations of genome mining, reverse genetics, metabolomics, biochemistry, and structural biology deciphered principles of ETP production. Sulfurization via glutathione and uncovering of the thiols followed by either oxidation or methylation crystallized as fundamental steps that impact expression of the biosynthesis cluster, toxicity and secretion of the metabolite as well as self&#8208;tolerance of the producer. This article showcases structure and activity of prototype ETPs such as gliotoxin and discusses the current knowledge on the biosynthesis routes of these exceptional natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Type III Polyketide Synthase Specific for Sporulating Negativicutes is Responsible for Alkylpyrone Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genomic analyses indicate that anaerobic bacteria represent a neglected source of natural products. Whereas a limited number of polyketides have been reported from anaerobes, products of type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) have remained unknown. We found a highly conserved biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) comprising genes putatively encoding a type III PKS and a methyltransferase in genomes of the Negativicutes, strictly anaerobic, diderm bacteria. By in vivo and in vitro expression of a type III PKS gene, dquA from the oak&#8208;associated Dendrosporobacter quercicolus in E. coli we show production of long&#8208;chain alkylpyrones. Intriguingly, this BGC is specific for sporulating Sporomusaceae but absent in related Negativicutes that do not sporulate, thus suggesting a physiological role.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Disorazole C1: Exchanging the Oxazole Ring by Thiazole and Influence of Chiral Centers within the Disorazole Core on Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of novel disorazole C1 analogs is described and their biological activity as cytotoxic compounds is reported. Based on our convergent entry to the disorazole core we wish to present a flexible and robust strategy to construct a variety of interesting new analogs. In particular, two regions of the molecules were examined for structural modification: 1. Replacement of the heterocyclic moiety by an exchange of the oxazole ring by a thiazole and 2. Evaluation of the influence of the absolute stereochemistry of the chiral centers of the molecule. Predicated on our flexible strategy we were able to construct all analogs in an efficient way and could perform an exciting SAR (structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship) study to get more insight in the cytotoxic activity influenced by the chiral centers of the disorazole core.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and potential novel epidemic coronaviruses underline the importance of investigating various viral proteins as potential drug targets. The papain&#8208;like protease of coronaviruses has been less explored than other viral proteins; however, its substantive role in viral replication and impact on the host immune response make it a suitable target to study. This review article focuses on the structure and function of the papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, including variants of concern, and compares it to those of other coronaviruses, such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;1 and MERS&#8208;CoV. The protease&#8217;s recognition motif is mirrored in ubiquitin and ISG15, which are important posttranslational modifiers of the antiviral immune response. Inhibitors, including GRL0617 derivatives, and their prospects as potential future antiviral agents are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Microviridin Analogs Containing Functional Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microviridins are a prominent family of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) featuring characteristic lactone and lactam rings. Their unusual cage&#8208;like architecture renders them highly potent serine protease inhibitors of which individual variants specifically inhibit different types of proteases of pharmacological interest. While posttranslational modifications are key for the stability and bioactivity of RiPPs, additional attractive properties can be introduced by functional tags. To date &#8211; although highly desirable &#8211; no method has been reported to incorporate functional tags in microviridin scaffolds or the overarching class of graspetides. In this study, a chemoenzymatic  in vitro  platform is used to introduce functional tags in various microviridin variants yielding biotinylated, dansylated or propargylated congeners. This straightforward approach paves the way for customized protease inhibitors with built&#8208;in functionalities that can help to unravel the still elusive ecological roles and targets of this remarkable class of compounds and to foster applications based on protease inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective acylation of proteins at Gly and Lys in His Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract 

The chemical modification of proteins is of great importance in chemical biology, biotechnology, and for the production of modified biopharmaceuticals, as it enables introduction of fluorophores, biotin, half&#8208;life extending moieties, and more. We developed two methods for using poly&#8208;His sequences to direct the highly selective acylation of proteins, either at the N&#8208;terminus or at a specific Lys residue. For the former, we used an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His  6  segment (Gly&#8208;His tag) that directed acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N  &#945;  &#8208;amine with 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl esters resulting in stable conjugates. Next, we developed the peptide sequences His  n  &#8208;Lys&#8208;His  m  (Lys&#8208;His tags) that direct the acylation of the designated Lys N  &#949;  &#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. Both the Gly&#8208;His and Lys&#8208;His tags maintain the capacity for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatopgrahy. We have demonstrated the robustness of these methods by attaching different moieties such as azides, fluorophores, and biotin to different proteins, including antibodies.</dc:description>

The chemical modification of proteins is of great importance in chemical biology, biotechnology, and for the production of modified biopharmaceuticals, as it enables introduction of fluorophores, biotin, half-life extending moieties, and more. We developed two methods for using poly-His sequences to direct the highly selective acylation of proteins, either at the N-terminus or at a specific Lys residue. For the former, we used an N-terminal Gly-His  6  segment (Gly-His tag) that directed acylation of the N-terminal N  &#945;  -amine with 4-methoxyphenyl esters resulting in stable conjugates. Next, we developed the peptide sequences His  n  -Lys-His  m  (Lys-His tags) that direct the acylation of the designated Lys N  &#949;  -amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. Both the Gly-His and Lys-His tags maintain the capacity for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatopgrahy. We have demonstrated the robustness of these methods by attaching different moieties such as azides, fluorophores, and biotin to different proteins, including antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A hybrid structural method for investigating low molecular weight oligomeric structures of amyloid beta</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spurred in part by the failure of recent therapeutics targeting amyloid b plaques in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), attention is increasingly turning to the oligomeric forms of this peptide that form early in the aggregation process. However, while numerous amyloid b fibril structures have been characterized, primarily by NMR and cryo&#8208;EM, obtaining structural information on the low molecular weight forms of amyloid b that presumably precede and/or seed fibril formation has proved challenging. These transient forms&#160; are heterogeneous, and depend heavily on experimental conditions such as buffer, temperature, concentration, and degree of quiescence during measurement. Here, we present the concept for a new approach to delineating structural features of early&#8208;stage low molecular weight amyloid b oligomers, using a solvent accessibility assay in conjunction with simultaneous fluorescence measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Annonaceous Acetogenin Mimic AA005 Inhibits the Growth of TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 Cells by Altering Cell Energy Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annonaceous acetogenins mimic AA005, disrupts both oxidative respiration and aerobic glycolysis in the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468, thus driving the cell energy crisis and exhibiting antitumor activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a serious health issue for women worldwide and there is still no suitable treatment option. AA005, a structurally simplified mimic of natural Annonaceous acetogenins, presents outstanding properties with impressive cytotoxicity and cell&#8208;type selective actions. The present study was aimed at evaluating the potential of AA005 as a therapeutic agent for TNBC. AA005 potently inhibited the growth of TNBC cells at 50&#8197;nM level. Inspired by the finding of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumor suppressor, the effect of AA005 on aerobic glycolysis was investigated in TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells. A short&#8208;term AA005 exposure markedly suppressed mitochondrial function in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells, thus activating the aerobic glycolysis to lessen the risk of decreased ATP generation in mitochondria. Prolonging the incubation time of AA005 clearly weakened the aerobic glycolysis in the cells. This was in part attributed to the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway inactivation and subsequent declined glucose uptake. As a consequence, the energy supply was completely cut from the two major energy&#8208;producing pathways. Further experiments showed that AA005 resulted in irreversible damage on cell activity including cell cycle and growth, inducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and ultimately leading to cell death. In addition, the in&#8197;vivo therapeutic efficacy of AA005 was proved on 4T1 xenograft tumor mice model. Our data demonstrate that AA005 exhibited a great potential for future clinical applications in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Generation of Photocaged Nanobodies for Intracellular Applications in an Animal Using Genetic Code Expansion and Computationally Guided Protein Engineering
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;activated nanobodies for intracellular use were created using a combination of genetic code expansion and computationally guided engineering of the binding interface. The engineered nanobodies allow optical control of subcellular protein localisation in living Caenorhabditis elegans.







Abstract
Nanobodies are becoming increasingly popular as tools for manipulating and visualising proteins in&#8197;vivo. The ability to control nanobody/antigen interactions using light could provide precise spatiotemporal control over protein function. We develop a general approach to engineer photo&#8208;activatable nanobodies using photocaged amino acids that are introduced into the target binding interface by genetic code expansion. Guided by computational alanine scanning and molecular dynamics simulations, we tune nanobody/target binding affinity to eliminate binding before uncaging. Upon photo&#8208;activation using 365&#8197;nm light, binding is restored. We use this approach to generate improved photocaged variants of two anti&#8208;GFP nanobodies that function robustly when directly expressed in a complex intracellular environment together with their antigen. We apply them to control subcellular protein localisation in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Our approach applies predictions derived from computational modelling directly in a living animal and demonstrates the importance of accounting for in&#8197;vivo effects on protein&#8208;protein interactions.

         <title>Tailored Phenyl Esters Inhibit ClpXP and Attenuate Staphylococcus aureus &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Secretion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibitory activity and stability of phenyl esters for chemical inhibition of the ClpXP&#8208;complex were systemically tailored. The new generation inhibitors show enhanced hydrolytic stability, while retaining inhibitory potency. Furthermore, this inhibition evidently reduces secretion of a major virulence factor (&#945;&#8208;hemolsyin) in Staphylococcus aureus while the inhibitors did not exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity against human and bacterial cells.







Abstract
Novel strategies against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria are urgently needed in order to overcome the current silent pandemic. Manipulation of toxin production in pathogenic species serves as a promising approach to attenuate virulence and prevent infections. In many bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocyotgenes, serine protease ClpXP is a key contributor to virulence and thus represents a prime target for antimicrobial drug discovery. The limited stability of previous electrophilic warheads has prevented a sustained effect of virulence attenuation in bacterial culture. Here, we systematically tailor the stability and inhibitory potency of phenyl ester ClpXP inhibitors by steric shielding of the ester bond and fine&#8208;tuning the phenol leaving group. Out of 17 derivatives, two (MAS&#8208;19 and MAS&#8208;30) inhibited S. aureus ClpP peptidase and ClpXP protease activities by &gt;60&#8201;% at 1&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the novel inhibitors did not exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity against human and bacterial cells. Unlike the first generation phenylester AV170, these molecules attenuated S. aureus virulence markedly and displayed increased stability in aqueous buffer compared to the previous benchmark AV170.

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Functionalized with Fucoidan: a Potential Theranostic Nanotool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small super&#8208;paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO NPs) were functionalized with fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide mimicking glycosaminoglycans, to obtain a potential theranostic nanotool for hepatocellular carcinoma. The USPIO NPs act as vehicle and magnetic label to control fucoidan loading within cells.







Abstract
Fucoidan is a natural sulfated polysaccharide with a large range of biological activities including anticancer and anti&#8208;oxidation activities. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fourth most common aggressive cancer type.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ultra-small super-paramagnetic&lt;/b&gt; iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO NPs) were functionalized with fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide mimicking glycosaminoglycans, to obtain a potential theranostic nanotool for hepatocellular carcinoma. The USPIO NPs act as vehicle and magnetic label to control fucoidan loading within cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucoidan is a natural sulfated polysaccharide with a large range of biological activities including anticancer and anti-oxidation activities. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fourth most common aggressive cancer type. The aim of this study was to investigate the bioactivity of free fucoidan versus its vectorization using nanoparticles (NPs) in human hepatoma cells, Huh-7. Iron oxide NPs were functionalized with fucoidan by a one-step surface complexation. NP cellular uptake was quantified by magnetic measurement at various extracellular iron concentrations. Cell invasion and migration were reduced with NPs while free fucoidan increases these events at low fucoidan concentration (&#8804;0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Concomitantly, a high decrease of reactive oxygen species production related with a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity and an increase of its expression was observed with NPs compared to free fucoidan. A proteomic analysis evidenced that some fucoidan regulated proteins appeared, which were related to protein synthesis, N-glycan processing, and cellular stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study which reveals such activity induced by fucoidan. These results pave the way for USPIO-fucoidan-NPs as potential theranostic nanotools for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Cell&#8208;Free ATP Regeneration Module Based on Non&#8208;Oxidative Glycolysis Using Thermophilic Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP regeneration made simple! We have developed an in&#8197;vitro system for ATP regeneration in a single&#8208;expression strain powered by starch and orthophosphate as the phosphate carrier. This system does not produce harmful byproducts, use costly substrates, or require expression of multiple enzymes. In addition, only heat&#8208;treatment is required for the preparation of this system.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential cofactor for energy&#8208;dependent enzymatic reactions that occur during in&#8197;vitro biochemical conversion. Recently, an enzyme cascade based on non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis, which uses starch and orthophosphate as energy and phosphate sources, respectively, for the regeneration of ATP from adenosine diphosphate, has been developed (Wei et&#8197;al., ChemCatChem 2018, 10, 5597&#8211;5601). However, the 12 enzymes required for this system hampered its practical usability and further testing potential. Here, we addressed this issue by constructing co&#8208;expression vectors for the simultaneous gene expression of the 12 enzymes in a single expression strain. All enzymes were sourced from (hyper)thermophiles, which enabled a one&#8208;step purification via a heat&#8208;treatment process. We showed that the combination of the two enabled the ATP regeneration system to function in a single recombinant Escherichia coli strain. Additionally, this work provides a strategy to rationally design and control proteins expression levels in the co&#8208;expression vectors.

         <title>Tying Up a Loose End: On the Role of the C&#8208;Terminal CCHHRAG Fragment of the Metalloregulator CueR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8208;terminal &#8220;tail&#8221; of CueR does not influence the overall structure of the protein and the structure of the functional metal site but significantly affects the binding affinity for monovalent metal ions, despite being disordered and relatively remote, i.&#8201;e. beyond the second coordination sphere of AgI coordinated at the functional metal binding loop.







Abstract
The transcriptional regulator CueR is activated by the binding of CuI, AgI, or AuI to two cysteinates in a near&#8208;linear fashion. The C&#8208;terminal CCHHRAG sequence in Escherichia coli CueR present potential additional metal binding ligands and here we explore the effect of deleting this fragment on the binding of AgI to CueR. CD spectroscopic and ESI&#8208;MS data indicate that the high AgI&#8208;binding affinity of WT&#8208;CueR is significantly reduced in &#916;7C&#8208;CueR.[111 Ag PAC spectroscopy demonstrates that the WT&#8208;CueR metal site structure (AgS2) is conserved, but less populated in the truncated variant. Thus, the function of the C&#8208;terminal fragment may be to stabilize the two&#8208;coordinate metal site for cognate monovalent metal ions. In a broader perspective this is an example of residues beyond the second coordination sphere affecting metal site physicochemical properties while leaving the structure unperturbed.

         <title>Boosted Productivity in Single&#8208;Tile&#8208;Based DNA Polyhedra Assembly by Simple Cation Replacement</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet efficient strategy for avoiding the concentration&#8208;dependent kinetic trap in DNA self&#8208;assembly is proposed. Through substituting monovalent Na+ for conventional divalent Mg2+, we have successfully achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the concentration reported previously.







Abstract
Cations such as divalent magnesium ion (Mg2+) play an essential role in DNA self&#8208;assembly. However, the strong electrostatic shielding effect of Mg2+ would be disadvantageous in some situations that require relatively weak interactions to allow a highly reversible error&#8208;correcting mechanism in the process of assembly. Herein, by substituting the conventional divalent Mg2+ with monovalent sodium ion (Na+), we have achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the DNA concentrations reported previously. This strategy takes advantage of coexisting counterions and is expected to surmount the major obstacle to potential applications of such DNA nanostructures: large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Myricetin Inhibits &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Aggregation by Delaying the Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase Transition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate amyloid aggregation. We discovered that myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, does not affect the initial formation of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates but dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition in the condensates.







Abstract
The aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) is a critical pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prevention of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation has become a key strategy for treating PD. Recent studies have suggested that &#945;&#8208;Syn undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate nucleation and amyloid formation. Here, we examined the modulation of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation by myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, under the conditions of LLPS. Unexpectedly, neither the initial morphology nor the phase&#8208;separated fraction of &#945;&#8208;Syn was altered by myricetin. However, the dynamics of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates decreased upon myricetin binding. Further studies showed that myricetin dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation in the condensates by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition. In addition, myricetin could disassemble the preformed &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregates matured from the condensates. Together, our study shows that myricetin inhibits &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregation in the condensates by retarding the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition and reveals that &#945;&#8208;Syn phase transition can be targeted to inhibit amyloid aggregation.

         <title>Conjugation of a Toll&#8208;Like Receptor Agonist to Glycans of an HIV Native&#8208;Like Envelope Trimer Preserves Neutralization Epitopes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viral glycoprotein immunogens can be modified by a small molecule adjuvant by chemical attachment of an immune&#8208;potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 followed by transfer to N&#8208;glycans of the glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelop trimer with an agonist of Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8. The modification did not compromise structural integrity and Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies.







Abstract
Small molecule adjuvants are attractive for enhancing broad protection and durability of immune responses elicited by subunit vaccines. Covalent attachment of an adjuvant to an immunogen is particularly attractive because it simultaneously delivers both entities to antigen presenting cells resulting in more efficient immune activation. There is, however, a lack of methods to conjugate small molecule immune potentiators to viral glycoprotein immunogens without compromising epitope integrity. We describe herein a one&#8208;step enzymatic conjugation approach for the covalent attachment of small molecule adjuvants to N&#8208;linked glycans of viral glycoproteins. It involves the attachment of an immune potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 by Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition followed by sialyltransferase&#8208;mediated transfer to N&#8208;glycans of a viral glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelope trimer with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist. The modification did not compromise Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies. Electron microscopy confirmed structural integrity of the modified immunogen.

         <title>Recombinant l&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase with Broad Substrate Spectrum for Co&#8208;substrate Recycling in (S)&#8208;Selective Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolutions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient co&#8208;substrate recycling system consisting of a heterologous expressed and highly active l&#8208;amino acid oxidase combined with a catalase was applied for kinetic resolutions to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;amines in &#969;&#8208;(S)&#8208;transaminase catalyzed reactions. Consequently, catalytic instead of stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;substrate can be applied in preparative scale reactions.







Abstract
Chiral and enantiopure amines can be produced by enantioselective transaminases via kinetic resolution of amine racemates. This transamination reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;substrate. A dual&#8208;enzyme recycling system overcomes this limitation: l&#8208;amino acid oxidases (LAAO) recycle the accumulating co&#8208;product of (S)&#8208;selective transaminases in the kinetic resolution of racemic amines to produce pure (R)&#8208;amines. However, availability of suitable LAAOs is limited. Here we use the heterologously produced, highly active fungal hcLAAO4 with broad substrate spectrum. H2O2 as byproduct of hcLAAO4 is detoxified by a catalase. The final system allows using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of 1&#8197;mol% of the transaminase co&#8208;substrate as well as the initial application of l&#8208;amino acids instead of &#945;&#8208;keto acids. With an optimized protocol, the synthetic potential of this kinetic resolution cascade was proven at the preparative scale (&gt;90&#8197;mg) by the synthesis of highly enantiomerically pure (R)&#8208;methylbenzylamine (&gt;99&#8201;%ee) at complete conversion (50&#8201;%).

         <title>A General Strategy for the Design and Evaluation of Heterobifunctional Tools: Applications to Protein Localization and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linkerology 101: This work presents a quantitative method for the rational design of tools to control protein&#8208;protein interactions. A library of probes based on the Trimethoprim&#8208;HaloTag system was synthesized and evaluated. The top&#8208;performing probe was used to control protein localization to various organelles within a cell and to initiate both local and global phase separation.







Abstract
To mimic the levels of spatiotemporal control that exist in nature, tools for chemically induced dimerization (CID) are employed to manipulate protein&#8208;protein interactions. Although linker composition is known to influence speed and efficiency of heterobifunctional compounds, modeling or in&#8197;vitro experiments are often insufficient to predict optimal linker structure. This can be attributed to the complexity of ternary complex formation and the overlapping factors that impact the effective concentration of probe within the cell, such as efflux and passive permeability. Herein, we synthesize a library of modular chemical tools with varying linker structures and perform quantitative microscopy in live cells to visualize dimerization in real&#8208;time. We use our optimized probe to demonstrate our ability to recruit a protein of interest (POI) to the mitochondria, cell membrane, and nucleus. Finally, we induce and monitor local and global phase separation. We highlight the importance of quantitative approaches to linker optimization for dynamic systems and introduce new, synthetically accessible tools for the rapid control of protein localization.

         <title>Colorimetric High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Prazole Sulfide Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric high&#8208;throughput screening method for the rapid screening of desired variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity was developed based on distinguishing sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones. Using this method, a CbBVMO variant was identified with improved activity and thermostability, and a 71.3&#8201;% increase in catalyzing the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are important biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of chiral sulfoxides, including chiral sulfoxide&#8208;type proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, native BVMOs are not yet suitable for practical application due to their unsatisfactory activity and thermostability. Although protein engineering approaches can help address these issues, few feasible high&#8208;throughput methods are available for the engineering of such enzymes. Herein, a colorimetric detection method to distinguish sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones was developed for prazole sulfide monooxygenases. Directed evolution enabled by this method has identified a prazole sulfide monooxygenase CbBVMO variant with improved activity and thermostability that catalyzes the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide. A 71.3&#8201;% increase in conversion and 6&#8201;&#176;C enhancement in the melting point were achieved compared with the wild&#8208;type enzyme. This new method is feasible for high&#8208;throughput screening of prazole sulfide monooxygenase variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity.

B1CTcu3, an &#945;&#8208;helical peptide identified from the skin secretion of Clinotarsus curtipes exhibited a broad range of antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. It also exhibits anti&#8208;biofilm properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. B1CTcu3 induces pores on the bacterial membrane which leads to the killing of bacteria.







Abstract
A twenty&#8208;two&#8208;residue peptide Brevinin1 Clinotarsus curtipus&#8208;3 (B1CTcu3), identified from the skin secretion of frog Clinotarsus curtipes of the Western Ghats, exhibited a broad range of antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It showed anti&#8208;biofilm activity even at sub&#8208;minimum inhibitory concentration (sub&#8208;MIC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Analysis of the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, confocal images, flow cytometric data and the effect of salt concentration on antibacterial potency suggests that the killing action of the peptide is through the membranolytic process. Single channel electric recording confirmed that the peptide elicited pores on the bacterial cell membrane as it induces a heterogeneous channel in the lipid bilayer. It also showed cytotoxicity against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cell with IC50 of 25&#8197;&#956;M. B1CTcu3 peptide could serve as the template for next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents, particularly against antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria.

         <title>Cover Feature: Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Functionalized with Fucoidan: a Potential Theranostic Nanotool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (ChemBioChem 16/2022)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were functionalized with fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide. NP cellular uptake was quantified by magnetic measurement at various extracellular iron concentrations. Cell invasion and migration were reduced with NPs. Concomitantly, a high decrease of reactive oxygen species production related with a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 activity and an increase of its expression was observed. Proteomic analysis showed that some fucoidan regulated proteins appeared related to protein synthesis, N&#8208;glycan processing, and cellular stress. These results pave the way for USPIO&#8208;fucoidan&#8208;NPs as potential theranostic nanotools for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Geinguenaud et al.

Just as a rocket enables the exploration of space, heterobifunctional tools allow us to probe the mysteries of biology. We have developed a powerful, microscopy&#8208;based assay to optimize the linkers of heterobifunctional tools. This is represented in the cover illustration by a rocket, powered by an optimized linker, setting out from a green, fluorescent planet (GFP) to a planet of interest (POI). We used this tool to induce phase separation, symbolized by stars in the sky. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Zhang, D.&#8197;M. Chenoweth et&#8197;al.

         <title>Towards a Better Understanding of Toxin Biosynthesis in Seaweeds</title>

Pick and mix: In an impressive new report, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of marine toxin domoic acid in the red alga Chondria armata, but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss in this Highlight article the importance of continuing to acquire new data on biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for both diagnostic and metabolic&#8208;engineering purposes.







Abstract
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) represent both ecological and public health hazards in the marine environment. Indeed, some algae can produce metabolites that have negative effects on marine ecosystems and mammals. Kainoid derivatives such as kainic acid (KA) and domoic acid (DA) are considered some of the most toxic metabolites of marine origin biosynthesized by a limited number of micro&#8208; and macroalgae. While recent works have provided the first insights into the biosynthetic route of KA in red algae and DA in diatoms, the DA biosynthetic pathway has remained uncharacterized for red algae. In a recent work, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of DA in the red alga Chondria armata but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss here the importance of pursuing active research in this area to gain insights into secondary biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for diagnostic and metabolic engineering perspectives.

         <title>Antibody&#8208;Recruitment as a Therapeutic Strategy: A Brief History and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibody recruitment to the surface of pathogens or malignant cells can lead to selective clearance or destruction of these unwanted guests by various immune system&#8208;dependent mechanisms. Small molecule, peptide, protein, and polymer&#8208;based antibody&#8208;recruiting technologies have been reported and represent an exciting therapeutic approach. Here, we review seminal and recent contributions to this drug discovery approach.







Abstract
Antibodies are a significant and growing sector within the global pharmaceutical industry. The popularity of antibodies as therapeutics derives from &#8211; at least in part &#8211; evolvable affinity for virtually any disease&#8208;relevant cell surface receptor, as well as unique immunotherapeutic mechanisms of action, including neutralization, antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). While advances in the large&#8208;scale expression and purification of therapeutic antibodies have been made, these remain costly and laborious tasks. Agents that redirect endogenous antibodies to target a pathogen or malignant cell obviate the need for new antibody discovery and production. Chimeric antibody&#8208;recruiting technologies consist of a target cell surface receptor binding domain, and an endogenous antibody&#8208;binding domain. By design, these agents bring endogenous antibodies to the surface of a target pathogen or diseased cell, which can result in targeted cytotoxicity by antibody&#8208;dependent mechanisms. This review highlights seminal contributions and recent advances in this growing and important therapeutic field.

         <title>Click Bioconjugation: Modifying Proteins Using Click&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 16, August 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioconjugation deals with the chemical modification of proteins. For the establishment of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and other bioconjugates, many click&#8208;type reactions have been applied, providing novel drugs that have entered clinical phases and also the market over recent years. Recent developments to broaden the chemical toolbox to meet the challenge of selective, bioorthogonal modification of biomolecules are showcasing new ways to apply novel click chemistry in the bioconjugation context.







Abstract
Bioconjugation deals with the chemical modification of proteins. The reactions used exploit either the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the biomolecule or introduce functionalities that can then be subsequently reacted without interfering with other functional groups of the biological entity. Perfectly selective, high yielding chemical transformations are needed that can be run in aqueous environment under mild pH conditions.

     alt="Click Bioconjugation: Modifying Proteins Using Click-Like Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bioconjugation&lt;/b&gt; deals with the chemical modification of proteins. For the establishment of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and other bioconjugates, many click-type reactions have been applied, providing novel drugs that have entered clinical phases and also the market over recent years. Recent developments to broaden the chemical toolbox to meet the challenge of selective, bioorthogonal modification of biomolecules are showcasing new ways to apply novel click chemistry in the bioconjugation context.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioconjugation deals with the chemical modification of proteins. The reactions used exploit either the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the biomolecule or introduce functionalities that can then be subsequently reacted without interfering with other functional groups of the biological entity. Perfectly selective, high yielding chemical transformations are needed that can be run in aqueous environment under mild pH conditions. Requirements that have an obvious overlap with the definition of click chemistry. This review shows a selection of successfully applied click-type reactions in bioconjugation as well as some recent developments to broaden the chemical toolbox to meet the challenge of selective, bioorthogonal modification of biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Glycan Engineering: Constructing the N&#8208;GlcNAc Stump</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Glycosylation is often essential for the structure and function of proteins. However, N&#8208;glycosylated proteins from nature sources exhibit considerable heterogeneity in the appended oligosaccharides, bringing daunting challenges to the corresponding basic research and therapeutic applications. To address this issue, various synthetic, enzymatic, and chemoenzymatic approaches have been elegantly designed. Utilizing the endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation method, the single N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (N&#8208;GlcNAc) stumps on proteins can be converted to various forms of homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylation, thereby becoming the focus of many research efforts. In this concept, we would like to briefly introduce the methods that allow the generation of N&#8208;GlcNAc and its close analogues on proteins and peptides, and highlight the current challenges and opportunities the scientific communities are facing.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic labeling to visualize intercellular contacts using lipidated sortase A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to label intercellular contact have attracted attention because of their potential in cell biological and medical applications for the analysis of intercellular communications. In this study, a simple and versatile method for chemoenzymatic labeling of intercellularly contacting cells is demonstrated using a cell&#8208;surface anchoring reagent of a poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid conjugate. The surfaces of each cell in the cell pairs of interest were decorated with sortase A (SrtA) and triglycine peptide that were lipidated with PEG&#8208;lipid. In the mixture of the two cell populations, the triglycine&#8208;modified cells were enzymatically labeled with a fluorescent labeling reagent when in contact with SrtA&#8208;modified cells on a substrate. The selective labeling of the contacting cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy. The method is a promising tool for selective visualization of intercellularly contacting cells in cell mixtures for cell&#8211;cell communication analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;based design of the first GlnA4&#8208;specific inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Glutamylamine synthetases are an important class of enzymes that play a key role in glutamate&#8208;based metabolism. Methionine sulfoximine (MSO) is a well established inhibitor for the archetypal glutamine synthetase (GS) but inhibitors for most GS&#8208;like enzymes are unknown. Assuming a conserved catalytic mechanism for GS and GS&#8208;like enzymes, we explored if subtype&#8208;selective inhibitors can be obtained by merging MSO with the cognate substrates of the respective GS&#8208;like enzymes. Using GlnA4 Sc from S. coelicolor, an enzyme recently shown to produce &#947;&#8208;glutamylenthanolamine, we demonstrate that MSO can be reengineered in a straight&#8208;forward fashion into potent and selective GlnA4 Sc inhibitors. Linkage chemistry as well as linker length between the MSO moiety and the terminal hydroxyl group derived from ethanolamine were in agreement with the postulated phosphorylated catalytic intermediate. The best GlnA4 inhibitor 7b potently blocked S. coelicolor growth in the presence of ethanolamine as the sole nitrogen source. Our results provide the first GlnA4 Sc &#8208;specific inhibitors and suggest a genereal strategy to develop mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors for GS&#8208;like enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavable Linker Incorporation into a Synthetic Dye&#8208;Nanobody&#8208;Fluorescent Protein Assembly: FRET, FLIM and STED Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugate and cleave? No paradox: compare! The target protein fused with a FRET donor was labeled with a nanobody bearing a FRET acceptor (synthetic dye). Then the acceptor was cleaved off, and the fluorescence outputs before and after cleavage were compared. Here are the news from FRET, FLIM and STED microscopy involving an anti&#8208;GFP nanobody bound with a fluorophore via a disulfide bond.







Abstract
A bright and photostable fluorescent dye with a disulfide (S&#8722;S) linker and maleimide group (Rho594&#8208;S2&#8208;mal), as cleavable and reactive sites, was synthesized and conjugated with anti&#8208;GFP nanobodies (NB). The binding of EGFP (FRET donor) with anti&#8208;GFP NB labeled with one or two Rho594&#8208;S2&#8208;mal residues was studied in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. The linker was cleaved with dithiothreitol recovering the donor (FP) signal. The bioconjugates (FP&#8208;NB&#8208;dye) were applied in FRET&#8208;FLIM assays, confocal imaging, and superresolution STED microscopy.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Genetically Encoded Lysine Post&#8208;Translational Modifications with Lactylation, &#946;&#8208;Hydroxybutyrylation and Lipoylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins with site&#8208;specific lysine lactylation, &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrylation and lipoylation were efficiently expressed in E.&#8197;coli and mammalian cells using genetic code expansion, and subsequently applied to the examination of the deacylase activities of mammalian sirtuins.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) occurring on lysine residues, especially diverse forms of acylations, have seen rapid growth over the past two decades. Among them, lactylation and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrylation of lysine side&#8208;chains are newly identified histone marks and their implications in physiology and diseases have aroused broad research interest. Meanwhile, lysine lipoylation is highly conserved in diverse organisms and well known for its pivotal role in central metabolic pathways. Recent findings in the proteomic profiling of protein lipoylation have nonetheless suggested a pressing need for an extensive investigation. For both basic and applied research, it is necessary to prepare PTM&#8208;bearing proteins particularly in a site&#8208;specific manner. Herein, we use genetic code expansion to site&#8208;specifically generate these lysine PTMs, including lactylation, &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrylation and lipoylation in proteins in E.&#8197;coli and mammalian cells. Notably, using strategies including activity&#8208;based selection, screening and rational design, unique pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase variants were successfully evolved for each of the three non&#8208;canonical amino acids, which enabled efficient production of recombinant proteins. Through encoding these ncAAs, we examined the deacylase activities of mammalian sirtuins to these modifications, and importantly we unfold the lipoamidase activity of several sirtuins.

         <title>DNA stability in biodosimetry, pharmacy and DNA based datastorage: Optimal storage and handling conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA long&#8208;term stability and integrity is of importance for applications in DNA based bio&#8208;dosimetry, data&#8208;storage, pharmaceutical quality&#8208;control, donor insemination and DNA based functional nanomaterials. Standard protocols for these applications involve repeated freeze&#8208;thaw cycles of the DNA, which can cause detrimental damage to the nucleobases, as well as the sugar&#8208;phosphate backbone and therefore the whole molecule. Throughout the literature three hypotheses can be found about the underlying mechanisms occurring during freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. It is hypothesized that DNA single&#8208;strand breaks during freezing can be induced by mechanical stress leading to shearing of the DNA molecule, by acidic pH causing damage through depurination and beta elimination or by the presence of metal ions catalyzing oxidative damage via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we test these hypotheses under well defined conditions with plasmid DNA pUC19 in high&#8208;purity buffer (1xPBS) at physiological salt and pH7.4 conditions, under pH6 and in the presence of metal ions in combination with the radical scavengers DMSO and Ectoine. The results show for the 2686bp long plasmid DNA, that neither mechanical stress, nor pH6 lead to degradation during repeated freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. In contrast, the presence of metal ions (Fe2+) leads to degradation of DNA via the production of radical species.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR Observation of Sulfhydryl Signals in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Aids Structural Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 68&#8208;kDa homodimeric 3C&#8208;like protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, M  pro  (3CL  pro  /Nsp5), is a key antiviral drug target. NMR spectroscopy of this large system proved challenging and resonance assignments have remained incomplete. Here we present the near&#8208;complete (&gt;97%) backbone assignments of a C145A variant of M  pro  (M  pro  C145A  ) both with, and without, the N&#8208;terminal auto&#8208;cleavage substrate sequence, in its native homodimeric state. We also present SILLY, a simple yet effective pseudo&#8208;3D NMR experiment that utilizes NOEs to identify interactions between Cys&#8208;thiol or aliphatic protons, and their spatially proximate backbone amides in a perdeuterated protein background. High protection against hydrogen exchange is observed for 10 of the 11 thiol groups in M  pro  C145A  , even those that are partially accessible to solvent. A combination of SILLY methods and high&#8208;resolution triple&#8208;resonance NMR experiments reveals site&#8208;specific interactions between M  pro  , its substrate peptides, and other ligands, which present opportunities for competitive binding studies in future drug design efforts.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prebiotically plausible single&#8208;chain amphiphiles are enticing as model protocellular compartments to study the emergence of cellular life owing to their self&#8208;assembling properties. Here, we investigated the self&#8208;assembly behaviour of mono&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl phosphate (DDP) and mixed systems of DDP with 1&#8208;dodecanol (DDOH) at varying pH conditions. Membranes composed of DDP showed pH&#8208;responsive vesicle formation in a wide range of pH with a low critical bilayer concentration (CBC). Further, the addition of DDOH to DDP membrane system enhanced vesicle formation and stability in alkaline pH regimes. We also compared the high&#8208;temperature behaviour of DDP and DDP:DDOH membranes with conventional fatty acid membranes. Both, DDP and DDP:DDOH mixed membranes possess packing that is similar to decanoic acid membrane. However, the micropolarity of these systems are similar to phospholipid membranes. Finally, the pH&#8208;dependent modulation of different phospholipid membranes doped with DDP was also demonstrated to engineer tuneable membranes with potential translational implications.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring DNA contains four canonical bases, forming two Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs (adenine&#8208;thymine, guanine&#8208;cytosine). Efforts over the past decades have led to the development of several unnatural base pairs, enabling the synthesis of unnatural DNA with an expanded genetic alphabet. The engineering of organisms capable of  de novo  biosynthesis of unnatural DNA would have significant technological and philosophical implications, but remains a challenge. Here we report the enzymatic conversion of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (dXMP) into deoxyisoguanosine monophosphate (dBMP), a precursor of the unnatural isoguanine&#8208;isocytosine base pair. The reaction is catalyzed by the bacteriophage enzyme PurZ and bacterial PurB, and is a key addition to the toolbox for  de novo  biosynthesis of unnatural DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Antibody&#8208;Specific Epitope Prediction Using AlphaFold and AbAdapt
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of AlphaFold2 with AbAdapt (AbAdapt&#8208;AF) resulted in improved docking, paratope and epitope prediction compared with AbAdapt alone.







Abstract
Antibodies recognize their cognate antigens with high affinity and specificity, but the prediction of binding sites on the antigen (epitope) corresponding to a specific antibody remains a challenging problem. To address this problem, we developed AbAdapt, a pipeline that integrates antibody and antigen structural modeling with rigid docking in order to derive antibody&#8208;antigen specific features for epitope prediction. In this study, we systematically assessed the impact of integrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art protein modeling method AlphaFold with the AbAdapt pipeline. By incorporating more accurate antibody models, we observed improvement in docking, paratope prediction, and prediction of antibody&#8208;specific epitopes. We further applied AbAdapt&#8208;AF in an anti&#8208;receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody complex benchmark and found AbAdapt&#8208;AF outperformed three alternative docking methods. Also, AbAdapt&#8208;AF demonstrated higher epitope prediction accuracy than other tested epitope prediction tools in the anti&#8208;RBD antibody complex benchmark. We anticipate that AbAdapt&#8208;AF will facilitate prediction of antigen&#8208;antibody interactions in a wide range of applications.

Abstract
Pulmonary artery vascular endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the occurrence and progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling (PVR). To address this, aberrantly expressed non&#8208;coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are excellent therapeutic targets in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). Here, we discovered and validated the overexpression of miRNA&#8208;152 in HPAECs under hypoxia and its role in endothelial cell dysfunction. We constructed a framework nucleic acid nanostructure that harbors six protruding single&#8208;stranded DNA segments that can fully hybridize with miRNA&#8208;152 (DNT&#8208;152). DNT&#8208;152 was efficiently taken up by HPAECs with increasing time and concentration; it markedly induced apoptosis, and inhibited HPAEC growth under hypoxic conditions. Mechanistically, DNT&#8208;152 silenced miRNA&#8208;152 expression and upregulated its target gene Meox2, which subsequently inhibited the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. These results indicate that miRNA&#8208;152 in HPAECs may be an excellent therapeutic target against PVR, and that framework nucleic acids with carefully designed sequences are promising nanomedicines for noncancerous cells and diseases.

         <title>Initial recognition and attachment of the Zika virus to host cells: A molecular dynamics and quantum interaction approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted to humans from the bites of  Aedes Aegypti  and  Aedes Albopictus  mosquitoes produces Zika fever and neurodegenerative disorders that despite affecting millions of people, most recently in Africa and the Americas, has been declared a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. In this work, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations followed by rigorous analysis of the intermolecular interactions reveal crucial aspects of the initial virus&#183;&#183;&#183;cell molecular recognition and attachment, events that trigger the infectious cycle. Previous experimental studies have shown that Dermatan Sulphate (DS) and Chondroitin Sulphate A (CSA), two glycosaminoglycans which are actually epimers to each other and that are structural constituents of receptors expressed in cell membranes, are the preferred anchorage sites, with a marked preference for DS. Our calculations rationalize this preference from a molecular perspective as follows: when free of the virus, DS has one sulfate group that does not participate in intramolecular strong hydrogen bonds, thus, it is readily available to interact with the envelope protein of the virus (Zika&#8211;E), then, after formation of the complexes, Zika&#8211;E&#183;&#183;&#183;DS exhibits ten strong salt brides connecting the two fragments against only six salt bridges and two hydrogen bonds in Zika&#8211;E&#183;&#183;&#183;CSA.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;assembly modification of protein cages by Ubc9&#8208;mediated&#160;lysine acylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although viruses have been successfully repurposed as&#160;vaccines, antibiotics, and anticancer therapeutics, they also raise&#160;concerns regarding genome integration and immunogenicity. Viruslike&#160;particles and non&#8208;viral protein cages represent a potentially safer&#160;alternative but often lack desired functionality. Here, we investigated
the utility of a new enzymatic bioconjugation method, called lysine&#160;acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE), to chemoenzymatically&#160;modify protein cages. We equipped two structurally distinct protein&#160;capsules with a LACE&#8208;reactive peptide tag and demonstrated their&#160;modification with diverse ligands. This modular approach combines
the advantages of chemical conjugation and genetic fusion and allows&#160;for site&#8208;specific modification with recombinant proteins as well as&#160;synthetic peptides with facile control of the extent of labeling. This&#160;strategy has the potential to fine&#8208;tune protein containers of different&#160;shape and size, to provide them with new properties that go beyond
their biologically native functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitope fine mapping by mass spectrometry: Investigations of immune complexes consisting of monoclonal anti&#8208;HpTGEKP antibody and zinc finger protein linker phospho&#8208;hexapeptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate formation of antibody &#8211; antigen complexes has been relied on in both, multitudes of scientific projects and ample therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Mass spectrometrically&#8208;determined dissociation behavior of immune complexes with the antiHpTGEKP antibody revealed that the ten most frequently occur&#173;ring phospho&#8208;hexapeptide linker sequences from C2H2 zinc finger proteins could be divided into two classes: orthodox binders, where strong non&#8208;covalent interactions developed as anticipated, and unorthodox binders with deviating structures and weaker binding. Phosphorylation of threonine was compulsory for antibody binding in an orthodox manner. Gas phase dissociation energy determinations of seven C2H2 zinc finger protein linker phospho&#8208;hexapeptides with orthodox binding properties revealed a bipolar binding motif of the antibody&#180;s paratope. Epitope peptides, which in addition to the negatively charged phospho&#8208;threonin residue were C&#8208;terminally flanked by positively charged residues provided stronger binding, i.e. dissociation was endothermic, than peptides with acidic amino acid residues at these positions, for which dissociation was exothermic.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Strategies of Enzyme Activity Regulation for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise enzyme activity regulation brings biocatalysis significantly closer to mimicking the physiological control mechanisms for treating diseases. This review provides a discussion and understanding of the mechanisms and approaches of on&#8208;demand enzyme activity control (including reversible and irreversible regulation) and prospective biomedical applications.







Abstract
Enzymes are important macromolecular biocatalysts that accelerate chemical and biochemical reactions in living organisms. Most human diseases are related to alterations in enzyme activity. Moreover, enzymes are potential therapeutic tools for treating different diseases, such as cancer, infections, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Precise remote enzyme activity regulation provides new opportunities to combat diseases. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of enzyme activity regulation, including reversible and irreversible regulation. It also discusses the mechanisms and approaches for on&#8208;demand control of these activities. Furthermore, a range of stimulus&#8208;responsive inhibitors, polymers, and nanoparticles for regulating enzyme activity and their prospective biomedical applications are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives on enzyme activity regulation are discussed.

         <title>AIEgens Based on Anion&#8722;&#960;+ Interactions: Design, Synthesis, Photophysical Properties, and their Applications in Material Science and Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of novel AIEGens, has generally been facilitated by disrupting the possibility of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The recent literature describes a novel strategy to design AIEGens by introducing anion&#8722;&#960;  +  interactions to prevent the detrimental &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking. This new strategy provides access to intrinsically charged AIEgens whose photophysical properties can be tuned either by incorporating different substituents on the &#960;&#8208;molecular scaffold to modulate the acidity for tuning the interaction energy between a &#960;&#8208;acceptor and counter&#8208;anions. This concept article provides a brief overview of the field, focusing on the synthesis of AIEGens, their photophysical properties, crystallography studies and their applications in live cell fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphoenolpyruvate mutase&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;P bond formation: mechanistic ambiguities and opportunities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonates are produced across all domains of life and used widely in medicine and agriculture. Biosynthesis almost universally originates from the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate mutase (Ppm), EC 5.4.2.9, which catalyzes O&#8208;P bond cleavage in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and forms a high energy C&#8208;P bond in phosphonopyruvate (PnPy). Mechanistic scrutiny of this unusual intramolecular O&#8208;to&#8208;C phosphoryl transfer began with the discovery of Ppm in 1988 and concluded in 2008 with computational evidence supporting a concerted phosphoryl transfer via a dissociative metaphosphatelike transition state. This mechanism deviates from the standard &#8216;in&#8208;line attack&#8217; paradigm for enzymatic phosphoryl transfer that typically involves a phosphoryl&#8208;enzyme intermediate, but definitive evidence is sparse. Here we review the experimental evidence leading to our current mechanistic understanding and highlight the roles of previously underappreciated conserved active site residues. We then identify remaining opportunities to evaluate overlooked residues and unexamined substrates/inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Treatment of host cell with Pentachloropseudilin (PClP) impaired Trypanosoma cruzi invasion, probably by decreasing lysosome migration to the entry site of the parasite. PClP impaired fundamental processes necessary for a successful T.&#8197;cruzi infection.







Abstract
Pentachloropseudilin (PClP) is a reversible and allosteric inhibitor of type&#8197;1 myosin. Here, we addressed the impact of PClP treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi and mammalian host cell on the parasite migration, cell adhesion and invasion. We observed that PClP was not toxic to either T.&#8197;cruzi or host cell. Moreover, treatment of T.&#8197;cruzi with PClP inhabited parasite motility, host cell adhesion and invasion. Treatment of host cell with PClP also impaired parasite invasion probably by decreasing lysosome migration to the entry site of the parasite. Therefore, PClP treatment impaired fundamental processes necessary for a successful T.&#8197;cruzi infection.

         <title>Synthesis of a Peptidoyl RNA Hairpin via a Combination of Solid&#8208;Phase and Template&#8208;Directed Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic access to peptidoyl RNA, where a peptide segment is doubly linked to RNA strands, is described. Peptidoyl RNAs are a fascinating species that may have played a role in the origin of translation.







Abstract
Peptidoyl RNAs are the products of ribosome&#8208;free, single&#8208;nucleotide translation. They contain a peptide in the backbone of the oligoribonucleotide and are interesting from a synthetic and a bioorganic point of view. A synthesis of a stabilized version of peptidoyl RNA, with an amide bond between the C&#8208;terminus of a peptide and a 3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;dideoxynucleoside in the RNA chain was developed. The preferred synthetic route used an N&#8208;Teoc&#8208;protected aminonucleoside support and involved a solution&#8208;phase coupling of the amino&#8208;terminal oligonucleotide to a dipeptido dinucleotide. Exploratory UV&#8208;melting and NMR analysis of the hairpin 5&#8242;&#8208;UUGGCGAAAGCdC&#8208;LeuLeu&#8208;AA&#8208;3&#8242; indicated that the peptide&#8208;linked RNA segments do not fold in a cooperative fashion. The synthetic access to doubly RNA&#8208;linked peptides on a scale sufficient for structural biology opens the door to the exploration of their structural and biochemical properties.

         <title>FRET&#8208;based cathepsin probes for simultaneous detection of cathepsin B and D activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent cathepsin probes were prepared by modification of peptidic substrates for cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin D (CTSD) with FRET pairs. Fluorophores with distinguishable emission characteristics were applied to CTSB and CTSD probes with their appropriate quenchers to simultaneously monitor the activity of CTSB and/or CTSD. Conjugation of both the CTSB and CTSD probes with short single&#8208;stranded DNA drastically increased their reactivity to cathepsins over the parent probes possibly by improving their solubility. The activity of CTSB and CTSD were simultaneously detected by using these orthogonal FRET&#8208;based cathepsin probes.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine ligands are coordinated to [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Ru(maleonitriledithiolate)] to obtain ruthenium(II) complexes with different hydrophilicities. Characterisation and evaluation of the in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity towards two ovarian, one non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer cell lines and one normal prostate cell line are presented. A mechanism of action based on reactive oxygen species production leading to apoptosis is suggested. In vivo evaluation suggests some evidence of tumour growth delay.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterisation, and evaluation of the in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity of five maleonitriledithiolate&#8208;based ruthenium metal complexes bearing various phosphine ligands towards two ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780 and A2780cisR), one non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer cell line (H460) and one normal prostate cell line (PNT2) are presented herein. These 18&#8208;electron complexes were designed with four water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands to increase the water&#8208;solubility character of the corresponding electron&#8208;deficient ruthenium complex which showed great in&#8197;vitro promises, and triphenylphosphine for comparison. The complexes with triphenylphosphine&#8208;3,3&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;trisulfonic acid and triphenylphosphine present similar cytotoxicity compared to the 16&#8208;electron precursor, with equal cytotoxicity to both A2780 and A2780cisR. Hints at the mechanism of action suggest an apoptotic pathway based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. No toxicity was observed in preliminary in&#8197;vivo pilot studies for these two complexes in subcutaneous A2780 and A2780cisR xenograft models, with some evidence of tumour growth delay.

         <title>Regulating Spatial Localization and Reactivity Biasness of DNAzymes by Metal Ions and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;equilibrium sensing and taxis of catalytically active biocolloids is crucial for understanding physiological processes and designing artificial nano&#8208; and microrobotic systems. We have demonstrated that the localization of a G&#8208;quadruplex based DNAzyme is biased to a zone where it shows higher peroxidase activity (lively area). The image shows how by diminishing the effect of inhibitors (Hg2+, symbolized by Halloween ghosts) by arresting them with thymidine&#8208;containing oligonucleotides, the activity of DNAzymes can be retained with concurrent migration from the catalytically inhibited region (deadly area). More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Maiti et&#8197;al.

         <title>Bioconjugation Strategies for Tobacco Mild Green Mosaic Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the plant virus nanoparticle TMGMV, we systematically assessed which amino acids are solvent exposed and addressable by bioconjugation strategies. We determined that glutamic acids on the exterior and interior surfaces, tyrosines on the exterior surface as well as the exterior and solvent&#8208;exposed N&#8208;terminus are reactive but to varying degrees (Tyr&gt;Glu&gt;N&#8208;term). Bioconjugation reactions and proteomics paired with structural analysis of TMGMV provided rationale for the underlying reactivity of target sites. A deeper understanding of the chemical properties of TMGMV further enables its functionalization and use as a multifunctional nanocarrier platform for applications in medicine and precision farming.







Abstract
Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) is a plant virus closely related to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), sharing many of its structural and chemical features. These rod&#8208;shaped viruses, comprised of 2130 identical coat protein subunits, have been utilized as nanotechnological platforms for a myriad of applications, ranging from drug delivery to precision agriculture. This versatility for functionalization is due to their chemically active external and internal surfaces. While both viruses are similar, they do exhibit some key differences in their surface chemistry, suggesting the reactive residue distribution on TMGMV should not overlap with TMV. In this work, we focused on the establishment and refinement of chemical bioconjugation strategies to load molecules into or onto TMGMV for targeted delivery. A combination of NHS, EDC, and diazo coupling reactions in combination with click chemistry were used to modify the N&#8208;terminus, glutamic/aspartic acid residues, and tyrosines in TMGMV. We report loading with over 600 moieties per TMGMV via diazo&#8208;coupling, which is a &gt;3&#8208;fold increase compared to previous studies. We also report that cargo can be loaded to the solvent&#8208;exposed N&#8208;terminus and carboxylates on the exterior/interior surfaces. Mass spectrometry revealed the most reactive sites to be Y12 and Y72, both tyrosine side chains are located on the exterior surface. For the carboxylates, interior E106 (66.53&#8201;%) was the most reactive for EDC&#8208;propargylamine coupled reactions, with the exterior E145 accounting for &gt;15&#8201;% reactivity, overturning previous assumptions that only interior glutamic acid residues are accessible. A deeper understanding of the chemical properties of TMGMV further enables its functionalization and use as a multifunctional nanocarrier platform for applications in medicine and precision farming.

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Triggered Bioorthogonal Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene&#8208;Caged Phenols Using a Minimal Self&#8208;Immolative Linker Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond&#8208;cleavage reactions triggered by bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation have emerged as strategies to chemically control the function of (bio)molecules and achieve activation of prodrugs in living systems. While most of these approaches make use of caged amines, current methods for the release of phenols are limited by unfavorable reaction kinetics or insufficient stability of the Tz&#8208;responsive reactants. To address this issue, we have implemented a self&#8208;immolative linker that enables the connection of cleavable  trans  &#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and phenols via carbamate linkages. Based on detailed investigation of the reaction mechanism with several Tz, revealing up to 96% elimination after 2 hours, we have developed a TCO&#8208;caged prodrug with 750&#8208;fold reduced cytotoxicity compared to the parent drug and achieved in situ activation upon Tz/TCO click&#8208;to&#8208;release.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Proteins Modulation in Live Cells with Small Molecules and Light</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinctive small&#8208;molecule strategies for spatiotemporal modulation of endogenous proteins in live cells are discussed, including decaging of small molecules by photolysis, visible&#8208;light photocatalytic releasing of small molecules, and small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging, which together provide powerful chemical biology tool kits with potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Protein modulation by light illumination enables the investigation of biological function in high spatiotemporal precision. Compared to genetic methods, the small molecule approach is uniquely suited for modulating endogenous proteins. Endogenous protein modulation in live cells with small molecules and light has recently advanced on three distinctive frontiers: i) the infrared&#8208;light&#8208;induced or localized decaging of small molecules by photolysis, ii) the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic releasing of small molecules, and iii) the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging for photomodulation of proteins. Together, these methods provide powerful chemical biology tool kits for spatiotemporal modulation of endogenous proteins with potential therapeutic applications. This Concept article aims to inspire organic chemists and chemical biologists to delve into this burgeoning endogenous protein modulation field for new biological discoveries.

         <title>Opportunities and Challenges to Profile mRNA Modifications in Escherichia&#8197;coli
</title>

         <dc:description>
mRNA methylation is an important regulator in eukaryotes but has not been studied in depth in prokaryotes. In this study, we compared size&#8208;dependent separation by electrophoresis and rRNA depletion for enrichment of Escherichia coli mRNA and quantitatively analyzed modified nucleosides in the different RNA types.







Abstract
mRNA methylation is an important regulator of many physiological processes in eukaryotes but has not been studied in depth in prokaryotes. Working with bacterial mRNA is challenging because it lacks a poly(A)&#8208;tail. However, methods for detecting RNA modifications, both sequencing and mass spectrometry, rely on efficient preparation of mRNA. Here, we compared size&#8208;dependent separation by electrophoresis and rRNA depletion for enrichment of Escherichia&#8197;coli mRNA. The purification success was monitored by qRT&#8208;PCR and RNA sequencing. Neither method allowed complete removal of rRNA. Nevertheless, we were able to quantitatively analyze several modified nucleosides in the different RNA types. We found evidence for stress dependent RNA modification reprofiling in rRNA, but also several modified nucleosides in the mRNA enriched fractions showed significant changes.

         <title>Peroxidase Activity of Myoglobin Variants Reconstituted with Artificial Cofactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the peroxidase activity of myoglobin, the effect of artificial cofactors (metal centre and the porphyrin ligand) was investigated. Twelve artificial cofactors were reconstituted with the myoglobin scaffold and FeCe6&#8208;Mb was identified to have 3&#8197;times improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Myoglobin (Mb) can react with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form a highly active intermediate compound and catalyse oxidation reactions. To enhance this activity, known as pseudo&#8208;peroxidase activity, previous studies have focused on the modification of key amino acid residues of Mb or the heme cofactor. In this work, the Mb scaffold (apo&#8208;Mb) was systematically reconstituted with a set of cofactors based on six metal ions and two ligands. These Mb variants were fully characterised by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and native mass spectrometry (nMS). The steady&#8208;state kinetics of guaiacol oxidation and 2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenol (TCP) dehalogenation catalysed by Mb variants were determined. Mb variants with iron chlorin e6 (Fe&#8722;Ce6) and manganese chlorin e6 (Mn&#8722;Ce6) cofactors were found to have improved catalytic efficiency for both guaiacol and TCP substrates in comparison with wild&#8208;type Mb, i.&#8201;e. Fe&#8208;protoporphyrin IX&#8208;Mb. Furthermore, the selected cofactors were incorporated into the scaffold of a Mb mutant, swMb H64D. Enhanced peroxidase activity for both substrates were found via the reconstitution of Fe&#8722;Ce6 into the mutant scaffold.

         <title>Applications and Limitations of Oxime&#8208;Linked &#8220;Split PROTACs&#8221;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activity of a proteolysis targeting chimera is highly dependent on the length and nature of the linker connecting the two component ligands. We explore the utility of using an oxime ligation to rapidly examine all the activity of &#8220;split PROTACs&#8221; created from collections of aldehyde&#8208; and alkoxyamine&#8208;functionalized pieces. Advantages and limitations of this approach are discussed.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras are of keen interest as probe molecules and drug leads. Their activity is highly sensitive to the length and nature of the linker connecting the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase (E3 Ubl) and target protein (TP) ligands, which therefore requires tedious optimization. The creation of &#8220;split PROTACs&#8221; from E3 Ubl and TP ligands modified with residues suitable for them to couple when simply mixed together would allow various combinations to be assessed in a combinatorial fashion, thus greatly easing the workload relative to a one&#8208;by&#8208;one synthesis of many different PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras). We explore oxime chemistry here for this purpose. We show that PROTAC assembly occurs efficiently when the components are mixed at a high concentration, then added to cells. However, in&#8197;situ coupling of the TP and E3 Ubl ligands is inefficient when these units are added to cells at lower concentrations.

         <title>Determination of 5&#8208;Formyluracil via Oxime&#8208;Based Nucleotide&#8208;Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After its reaction with 5&#8208;formyluracil, a small chemical molecule, 2&#8208;(aminooxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide, was used to regulate activities of DNA polymerase. Then, the content of 5&#8208;formyluracil sites in DNA samples was detected by isothermal amplification strategy. According to the calculation of experimental data, 14.7 5&#8208;formyluracil components per 106 nucleotides per Gy were obtained in the radiation process.







Abstract
2&#8208;(Aminooxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide was synthesized, and its ability to regulate activities of DNA polymerase was tested. In addition, we used the isothermal amplification technology to detect the content of 5&#8208;formyluracil sites in irradiated genomic DNA, which confirmed its capability for the detection of 5&#8208;formyluracil content in general samples. This study presents the first example of the determination of 5fU based on coordination chemistry.

         <title>New Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Phycobiliproteins with Excellent Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monomeric far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent phycobiliproteins, termed BDFPs, show excellent photostability with extreme brightness in mammalian cells. Most BDFPs among them are small monomers (15&#8764;17&#8197;kDa). These excellent BDFPs can fuse with various proteins in mammalian cells and have been successfully used in super&#8208;resolution imaging.







Abstract
Far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins can be used as fluorescence biomarkers in the region of maximal transmission of most tissues and facilitate multiplexing. Recently, we reported the generation and properties of far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent phycobiliproteins, termed BeiDou Fluorescent Proteins (BDFPs), which can covalently bind the more readily accessible biliverdin. Far&#8208;red BDFPs maximally fluoresce at &#8764;670&#8197;nm, while near&#8208;infrared BDFPs fluoresce at &#8764;710&#8197;nm. In this work, we molecularly evolved BDFPs as follows: (a) mutations L58Q, S68R and M81K of BDFPs, which can maximally enhance the effective brightness in&#8197;vivo by 350&#8201;%; (b) minimization and monomerization of far&#8208;red BDFPs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and near&#8208;infrared BDFPs 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. These newly developed BDFPs are remarkably brighter than the formerly reported far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins. Their advantages are demonstrated by biolabeling in mammalian cells using super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Menaquinone in E.&#8197;coli: Identification of an Elusive Isomer of SEPHCHC</title>

Elusive isomer: The shikimate pathway has been studied over decades, but the metabolite iso&#8208;SEPHCHC remained hidden until now.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of menaquinone in bacteria, the thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme MenD catalyzes the decarboxylative carboligation of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate and isochorismate to (1R,2S,5S,6S)&#8208;2&#8208;succinyl&#8208;5&#8208;enolpyruvyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohex&#8208;3&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate (SEPHCHC). The regioisomer of SEPHCHC, namely (1R,5S,6S)&#8208;2&#8208;succinyl&#8208;5&#8208;enolpyruvyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate (iso&#8208;SEPHCHC), has been considered as a possible product, however, its existence has been doubtful due to a spontaneous elimination of pyruvate from SEPHCHC to 2&#8208;succinyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate (SHCHC). In this work, the regioisomer iso&#8208;SEPHCHC was distinguished from SEPHCHC by liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry. Iso&#8208;SEPHCHC was purified and identified by NMR spectroscopy. Just as SEPHCHC remained hidden as a MenD product for more than two decades, its regioisomer iso&#8208;SEPHCHC has remained until now.

         <title>The Total Synthesis of Glycolipids from Streptococcus pneumoniae and a Re&#8208;evaluation of Their Immunological Activity
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic KRN7000 derived from sponge&#8208;dwelling bacteria metabolites, activates the invariant natural killer T&#8208;cells. Two glycolipids were reported isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2011 with reported potent activity. This resynthesis of both shows they are inactive against this receptor, and computational data proposes that this is expected as they present differently on the iNKT receptor.







Abstract
Invariant natural killer (iNK) T cells, Type I iNKTs, are responsible for the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines which induce a systemic immune response. They are distinctive in possessing an semi&#8208;invariant T&#8208;cell receptor that recognizes glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d, a protein closely related to the class I major histocompatibility complex, conserved across multiple mammalian species in a class of proteins well&#8208;renowned for their high degree of polymorphism. This receptor's first potent identified antigen is the &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide, KRN7000, a synthetic glycosphingolipid closely related to those isolated from bacteria that were found on a Japanese marine sponge. A corresponding terrestrial antigen remained unidentified until two specific diacylglycerol&#8208;containing glycolipids, reported to activate iNKT cells, were isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae. We report the total synthesis and immunological re&#8208;evaluation of these two glycolipids. The compounds are unable to meaningfully activate iNKT cells. Computational modelling shows that these ligands, while being capable of interacting with the CD1d receptor, create a different surface for the binary complex that makes formation of the ternary complex with the iNKT T&#8208;cell receptor difficult. Together these results suggest that the reported activity might have been due to an impurity in the original isolated sample and highlights the importance of taking care when reporting biological activity from isolated natural products.

Together these results suggest that the reported activity might have been due to an impurity in the original isolated sample and highlights the importance of taking care when reporting biological activity from isolated natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Arrays Could Influence the Formation of Their Component Tiles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data that that show higher level structures, i.&#8201;e. two&#8208;dimensional arrays, could impact the formation of their component tiles, are presented. Herein, the branched Kissing Loop motif has enabled us to observe this phenomenon with regard to programmed DNA self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Tile&#8208;based DNA self&#8208;assembly is a powerful approach for nano&#8208;constructions. In this approach, individual DNA single strands first assemble into well&#8208;defined structural tiles, which, then, further associate with each other into final nanostructures. It is a general assumption that the lower&#8208;level structures (tiles) determine the higher&#8208;level, final structures. In this study, we present concrete experimental data to show that higher&#8208;level structures could, at least in the current example, also impact on the formation of lower&#8208;level structures. This study prompts questions such as: how general is this phenomenon in programmed DNA self&#8208;assembly and can we turn it into a useful tool for fine tuning DNA self&#8208;assembly?

         <title>Lectin Drug Conjugates Targeting High Mannose N&#8208;Glycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A toxin delivery system that targets the aberrant presentation of high mannose N&#8208;glycans on cancer cells is described. This delivery system leverages lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that were prepared using a high mannose N&#8208;glycan binding lectin that is site specifically functionalized at the C&#8208;terminus with peptide toxin via a sortase ligation. In vitro studies demonstrate that the described LDCs potently and preferentially induce apoptosis in high mannose N&#8208;glycans presenting cancer cells.







Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated alterations to glycosylation have been shown to aid cancer development and progression. An increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been observed in several cancers. Here, we describe the preparation of lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that permit toxin delivery to cancer cells presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Additionally, we demonstrate that cancer cells presenting low levels of high mannose N&#8208;glycans can be rendered sensitive to the LDCs by co&#8208;treatment with a type I mannosidase inhibitor. Our findings establish that an increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans in the glycocalyx of cancer cells can be leveraged to enable toxin delivery.

         <title>Investigating Peptide&#8208;Coenzyme A Conjugates as Chemical Probes for Proteomic Profiling of N&#8208;Terminal and Lysine Acetyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;terminal (NAT) and lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) acetylate protein N&#8208;termini and lysine side chains, respectively. Immobilized peptide&#8208;coenzyme A conjugates recruit endogenous NAT and KAT complexes from cellular lysates. Our chemoproteomics analysis showed strong preferences of NAT complexes for N&#8208;terminal coenzyme A conjugated peptide probes enabling future investigations into changes in composition, modification, and activity states.







Abstract
Acetyl groups are transferred from acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A (Ac&#8208;CoA) to protein N&#8208;termini and lysine side chains by N&#8208;terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), respectively. Building on lysine&#8208;CoA conjugates as KAT probes, we have synthesized peptide probes with CoA conjugated to N&#8208;terminal alanine (&#945;&#8208;Ala&#8208;CoA), proline (&#945;&#8208;Pro&#8208;CoA) or tri&#8208;glutamic acid (&#945;&#8208;3Glu&#8208;CoA) units for interactome profiling of NAT complexes. The &#945;&#8208;Ala&#8208;CoA probe enriched the majority of NAT catalytic and auxiliary subunits, while a lysine CoA&#8208;conjugate bound only a subset of endogenous KATs. Interactome profiling with the &#945;&#8208;Pro&#8208;CoA probe showed reduced NAT recruitment in favor of metabolic CoA binding proteins and &#945;&#8208;3Glu&#8208;CoA steered the interactome towards NAA80 and NatB. These findings agreed with the inherent substrate specificities of the target proteins and showed that N&#8208;terminal CoA&#8208;conjugated peptides are versatile probes for NAT complex profiling in lysates of physiological and pathological backgrounds.

         <title>Replacing Commercial 6&#8208;Phosphofructokinase in an Online Pyrophosphate Detection Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi&#8208;PFK) is crucial to a coupled assay that measures the release of pyrophosphate by adenylation (A) domains. We show that recombinantly expressed and purified PPi&#8208;PFK can replace the now discontinued commercial source of this enzyme.







Abstract
Detection of pyrophosphate is important in quantifying enzyme activity, particularly adenylation domain activity during non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthesis. The previous development of an enzyme coupled PPi/NADH assay allowed the measurement of such activity in an online fashion using commercially available components. Now, with a key enzyme &#8208; 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase &#8208; no longer available, we have screened and identified viable replacement enzymes that can be expressed in high yield and that are far superior in activity to the now discontinued commercial product. This will support the ability of groups to continue to use this established online assay for pyrophosphate detection.

         <title>Feruloyl Esterases Protein Engineering to Enhance Their Performance as Biocatalysts: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to enhance enzymes performance is presented in this review. Analyses of the current protein engineering strategies that have been used to improve feruloyl esterases in terms of thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and selectivity are discussed. The result is a framework that suggests the direction of feruloyl esterases protein engineering to generate robust industrial biocatalysts.







Abstract
Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) are versatile enzymes able to release hydroxycinnamic acids or synthesize their ester derivatives, both molecules with interesting biological activities such as: antioxidants, antifungals, antivirals, antifibrotic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, among others. The importance of these molecules in medicine, food or cosmetic industries provides FAEs with several biotechnological applications as key industrial biocatalysts. However, FAEs have some operational limitations that must be overcome, which can be addressed through different protein engineering approaches to enhance their thermal stability, catalytic efficiencies, and selectivity. This review aims to present a brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to improve enzymes performance and analyze the current protein engineering strategies applied to FAEs as interesting biocatalysts. Finally, an outlook of the future of FAEs protein engineering approaches to achieve successful industrial biocatalysts is given.

Analyses of the current protein engineering strategies that have been used to improve feruloyl esterases in terms of thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and selectivity are discussed. The result is a framework that suggests the direction of feruloyl esterases protein engineering to generate robust industrial biocatalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) are versatile enzymes able to release hydroxycinnamic acids or synthesize their ester derivatives, both molecules with interesting biological activities such as: antioxidants, antifungals, antivirals, antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, among others. The importance of these molecules in medicine, food or cosmetic industries provides FAEs with several biotechnological applications as key industrial biocatalysts. However, FAEs have some operational limitations that must be overcome, which can be addressed through different protein engineering approaches to enhance their thermal stability, catalytic efficiencies, and selectivity. This review aims to present a brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to improve enzymes performance and analyze the current protein engineering strategies applied to FAEs as interesting biocatalysts. Finally, an outlook of the future of FAEs protein engineering approaches to achieve successful industrial biocatalysts is given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Honeybee Iflaviruses Pack Specific tRNA Fragments from Host Cells in Their Virions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
tRNA fragments in +ssRNA viruses: To reveal typical RNA modifications in viral genomic/mRNA, we purified RNA from Picornavirales and analyzed it using LC&#8211;MS, RNA&#8208;seq and Northern blots. While 1&#8208;methyladenosine and 5&#8208;methylcytidine were not detected in viral genomic RNA, we discovered that viral particles selectively co&#8208;pack host tRNA fragments.







Abstract
The Picornavirales include viruses that infect vertebrates, insects, and plants. It was believed that they pack only their genomic mRNA in the particles; thus, we envisaged these viruses as excellent model systems for studies of mRNA modifications. We used LC&#8211;MS to analyze digested RNA isolated from particles of the sacbrood and deformed wing iflaviruses as well as of the echovirus 18 and rhinovirus 2 picornaviruses. Whereas in the picornavirus RNAs we detected only N6&#8208;methyladenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylated nucleosides, the iflavirus RNAs contained a wide range of methylated nucleosides, such as 1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) and 5&#8208;methylcytidine (m5C). Mapping of m1A and m5C through RNA sequencing of the SBV and DWV RNAs revealed the presence of tRNA molecules. Both modifications were detected only in tRNA. Further analysis revealed that tRNAs are present in form of 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; fragments and they are packed selectively. Moreover, these tRNAs are typically packed by other viruses.

         <title>Bacterial Peroxidase on Electrochemically Reduced Graphene Oxide for Highly Sensitive H2O2 Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial peroxidase (BsDyP) from the &#8220;dye&#8208;decolorizing&#8221; family was immobilized on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers to create a mechanically robust biosensor with a shelf&#8208;life of eight weeks. This biosensor was characterized for the highly selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide (linearity 0.05&#8211;280&#8197;&#956;M, LOD 32&#8197;nM).







Abstract
Peroxidase enzymes enable the construction of electrochemical sensors for highly sensitive and selective quantitative detection of various molecules, pathogens and diseases. Herein, we describe the immobilization of a peroxidase from Bacillus s. (BsDyP) on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers. XRD, SEM, AFM, FT&#8208;IR and Raman characterization of the sensor confirmed its structural integrity and a higher enzyme surface occupancy. The BsDyP&#8208;ERGO/ITO/PET electrode performed better than other horseradish peroxidase&#8208;based electrodes, as evinced by an improved electrochemical response in the nanomolar range (linearity 0.05&#8211;280&#8197;&#956;M of H2O2, LOD 32&#8197;nM). The bioelectrode was mechanically robust, active in the 3.5&#8211;6&#8197;pH range and exhibited no loss of activity upon storage for 8&#8197;weeks at 4&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Chemical Conjugation to Less Targeted Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective conjugation to the multitude of functional groups at the surface of proteins is challenging. Most commonly lysine, cysteine or tyrosine are targeted, however in recent years a range of innovative methods have been developed to selectively target other amino acids at proteins and these methods are the focus of this review.







Abstract
Protein bioconjugates are in high demand for applications in biomedicine, diagnostics, chemical biology and bionanotechnology. Proteins are large and sensitive molecules containing multiple different functional groups and in particular nucleophilic groups. In bioconjugation reactions it can therefore be challenging to obtain a homogeneous product in high yield. Numerous strategies for protein conjugation have been developed, of which a vast majority target lysine, cysteine and to a lesser extend tyrosine. Likewise, several methods that involve recombinantly engineered protein tags have been reported. In recent years a number of methods have emerged for chemical bioconjugation to other amino acids and in this review, we present the progress in this area.

         <title>Intramolecular Covalent Bonds in Gram&#8208;Positive Bacterial Surface Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;positive bacteria have evolved a variety of intramolecular covalent bonds that are found to play important mechanical roles for stabilizing host infection. Studying the proteins containing these unusual covalent bond yields rich information about the mechanical design of these proteins and inspires the design of novel antibiotics and bioengineering tools.







Abstract
Gram&#8208;positive bacteria experience considerable mechanical perturbation when adhering to host surfaces during colonization and infection. They have evolved various adhesion proteins that are mechanically robust to ensure strong surface adhesion. Recently, it was discovered that these adhesion proteins contain rare, extra intramolecular covalent bonds that stabilize protein structures and participate in surface bonding. These intramolecular covalent bonds include isopeptides, thioesters, and ester bonds, which often form spontaneously without the need for additional enzymes. With the development of single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy techniques, the detailed mechanical roles of these intramolecular covalent bonds have been revealed. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in this area of research, focusing on the link between the mechanical stability and function of these covalent bonds in Gram&#8208;positive bacterial surface proteins. We also highlight the potential impact of these discoveries on the development of novel antibiotics and chemical biology tools.

         <title>Fragment Screening Yields a Small&#8208;Molecule Stabilizer of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Dimers That Modulates Client Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment library screen identified fragment 2 as a novel non&#8208;covalent protein&#8208;protein interaction stabilizer targeting 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 dimers. Fragment 2 can act cooperatively with Fusicoccin&#8208;A, resulting in enhanced binding to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client proteins such as the estrogen receptor alpha.







Abstract
The development of protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors has been a successful strategy in drug development. However, the identification of PPI stabilizers has proven much more challenging. Here we report a fragment&#8208;based drug screening approach using the regulatory hub&#8208;protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 as a platform for identifying PPI stabilizers. A homogenous time&#8208;resolved FRET assay was used to monitor stabilization of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/peptide binding using the known interaction partner estrogen receptor alpha. Screening of an in&#8208;house fragment library identified fragment 2 (VUF15640) as a putative PPI stabilizer capable of cooperatively stabilizing 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPIs in a cooperative fashion with Fusicoccin&#8208;A. Mechanistically, fragment 2 appears to enhance 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 dimerization leading to increased client&#8208;protein binding. Functionally, fragment 2 enhanced potency of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 in a cell&#8208;free system inhibiting the enzyme activity of the nitrate reductase.

     alt="Fragment Screening Yields a Small-Molecule Stabilizer of 14-3-3 Dimers That Modulates Client Protein Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fragment library screen&lt;/b&gt; identified fragment &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; as a novel non-covalent protein-protein interaction stabilizer targeting 14-3-3 dimers. Fragment &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; can act cooperatively with Fusicoccin-A, resulting in enhanced binding to 14-3-3 client proteins such as the estrogen receptor alpha.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors has been a successful strategy in drug development. However, the identification of PPI stabilizers has proven much more challenging. Here we report a fragment-based drug screening approach using the regulatory hub-protein 14-3-3 as a platform for identifying PPI stabilizers. A homogenous time-resolved FRET assay was used to monitor stabilization of 14-3-3/peptide binding using the known interaction partner estrogen receptor alpha. Screening of an in-house fragment library identified fragment &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (VUF15640) as a putative PPI stabilizer capable of cooperatively stabilizing 14-3-3 PPIs in a cooperative fashion with Fusicoccin-A. Mechanistically, fragment &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; appears to enhance 14-3-3 dimerization leading to increased client-protein binding. Functionally, fragment &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; enhanced potency of 14-3-3 in a cell-free system inhibiting the enzyme activity of the nitrate reductase. In conclusion, we identified a general PPI stabilizer targeting 14-3-3, which could be used as a tool compound for investigating 14-3-3 client protein interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective and Reversible Ligand Assembly on the DNA and RNA Repeat Sequences in Myotonic Dystrophy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules that selectively bind to and reversibly assemble on the DNA and RNA sequences that are the causative agent of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) were developed. The combination of dialdehyde and diamine inhibited the formation of toxic RNA in&#8197;vitro and rescued mis&#8208;splicing in DM1 model cells.







Abstract
Small molecule targeting of DNA and RNA sequences has come into focus as a therapeutic strategy for diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a trinucleotide repeat disease characterized by RNA gain&#8208;of&#8208;function. Herein, we report a novel template&#8208;selected, reversible assembly of therapeutic agents in&#8197;situ via aldehyde&#8208;amine condensation. Rationally designed small molecule targeting agents functionalized with either an aldehyde or an amine were synthesized and screened against the target nucleic acid sequence. The assembly of fragments was confirmed by MALDI&#8208;MS in the presence of DM1&#8208;relevant nucleic acid sequences. The resulting hit combinations of aldehyde and amine inhibited the formation of r(CUG)exp in&#8197;vitro in a cooperative manner at low micromolar levels and rescued mis&#8208;splicing defects in DM1 model cells. This reversible template&#8208;selected assembly is a promising approach to achieve cell permeable and multivalent targeting via in&#8197;situ synthesis and could be applied to other nucleic acid targets.

Dextran&#8208;rich droplets are generated in a polyethylene glycol&#8208;rich phase via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. This study demonstrates that the dextran&#8208;rich droplets can selectively uptake DNA nano/microstructures based on size and shape. This property is explored for constructing a versatile method for purifying DNA nano/microstructures. This method can be applied to various DNA nano/microstructures, including hexagons, triangles, and fibers, with a high yield and short preparation time. This picture shows the time variation of a spherical dextran&#8208;rich droplet capturing DNA nano/microstructures. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Takinoue et&#8197;al.

         <title>Inactivation Mechanism of the Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Inhibitor BIA 10&#8208;2474</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BIA 10&#8208;2474 is a time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase(FAAH) that was under clinical development for the treatment of neurological conditions when the program was terminated after one subject died and four were hospitalized with neurological symptoms during a first&#8208;in&#8208;human clinical study.
The present manuscript describes the mechanism of FAAH inhibition by BIA 10&#8208;2474 as a target&#8208;specific covalent inhibition, supported by quantum mechanics and molecular modelling studies. The inhibitor incorporates a weakly reactive electrophile which, upon specific binding to the enzyme's active site, is positioned to react readily with the catalytic residues. The reactivity is enhanced on&#8208;site by the increased molarity at the reaction site and by specific inductive interactions with FAAH. In the second stage, the inhibitor reacts with the enzyme's catalytic nucleophile to form a covalent enzyme&#8208;inhibitor adduct. The hydrolysis of this adduct is shown to be unlikely under physiological conditions, therefore leading to irreversible inactivation of FAAH.
The results also reveal the important role played by FAAH Thr236 in the reaction with BIA 10&#8208;2474, which is specific to FAAH and is not present in other serine hydrolases.</dc:description>

         <title>Tyramine Derivatives Catalyze the Aldol Dimerization of Butyraldehyde in the Presence of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial amine organocatalysis: Biogenic amines derived from L&#8208;tyrosine were found to catalyze the biocompatible self&#8208;aldol dimerization of butanal in the presence of Escherichia coli. Cell lysates from both E. coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum were also found to catalyze this reaction in&#8197;vitro. Under biocompatible conditions, the product enal was reduced to 2&#8208;ethylhexanal via endogenous reductases.







Abstract
Biogenic amine organocatalysts have transformed the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Yet despite their use in synthesis and to label biomolecules in&#8197;vitro, amine organocatalysis in&#8197;vivo has received comparatively little attention &#8211; despite the potential of such reactions to be interfaced with living cells and to modify cellular metabolites. Herein we report that biogenic amines derived from L&#8208;tyrosine catalyze the self&#8208;aldol condensation of butanal to 2&#8208;ethylhexenal &#8211; a key intermediate in the production of the bulk chemical 2&#8208;ethylhexanol &#8211; in the presence of living Escherichia coli and outperform many amine organocatalysts currently used in synthetic organic chemistry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell lysate from E. coli and the prolific amine overproducer Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 catalyze this reaction in&#8197;vitro, demonstrating the potential for microbial metabolism to be used as a source of organocatalysts for biocompatible reactions in cells.

         <title>Synthetic &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides as Potential Inhibitors of the ACE2 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;cap makes the difference: Aiming at the development of potential COVID&#8208;19 drugs distorting the interaction between the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and human ACE2, a series of N&#8208;capped peptides derived from the &#945;1&#8208;helix of ACE2 were prepared to increase the &#945;&#8208;helical content. This led to the discovery of a comparably short peptide binding to the spike protein with high affinity (KD=62&#8197;nM).







Abstract
During viral cell entry, the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to the &#945;1&#8208;helix motif of human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2). Thus, alpha&#8208;helical peptides mimicking this motif may serve as inhibitors of viral cell entry. For this purpose, we employed the rigidified diproline&#8208;derived module ProM&#8208;5 to induce &#945;&#8208;helicity in short peptide sequences inspired by the ACE2 &#945;1&#8208;helix. Starting with Ac&#8208;QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ&#8208;NH2 as a relevant section of &#945;1, a series of peptides, N&#8208;capped with either Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;[ProM&#8208;5] or Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;PP, were prepared and their &#945;&#8208;helicities were investigated. While ProM&#8208;5 clearly showed a pronounced effect, an even increased degree of helicity (up to 63&#8201;%) was observed in sequences in which non&#8208;binding amino acids were replaced by alanine. The binding affinities of the peptides towards the spike protein, as determined by means of microscale thermophoresis (MST), revealed only a subtle influence of the &#945;&#8208;helical content and, noteworthy, led to the identification of an Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;PP&#8208;capped peptide displaying a very strong binding affinity (KD=62&#8197;nM).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-cap makes the difference&lt;/b&gt;: Aiming at the development of potential COVID-19 drugs distorting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2, a series of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-capped peptides derived from the &#945;1-helix of ACE2 were prepared to increase the &#945;-helical content. This led to the discovery of a comparably short peptide binding to the spike protein with high affinity (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;=62&#8197;nM).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During viral cell entry, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the &#945;1-helix motif of human angiotensin-converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2). Thus, alpha-helical peptides mimicking this motif may serve as inhibitors of viral cell entry. For this purpose, we employed the rigidified diproline-derived module &lt;b&gt;ProM-5&lt;/b&gt; to induce &#945;-helicity in short peptide sequences inspired by the ACE2 &#945;1-helix. Starting with Ac-QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a relevant section of &#945;1, a series of peptides, &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;capped with either Ac-&#946;HAsp-[&lt;b&gt;ProM-5&lt;/b&gt;] or Ac-&#946;HAsp-PP, were prepared and their &#945;-helicities were investigated. While &lt;b&gt;ProM-5&lt;/b&gt; clearly showed a pronounced effect, an even increased degree of helicity (up to 63&#8201;%) was observed in sequences in which non-binding amino acids were replaced by alanine. The binding affinities of the peptides towards the spike protein, as determined by means of microscale thermophoresis (MST), revealed only a subtle influence of the &#945;-helical content and, noteworthy, led to the identification of an Ac-&#946;HAsp-PP-capped peptide displaying a very strong binding affinity (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;=62&#8197;nM).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Human Cancer Proteins Using Microprocessor Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microchip&#8208;based substrates and high&#8208;resolution imaging technology were used to resolve full&#8208;length p53 structures from human cancer cells for the first time.







Abstract
Mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), are heavily implicated in aggressive cancers giving rise to gain&#8208; and loss&#8208;of&#8208;function phenotypes. While individual domains of the p53 protein have been studied extensively, structural information for full&#8208;length p53 remains incomplete. Functionalized microprocessor chips (microchips) with properties amenable to electron microscopy permitted us to visualize complete p53 assemblies for the first time. The new structures revealed p53 in an inactive dimeric state independent of DNA binding. Residues located at the protein&#8208;protein interface corresponded with modification sites in cancer&#8208;related hot spots. Changes in these regions may amplify the toxic effects of clinical mutations. Taken together, these results contribute advances in technology and imaging approaches to decode native protein models in different states of activation.

         <title>Trace&#8208;Level Phenolics Detection Based on Composite PAN&#8208;MWCNTs Nanofibers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrospun nanofiber mat consisting of polyacrylonitrile and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes was employed as an immobilization matrix in tyrosinase&#8208;based biosensors. The biosensors were very successful in trace&#8208;level detection of mono&#8208; and diphenol derivatives in water samples.







Abstract
In view of major concerns regarding toxicity (genotoxic, mutagenic, hepatotoxic) of phenolics, there is an on&#8208;going necessity for sensitive and accurate analytical procedures for detection and measurements in environmental field, water, and food quality control. The current study proposes composite polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous assemblies enriched with multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (PAN&#8208;MWCNTs NFs) as suitable immobilization platforms for cross&#8208;linking of tyrosinase in detection of both diphenols and monophenols, which are of much interest in water contamination. The prepared biosensor (Pt/PAN&#8208;MWCNTs/Tyr) showed high sensitivity in catechol detection (362.5&#8197;mA/M.cm2) and moderate sensitivity for the two monophenols (phenol, p&#8208;chlorophenol) with 14.79 and 25.46&#8197;mA/M.cm2, respectively. The LOD values of the sensor were in the nanomolar range: 4.42&#215;10&#8722;9, 4.06&#215;10&#8722;7 and 1.05&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M for catechol, phenol and p&#8208;chlorophenol, respectively, allowing detection of trace amounts of phenolics in spiked water samples.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Continuous Spectroscopic Assay to Measure the Activity of Natural Product Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule methylation catalyzed by natural product methyltransferases (NPMTs) carries a tremendous potential to improve bioactivity and bioavailability of natural products. To assist with the expansion of available NPMTs, we present a high&#8208;throughput continuous assay for the rapid and reliable detection of methyltransferase activity for small molecules.







Abstract
Natural product methyltransferases (NPMTs) represent an emerging class of enzymes that can be of great use for the structural and functional diversification of bioactive compounds, such as the strategic modification of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;moieties. To assess the activity and the substrate scope of the ever&#8208;expanding repertoire of NPMTs, a simple, fast, and robust assay is needed. Here, we report a continuous spectroscopic assay, in which S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methylation is linked to NADH oxidation through the coupled activities of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) deaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase. The assay is highly suitable for a high&#8208;throughput evaluation of small molecule methylation and for determining the catalytic parameters of NPMTs under conditions that remove the potent inhibition by SAH. Through the modular design, the assay can be extended to match the needs of different aspects of methyltransferase cascade reactions and respective applications.

         <title>Regioselective Biocatalytic C4&#8208;Prenylation of Unprotected Tryptophan Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C4&#8208;regioselective prenylation of 5&#8208;substituted tryptophans as well as truncated tryptophan derivatives was achieved using a set of prenlyltransferases. Conversions were increased by designing improved variants and the feasibility of preparative transformations was successfully demonstrated reaching isolated yields up to 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation belongs to the challenging tasks in organic synthesis. In this context, C&#8722;C bond formation catalyzed by 4&#8208;dimethylallyltryptophan synthases (4&#8208;DMATSs) represents a possible tool to regioselectively synthesize C4&#8208;prenylated indole derivatives without site&#8208;specific preactivation and circumventing the need of protection groups as used in chemical synthetic approaches. In this study, a toolbox of 4&#8208;DMATSs to produce a set of 4&#8208;dimethylallyl tryptophan and indole derivatives was identified. Using three wild&#8208;type enzymes as well as variants, various C5&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives as well as N&#8208;methyl tryptophan were successfully prenylated with conversions up to 90&#8201;%. Even truncated tryptophan derivatives like tryptamine and 3&#8208;indole propanoic acid were regioselectively prenylated in position C4. The acceptance of C5&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives was improved up to 5&#8208;fold by generating variants (e.&#8201;g. T108S). The feasibility of semi&#8208;preparative prenylation of selected tryptophan derivatives was successfully demonstrated on 100&#8197;mg scale at 15&#8197;mM substrate concentration, allowing to reduce the previously published multistep chemical synthetic sequence to just a single step.

         <title>BioWF: A Naturally&#8208;Fused, Di&#8208;Domain Biocatalyst from Biotin Biosynthesis Displays an Unexpectedly Broad Substrate Scope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BioWF fusion biocatalyst can convert various fatty acid substrates to &#945;&#8208;oxoamine (AON) products. The ATP&#8208;dependent BioW domain catalyses formation of an acyl&#8208;CoA thioester intermediate. The pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent BioF domain then accepts various amino acids and catalyses the formation of a range of aminoketone analogues.







Abstract
The carbon backbone of biotin is constructed from the C7 di&#8208;acid pimelate, which is converted to an acyl&#8208;CoA thioester by an ATP&#8208;dependent, pimeloyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (PCAS, encoded by BioW). The acyl&#8208;thioester is condensed with &#671;&#8208;alanine in a decarboxylative, Claisen&#8208;like reaction to form an aminoketone (8&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;oxononanoic acid, AON). This step is catalysed by the pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme (AON synthase, AONS, encoded by BioF). Distinct versions of Bacillus subtilis BioW (BsBioW) and E. coli BioF (EcBioF) display strict substrate specificity. In contrast, a BioW&#8208;BioF fusion from Corynebacterium amycolatum (CaBioWF) accepts a wider range of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;fatty acids. Analysis of the active site of the BsBioW : pimeloyl&#8208;adenylate complex suggested a key role for a Phe (F192) residue in the CaBioW domain; a F192Y mutant restored the substrate specificity to pimelate. This surprising substrate flexibility also extends to the CaBioF domain, which accepts &#671;&#8208;alanine, &#671;&#8208;serine and glycine. Structural models of the CaBioWF fusion provide insight into how both domains interact with each other and suggest the presence of an intra&#8208;domain tunnel. The CaBioWF fusion catalyses conversion of various fatty acids and amino acids to a range of AON derivatives. Such unexpected, natural broad substrate scope suggests that the CaBioWF fusion is a versatile biocatalyst that can be used to prepare a number of aminoketone analogues.

         <dc:description>
Exendin&#8208;4&#8208;&#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid conjugates have been generated by efficient Diels&#8208;Alder click reaction. The highly functionalized conjugate (average 106 Exendin&#8208;4 molecules/&#947;&#8208;Polyglutamic acid) showed affinity towards GLP1 receptor higher with respect to Enendin&#8208;4 a labile peptide approved for type 2 diabetes treatment.







Abstract
Targeting of glucagon&#8208;like peptide 1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R), expressed on the surface of pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells, is of great interest for the development of advanced therapies for diabetes and diagnostics for insulinoma. We report the conjugation of exendin&#8208;4 (Ex&#8208;4), an approved drug to treat type 2 diabetes, to poly&#8208;&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid (&#947;&#8208;PGA) to obtain more stable and effective GLP&#8208;1R ligands. Exendin&#8208;4 modified at Lysine&#8208;27 with PEG4&#8208;maleimide was conjugated to &#947;&#8208;PGA functionalized with furan, in different molar ratios, exploiting a chemoselective Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition. The &#947;&#8208;PGA presenting the highest number of conjugated Ex&#8208;4 molecules (average 120 per polymeric chain) showed a double affinity towards GLP&#8208;1R with respect to exendin per se, paving the way to improved therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Determination of Amide cis/trans Isomers in N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine: Tailored NMR Analysis of the N&#8208;Acetyl Group Conformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;acetyl group of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) is defined by two torsion angles, &#952;1 and &#952;2, where &#952;2 defines the amide bond orientation which enables cis&#8208;trans isomerization (CTI). This is the first identification of NH protons of the amide cis isomers of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc, which has allowed conformational analysis of these isomers based on J&#8208;couplings within the N&#8208;acetyl group.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) is one of the most common amino sugars in nature, but the conformation of its N&#8208;acetyl group has drawn little attention. We report herein the first identification of NH protons of the amide cis forms of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc by NMR spectroscopy. Relative quantification and thermodynamic analysis of both cis and trans forms was carried out in aqueous solution. The NH protons were further utilized by adapting protein NMR experiments to measure eight J&#8208;couplings within the N&#8208;acetyl group, of which six are sensitive to the H2&#8208;NH conformation and two are sensitive to the amide conformation. For amide cis and trans forms, the orientation between H2 and NH was determined as anti conformation, while a small percentage of syn conformation was predicted for the amide trans form of &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc. This approach holds great promise for the detailed conformational analysis of GlcNAc in larger biomolecules, such as glycoproteins and polysaccharides.

         <title>Regulating Spatial Localization and Reactivity Biasness of DNAzymes by Metal Ions and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique macroscopic spatially controlled, non&#8208;equilibrium sensing and catalytic behavior for the G&#8208;quadruplex based DNAzyme towards substrate and inhibitor concentration gradient along with its modulation in an environment with non&#8208;catalytic aptamer is reported. This unique reaction&#8208;diffusion based organizational and catalytic heterogeneity of DNAzyme in space will show new insights in the area of spatially controlled surface chemistry, bio&#8208;patterning and DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Chemical gradient sensing behavior of catalytically active colloids and enzymes is an area of immense interest owing to their importance in understanding fundamental spatiotemporal complexity patterns in living systems and designing dynamic materials. Herein, we have shown the peroxidase activity of DNAzyme (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;hemin complex tagged in a micron&#8208;sized glass bead) can be modulated by metal ions and metal ion&#8208;binding oligonucleotides. Next we demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically, that the localization and product formation ability of the DNAzyme&#8208;containing particle remains biased to the more catalytically active zone where the concentration of metal ion (Hg2+) inhibitor is low. Interestingly, this biased localization can be broken by introduction of Hg2+ binding oligonucleotide in the system. Additionally, a macroscopically asymmetric catalytic product distributed zone has been achieved with this process, showing the possibility of regulation in autonomous spatially controlled chemical processes. This demonstration of autonomous modulation of the localization pattern and spatially specific enhanced product forming ability of DNAzymes will further enable the design of responsive nucleic acid&#8208;based motile materials and surfaces.

         <title>STAT Protein Thermal Shift Assays to Monitor Protein&#8208;Inhibitor Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STAT proteins are a family of multifaceted transcription factors whose deregulated activity is linked to diseases like cancer and arthritis. To interrogate a selection of STAT inhibitors, we have developed a protein thermal shift assay which serves as a steppingstone between biochemical thermal stability assays and cellular thermal shift assays.







Abstract
STAT3 protein is a sought&#8208;after drug target as it plays a key role in the progression of cancer. Many STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i) have been reported, but accumulating evidence suggests many of these act as off&#8208;target/indirect inhibitors of STAT signaling. Herein, we describe the STAT protein thermal shift assay (PTSA) as a novel target engagement tool, which we used to test the binding of known STAT3i to STAT3 and STAT1. This revealed STATTIC, BP&#8208;1&#8208;102, and Cpd188 destabilized both STATs and produced unique migratory patterns on SDS&#8208;PAGE gels, suggesting covalent protein modifications. Mass spectrometry experiments confirmed that these compounds are nonspecifically alkylating STATs, as well as an unrelated protein, NUDT5. These experiments have highlighted the benefits of PTSA to investigate interactions with STAT proteins and have helped reveal the novel reactivity of Cpd188. The described PTSA represents a promising chemical biology tool that could be applied to an array of other protein targets.

         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As exemplified with TZM&#8208;E9, a foldable detergent with an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance is able to form stable micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors. Detergent foldability is favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability and represents a new concept that can be utilized for novel detergent development for membrane protein structural study.







Abstract
Detergents are widely used for membrane protein structural study. Many recently developed detergents contain multiple tail and head groups, which are typically connected via a small and branched linker. Due to their inherent compact structures, with small inter&#8208;alkyl chain distances, these detergents form micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors, a feature favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability. A recent study on tandem triazine maltosides (TZMs) revealed a distinct trend; despite possession of an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance, the TZM&#8722;Es were highly effective at stabilizing membrane proteins. Thanks to the incorporation of a flexible spacer between the two triazine rings in the linker region, these detergents are prone to folding into a compact architecture in micellar environments instead of adopting an extended conformation. Detergent foldability represents a new concept of novel detergent design with significant potential for future detergent development.

         <title>Methyltransferases: Functions and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyltransferases are enzymes that will in the future enable clean and green alkylation of amino and hydroxy groups as well as reactive carbon atoms. These enzymes, their cofactor SAM (S&#8208;adenosylmethionine) and the opportunities&#8217; they offer for new SN2 chemistries are highlighted.







Abstract
In this review the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and SAM are evaluated. Their structural classification and diversity is introduced and key mechanistic aspects presented which are then detailed further. Then, catalytic SAM as a target for drugs, and approaches to utilise SAM as a cofactor in synthesis are introduced with different supply and regeneration approaches evaluated. The use of SAM analogues are also described. Finally O&#8208;, N&#8208;, C&#8208; and S&#8208;MTs, their synthetic applications and potential for compound diversification is given.

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;Water Droplets Selectively Uptake Self&#8208;Assembled DNA Nano/Microstructures: a Versatile Method for Purification in DNA Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;rich droplets display a selective uptake of DNA structures based on size and shape. This property is explored for creating a versatile protocol for the purification of DNA structures used in DNA nanotechnology. The protocol is applicable to a wide size range of DNA structures, with a high yield and short preparation time.







Abstract
DNA is an excellent material for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures. Owing to the widespread use of DNA as a building block in laboratories and industry, it is desirable to increase the efficiency of all steps involved in producing self&#8208;assembled DNA structures. One of the bottlenecks is the purification required to separate the excess components from the target structures. This paper describes a purification method based on the fractionation by water&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/W) droplets composed of phase&#8208;separated dextran&#8208;rich droplets in a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;rich continuous phase. The dextran&#8208;rich droplets facilitate the selective uptake of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures and allow the separation of the target structure. This study investigates the ability to purify DNA origami, DNA hydrogels, and DNA microtubes. The W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation allows the purification of structures of a broad size spectrum without changes to the protocol. By quantifying the activity of deoxyribozyme&#8208;modified DNA origami after W/W&#8208;droplet purification, this study demonstrates that this method sufficiently preserves the accessibility to the surface of a functional DNA nanostructure. It is considered that the W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation could become one of the standard methods for the purification of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures for biomedical and nanotechnology applications owing to its low cost and simplicity.

         <title>Diterpenoids from Streptomyces: Structures, Biosyntheses and Bioactivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diterpenoids from Streptomyces, which were identified by direct isolation or genome mining, show diverse biological activities and can be potential drug candidates. Biosynthesis of these diterpenoids holds great promise for uncovering novel skeletons of diterpenoids by genome mining in Streptomyces strains.







Abstract
Bacteria, especially Streptomyces spp., have emerged as a rich source for natural diterpenoids with diverse structures and broad bioactivities. Here, we review diterpenoids biosynthesized by Streptomyces, with an emphasis on their structures, biosyntheses, and bioactivities. Although diterpenoids from Streptomyces are relatively rare compared to those from plants and fungi, their novel skeletons, biosyntheses and bioactivities present opportunities for discovering new drugs, enzyme mechanisms, and applications in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway engineering.

&lt;p&gt;Bacteria, especially &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; spp., have emerged as a rich source for natural diterpenoids with diverse structures and broad bioactivities. Here, we review diterpenoids biosynthesized by &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt;, with an emphasis on their structures, biosyntheses, and bioactivities. Although diterpenoids from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; are relatively rare compared to those from plants and fungi, their novel skeletons, biosyntheses and bioactivities present opportunities for discovering new drugs, enzyme mechanisms, and applications in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Seeking Citius: Photochemical Access of Reactive Intermediates for Faster Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An attractive strategy to increase reaction kinetics in bioorthogonal chemistry is to access highly reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ. This article discusses efficient photochemical generation of two reactive intermediates&#8212;nitrile imine and tetrazine&#8212;from their stable and unreactive precursors and their subsequent use in rapid bioorthogonal labeling of proteins in live cells.







Abstract
Fast bioorthogonal reactions are sought after because of their superior performance in labeling low&#8208;abundance biomolecules in native cellular environments. An attractive strategy to increase reaction kinetics is to access the reactive intermediates through photochemical activation. To this end, significant progress was made in the last few years in harnessing two highly reactive intermediates&#8212;nitrile imine and tetrazine&#8212;generated through photoinduced ring rupture and catalytic photooxidation, respectively. The efficient capture of these reactive intermediates by their cognate reaction partners has enabled bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling of biomolecules in live cells.

         <title>Chemical Diversity and Biosynthesis of Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpenes in the Fungal Kingdom</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fungal drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are emerging as a very interesting class of chemicals with many notable activities. Elucidation of DTS biosynthesis in fungi revealed that the two main precursors, drimenol and drim&#8208;8&#8208;ene&#8208;11&#8208;ol, are the preferred backbones. Hence, hundreds of different fungal DTS derivatives have been isolated and identified, suggesting that they are relevant secondary metabolites in the fungal kingdom.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes are a class of compounds produced by a wide range of organisms, initially isolated and characterized in plants. Meanwhile, in the past 20&#8211;30&#8197;years, a large number of novel structures from many divergent fungi have been elucidated. Recently, the biosynthesis of drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and their esters has been explained in two filamentous fungi, namely Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus calidoustus, disclosing the basic biosynthetic principles needed to identify similar pathways in the fungal kingdom.

         <title>Advances in Designer DNA Nanorobots Enabling Programmable Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;enabled nanorobotics: DNA nanotechnology advances the development of the rational design of DNA nanorobots capable of executing programmable functions. Integrating the sensory, controller, and actuation modules, distinct types of designer DNA nanorobots can automatically perform various mechanical motions (one&#8208;step, multi&#8208;step, or continuously stepping) in response to certain stimuli, realizing versatile functionalities in accurate biosensing, targeted drug delivery, even autonomous operations to trigger desired cellular behavior.







Abstract
The advent of DNA nanotechnology has paved the way for the development of nanoscale robotics capable of executing smart and sophisticated tasks in a programmed and automatic manner. The programmability and customizable functionality of designer DNA nanorobots interfacing with biology would offer great potential for basic and applied research in the interdisciplinary fields of chemistry, biology, and medicine. This review aims to summarize the latest progress in designer DNA nanorobotics enabling programmable functions. We first describe the state&#8208;of&#8208;art engineering principles and the functional modules used in the rational design of a dynamic DNA nanorobot. Subsequently, we summarize the distinct types of DNA nanorobots performing sensing tasks, sensing&#8208;and&#8208;actuation, or continuous actuation, highlighting the versatility of designer DNA nanorobots in accurate biosensing, targeted drug delivery, and autonomous molecular operations to promote desired cellular behavior. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the development of functional DNA nanorobotics for biomedical applications. We envision that significant progress in DNA&#8208;enabled nanorobotics with programmable functions will improve precision medicine in the future.
