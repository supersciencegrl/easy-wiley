      <dc:description>G&#8208;Quadruplex (GQ) and  i&#8208;  motif structures are the paradigmatic examples of non&#8208;classical tetra&#8208;stranded nucleic acids having multifarious biological functions and widespread applications in therapeutics and material science. Recently, the tetraplexes emerged as the promising ant  i&#8208;  cancer targets due to their structural robustness, gene&#8208;regulatory roles, and predominant distribution at the specific loci of the oncogenes. However, it is arguable whether  i&#8208;  motif evolves in the complementary single&#8208;stranded region after GQ&#8208;formation in its opposite strand and  vice versa  . In this review, we addressed the prerequisites and significance of simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive formation of GQ and  i&#8208;  motif structures at the complementary and sequential positions in the duplex under cellular milieu. We discussed how their dynamic interplay poises cellular homeostasis and exacerbates carcinogenesis. The review revealed invaluable insights on the spatiotemporal formation of GQ and  i&#8208;  motifs that could be harnessed to design different types of reporter systems and diagnostic platform for potential bioanalytical and therapeutic intervention.</dc:description>

      <title>Comparative biochemistry of four polyester (PET) hydrolases</title>
      <dc:description>The potential of bioprocessing in a circular plastic economy has strongly stimulated research in enzymatic degradation of different synthetic polymers. Particular interest has been devoted to the commonly used polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and&#160; a number of PET hydrolases have been described. However, a kinetic framework for comparisons of PET hydrolases (or other plastic degrading enzymes) acting on the insoluble substrate, has not been established. Here, we propose such a framework and test it against kinetic measurements on four PET hydrolases. The analysis provided values of kcat and KM, as well as an apparent specificity constant in the conventional units of M&#8208;1s&#8208;1. These parameters, together with experimental values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface, enabled comparative analyses. A variant of the PET hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis was the most efficient enzyme at ambient conditions, which relied on a high kcat rather than a low KM. Moreover, both soluble and insoluble PET fragments were consistently hydrolyzed much faster than intact PET. This suggests that interactions between polymer strands slow down PET degradation, while the chemical steps of catalysis and the low accessibility associated with solid substrate were less important for the overall rate.

      <title>The Perturbed Free Energy Landscape: Linking Ligand Binding to Biomolecular Folding</title>
      <dc:description>Effects of ligand binding on biomolecular conformation are crucial in drug design, enzyme mechanisms, regulation of gene expression, and other biological processes. Descriptive models; &#8220;lock and key&#8221;, &#8220;induced fit&#8221;, and &#8220;conformational selection&#8221; are common ways to interpret such interactions. Another historical model, linked equilibria, proposes that the Free Energy Landscape (FEL) is perturbed by the addition of ligand binding energy for the bound population of biomolecules. This principle leads to a unified, quantitative theory of ligand&#8208;induced conformational change, building upon the FEL concept. We call the map of binding free energy over biomolecular conformational space the &#8220;binding affinity landscape&#8221; (BAL). The perturbed FEL predicts/explains ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes conforming to all common descriptive models. We review recent experimental and computational studies that exemplify the perturbed FEL, with emphasis on RNA. This way of understanding ligand&#8208;induced conformational dynamics motivates new experimental and theoretical approaches to ligand design, structural biology and systems biology.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Incorporation of Clickable Unnatural Amino Acids Enables Rapid and Biocompatible Labeling of Proteins in Vitro and in Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) bearing a bioorthogonal group has enabled the attachment &#8211; typically at a single site or at a few sites per protein &#8211; of chemical groups at precise locations for protein and biomaterial labeling, conjugation, and functionalization. Here, we report the evolution of chromosomal  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii  tyrosyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the alkyne&#8208;bearing uAA, 4&#8208;propargyloxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pPR), with ~30&#8208;fold increased production of green fluorescent protein containing 3 instances of pPR compared with a previously described  M. jannaschii  derived aaRS for pPR, when expressed from a single chromosomal copy. We show that when expressed from multi&#8208;copy plasmids, the evolved aaRSs enable the production &#8211; using a genomically recoded  Escherichia coli  and the non&#8208;recoded BL21  E. coli  strain &#8211; of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) containing multiple pPR residues in high yields. We further show that the multi&#8208;site incorporation of pPR in ELPs facilitates the rapid, robust, and non&#8208;toxic fluorescent labeling of these proteins in bacteria. The evolved variants described in this work can be utilized to produce a variety of protein and biomaterial conjugates and to create efficient minimal tags for protein labeling.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferritin as a Platform for Creating Antiviral Mosaic Nanocages: Prospects for Treating COVID&#8208;19</title>
      <dc:description>
Tackling bottlenecks: Antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement of infection and low or narrow efficacy against strains of a virus are two bottlenecks to antibody therapy and vaccines. To tackle them, I propose using ferritin to develop novel antiviral mosaic nanocages that could deliver a cocktail of antibodies, nanobodies, or a combination of therapeutics, deceive a virus, or elicit a broad neutralizing antibody response.







Abstract
Infectious diseases are a continues threat to human health and the economy worldwide. The latest example is the global pandemic of COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Antibody therapy and vaccines are promising approaches to treat the disease; however, they have bottlenecks: they might have low efficacy or narrow breadth due to the continuous emergence of new strains of the virus or antibodies could cause antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. To address these bottlenecks, I propose the use of 24&#8208;meric ferritin for the synthesis of mosaic nanocages to deliver a cocktail of antibodies or nanobodies alone or in combination with another therapeutic, like a nucleotide analogue, to mimic the viral entry process and deceive the virus, or to develop mosaic vaccines. I argue that available data showing the effectiveness of ferritin&#8208;antibody conjugates in targeting specific cells and ferritin&#8208;haemagglutinin nanocages in developing influenza vaccines strongly support my proposals.

Ramoplanins and enduracidins belong to a unique class of nonribosomal peptides with potent antimicrobial activity. Targeted genome mining showed that biosynthetic gene clusters for congeners have been hiding in plain sight within sequenced organisms known for producing other important antimicrobial natural products.

      <title>Molecular Basis of the Antiangiogenic Action of Rosmarinic Acid, a Natural Compound Targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor&#8208;2/FGFR Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Less complex: Right: Fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 (FGF2, orange) interacts with the extracellular domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR, red/blue) and induces the autophosphorylation of FGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that, in turn, leads to complex signal transduction pathways regulating angiogenesis, tissue homeostasis, wound repair and cancer. Left: Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenol present in Laminaceae family plants, binds to the extracellular domain of FGFR and induces dissociation of the FGF2/FGFR complex. NMR and docking approaches demonstrate that RA directly competes with FGF2 for the same binding site and induces allosteric perturbations further destabilizing the complex. Cellular studies show that RA binding inhibits FGF2&#8208;induced FGFR phosphorylation, a key step in FGFR signalling. More information can be found in the full paper by K. Pagano, L. Ragona et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less complex&lt;/b&gt;: Right: Fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 (FGF2, orange) interacts with the extracellular domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR, red/blue) and induces the autophosphorylation of FGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that, in turn, leads to complex signal transduction pathways regulating angiogenesis, tissue homeostasis, wound repair and cancer. Left: Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenol present in Laminaceae family plants, binds to the extracellular domain of FGFR and induces dissociation of the FGF2/FGFR complex. NMR and docking approaches demonstrate that RA directly competes with FGF2 for the same binding site and induces allosteric perturbations further destabilizing the complex. Cellular studies show that RA binding inhibits FGF2&#8208;induced FGFR phosphorylation, a key step in FGFR signalling.

      <dc:description>
The s4U button has more power to catch RNA toys: There is growing interest in RNA techniques. Engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) was discovered to react with guanine, and generate RNA proximity labeling tools. But the RNA labeling efficiency still has room for improvement. We found that the metabolic incorporation of 4&#8208;thiouridine can introduce additional reactive sites for RNA labeling, and improve the efficiency of the peroxidase&#8208;generated biotinylation of RNA.

      <title>Activity&#8208;based profiling of bile salt hydrolysis in the human gut microbiome with beta&#8208;lactam or acrylamide&#8208;based probes</title>
      <dc:description>Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Thereby, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.</dc:description>

      <title>Pyrene tags for the detection of carbohydrates by label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) is widely used for the analysis of biomolecules. Label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI&#8208;MS) is a matrix&#8208;free variant of MALDI&#8208;MS, in which only analytes covalently attached to a laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancer are detected. LALDI&#8208;MS has shown promise in overcoming limitations of MALDI&#8208;MS in terms of sample preparation and MS analysis. In this work, we have developed a series of pyrene&#8208;based LDI reagents (LALDI tags) that can be used for labelling and LALDI&#8208;MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates from complex (biological) samples without the need for additional chemical derivatisation or purification. We have systematically explored the suitability of four pyrene&#8208;based LDI enhancers and three aldehyde&#8208;reactive handles, optimised sample preparation, and demonstrated the use of LALDI tags for the detection of lactose. We have also exemplified the potential of LALDI tags for labelling of carbohydrates in biological samples by direct detection of lactose in cow&#8217;s milk. These results demonstrate that LALDI&#8208;MS is a promising technique for the analysis of reducing carbohydrates in biological samples, and pave the way for the development of LALDI&#8208;MS for glycomics and diagnostics.</dc:description>

      <title>Remote Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter&#8208;Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper&#8208;Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron/proton transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton transfer channels by using two&#8208;layered ONIOM calculations, including the high&#8208;pH proton channel and the primary proton channel. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer, which can be termed as a water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism. In the high&#8208;pH proton channel, the water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel the transfer is performed from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton/electron transfer mechanisms of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase and may extend our understanding of the diverse proton&#8208;coupled ET mechanisms in complicated proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemoenzymatic Semi&#8208;synthesis Enables Efficient Production of Isotopically&#8208;Labelled &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Site&#8208;specific Tyrosine Phosphorylation</title>
      <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) can affect the normal function and pathology of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S), an amyloid fibril forming protein linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Phosphorylation of &#945;S Tyr39 has recently been found to display a dose&#8208;dependent effect on fibril formation kinetics and to alter the morphology of the fibrils. Existing methods to access site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated &#945;S for biochemical studies include total or semi&#8208;synthesis by native chemical ligation (NCL) as well as chemoenzymatic methods to phosphorylate peptides, followed by NCL. Here we investigated a streamlined method to produce large quantities of phosphorylated &#945;S by co&#8208;expressing a kinase with a protein fragment in  E. coli  . We also introduced the use of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) to enable one pot NCL and desulfurization. We compare our optimized methods to previous reports and show that we can achieve the highest yields of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated protein through chemoenzymatic methods using MTG, and that our strategy is uniquely well&#8208;suited to producing  15  N labeled, phosphorylated protein for NMR studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via estimation of the enzyme promiscuous activity in the perhydrolysis reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in the view of availability, atom&#8208;economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling the physiological processes, but unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to prevent the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the peracid formation. According to our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting the hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous media.</dc:description>

      <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
      <dc:description>Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp  Parachartergus fraternus  that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a non&#8208;toxic cell penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.</dc:description>

      <title>Advanced understanding of electron transfer pathway of cytochrome P450s</title>
      <dc:description>Cytochrome P450s (P450s) are heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that participate in carbon source assimilation, natural compound biosynthesis and xenobiotics metabolism in all kingdoms of life. P450s can catalyze various reactions using a wide range of organic compounds, thus exhibiting great potentials in biotechnological applications. The catalytic reactions of P450s are driven by electron equivalents that are sourced from pyridine nucleotides and delivered by cognate or matching redox partners (RPs). The electron transfer (ET) route from RPs to P450s involves one or more redox center&#8208;containing domain. As ET rate is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, the in&#8208;depth understanding of P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural studies of two main types of self&#8208;sufficient P450 will also be summarized.</dc:description>

As ET rate is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, the in&#8208;depth understanding of P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural studies of two main types of self&#8208;sufficient P450 will also be summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Biosynthetic Intermediate Probes for Visualizing and Identifying the Biosynthetic Enzymes of Plant Metabolites</title>
      <dc:description>
See what&#8216;s missing: Biosynthetic study of plant metabolites paves the way for manufacturing plant&#8208;derived drugs by synthetic biology. However, identifying any missing enzymes in a plant metabolic pathway is a formidable challenge. Biosynthetic intermediate probes make potentially useful tools to resolve the challenge by visualizing biosynthetic enzymes to facilitate transcriptome analysis or chemical proteomics approaches for identifying the biosynthetic enzymes.







Abstract
Plant metabolites play important roles in both plant physiology and drug discovery. Taking advantage of new emerging technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), whole genome assembly, bioinformatics, omics&#8208;based strategies have been demonstrated as popular and powerful ways to elucidate complex metabolic pathways in plants. In this viewpoint, biosynthetic intermediates probes have been proposed as the potentinal tools to study the plant natural product biosynthesis via chemical proteomics appoaches or transcriptome analysis.

      <title>Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

      <dc:description>Fluorescent fusion proteins are powerful tools for studying biological processes in living cells, but universal application is limited due to the voluminous size of those tags which may impact the folding, localization or even the biological function of the target protein.

The function of the approach was tested using the examples of covalent derivatization of the transmembrane proteins CD147 as well as the EGF receptor, both presented on human HeLa cells. Specific Trypsiligase recognition of the site of linkage was mediated by the dipeptide sequence Arg&#8208;His added to the proteins&#8217; native N&#8208;termini, pointing outside the cell membrane.

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
