         <title>Interfacial interactions within amyloid protein corona based on 2D MoS2 nanosheets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interfacial interaction within the amyloid protein corona based on MoS  2  &#160;nanomaterial is crucial, both for understanding the biological effects of MoS  2  &#160;nanomaterial and the evolution of amyloid diseases. The specific nano&#8208;bio interface phenomenon of human islet amyloid peptide (hIAPP) and MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet was investigated by using theoretical&#160;and experimental methods. The MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet enables to attract the hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer on its surface through the van der Waals force between them. Especially, the interaction way between two hIAPP peptides might be changed by the MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet. In addition, it is interesting to find that the hIAPP oligomer can stably interact with the MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet in one unique &#8220;standing&#8221; binding mode with an entire exposed &#946;&#8208;sheet surface. All the interaction modes on the surface of MoS  2  &#160;nanosheet can be the essence of amyloid protein corona that may provide the venues to facilitate the fibrillation of hIAPP proteins. Further, it was verified experimentally that MoS  2  &#160;nanosheets could accelerate the fibrillation of hIAPP at a certain concentration mainly based on the newly formed nano&#8208;bio interface. In general, our results provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of the nano&#8208;bio interface within the amyloid protein corona,&#160;and further, it shed light on the pathway of amyloid protein aggregation that is related to the evolution of amyloid diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of two novel oxidases using a high&#8208;throughput activity screen</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of novel enzymes is a challenging task, yet a crucial one, due to their increasing relevance as chemical catalysts and biotechnological tools. In our work we present a high&#8208;throughput screening approach to discovering novel activities. A screen of 96 putative oxidases with 23 substrates led to the discovery of two new enzymes. The first enzyme, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;hexosamine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.29) from  Ralstonia solanacearum,  is a vanillyl alcohol oxidase&#8208;like flavoprotein displaying the highest activity with N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. Before our discovery of the enzyme, its activity was an orphan one &#8208; experimentally characterized but lacking the link to amino acid sequence. The second enzyme, from an uncultured marine euryarchaeota, is a long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase (LCAO, EC 1.1.3.20) active with a range of fatty alcohols, with 1&#8208;dodecanol being the preferred substrate. The enzyme displays no sequence similarity to previously characterised LCAOs, and thus is a completely novel representative of a protein with such activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress on the Physiological Function of Mitochondrial DNA and Its Specific Detection and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and status quo of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) imaging and detection are highlighted in this minireview, and insights for designing excellent mtDNA probes are provided. New treatments for mtDNA&#8208;related diseases are also discussed.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the genetic information of mitochondrion, and its structure is circular double&#8208;stranded. Despite the diminutive size of the mitochondrial genome, mtDNA mutations are an important cause of mitochondrial diseases which are characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial diseases are involved in multiple systems, particularly in the organs that are highly dependent on aerobic metabolism. The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is more complicated since mtDNA mutations can cause various clinical symptoms. To realize more accurate diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial diseases, the detection of mtDNA and the design of drugs acting on it are extremely important. Over the past few years, many probes and therapeutic drugs targeting mtDNA have been developed, making significant contributions to fundamental research including elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases at the genetic level. In this review, we summarize the structure, function, and detection approaches for mtDNA. The most current topics in this field, such as mechanistic exploration and treatment of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related disorders, are also reviewed. Specific attention is given to discussing the design and development of these probes and drugs for mtDNA. We hope that this review will provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the importance of mtDNA, and promote the development of effective molecules for theragnosis of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Design of a Full&#8208;Consensus Glutamate Decarboxylase and Its Application to GABA Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;based protein design has the potential to generate highly functional enzymes. A full consensus glutamate decarboxylase, FcGAD, has high thermal stability and catalytic rate, which can be used in the synthesis of gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA). Utilizing E. coli which express FcGAD as biocatalyst, we achieved the synthesis of GABA at gram scale in a one&#8208;pot reaction.







Abstract
Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyses the decarboxylation of L&#8208;glutamate to gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA). Improvement of the enzymatic properties of GAD is important for the low&#8208;cost synthesis of GABA. In this study, utilizing sequences of enzymes homologous with GAD from lactic acid bacteria, highly mutated GADs were designed using sequence&#8208;based protein design methods. Two mutated GADs, FcGAD and AncGAD, generated by full&#8208;consensus design and ancestral sequence reconstruction, had more desirable properties than native GADs. With respect to thermal stability, the half&#8208;life of the designed GADs was about 10&#8201;&#176;C higher than that of native GAD. The productivity of FcGAD was considerably higher than those of known GADs; more than 250&#8197;mg/L of purified enzyme could be produced in the E. coli expression system. In a production test using 26.4&#8197;g of l&#8208;glutamate and 3.0&#8197;g of resting cells, 17.2&#8197;g of GABA could be prepared within one hour, without purification, in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.

         <title>The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted supramolecular recognition? CD spectroscopy of Yariv reagent dyes identifies a correlation between positive couplets in CD spectra, indicative of helical chirality, and the ability of the dyes to bind arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs).







Abstract
Yariv reagents are glycosylated triphenylazo dyes that bind to arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), proteoglycans found in plant cell walls that are integral for plant growth and development. Yariv reagents are widely utilized as imaging, purification, and quantification tools for AGPs and represent the only small molecule probe for interrogating AGP function. The ability of Yariv reagents to bind to AGPs is dependent on the structure of the terminal glycoside on the dye. The reason for this selectivity has not been understood until the present work. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the Yariv reagents form supramolecular aggregates with helical chirality. More significantly, the ability of the Yariv reagent to bind AGPs is correlated with this helical chirality. This finding paves the way towards developing a more detailed understanding of the nature of the Yariv&#8208;AGP complex, and the design of AGP&#8208;binding reagents with higher affinities and selectivities.

         <title>Scalable and selective &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid synthesis catalyzed by promiscuous L&#8208;threonine transaldolase ObiH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways possess broad potential for the selective synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. However, the practical application of these enzymes for organic synthesis is dependent on the development of efficient, economical, operationally&#8208;simple and well&#8208;characterized systems for preparative scale reactions. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap for the selective biocatalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, which are important synthetic building blocks. To achieve this goal, we demonstrated the ability of ObiH, an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase, to achieve selective milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of a diverse array of non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs) using a scalable whole cell platform. We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids possessing broad functional&#8208;group diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ObiH&#8208;generated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids could be modified through additional transformations to access important motifs, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and substituted &#945;&#8208;keto acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Creation of an engineered amide synthetase biocatalyst by the rational separation of a two&#8208;step nitrile synthetase.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly&#8208;used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitriles synthetases (NSs) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The B. subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is a NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly&#8208;conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Head Comparison of Selected Extra&#8208; and Intracellular CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules on Their CO&#8208;Releasing and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beneficial anti&#8208;inflammatory effects of carbon monoxide were studied using differently triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs). In particular, some acyloxy&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes acting as enzyme&#8208;triggered CORMs showed pronounced cellular effects regardless of whether CO release was intra&#8208; or extracellular.







Abstract
Over the past decade, a variety of carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed and tested. Some CORMs spontaneously release CO once in solution, while others require a trigger mechanism to release the bound CO from its molecular complex. The modulation of biological systems by CORMs depends largely on the spatiotemporal release of CO, which likely differs among the different types of CORMs. In spontaneously releasing CORMs, CO is released extracellularly and crosses the cell membrane to interact with intracellular targets. Other CORMs can directly release CO intracellularly, which may be a more efficient method to modulate biological systems. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of extracellular and intracellular CO&#8208;releasing CORMs that either release CO spontaneously or require an enzymatic trigger. The efficacy of such CORMs to modulate HO&#8208;1 and VCAM&#8208;1 expression in TNF&#8208;&#945;&#8208;stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was evaluated.

         <title>Orthogonal Peptide&#8208;Templated Labeling Elucidates Lateral ETAR/ETBR Proximity and Reveals Altered Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GPCR&#8208;GPCR interactions can influence signaling events but are difficult to investigate in live cell setups. Here, we report on an orthogonal labeling approach, which excludes intracellular background signals and allows the installment of different dyes. Using this technique, the interaction of homo&#8208;receptors demonstrated for different GPCRs, but hetero&#8208;interaction was limited to ETAR/ETBR. For the latter, impaired ETBR signaling was shown.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that lateral GPCR interactions in the cell membrane can impact signaling profiles. Here, we report on a one&#8208;step labeling method of multiple membrane&#8208;embedded GPCRs. Based on short peptide tags, complementary probes transfer the cargo (e.&#8201;g. a fluorescent dye) by an acyl transfer reaction with high spatial and temporal resolution within 5&#8197;min. We applied this approach to four receptors of the cardiovascular system: the endothelin receptor A and B (ETAR and ETBR), angiotensin II receptor type 1, and apelin. Wild type&#8208;like G protein activation after N&#8208;terminal modification was demonstrated for all receptor species. Using FRET&#8208;competent dyes, a constitutive proximity between hetero&#8208;receptors was limited to ETAR/ETBR. Further, we demonstrate, that ETAR expression regulates the signaling of co&#8208;expressed ETBR. Our orthogonal peptide&#8208;templated labeling of different GPCRs provides novel insight into the regulation of GPCR signaling.

         <title>Novel Antibacterial Targets in Protein Biogenesis Pathways</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial protein biogenesis pathways are attractive antibacterial targets since many of them, or their substrates, are essential for bacterial survival. We review the various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis that show promise as potential antibacterial targets. This information will facilitate rational antibiotic design to help combat antibacterial resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat due to the ability of bacteria to quickly evolve in response to the selection pressure induced by anti&#8208;infective drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against resistant bacteria. In this review, we discuss pathways involving bacterial protein biogenesis as attractive antibacterial targets since many of them are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. We discuss the structural understanding of various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis, which in turn can be utilized for rational antibiotic design. We highlight efforts made towards developing inhibitors of these pathways with insights into future possibilities and challenges. We also briefly discuss other potential targets related to protein biogenesis.

         <title>Varying the Directionality of Protein Catalysts for Aldol and Retro&#8208;aldol Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural aldolase enzymes and created retro&#8208;aldolase protein catalysts often catalyze both aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions depending on the concentrations of the reactants and the products. Here, we report that the directionality of protein catalysts can be altered by replacing one amino acid. The protein catalyst derived from a scaffold of a previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst catalyzed aldol reactions more efficiently than the previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst. The retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst efficiently catalyzed the retro&#8208;aldol reaction but was less efficient in catalyzing the aldol reaction. The results indicated that protein catalysts with varying levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions can be generated from the same protein scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Removable Photocaging Groups Accepted by MjMAT Variant: Structural Basis and Compatibility with DNA and RNA Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MAT (methionine adenosyltransferase) exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red&#8208;shifted ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl (ONB)&#8208;derivatives and is compatible with methyltransferases from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. This enables photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light. The crystal structure reveals details about substrate accommodation.







Abstract
Methylation and demethylation of DNA, RNA and proteins constitutes a major regulatory mechanism in epigenetic processes. Investigations would benefit from the ability to install photo&#8208;cleavable groups at methyltransferase target sites that block interactions with reader proteins until removed by non&#8208;damaging light in the visible spectrum. Engineered methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) have been exploited in cascade reactions with methyltransferases (MTases) to modify biomolecules with non&#8208;natural groups, including first evidence for accepting photo&#8208;cleavable groups. We show that an engineered MAT from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (PC&#8208;MjMAT) is 308&#8208;fold more efficient at converting ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;(ONB)&#8208;homocysteine than the wildtype enzyme. PC&#8208;MjMAT is active over a broad range of temperatures and compatible with MTases from mesophilic organisms. We solved the crystal structures of wildtype and PC&#8208;MjMAT in complex with AdoONB and a red&#8208;shifted derivative thereof. These structures reveal that aromatic stacking interactions within the ligands are key to accommodating the photocaging groups in PC&#8208;MjMAT. The enlargement of the binding pocket eliminates steric clashes to enable AdoMet analogue binding. Importantly, PC&#8208;MjMAT exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red&#8208;shifted ONB&#8208;derivatives enabling photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light.

         <title>Photoactivation of Innate Immunity Receptor TLR8 in Live Mammalian Cells by Genetic Encoding of Photocaged Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic balance between the resting and active states of the immune response is essential for the host defense against invasion. Photocontrol of the innate immunity receptor TLR8 achieved precise regulation and dynamics programming. By genetic encoding of unnatural, photocaged tyrosine into TLR8, the receptor can be regulated by UV light with high spatiotemporal resolution, making it a suitable tool for TLR8 biological studies. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Yin et&#8197;al.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hydrogen Peroxide Responsive Organoborons for Biological and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elevated H2O2 has been observed under various disease conditions. Due to the chemoselective reaction between boron functional groups and H2O2, numerous deactivated organoborons have been developed for H2O2&#8208;mediated activation to form an active hydroxyl product. These include H2O2 bioimaging probes and H2O2&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;prochelators, prodrugs, and theranostic agents.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable reactive oxygen species generated endogenously, participating in numerous physiological processes and abnormal pathological conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that a higher level of H2O2 exists in various disease conditions. Thus, H2O2 functions as an ideal target for site&#8208;specific bioimaging and therapeutic targeting. The unique reactivity of organoborons with H2O2 provides a method for developing chemoselective molecules for biological and biomedical applications. This review highlights the design and application of boron&#8208;derived molecules for H2O2 detection, and the utility of boron moieties toward masking reactive compounds leading to the development of metal prochelators and prodrugs for selectively delivering an active species at the target sites with elevated H2O2 levels. Additionally, the emergence of H2O2&#8208;responsive theranostic agents consisting of both therapeutic and diagnostic moieties in one integrated system are discussed. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of the role of boron&#8208;derived molecules toward biological and pharmacological applications.

Computational analyses involving the quantitative assessment of the associated energetics, the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP), and electron density derived topological parameters, namely, Quantum theory of Atom in Molecules (QTAIM), analyses, and NBO (Natural Bond Orbital) based calculations, have been performed to unequivocally establish the strength, stabilizing and attractive role of chalcogen bonds in the solid&#8208;state. This investigation has been performed in molecules from both the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Diselenide&#8208;based S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic: This study demonstrates the potential of 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine conjugated with Pro&#8208;His dipeptide as a novel S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic, which catalytically promotes cysteinyl S&#8208;denitrosylation in the presence of a thiol co&#8208;substrate and prevents protein misfolding caused by S&#8208;nitrosylation. The cover image shows how the catalytic cycle involved a highly reactive diselenol species forming a &#947;&#8208;turn structure, and highlights the mystique of the reaction controlled by Selene, goddess of the moon and origin of the name for the element, selenium.

         <title>Defluorination Capability of l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid Dehalogenases in the HAD&#8208;Like Hydrolase Superfamily Correlates with Active Site Compactness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
You have to come close if you want a reaction: Several members of the haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like hydrolases superfamily were found to break carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds. The only features that differentiate between them and other family members unable to achieve this feat were small changes in distance between selected active site residues and protein dynamics leading to tighter interactions between protein and halogen.







Abstract
l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid dehalogenases, industrially and environmentally important enzymes that catalyse cleavage of the carbon&#8208;halogen bond in S&#8208;2&#8208;halocarboxylic acids, were known to hydrolyse chlorinated, brominated and iodinated substrates but no activity towards fluorinated compounds had been reported. A screen for novel dehalogenase activities revealed four l&#8208;2&#8208;haloacid dehalogenases capable of defluorination. We now report crystal structures for two of these enzymes, Bpro0530 and Rha0230, as well as for the related proteins PA0810 and RSc1362, which hydrolyse chloroacetate but not fluoroacetate, all at &#8764;2.2&#8197;&#197; resolution. Overall structure and active sites of these enzymes are highly similar. In molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, only the defluorinating enzymes sample more compact conformations, which in turn allow more effective interactions with the small fluorine atom. Structural constraints, based on X&#8208;ray structures and MD calculations, correctly predict the defluorination activity of the homologous enzyme ST2570.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotide Modified with Disulfide Units Induces Efficient Exon Skipping in mdx Myotubes through Enhanced Membrane Permeability and Nucleus Internalization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced cellular uptake was achieved using a disulfide&#8208;unit&#8208;containing membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotide (MPON). Long&#8208;term incubation enabled their nuclear internalization and subsequent exon skipping.







Abstract
We have found that antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA molecules modified with repeat structures of disulfide units can be directly introduced into the cytoplasm and exhibit a suppressive effect on gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of cellular uptake of these membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotides (MPONs). Time&#8208;course analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the uptake of MPONs from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm reached 50&#8201;% of the total uptake in about 5&#8197;min. In addition, analysis of the plasma membrane proteins to which MPONs bind, identified several proteins, including voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel. Next, we analyzed the behavior of MPONs in the cell and found them to be abundant in the nucleus as early as 24&#8197;h after addition with the amount increasing further after 48 and 72&#8197;h. The amount of MPONs was 2.5&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified oligonucleotides in the nucleus after 72&#8197;h. We also designed antisense oligonucleotides and evaluated the effect of MPONs on mRNA exon skipping using DMD model cells; MPONs caused exon skipping with 69&#8201;% efficiency after 72&#8197;h, which was three times higher than the rate of the control. In summary, the high capacity for intracytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of MPONs is expected to be useful for therapeutic strategies targeting exon skipping.

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Fluorination as Modification for Peptide&#8208;Based Fusion Inhibitors against HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated variants of an HIV entry inhibitor inspired by clinically applied T20 were systematically studied. The results reveal six&#8208;helix bundle formation for the fluorine&#8208;containing sequences in the presence of wildtype N&#8208;terminal heptad repeat peptide of gp41. X&#8208;ray crystal structures confirm favorable packing of the fluorinated groups and in&#8197;vitro infection experiments with CEMx174 SEAP cells reveal nanomolar inhibition.







Abstract
With the emergence of novel viruses, the development of new antivirals is more urgent than ever. A key step in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) infection is six&#8208;helix bundle formation within the envelope protein subunit gp41. Selective disruption of bundle formation by peptides has been shown to be effective; however, these drugs, exemplified by T20, are prone to rapid clearance from the patient. The incorporation of non&#8208;natural amino acids is known to improve these pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we evaluate a peptide inhibitor in which a critical Ile residue is replaced by fluorinated analogues. We characterized the influence of the fluorinated analogues on the biophysical properties of the peptide. Furthermore, we show that the fluorinated peptides can block HIV&#8208;1 infection of target cells at nanomolar levels. These findings demonstrate that fluorinated amino acids are appropriate tools for the development of novel peptide therapeutics.

         <title>The Inhibition Effect of Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking between Probes in Photo&#8208;Induced Double Duplex Invasion DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced double duplex invasion (pDDI) was enabled by ultrafast DNA photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK) and photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitor, 5&#8208;cyanouracil(CNU). In this study, we evaluated the effect on pDDI efficiency using spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS), which are considered to have photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability, similar to CNU. As a result, CNU had the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were found to be not very different.







Abstract
Double duplex invasion (DDI) DNA is a useful antigene method that inhibits expression of genomic DNA. We succeeded in performing photoinduced&#8208;DDI (pDDI) using ultrafast photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking. 5&#8208;Cyanouracil (CNU) has been used in pDDI to inhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking between probes, but its importance has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS) that exhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability similar to that of CNU. CNU exhibited the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were not very different. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect was better with S and dS than with thymidine (T). Conversely, the thermal stability was significantly lower with S and dS than with T. The results suggest that the pDDI efficiency is determined by the balance between the photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and the thermal stability, which is the introduction efficiency for double&#8208;stranded DNA. Therefore, CNU, which has a photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and a high Tm value, showed the highest inhibitory efficiency.

In this study, we evaluated the effect on pDDI efficiency using spacer (S) and d-spacer (dS), which are considered to have photo-cross-linking ability, similar to &lt;sup&gt;CN&lt;/sup&gt;U.

We succeeded in performing photoinduced-DDI (pDDI) using ultrafast photo-cross-linking. 5-Cyanouracil (&lt;sup&gt;CN&lt;/sup&gt;U) has been used in pDDI to inhibit photo-cross-linking between probes, but its importance has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of spacer (S) and d-spacer (dS) that exhibit photo-cross-linking ability similar to that of &lt;sup&gt;CN&lt;/sup&gt;U. &lt;sup&gt;CN&lt;/sup&gt;U exhibited the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were not very different. The photo-cross-linking inhibitory effect was better with S and dS than with thymidine (T). Conversely, the thermal stability was significantly lower with S and dS than with T. The results suggest that the pDDI efficiency is determined by the balance between the photo-cross-linking inhibitory effect and the thermal stability, which is the introduction efficiency for double-stranded DNA. Therefore, &lt;sup&gt;CN&lt;/sup&gt;U, which has a photo-cross-linking inhibitory effect and a high &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value, showed the highest inhibitory efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Target&#8208;Mediated 5&#8217;&#8208;Exonuclease Digestion of DNA Aptamers with RecJ to Modulate Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protect and detect: a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 5&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ followed by introduction of a circular template and phi29 DNA polymerase to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing low picomolar detection limits for a protein (thrombin) and a small molecule (OTA) target.







Abstract
We report a new method for biosensing based on the target&#8208;mediated resistance of DNA aptamers against 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion, allowing them to act as primers for rolling circle amplification (RCA). A target&#8208;bound DNA strand containing an aptamer region on the 5&#8217;&#8208;end and a primer region on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end is protected from 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ exonuclease in a target&#8208;dependent manner. As the protected aptamer is at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end, the exposed primer on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template to generate a turn&#8208;on sensor. Without target, RecJ digests the primer and prevents RCA from occurring, allowing quantitative fluorescence detection of both thrombin, a protein, and ochratoxin A (OTA), a small molecule, at picomolar concentrations.

         <title>Controlling Enzymatic Activity by Modulating the Oligomerization State via Chemical Rescue and Optical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous control of the association state of enzyme complexes can be used to switch activity. A cation&#8208;&#960; bond in the oligomerization interface was disrupted either by a Lys&#8208;to&#8208;Cys mutation or by incorporation of an unnatural amino acid (UAA), resulting in complex disassembly and loss of activity. For switching activity on again, Lys was chemically rescued or the UAA was decaged by light. The complex was reformed and the activity was fully restored.







Abstract
Selective switching of enzymatic activity has been a longstanding goal in synthetic biology. Drastic changes in activity upon mutational manipulation of the oligomerization state of enzymes have frequently been reported in the literature, but scarcely exploited for switching. Using geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase as a model, we demonstrate that catalytic activity can be efficiently controlled by exogenous modulation of the association state. We introduced a lysine&#8208;to&#8208;cysteine mutation, leading to the breakdown of the active hexamer into dimers with impaired catalytic efficiency. Addition of bromoethylamine chemically rescued the enzyme by restoring hexamerization and activity. As an alternative method, we incorporated the photosensitive unnatural amino acid o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;O&#8208;tyrosine (ONBY) into the hexamerization interface. This again led to inactive dimers, but the hexameric state and activity could be recovered by UV&#8208;light induced cleavage of ONBY. For both approaches, we obtained switching factors greater than 350&#8208;fold, which compares favorably with previously reported activity changes that were caused by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

         <title>Engineering of a plant isoprenyl diphosphate synthase for development of irregular coupling activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We performed mutagenesis on a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (IDS), neryl diphosphate synthase from Solanum lycopersicum (SlNPPS), that has a structurally related analogue performing non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling of two dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) units, lavandulyl diphosphate synthase from Lavandula x intermedia (LiLPPS). Wild&#8208;type SlNPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in cis&#8208;orientation resulting in the formation of neryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able to catalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregular monoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis of their dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The second compound is the trans&#8208;isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregular cyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregular activity of SlNPPS constitutes 0.4% of its regular activity and is revealed only if the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in absence of IPP. The exchange of asparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling. While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutant reaches 13.1 % of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regular IDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at the development of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Predictive engineering of class I terpene synthases using experimental and computational approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenoids are a highly diverse group of natural products with considerable industrial interest. Increasingly, engineered microbes are used for the production of terpenoids to replace natural extracts and chemical synthesis. Terpene synthases (TSs) show a high level of functional plasticity and are responsible for the vast structural diversity observed in natural terpenoids. Their relatively inert active sites guide intrinsically reactive linear carbocation intermediates along one of many cyclisation paths via exertion of subtle steric and electrostatic control. Due to the absence of a strong protein interaction with these intermediates, there is a remarkable lack of sequence&#8208;function relationship within the TS family, making product&#8208;outcome predictions from sequences alone challenging. This, in combination with the fact that many TSs produce multiple products from a single substrate hampers the design and use of TSs in the biomanufacturing of terpenoids. This review highlights recent advances in genome mining, computational modelling, high&#8208;throughput screening, and machine&#8208;learning that will allow more predictive engineering of these fascinating enzymes in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>HaloTag Engineering for Enhanced Fluorogenicity and Kinetics with a Styrylpyridium Dye</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein engineering techniques were implemented to improve the fluorogenicity and kinetics of an accessible dye&#8208;HaloTag construct. The engineered protein showed dramatically improved fluorescent properties with purified HaloTag and enabled live&#8208;cell imaging in mammalian cells.







Abstract
HaloTag is a small self&#8208;labeling protein that is frequently used for creating fluorescent reporters in living cells. The small&#8208;molecule dyes used with HaloTag are almost exclusively based on rhodamine scaffolds, which are often expensive and challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report the engineering of HaloTag for use with a chemically accessible, inexpensive fluorophore based on the dimethylamino&#8208;styrylpyridium dye. Through directed evolution, the maximum fluorogenicity and the apparent second&#8208;order bioconjugation rate constants could be improved up to 4&#8208;fold and 42&#8208;fold, respectively. One of the top variants, HT&#8208;SP5, enabled reliable imaging in mammalian cells, with a 113&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement over the parent protein. Additionally, crystallographic characterization of selected mutants suggests the chemical origin of the fluorescent enhancement. The improved dye system offers a valuable tool for imaging and illustrates the viability of engineering self&#8208;labeling proteins for alternative fluorophores.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Phage&#8208;Displayed Helix&#8208;Loop&#8208;Helix Peptides to Construct Kinase&#8208;Focused Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptide libraries: A phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptide library was chemically modified with adenosine as an anchor molecule for binding to the ATP binding site of protein kinase. This approach to the construction of target&#8208;focused HLH peptide libraries would enable the efficient generation of selective inhibitors not only for protein kinases, but also for other proteins of interest.







Abstract
Conformationally constrained peptides hold promise as molecular tools in chemical biology and as a new modality in drug discovery. The construction and screening of a target&#8208;focused library could be a promising approach for the generation of de novo ligands or inhibitors against target proteins. Here, we have prepared a protein kinase&#8208;focused library by chemically modifying helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptides displayed on phage and subsequently tethered to adenosine. The library was screened against aurora kinase A (AurA). The selected HLH peptide Bip&#8208;3 retained the &#945;&#8208;helical structure and bound to AurA with a KD value of 13.7&#8197;&#956;M. Bip&#8208;3 and the adenosine&#8208;tethered peptide Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc provided IC50 values of 103&#8197;&#956;M and 7.7&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, suggesting that Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc bivalently inhibited AurA. In addition, the selectivity of Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc to several protein kinases was tested, and was highest against AurA. These results demonstrate that chemical modification can enable the construction of a kinase&#8208;focused library of phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptides.

         <title>Harnessing P450 Enzyme for Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attention in synthetic biology and biotechnology. To leverage their catalytic efficiency, different strategies have been developed including substrate engineering, allosteric effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, one&#8208;pot multienzyme reactions (OPME), and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization. These research efforts also have important implications for the study of other enzymes and many fields of application. More information can be found in the Minireview by L. Zhang and Q. Wang.

         <title>Visual Detection of Adenosine Triphosphate by Taylor Rising: A Simple Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Method Based on Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid run! A new point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing method for adenosine triphosphate detection was developed based on Taylor rising. This approach is quite general, includes naked eye quantification and does not require cumbersome equipment.







Abstract
Rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) is an extremely critical mission in practical applications, especially for rigorous military medicine, home health care, and in the third world. Here, we report a visual POCT method for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection based on Taylor rising in the corner of quadratic geometries between two rod surfaces. We discuss the principle of Taylor rising, demonstrating that it is significantly influenced by contact angle, surface tension, and density of the sample, which are controlled by ATP&#8208;dependent rolling circle amplification (RCA). In the presence of ATP, RCA reaction effectively suppresses Taylor&#8208;rising behavior, due to the increased contact angle, density, and decreased surface tension. Without addition of ATP, untriggered RCA reaction is favorable for Taylor rising, resulting in a significant height. With this proposed method, visual sensitive detection of ATP without the aid of other instruments is realized with only a 5 &#956;L droplet, which has good selectivity and a low detection limit (17&#8197;nM). Importantly, this visual method provides a promising POCT tool for user&#8208;friendly molecular diagnostics.

         <title>Chemical Biology Toolbox to Visualize Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical biology methods to visualize protein aggregation in live cells are presented in this review. The methods discussed include fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small molecule probes.







Abstract
Protein misfolding and aggregation is a complex biochemical process and has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. Developing novel chemical and biological tools and approaches to visualize aggregated proteins in live cells is in high demand for mechanistic studies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the recent developments in the chemical biology toolbox applied to protein aggregation studies in live cells. These methods exploited fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small&#8208;molecule probes to visualize the protein&#8208;aggregation process, detect proteome stresses, and quantify the protein homeostasis network capacity. Inspired by these seminal works, we have generalized design principles for the development of new detection methods and probes in the future that will illuminate this important biological process.

Inspired by these seminal works, we have generalized design principles for the development of new detection methods and probes in the future that will illuminate this important biological process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a Stable Isostere of Malonyllysine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine malonylation is a recently characterized posttranslational modification involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and gene expression. One unique feature of this posttranslational modification is its potential susceptibility to decarboxylation, which poses possible challenges to its study. As a step towards addressing these challenges, here we report the synthesis and evaluation of a stable isostere of malonyllysine. First, we find that synthetic substitution of the malonyl group with a tetrazole isostere results in amino acids resistant to thermal decarboxylation. Next, we demonstrate that protected variants of this amino acid are readily incorporated into peptides. Finally, we show that tetrazole isosteres of malonyllysine can be recognized by anti&#8208;malonyllysine antibodies and histone deacylases, validating their ability to mimic features of the endogenous lysine modification. Overall, this study establishes a new chemical strategy for stably mimicking a metabolite&#8208;derived posttranslational modification, providing a foothold for tool development and functional analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Weak Binding and Spectroscopic Signature of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 Interaction with RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of nsp14 protein with nascent RNA for the removal of mismatched nucleotide from the newly synthesized RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is reported.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 non&#8208;structural protein 14 (nsp14), known as exoribonuclease is encoded from the large polyprotein of viral genome and is a major constituent of the transcription replication complex (TRC) machinery of the viral RNA synthesis. This protein is highly conserved among the coronaviruses and is a potential target for the development of a therapeutic drug. Here, we report the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 expression, show its structural characterization, and ss&#8208;RNA exonuclease activity through vibrational and electronic spectroscopies. The deconvolution of amide&#8208;I band in the FTIR spectrum of the protein revealed a composition of 35&#8201;% &#945;&#8208;helix and 25&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;sheets. The binding between protein and RNA is evidenced from the spectral changes in the amide&#8208;I region of the nsp14, showing protein conformational changes during the binding process. A value of 20.60&#177;3.81&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 of the binding constant (KD) is obtained for nsp14/RNA complex. The findings reported here can motivate further studies to develop structural models for better understanding the mechanism of exonuclease enzymes for correcting the viral genome and can help in the development of drugs against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Structural Studies Provide New Insights into the Role of Lysine Acetylation on Substrate Recognition by CARM1 and Inform the Design of Potent Peptidomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidomimetics based on the histone H3 tail peptide were used in co&#8208;crystallization studies with coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) to investigate the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. These findings also provide new insights into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation and the development of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of CARM1.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin provides a communication system for the regulation of gene expression. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role that such crosstalk between PTMs plays in chromatin recognition. In this study, (bio)chemical and structural approaches were applied to specifically probe the impact of acetylation of Lys18 in the histone H3 tail peptide on peptide recognition by the protein methyltransferase coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). Peptidomimetics that recapitulate the transition state of protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferases, were designed based on the H3 peptide wherein the target Arg17 was flanked by either a free or an acetylated lysine. Structural studies with these peptidomimetics and the catalytic domain of CARM1 provide new insights into the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. While the co&#8208;crystal structures reveal that lysine acetylation results in minor conformational differences for both CARM1 and the H3 peptide, acetylation of Lys18 does lead to additional interactions (Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) and likely reduces the cost of desolvation upon binding, resulting in increased affinity. Informed by these findings a series of smaller peptidomimetics were also prepared and found to maintain potent and selective CARM1 inhibition. These findings provide new insights both into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation as well as towards the development of peptidomimetic CARM1 inhibitors.

         <title>Harnessing Fluorescent Moenomycin A Antibiotics for Bacterial Cell Wall Imaging Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moenomycin A (MoeA)&#8208;based fluorescent probes were developed for imaging the bacterial cell wall through specific labeling of transglycosylases. The strategy provided stunning imaging probes for mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains.







Abstract
The imaging of peptidoglycan (PGN) dynamics in living bacteria facilitates the understanding of PGN biosynthesis and wall&#8208;targeting antibiotics. The main tools for imaging bacterial PGN are fluorescent probes, such as the well&#8208;known PGN metabolic labeling probes. However, fluorescent small&#8208;molecule probes for labeling key PGN&#8208;synthesizing enzymes, especially for transglycosylases (TGases), remain to be explored. In this work, the first imaging probe for labeling TGase in bacterial cell wall studies is reported. We synthesized various fluorescent MoeA&#8208;based molecules by derivatizing the natural antibiotic moenomycin A (MoeA), and used them to label TGases in living bacteria, monitor bacterial growth and division cycles by time&#8208;lapse imaging, and study cell wall growth in the mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains when the &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based probes were unsuitable.

         <title>The Diverse Antimicrobial Activities of Human Milk Oligosaccharides against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exert various activities against Group B Streptococcus (GBS) including inhibition of bacterial growth, enhanced penetrance, and efficacy of antibiotics via bacterial cell permeabilization, and inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation. This review discusses the most recent studies on the interaction between HMOs and GBS.







Abstract
Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathobiont that is the etiological cause of severe perinatal infections. GBS can colonize the vagina of pregnant patients and invade tissues causing ascending infections of the gravid reproductive tract that lead to adverse outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal or fetal demise. Additionally, transmission of GBS during labor or breastfeeding can also cause invasive infections of neonates and infants. However, human milk has also been shown to have protective effects against infection; a characteristic that is likely derived from antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of molecules that comprise human milk. Recent evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), short&#8208;chain sugars that comprise 8&#8211;20&#8201;% of breast milk, have antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and other bacterial pathogens. Additionally, HMOs have been shown to potentiate the activity of antibiotics against GBS. This review presents the most recent published work that studies the interaction between HMOs and GBS.

         <title>Peptides derived from vascular endothelial growth factor B show potent binding to neuropilin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate significant pathways in angiogenesis, myocardial and neuronal protection, metabolism, and cancer progression. The VEGF&#8208;B isoform is involved in cell survival, anti&#8208;apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms, through binding to VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin&#8208;1 (NRP&#8208;1).  We employed surface plasmon resonance technology and X&#8208;ray crystallography to analyse the molecular basis of the interaction between VEGF&#8208;B and the b1 domain of NRP&#8208;1, and developed VEGF&#8208;B &#8211; C&#8208;terminus derived peptides to be used as chemical tools for studying VEGF&#8208;B &#8211; NRP&#8208;1 related pathways.  Peptide lipidation was used as a means to stabilise the peptides. VEGF&#8208;B &#8211; derived peptides containing a C&#8208;terminal arginine show potent binding to NRP1&#8208;b1. Peptide lipidation increased binding residence time and improved plasma stability. A crystal structure of a peptide with NRP&#8208;1 demonstrated that VEGF&#8208;B peptides bind at the canonical C&#8208;terminal Arginine binding site. VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus imparts higher affinity for NRP&#8208;1 than the corresponding VEGF&#8208;A  165  region. This tight binding may impact on the activity and selectivity of the full&#8208;length protein. The VEGF&#8208;B  167  derived peptides were more effective than VEGF&#8208;A  165  peptides in blocking functional phosphorylation events. Blockers of VEGF&#8208;B function have potential applications in diabetes and non&#8208;alcoholic fatty liver disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthopsin&#8208;like Systems via Site&#8208;Specific Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Retinoic Acid Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of light&#8208;responsive proteins to control both living or synthetic cells, is at the core of the expanding fields of optogenetics and synthetic biology. It is thus apparent that a richer reaction toolbox for the preparation of such systems is of fundamental importance. Here, we provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration that Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed to perform a facile site&#8208;specific, irreversible and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket and yielding an unnatural chromophore with an extended &#960;&#8208;system. In doing so we effectively open the path to the in vitro preparation of a library of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors. We argue that such library, made of variable unnatural chromophores inserted in an easy to mutate and crystallize retinoic acid transporter, significantly expand the scope of the recently introduced rhodopsin mimics as both optogenetic and "lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule" tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Transaminase Activity by Encapsulation in Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus megaterium transaminase (BmTA) shows high immobilization efficiency in upper critical solution temperature type poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) (pNAGA) hydrogels, and high activity in the swollen hydrogel. Upon temperature decrease, the hydrogel swelling and enzyme activity decrease. The deactivation tended to be higher for BmTA immobilized in pNAGA compared to free BmTA due to temperature&#8208;induced hydrogel shrinking.







Abstract
Smart hydrogels hold much potential for biocatalysis, not only for the immobilization of enzymes, but also for the control of enzyme activity. We investigated upper critical solution temperature&#8208;type poly N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (pNAGA) hydrogels as a smart matrix for the amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium (BmTA). Physical entrapment of BmTA in pNAGA hydrogels results in high immobilization efficiency (&gt;89&#8201;%) and high activity (97&#8201;%). The temperature&#8208;sensitiveness of pNAGA is preserved upon immobilization of BmTA and shows a gradual deswelling upon temperature reduction. While enzyme activity is mainly controlled by temperature, deactivation tended to be higher for immobilized BmTA (&#8776;62&#8211;68&#8201;%) than for free BmTA (&#8776;44&#8201;%), suggesting a deactivating effect due to deswelling of the pNAGA gel. Although the deactivation in response to hydrogel deswelling is not yet suitable for controlling enzyme activity sufficiently, it is nevertheless a good starting point for further optimization.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can a common synthetic intermediate be transformed by different functional groups to target different cell organelles? We evaluated the structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes synthesized from the same synthetic intermediate to target nuclei, lysosomes, and mitochondria in live microglial cells.







Abstract
Targeting live cell organelles is essential for imaging, understanding, and controlling specific biochemical processes. Typically, fluorescent probes with distinct structural scaffolds are used to target specific cell organelles. Here, we have designed a modular one&#8208;step synthetic strategy using a common reaction intermediate to develop new lysosomal, mitochondrial, and nucleus&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes that are all based on a single boron dipyrromethane scaffold. The divergent cell organelle targeting was achieved by synthesizing probes with specific functional group changes to the central scaffold resulting in differential fluorescence and pKa. Specifically, we show that the functional group transformation of the same scaffold influences cellular localization and specificity of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes in live primary microglial cells with pKa values ranging from &#8764;3.2&#8211;6.0. We introduce a structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) framework to target nuclei (NucShine), lysosomes (LysoShine), and mitochondria (MitoShine) in live microglia. This work will result in future applications of SOR beyond imaging to target and control organelle&#8208;specific biochemical processes in disease&#8208;specific models.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Detection of Enzymatic Alcohol Dehydrogenase Activity in Microfluidic Droplets with a Direct Fluorogenic Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh throughput screening assay of alcohol dehydrogenases in microfluidic droplets becomes possible with substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore. With a 100&#8197;nM detection threshold and no appreciable leaking even after 6 weeks, less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average is robustly detectable.







Abstract
The exploration of large DNA libraries of metagenomic or synthetic origin is greatly facilitated by ultrahigh&#8208;throughput assays that use monodisperse water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets as sequestered reaction compartments. Millions of samples can be generated and analysed in microfluidic devices at kHz speeds, requiring only micrograms of reagents. The scope of this powerful platform for the discovery of new sequence space is, however, hampered by the limited availability of assay substrates, restricting the functions and reaction types that can be investigated. Here, we broaden the scope of detectable biochemical transformations in droplet microfluidics by introducing the first fluorogenic assay for alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in this format. We have synthesized substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore (8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;pyrenetrisulfonic acid, HPTS) when enzymatic turnover occurs. Pyranine is well retained in droplets for &gt;6 weeks (i.&#8201;e. 14&#8208;times longer than fluorescein), avoiding product leakage and ensuring excellent assay sensitivity. Product concentrations as low as 100&#8197;nM were successfully detected, corresponding to less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average. The potential of our substrate design was demonstrated by efficient recovery of a bona fide ADH with an &gt;800&#8208;fold enrichment. The repertoire of droplet screening is enlarged by this sensitive and direct fluorogenic assay to identify dehydrogenases for biocatalytic applications.

The scope of this powerful platform for the discovery of new sequence space is, however, hampered by the limited availability of assay substrates, restricting the functions and reaction types that can be investigated. Here, we broaden the scope of detectable biochemical transformations in droplet microfluidics by introducing the first fluorogenic assay for alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in this format. We have synthesized substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore (8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid, HPTS) when enzymatic turnover occurs. Pyranine is well retained in droplets for &amp;gt;6 weeks (i.&#8201;e. 14-times longer than fluorescein), avoiding product leakage and ensuring excellent assay sensitivity. Product concentrations as low as 100&#8197;nM were successfully detected, corresponding to less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average. The potential of our substrate design was demonstrated by efficient recovery of a &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; ADH with an &amp;gt;800-fold enrichment. The repertoire of droplet screening is enlarged by this sensitive and direct fluorogenic assay to identify dehydrogenases for biocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitochondrial Membrane Disrupting Molecules for Selective Killing of Senescent Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here, we showcase the importance of hydrophobicity and charge during the design of new mitochondria&#8208;targeted small molecules as a senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.







Abstract
Cellular senescence, a stable form of cell cycle arrest, facilitates protection from tumorigenesis and aids in tissue repair as they accumulate in the body at an early age. However, long&#8208;term retention of senescent cells causes inflammation, aging of the tissue, and progression of deadly diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Various attempts have been made to achieve selective elimination of senescent cells from the body, yet little has been explored in designing the mitochondria&#8208;targeted senolytic agent. Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here we have designed a library of alkyl&#8208;monoquaternary ammonium&#8208;triphenyl phosphine (TPP) and alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP of varying alkyl chain lengths, which target the mitochondria; we also studied their senolytic properties. It was observed that the alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP with the longest chain length induced apoptosis in senescent cells selectively via an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane disruption. This study demonstrates that mitochondria could be a potential target for designing new small molecules as senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.

         <title>&#8220;A Study in Yellow&#8221;: Investigations in the Stereoselectivity of Ene&#8208;Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Elementary, Watson!&#8221; The recent efforts to investigate and understand the stereochemical course of the asymmetric bioreduction of C=C bonds mediated by ene&#8208;reductases are reviewed, covering the literature of the last two decades. A general binding model is presented and successful approaches to stereodivergent reductions are discussed with representative examples.







Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductases from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily are a well&#8208;known and efficient biocatalytic alternative for the asymmetric reduction of C=C bonds. Considering the broad variety of substituents that can be tolerated, and the excellent stereoselectivities achieved, it is apparent why these enzymes are so appealing for preparative and industrial applications. Different classes of C=C bonds activated by at least one electron&#8208;withdrawing group have been shown to be accepted by these versatile biocatalysts in the last decades, affording a vast range of chiral intermediates employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavours, fragrances and fine chemicals. In order to access both enantiomers of reduced products, stereodivergent pairs of OYEs are desirable, but their natural occurrence is limited. The detailed knowledge of the stereochemical course of the reaction can uncover alternative strategies to orient the selectivity via mutagenesis, evolution, and substrate engineering. An overview of the ongoing studies on OYE&#8208;mediated bioreductions will be provided, with particular focus on stereochemical investigations by deuterium labelling.

         <title>NAD(H)&#8208;PEG Swing Arms Improve Both the Activities and Stabilities of Modularly&#8208;Assembled Transhydrogenases Designed with Predictable Selectivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular assembly of synthetic transhydrogenase catalysts is demonstrated using a PEG&#8208;NAD(H) modified formate dehydrogenase (FDH)&#8208;SpyCatcher fusion protein. The front cover highlights how any oxidoreductase enzyme can be outfitted with a simple SpyTag peptide and conjugated to FDH&#8208;SpyCatcher to create new cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalysts driven by formate oxidation. The stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites, emphasizing the functional modularity and predictive nature of this synthetic approach to biocatalyst design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Massad and S. Banta.

Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the motility of molecules in living cells. Considering the relationship between the motility of molecules and their function, information obtained from single&#8208;molecule imaging involves essential clues for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the processes of target molecules, and translation to applied sciences such as drug discovery. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging studies on G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are mainly introduced, and recent techniques of single&#8208;molecule imaging for overcoming the limitation of single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging are discussed. Based on these studies, the prospects of single&#8208;molecule imaging will be outlined.

         <title>Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy Enables to Quantify the Affinity Between DNA and Proteins in Cell Lysate</title>

Our research targets on the quantitative determination of protein&#8208;to&#8208;ligand binding in complex cellular environments. Fluorine protein labelling has been utilized enabling to analyze signal height, line width and chemical shift upon DNA binding in great detail employing high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and simulations. This approach can be easily applied to studies generally interested in interaction processes taking place in cellular environments.







Abstract
The determination of the binding affinity quantifying the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is of crucial interest in biological and chemical research. Here, we have made use of site&#8208;specific fluorine labeling of the cold shock protein from Bacillus subtilis, BsCspB, enabling to directly monitor the interaction with single stranded DNA molecules in cell lysate. High&#8208;resolution 19F NMR spectroscopy has been applied to exclusively report on resonance signals arising from the protein under study. We have found that this experimental approach advances the reliable determination of the binding affinity between single stranded DNA molecules and its target protein in this complex biological environment by intertwining analyses based on NMR chemical shifts, signal heights, line shapes and simulations. We propose that the developed experimental platform offers a potent approach for the identification of binding affinities characterizing intermolecular interactions in native surroundings covering the nano&#8208;to&#8208;micromolar range that can be even expanded to in cell applications in future studies.

siRNA lego: Cubane&#8208;functionalized siRNAs lead to potent RNAi&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;silencing activity, and improved strand selection.







Abstract
Cubane molecules hold great potential for medicinal chemistry applications due to their inherent stability and low toxicity. In this study, we report the synthesis of a cubane derivative phosphoramidite for the incorporation of cubane into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Synthetic siRNAs rely on chemical modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profiles. However, they are still able to mediate sequence&#8208;specific gene silencing via the endogenous RNA interference pathway. We designed a library of siRNAs bearing cubane at different positions within the sense and antisense strands. All siRNAs showed excellent gene&#8208;silencing activity, with IC50 values ranging from 45.4 to 305&#8197;pM. Incorporating the cubane modification in both the sense and antisense strand led to viable duplexes with good biological activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of siRNAs bearing a cubane derivative within the backbone.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>

         <dc:description>
Enzymes are a valuable tool for upcycling side&#8208;stream from renewable sources. We have found that EstB from Burkholderia gladioli could achieve high enantiopurity in upcycling &#945;&#8208;pinene, a side&#8208;product from turpentine production, whereas common lipases and esterases could not. This reaction can be easily integrated with the existing chemical synthetic route for the production of the racemic camphor with minimal adjustments as the route goes through an intermediate isobornyl acetate.







Abstract
Racemic camphor and isoborneol are readily available as industrial side products, whereas (1R)&#8208;camphor is available from natural sources. Optically pure (1S)&#8208;camphor, however, is much more difficult to obtain. The synthesis of racemic camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene proceeds via an intermediary racemic isobornyl ester, which is then hydrolyzed and oxidized to give camphor. We reasoned that enantioselective hydrolysis of isobornyl esters would give facile access to optically pure isoborneol and camphor isomers, respectively. While screening of a set of commercial lipases and esterases in the kinetic resolution of racemic monoterpenols did not lead to the identification of any enantioselective enzymes, the cephalosporin Esterase B from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB) and Esterase C (EstC) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed outstanding enantioselectivity (E&gt;100) towards the butyryl esters of isoborneol, borneol and fenchol. The enantioselectivity was higher with increasing chain length of the acyl moiety of the substrate. The kinetic resolution of isobornyl butyrate can be easily integrated into the production of camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene and thus allows the facile synthesis of optically pure monoterpenols from a renewable side&#8208;product.

         <title>Construction of Synthetic Nanobody Library in Mammalian Cells by dsDNA&#8208;Based Strategies**

Construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells: Two novel methods for the construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells, called dsDNA&#8208;HR and in&#8197;vitro ligation, were developed. Both methods generated over a million unique nanobody sequences as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing.







Abstract
A nanobody is an antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antigen&#8208;binding domain. Mammalian cells are ideal platforms for identifying nanobodies targeting hard&#8208;to&#8208;display transmembrane proteins and nanobodies that function as modulators of cellular phenotypes. However, the introduction of a high&#8208;diversity nanobody library into mammalian cells is challenging. We have developed two novel methods for constructing a nanobody library in mammalian cells. Complementarity&#8208;determining region (CDR) random sequences were first incorporated into upstream and downstream dsDNAs by PCR. In the first method, named dsDNA&#8208;HR, upstream and downstream dsDNAs containing an identical overlapping sequence were co&#8208;transfected into cultured mammalian cells for intracellular homologous recombination that resulted in the formation of an intact nanobody library expression cassette. In the second method, named in&#8197;vitro ligation, we generated full&#8208;length nanobody expression dsDNAs via ligation of restriction digested upstream and downstream dsDNAs. The obtained full&#8208;length dsDNAs were transfected into mammalian cells for nanobody library expression. Using both methods, we generated over a million unique nanobody sequences, as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Single&#8208;cell sequencing was employed to resolve the diversity of the dsDNA&#8208;HR nanobody library. We also identified a small molecule, Nocodazole, which could enhance the efficacy of dsDNA&#8208;HR.

Kinetic calculations on the migration between saccharide units in a mannan trisaccharide model compounds and a galactoglucomannan polysaccharide were performed. Potential interactions of the model compounds with a lectin were also investigated.







Abstract
Acyl group migration is a fundamental phenomenon in carbohydrate chemistry, recently shown to take place also between two non&#8208;adjacent hydroxyl groups, across the glycosidic bond, in a &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked mannan trisaccharide model compound. With the central mannoside unit containing acetyl groups at the O2 and O3 positions, the O2&#8208;acetyl was in the earlier study shown to migrate to O6 of the reducing end. Potential implications of the general acyl migration process on cell signaling events and plant growth in nature are intriguing open questions. In the present work, migration kinetics in this original trisaccharide model system were studied in more detail together with potential interactions of the model compound and the migration products with DC&#8208;SIGN lectin. Furthermore, we demonstrate here for the first time that similar migration may also take place in native polysaccharides, here represented by galactoglucomannan from Norway spruce.

A chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates is reported. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain.







Abstract
The reversible nature of disulfide functionality has been exploited to design intelligent materials such as nanocapsules, micelles, vesicles, inorganic nanoparticles, peptide and nucleic acid nanodevices. Herein, we report a new chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The disulfide functionality is strategically placed between the dendron and protein domains. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the protein assemblies is demonstrated using a suitable redox trigger.

&lt;p&gt;The reversible nature of disulfide functionality has been exploited to design intelligent materials such as nanocapsules, micelles, vesicles, inorganic nanoparticles, peptide and nucleic acid nanodevices. Herein, we report a new chemical methodology for the construction redox-sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein-dendron bioconjugates. The disulfide functionality is strategically placed between the dendron and protein domains. The custom designed bioconjugates self-assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain. The stimuli-responsive behavior of the protein assemblies is demonstrated using a suitable redox trigger.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>When Supramolecular Chemistry Meets Chemical Biology: New Strategies to Target Proteins through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 20, Page 2914-2917, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein targeting through host&#8208;guest recognition is an exciting area but is limited by the lack of specific recognition element on protein. Chemical biology methods for site&#8208;specific protein modification provide powerful tools for introducing guest molecules into proteins and will greatly expand the scope of protein targeting using supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins is of great interest for the development of novel approaches to recognize, isolate and control proteins. Taking advantage of chemical biology approaches, such as genetic&#8208;code expansion and enzyme&#8208;mediated ligation, guest recognition elements can be built into proteins of interest, allowing supramolecular control of protein function and regulation. In this viewpoint article, we will discuss the methods, applications, limitations, and future perspectives of supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins in a site&#8208;specific manner.

Functional protein nanotechnology: The cover feature illustrates the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of redox&#8208;sensitive artificial proteins. The disulfide functionality is placed strategically in between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of the artificial protein. The hydrophobic domain drives the self&#8208;assembly of artificial proteins to form monodisperse protein nanoparticles. Treatment of protein nanoparticles with dithiothreitol (DTT) results in cleavage of disulfide bonds and subsequent disassembly of protein nanoparticles due to cleavage of the hydrophobic domain. This work lays the foundation for pushing the boundaries of functional protein nanotechnology. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;J. Bhandari and B.&#8197;S.

(&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor can occur naturally as a constituent of essential oils of several plants, including Cinnamomum camphora, or it can be obtained chemically from optically pure &#945;&#8208;pinene, which itself must be isolated from plants. Camphor is well known for its characteristic pungent odor and health benefits. While (+)&#8208;camphor can be isolated from various natural sources, (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor is more difficult to obtain. In our work, we demonstrate facile enantioselective kinetic resolution of renewable isobornyl esters for the synthesis of the valuable (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor.

Native Sec incorporation is highly species&#8208;dependent, which makes it challenging to express selenoproteins recombinantly. This article reviews recent progress in the method development for selenoprotein production, including the uses of engineered tRNA, allo&#8208;tRNA and Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element as well as genetic code expansion approaches for efficient site&#8208;specific Sec incorporation.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation in vivo is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe the progress in selenoprotein production methodology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Bioactive Artificial Ionophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 20, Page 2925-2940, October 13, 2021. </description>

Recent progress in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure&#8208;activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.







Abstract
Several life&#8208;threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non&#8208;toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations. In addition, their ability to disrupt cellular homeostasis and to alter lysosomal pH endow ionophores as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Overall, critically outlining the advances in artificial ionophores in terms of in vitro ion transport, possible modes of action and biological activities enables us to propose possible future roadmaps in this research area.

     alt="Recent Advances in Bioactive Artificial Ionophores"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recent progress&lt;/b&gt; in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure-activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several life-threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non-toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations. In addition, their ability to disrupt cellular homeostasis and to alter lysosomal pH endow ionophores as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Overall, critically outlining the advances in artificial ionophores in terms of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ion transport, possible modes of action and biological activities enables us to propose possible future roadmaps in this research area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Natural Products of Commensal Microbiota as an Environmental Selection Pressure for the Rise of New Variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>

In silico studies suggest that NPs like bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) produced by bacteria residing in the respiratory tract can interfere with the binding of the original strain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to the ACE2 receptor but not with the binding of the emerging variants having the N501Y mutation. Thus, it is hypothesized that NPs of respiratory tract bacteria are an environmental selection pressure for the rise of new variants of the virus with higher infectivity rate.







Abstract
Since the emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, little attention has been paid to the interplay between the interaction of virus and commensal microbiota. Here, we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations to study the interaction of some of the known metabolites and natural products (NPs) produced by commensal microbiota with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The results predict that NPs of commensal microbiota such as bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs), of which some are siderophores, bind to the wild&#8208;type RBD and interfere with its binding to the ACE2 receptor. N501Y mutation, which is present in many of the emerging variants of the virus, abolishes the predicted binding pocket of bile acids and NRPs. Based on these findings, available experimental data showing that bile acids reduce the binding affinity of wild&#8208;type RBD to the ACE2 receptor, and the data suggesting that the respiratory tract microbiota affect viral infection we put forward the following proposal: mutations such as N501Y enable the RBD to bind to the ACE2 receptor more effectively in the presence of NPs produced by the respiratory tract bacteria thereby, increasing the infectivity rate of the virus. We hope our data stimulate future works to better understand the interactions of NPs produced by commensal microbiota with respiratory viruses like SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>The Conversion of Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by Nitrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenases are the only known family of enzymes that catalyze the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2  ) to ammonia (NH3  ). The N2  reduction drives the biological nitrogen fixation and the global nitrogen cycle. Beside the conversion of N2  , nitrogenases catalyze a whole range of other reductions, including the reduction of the small gaseous substrates carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to hydrocarbons. However, it remains an open question whether these &#8216;side reactivities&#8217; play a role under environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these reactivities and particularly the formation of hydrocarbons have spurred the interest in nitrogenases for biotechnological applications. There are three different isozymes of nitrogenase: the molybdenum and the alternative vanadium and iron&#8208;only nitrogenase. The isozymes differ in their metal content, structure and substrate&#8208;dependent activity despite their homology. This minireview focuses on the conversion of CO and CO2  to methane and higher hydrocarbons and aims to specify the differences in activity between the three nitrogenase isozymes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High costs and low availability of UDP&#8208;galactose hampers the enzymatic synthesis of valuable oligosaccharides such as human milk oligosaccharides. Here, we report the development of a platform for the scalable, biocatalytic synthesis and purification of UDP&#8208;galactose. UDP&#8208;galactose was produced with a titer of 48 mM (27.2 g/L) in a small&#8208;scale batch process (200 &#181;L) within 24 h using 0.02 g  enzyme  /g  product  . Through  in&#8208;situ  ATP regeneration, the amount of ATP (0.6 mM) supplemented was around 240&#8208;fold lower than the stoichiometric equivalent required to achieve the final product yield. Chromatographic purification using porous graphic carbon adsorbent yielded UDP&#8208;galactose with a purity of 92%. The synthesis was transferred to 1 L preparative scale production in a stirred tank bioreactor. To further reduce the synthesis costs here, the supernatant of cell lysates was used bypassing expensive purification of enzymes. Here, 23.4 g/L UDP&#8208;galactose were produced within 23 h with a synthesis yield of 71% and a biocatalyst load of 0.05 g  total_protein  /g  product  .

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of Potent Bioactive anti&#8208;TNF&#945; Aptamers by Microbead&#8208;Assisted Capillary Electrophoresis (MACE)&#8208;SELEX</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid identification of high&#8208;affinity aptamers against human TNF&#945;: In vitro selection coupled with microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) separation was performed to rapidly identify anti&#8208;TNF&#945; aptamers; it was completed in only three rounds. Selected Apt14 showed the strongest inhibition activity according to the cell viability assay. Furthermore, by introducing a complementary linker to the aptamers, facile dimerization was performed, resulting in enhanced affinity and inhibition activity compared to that of the monomer.







Abstract
Dysregulation of tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;), a pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine, causes several diseases, making it an important therapeutic target. Here, we identified a novel DNA aptamer against human TNF&#945; using in&#8197;vitro selection, which included a high exclusion pressure process against non&#8208;binding and weak binders through microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) in only three rounds. Among the 15 most enriched aptamers, Apt14 exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for the interaction between TNF&#945; and its cognate receptor in mouse L929 cells. For further improving the bioactivity of the aptamer, dimerization programed by hybridization was evaluated, resulting in the Apt14 dimer exhibited a twofold higher binding affinity and stronger inhibition compared to the monomer counterpart. Rapid identification of bioactive aptamers using MACE in combination with facile dimerization by hybridization accelerates the discovery of novel bioactive aptamers, paving the way toward replacing current monoclonal antibody therapy with the less expensive and non&#8208;immunogenic aptamer therapy.

Rapid identification of bioactive aptamers using MACE in combination with facile dimerization by hybridization accelerates the discovery of novel bioactive aptamers, paving the way toward replacing current monoclonal antibody therapy with the less expensive and non-immunogenic aptamer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing P450 Enzyme for Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attentions in the synthetic biology and biotechnology areas due to their versatile functions and unique structures. In this article, different strategies that used to leverage P450s catalytic efficiency have been reviewed and discussed, which include substrate engineering, allostery effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, OPME and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization etc.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYPs) catalyze the oxidative transformation of a wide range of organic substrates. Their functions are crucial to xenobiotic metabolism and steroid transformation in humans and other organisms. The enzymes are promising for synthetic biology applications but limited by several drawbacks including low turnover rates, poor stability, the dependance of expensive cofactors and redox partners, and the narrow substrate scope. To conquer these obstacles, emerging strategies including substrate engineering, usage of decoy and decoy&#8208;based small molecules auxiliaries, designing of artificial enzyme cascades and the incorporation of materials have been explored based on the unique properties of P450s. These strategies can be applied to a wide range of P450s and can be combined with protein engineering to improve the enzymatic activities. This minireview will focus on some recent developments of these strategies which have been used to leverage P450 catalysis. Remaining challenges and future opportunities will also be discussed.

         <title>Identification and Composition of Clasper Scent Gland Components of the Butterfly Heliconius erato and Its Relation to Mimicry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scent glands of male Heliconius erato contain up to 350 components with individual compositions. Linear terpenes dominate, either as esters or as long, regular linear isoprene&#8208;oligomers. The high chemical diversity is reflected within the many different mimicry patterns of these butterflies. The compounds were identified by a combination of various methods, including synthesis, which allowed to unravel the underlying biosynthetic pathways used to arrive at these compound bouquets.







Abstract
The butterfly Heliconius erato occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper scent gland releases an anti&#8208;aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)&#8208;analyses, derivatization, and synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3&#8208;oxohexan&#8208;1&#8208;ol and (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol with (S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids, and various alcohols. In addition, linear terpenes with up to seven uniformly connected isoprene units occur, e.&#8201;g. farnesylfarnesol. A large number of the compounds have not been reported before from nature. Discriminant analyses of principal components of the gland contents showed that the iridescent mimicry group differs strongly from the other, mostly also separated, mimicry groups. Comparison with data from other species indicated that Heliconius recruits different biosynthetic pathways in a species&#8208;specific manner for semiochemical formation.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a biomimetic iron (IV)&#8208;oxo complex (the sun) towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates (the orbiting planets) was investigated. The reaction rates (corresponding to the orbital periods) are in very good agreement with the calculated bond dissociation energies. 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU or the dimethylated compounds 1,5dimC and 1,5dimU.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel benzaldehyde lyase for the production of chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones was identified by a machine learning model and two variants with altered substrate scopes were created by rational design. All three variants exhibit significantly higher thermostability compared to the only previously described benzaldehyde lyase. When immobilized in a packed&#8208;bed reactor, the most thermostable variant showed stable substrate turnover over days.







Abstract
Enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are important building blocks of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which can be produced by thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyases, such as benzaldehyde lyase. Here we report the discovery of a novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis R138 (ReBAL). While the overall sequence identity to the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar I (PfBAL) was only 65&#8201;%, comparison of a structural model of ReBAL with the crystal structure of PfBAL revealed only four divergent amino acids in the substrate binding cavity. Based on rational design, we generated two ReBAL variants, which were characterized along with the wild&#8208;type enzyme in terms of their substrate spectrum, thermostability and biocatalytic performance in the presence of different co&#8208;solvents. We found that the new enzyme variants have a significantly higher thermostability (up to 22&#8201;&#176;C increase in T50) and a different co&#8208;solvent&#8208;dependent activity. Using the most stable variant immobilized in packed&#8208;bed reactors via the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, (R)&#8208;benzoin was synthesized from benzaldehyde over a period of seven days with a stable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8208;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;d&#8722;1. Our work expands the important class of benzaldehyde lyases and therefore contributes to the development of continuous biocatalytic processes for the production of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and APIs.

New SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2&#8201;variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells.







Abstract
Specific S477N, N501Y, K417N, K417T, E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein in the wild type SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus have resulted, among others, in the following variants: B.1.160 (20A or EU2, first reported in continental Europe), B1.1.7 (&#945; or 20I501Y.V1, first reported in the United Kingdom), B.1.351 (&#946; or 20H/501Y.V2, first reported in South Africa), B.1.1.28.1 (&#947; or P.1 or 20J/501Y.V3, first reported in Brazil), and B.1.1.28.2 (&#950;, or P.2 or 20B/S484K, also first reported in Brazil). From the analysis of a set of bonding descriptors firmly rooted in the formalism of quantum mechanics, including Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO), Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and highly correlated energies within the Domain Based Local Pair Natural Orbital Coupled Cluster Method (DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)), and from a set of computed electronic spectral patterns with environmental effects, we show that the new variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells. This results in significantly improved initial virus&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;cell molecular recognition and attachment at the microscopic level, which trigger the infectious cycle.

         <title>Protein Design with Fluoroprolines: 4,4&#8208;Difluoroproline Does Not Eliminate the Rate&#8208;Limiting Step of Thioredoxin Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of 4,4&#8208;difluoroproline into the conserved cis prolyl&#8208;peptide bond of the E.&#8197;coli thioredoxin variant Trx1P neither eliminated the bottleneck of the thioredoxin refolding reaction nor had an impact on the attainment of the cis/trans equilibrium in the unfolded state. Our results suggest that the cis/trans isomerisation rates predicted for fluorinated proline analogues in the context of short model peptides are not applicable in the context of tertiary structures.







Abstract
C4&#8208;substituted fluoroprolines (4R)&#8208;fluoroproline ((4R)&#8208;Flp) and (4S)&#8208;fluoroproline ((4S)&#8208;Flp) have been used in protein engineering to enhance the thermodynamic stability of peptides and proteins. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine can bias the pucker of the pyrrolidine ring, influence the conformational preference of the preceding peptide bond, and can accelerate the cis/trans prolyl peptide bond isomerisation by diminishing its double bond character. The role of 4,4&#8208;difluoroproline (Dfp) in the acceleration of the refolding rate of globular proteins bearing a proline (Pro) residue in the cis conformation in the native state remains elusive. Moreover, the impact of Dfp on the thermodynamic stability and bioactivity of globular proteins has been seldom described. In this study, we show that the incorporation of Dfp caused a redox state dependent and position dependent destabilisation of the thioredoxin (Trx) fold, while the catalytic activities of the modified proteins remained unchanged. The Pro to Dfp substitution at the conserved cisPro76 in the thioredoxin variant Trx1P did not elicited acceleration of the rate&#8208;limiting trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization of the Ile75&#8208;Pro76 peptide bond. Our results show that pucker preferences in the context of a tertiary structure could play a major role in protein folding, thus overtaking the rules determined for cis/trans isomerisation barriers determined in model peptides.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Mesophilic CTP&#8208;Dependent Riboflavin Kinase and Rational Engineering to Create Its Thermostable Homologues
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pathway for vitamin B2 (riboflavin) biosynthesis in archaea contains several novel enzymes and reactions. The archaeal riboflavin kinase, RibK, is one such example &#8211; it has a unique structural fold, and phosphorylates B2 using CTP. Here, we characterize a new mesophilic archaeal RibK, compare its structure and function with a closely linked thermophilic homologue, and determine the molecular factors that confer thermal stability to this enzyme's characteristic structural fold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Kumar, R.&#8197;K. Singh, and A.&#8197;B. Hazra.

         <title>Exploration of GH94 Sequence Space for Enzyme Discovery Reveals a Novel Glucosylgalactose Phosphorylase Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of a glucosylgalactose phosphorylase: Although the rapidly expanding sequence space offers excellent opportunities for the discovery of novel enzymes, its rational exploration is key to the effective localization of regions for which no functional information is available. We have applied a binary approach that leverages the strengths of phylogeny and sequence similarity networks and which led to the discovery of the novel 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose phosphorylase.







Abstract
The substantial increase in DNA sequencing efforts has led to a rapid expansion of available sequences in glycoside hydrolase families. The ever&#8208;increasing sequence space presents considerable opportunities for the search for enzymes with novel functionalities. In this work, the sequence&#8208;function space of glycoside hydrolase family 94 (GH94) was explored in detail, using a combined approach of phylogenetic analysis and sequence similarity networks. The identification and experimental screening of unknown clusters led to the discovery of an enzyme from the soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa that acts as a 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose phosphorylase (GGalP), a specificity that has not been reported to date. Detailed characterization of GGalP revealed that its kinetic parameters were consistent with those of other known phosphorylases. Furthermore, the enzyme could be used for production of the rare disaccharides 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose and 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;l&#8208;arabinose. Our current work highlights the power of rational sequence space exploration in the search for novel enzyme specificities, as well as the potential of phosphorylases for rare disaccharide synthesis.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two for one: A straightforward chemoenzymatic synthesis pathway towards valuable chiral alcohols with &#945;&#8208;fluorination in close proximity to the chiral center and a pyridine ring is presented. High conversions with excellent enantioselectivities were found, showing its high synthetic potential.







Abstract
Fluoro&#8208;substituted and heteroaromatic compounds are valuable intermediates for a variety of applications in pharma&#8208; and agrochemistry and synthetic chemistry. This study investigates the chemoenzymatic preparation of chiral alcohols bearing a heteroaromatic ring with an increasing degree of fluorination in &#945;&#8208;position. Starting from readily available picoline derivatives prochiral &#945;&#8208;halogenated acyl moieties were introduced with excellent selectivity and 64&#8211;95&#8201;% yield. The formed carbonyl group was subsequently reduced to the corresponding alcohols using the alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir, yielding an enantiomeric excess of 95&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% and up to 98&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Completely Chemically Synthesized Long DNA Can be Transcribed in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA segments of 78&#8197;bp and 258&#8197;bp in length, were prepared by chemical ligation of chemically synthesized DNA fragments with phosphorothioate and haloacyl terminus groups. The 258&#8197;bp DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a truncated SV promoter sequence, was successfully transcribed and showed full gene silencing effects in human cells.







Abstract
Chemical ligation reaction of DNA is useful for the construction of long functional DNA using oligonucleotide fragments that are prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis. However, the unnatural linkage structure formed by the ligation reaction generally impairs the biological function of the resulting ligated DNA. We achieved the complete chemical synthesis of 78 and 258&#8197;bp synthetic DNAs via multiple chemical ligation reactions with phosphorothioate and haloacyl&#8208;modified DNA fragments. The latter synthetic DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a designed truncated SV promoter sequence, successfully induced the expected gene silencing effect in HeLa cells.

         <title>Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes in Photoredox Catalysis and Photodynamic Therapy: A New Paradigm towards Anticancer Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered Ir(III)&#8208; and Ru(II)&#8208;based organometallic complexes that elicit selective in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo responses to cancerous cells while being nontoxic to normal cells in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photoredox catalysis (PC) are discussed in this Highlight article. We indicate promising avenues in translational research for cancer treatment by examining stable transition&#8208;metal complexes that hold potential for clinical trials in the future.







Abstract
Individually, photoredox catalysis (PC) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are well&#8208;established concepts that have experienced a remarkable resurgence in recent years, leading to significant progress in organic synthesis for PC and clinical approval of anticancer drugs for PDT. But, very recently, new photoredox catalyst systems based on Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes have garnered significant interest because they can simultaneously be used as PDT agents apart from their demonstrated PC activity. This highlight discusses the unique PC behavior of emerging Ir(III)&#8208; and Ru(II)&#8208;based systems while also examining their potential PDT activity in cancer treatment.

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Gly&#8208;His&#8208;Tagged Proteins with Azidogluconolactone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;amino acylation of proteins with N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;HisTags using 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone (6AGDL) is reported. To demonstrate the usefulness of this reaction, we multimerise the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) protein antigen onto virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). The resulting COVID&#8208;19 vaccine candidate induces single&#8208;shot seroconversion, and virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies in mice.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific protein modifications are vital for biopharmaceutical drug development. Gluconoylation is a non&#8208;enzymatic, post&#8208;translational modification of N&#8208;terminal HisTags. We report high&#8208;yield, site&#8208;selective in&#8197;vitro &#945;&#8208;aminoacylation of peptides, glycoproteins, antibodies, and virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) with azidogluconolactone at pH&#8197;7.5 in 1&#8197;h. Conjugates slowly hydrolyse, but diol&#8208;masking with borate esters inhibits reversibility. In an example, we multimerise azidogluconoylated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) onto VLPs via click&#8208;chemistry, to give a COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. Compared to yeast antigen, HEK&#8208;derived RBD was immunologically superior, likely due to observed differences in glycosylation. We show the benefits of ordered over randomly oriented multimeric antigen display, by demonstrating single&#8208;shot seroconversion and best virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies. Azidogluconoylation is simple, fast and robust chemistry, and should accelerate research and development.

         <title>Engineering Leifsonia Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Thermostability and Catalytic Efficiency by Enhancing Subunit Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the subunit interface of Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) yielded thermostability, and catalytic efficiency significantly improved in the mutant T100R/S148I. T100R/S148I can efficiently convert various ketone substrates into nearly optically pure chiral alcohols at elevated temperature in a very low enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;500).







Abstract
Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) is a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. However, limitations of wild&#8208;type LnADH observed for practical application include low activity and poor stability. In this work, protein engineering was employed to improve its thermostability and catalytic efficiency by altering the subunit interfaces. Residues T100 and S148 were identified to be significant for thermostability and activity, and the melting temperature (&#916;Tm) and catalytic efficiency of the mutant T100R/S148I toward ketone substrates was improved by 18.7&#8201;&#176;C and 1.8&#8211;5.5&#8208;fold. Solving the crystal structures of the wild&#8208;type enzyme and T100R/S148L revealed beneficial effects of mutations on stability and catalytic activity. The most robust mutant T100R/S148I is promising for industrial applications and can produce 200&#8197;g&#8201;liter&#8722;1&#8201;day&#8722;1 chiral alcohols at 50&#8201;&#176;C by only a 1&#8201;:&#8201;500 ratio of enzyme to substrate.

         <title>Efficient Linear dsDNA Tagging Using Deoxyuridine Excision**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular barcoding is used to tag nucleic acids with sequence&#8208;encoded identifiers to distinguish between different samples or individual molecules. I describe a one&#8208;pot procedure for efficiently tagging linear dsDNA with molecular barcodes. This approach has potential utility for high&#8208;throughput in&#8197;vitro biochemical experiments that require uniform and quantitative dsDNA tagging.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific strategies for exchanging segments of dsDNA are important for DNA library construction and molecular tagging. Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3&#8217; ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi&#8208;base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT&#8594;dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non&#8208;perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called deoxyUridine eXcision&#8208;tagging (dUX&#8208;tagging), is an efficient one&#8208;pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3&#8217; overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5&#8217; overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX&#8208;tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX&#8208;tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high&#8208;efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.

Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3&#8217; ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi-base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT&#8594;dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non-perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called deoxyUridine eXcision-tagging (dUX-tagging), is an efficient one-pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3&#8217; overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5&#8217; overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX-tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX-tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high-efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial biosynthesis and catabolism of phosphonate natural products is a largely unexplored world of unusual enzyme reactions. Within this world resides Fosfonochlorin, a rare example of a halogenated phosphonate natural product, and a biosynthetic enigma since its discovery in 1988. In this study Gama and co&#8208;workers reveal two key steps in the biosynthesis of this deceptively simple molecule. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Pallitsch, D.&#8197;L. Zechel et&#8197;al.

         <title>Structural Basis of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diene Forming Acyl&#8208;Coenzyme A Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the biocatalytic repertoire: Canonical acyl&#8208;coenzyme dehydrogenases catalyze the 1,2&#8208;dehydrogenation of aliphatic thioesters in a highly conserved manner with a invariant glutamate serving as catalytic base and a flavin as hydride acceptor. By removal of this glutamate and positioning of a novel aspartate base at C3, an 1,4 dehydrogenation activity is achieved, thereby generating a cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building block.







Abstract
The biologically important, FAD&#8208;containing acyl&#8208;coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenases (ACAD) usually catalyze the anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination of a proton and a hydride of aliphatic CoA thioesters. Here, we report on the structure and function of an ACAD from anaerobic bacteria catalyzing the unprecedented 1,4&#8208;elimination at C3 and C6 of cyclohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1CoA) to cyclohex&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1,5CoA) and at C3 and C4 of the latter to benzoyl&#8208;CoA. Based on high&#8208;resolution Ch1CoA dehydrogenase crystal structures, the unorthodox reactivity is explained by the presence of a catalytic aspartate base (D91) at C3, and by eliminating the catalytic glutamate base at C1. Moreover, C6 of Ch1CoA and C4 of Ch1,5CoA are positioned towards FAD&#8208;N5 to favor the biologically relevant C3,C6&#8208; over the C3,C4&#8208;dehydrogenation activity. The C1,C2&#8208;dehydrogenation activity was regained by structure&#8208;inspired amino acid exchanges. The results provide the structural rationale for the extended catalytic repertoire of ACADs and offer previously unknown biocatalytic options for the synthesis of cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building blocks.

         <title>Discovery, Biocatalytic Exploration and Structural Analysis of a 4&#8208;Ethylphenol Oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gc4EO, a new member of the VAO/PCMH family from the actinobacteria Gulosibacter chungangensis was discovered. This oxidase is a very appealing biocatalyst for the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylphenols, exhibiting high conversion yields with an attractive chemoselectivity towards the production of alkenes. Gc4EO showed high activity to produce 4&#8208;vinylphenol, an interesting building block for the synthesis of polyvinylphenol.







Abstract
The vanillyl&#8208;alcohol oxidase (VAO) family is a rich source of biocatalysts for the oxidative bioconversion of phenolic compounds. Through genome mining and sequence comparisons, we found that several family members lack a generally conserved catalytic aspartate. This finding led us to study a VAO&#8208;homolog featuring a glutamate residue in place of the common aspartate. This 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis (Gc4EO) shares 42&#8201;% sequence identity with VAO from Penicillium simplicissimum, contains the same 8&#945;&#8208;N3&#8208;histidyl&#8208;bound FAD and uses oxygen as electron acceptor. However, Gc4EO features a distinct substrate scope and product specificity as it is primarily effective in the dehydrogenation of para&#8208;substituted phenols with little generation of hydroxylated products. The three&#8208;dimensional structure shows that the characteristic glutamate side chain creates a closely packed environment that may limit water accessibility and thereby protect from hydroxylation. With its high thermal stability, well defined structural properties and high expression yields, Gc4EO may become a catalyst of choice for the specific dehydrogenation of phenolic compounds bearing small substituents.

         <title>Remote Photodamaging of DNA by Photoinduced Energy Transport</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far does energy migrate in DNA? DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport is a new pathway to DNA photodamage occurring at remote sites and not locally at the site of excitation by light. Although these distances might be small with regard to a whole gene, the proposal that a site might be damaged other than the site of initial photoexcitation is important to the understanding of mutations that are caused by remote DNA photodamages.







Abstract
Local DNA photodamaging by light is well&#8208;studied and leads to a number of structurally identified direct damage, in particular cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and indirect oxidatively generated damage, such as 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;hydroxyguanine. Similar damages have now been found at remote sites, at least more than 105&#8197;&#197; (30 base pairs) away from the site of photoexcitation. In contrast to the established mechanisms of local DNA photodamaging, the processes of remote photodamage are only partially understood. Known pathways include those to remote oxidatively generated DNA photodamages, which were elucidated by studying electron hole transport through the DNA about 20&#8197;years ago. Recent studies with DNA photosensitizers and mechanistic proposals on photoinduced DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport are summarized in this minireview. These new mechanisms to a new type of remote DNA photodamaging provide an important extension to our general understanding to light&#8208;induced DNA damage and their mutations.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Dual Modulators of A&#946; and Tau Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The screening of a focused library of 52 thiophene molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation identified lead compounds. The potent lead compound effectively rescued neuronal cells from aggregation&#8208;induced toxicity and establish thiophene compound as a dual modulator of A&#946; and Tau aggregation.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A&#946;) and Tau aggregates in the brain, which induces various pathological events resulting in neurodegeneration. There have been continuous efforts to develop modulators of the A&#946; and Tau aggregation process to halt or modify disease progression. A few small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based inhibitors that target both A&#946; and Tau pathology have been reported. Here, we report the screening of a targeted library of small molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation together with their in&#8197;vitro, in&#8197;silico and cellular studies. In&#8197;vitro ThT fluorescence assay, dot blot assay, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results have shown that thiophene&#8208;based lead molecules effectively modulate A&#946; aggregation and inhibit Tau aggregation. In&#8197;silico studies performed by employing molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding&#8208;free energy calculations have helped in understanding the mechanism of interaction of the lead thiophene compounds with A&#946; and Tau fibril targets. In&#8197;cellulo studies revealed that the lead candidate is biocompatible and effectively ameliorates neuronal cells from A&#946; and Tau&#8208;mediated amyloid toxicity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The screening&lt;/b&gt; of a focused library of 52 thiophene molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation identified lead compounds. The potent lead compound effectively rescued neuronal cells from aggregation-induced toxicity and establish thiophene compound as a dual modulator of A&#946; and Tau aggregation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A&#946;) and Tau aggregates in the brain, which induces various pathological events resulting in neurodegeneration. There have been continuous efforts to develop modulators of the A&#946; and Tau aggregation process to halt or modify disease progression. A few small-molecule-based inhibitors that target both A&#946; and Tau pathology have been reported. Here, we report the screening of a targeted library of small molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation together with their &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;silico&lt;/i&gt; and cellular studies. &lt;i&gt;In&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; ThT fluorescence assay, dot blot assay, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results have shown that thiophene-based lead molecules effectively modulate A&#946; aggregation and inhibit Tau aggregation. &lt;i&gt;In&#8197;silico&lt;/i&gt; studies performed by employing molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding-free energy calculations have helped in understanding the mechanism of interaction of the lead thiophene compounds with A&#946; and Tau fibril targets. &lt;i&gt;In&#8197;cellulo&lt;/i&gt; studies revealed that the lead candidate is biocompatible and effectively ameliorates neuronal cells from A&#946; and Tau-mediated amyloid toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs enables efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The cover feature demonstrates how PylT recodes an amber stop codon within a GFP reporter to direct site&#8208;specific incorporation of an ncAA, leading to GFP fluorescence throughout the organoid, as visible by light&#8208;sheet microscopy. The method will help to implement existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies for probing and manipulating proteins in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. van&#8197;Husen et&#8197;al.

         <title>TET&#8208;Like Oxidation in 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and Derivatives: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex 1 towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates was investigated. The reaction rates are in very good agreement with the calculated BDEs. C&#8208;Methylated compounds such as 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU.







Abstract
The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) is an important factor in DNA modification and epigenetics. It can be modified through a three&#8208;step oxidation performed by ten&#8208;eleven&#8208;translocation (TET) enzymes and we have previously reported that the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [Fe(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can oxidize 5mC. Here, we report the reactivity of this iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex towards a wider scope of methylated cytosine and uracil derivatives relevant for synthetic DNA applications, such as 1&#8208;methylcytosine (1mC), 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;iso&#8208;cytosine (5miC) and thymine (T/5mU). The observed kinetic parameters are corroborated by calculation of the C&#8722;H bond energies at the reactive sites which was found to be an efficient tool for reaction rate prediction of 1 towards methylated DNA bases. We identified oxidation products of methylated cytosine derivatives using HPLC&#8208;MS and GC&#8208;MS. Thereby, we shed light on the impact of the methyl group position and resulting C&#8722;H bond dissociation energies on reactivity towards TET&#8208;like oxidation.

         <title>Recent Developments in PROTAC&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation: From Bench to Clinic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past two decades, Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed as a new approach for targeted protein degradation by hijacking the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In this review, we describe recent PROTAC developments, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), an emerging paradigm&#8208;shifting technology, hijacks the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. PROTACs induce ternary complexes between an E3 ligase and POI, and this induced proximity leads to polyUb chain formation on substrates and eventual proteasomal&#8208;mediated POI degradation. PROTACs have shown great therapeutic potential by degrading many disease&#8208;causing proteins, such as the androgen receptor and BRD4. The PROTAC technology has advanced significantly in the last two decades, with the repertoire of PROTAC targets increased tremendously. Herein, we describe recent developments of PROTAC technology, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.

         <title>Experimental Perspectives on Direct Visualization of Endosomal Rupture</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endosomal/lysosomal disruption can be directly visualized via lysosome size or genetically engineered cell lines.







Abstract
Endosomal escape continues to be a limiting factor in the therapeutic use of nanomaterials. Assays to visualize endosomal escape often do not decouple the endosomal/lysosomal disruption from the release of payload into the cytosol. Here, we discuss three approaches to directly probe endosomal/lysosomal rupture: calcein dye dilution, lysosome size quantification and endosome/lysosome membrane integrity visualized with a genetically engineered cell line. We apply the three assays to endosomes/lysosomes ruptured via osmotic pressure and photochemical internalization.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising diversity: The aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases from E. coli have been extensively explored, and a surprising number of amino acid substrates have been described. This comprehensive review catalogues all known substrates for these enzymes and highlights trends and novel applications.







Abstract
In this comprehensive review, I focus on the twenty E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases and their ability to charge non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) onto tRNAs. The promiscuity of these enzymes has been harnessed for diverse applications including understanding and engineering of protein function, creation of organisms with an expanded genetic code, and the synthesis of diverse peptide libraries for drug discovery. The review catalogues the structures of all known ncAA substrates for each of the 20 E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including ncAA substrates for engineered versions of these enzymes. Drawing from the structures in the list, I highlight trends and novel opportunities for further exploitation of these ncAAs in the engineering of protein function, synthetic biology, and in drug discovery.

         <title>What is the Sugar Code?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Information coding by sugars: Letting symbols convey information comes in many forms such as the QR code. We explain that sugars are an ideal alphabet of life. They form an unsurpassed size of bio&#8208;vocabulary. It is read and translated by a matching diversity of sugar receptors (lectins) so that establishing a dictionary for the glyco&#8208;vocabulary is now in progress. The given QR code directs you to our review on the sugar code.







Abstract
A code is defined by the nature of the symbols, which are used to generate information&#8208;storing combinations (e.&#8201;g. oligo&#8208; and polymers). Like nucleic acids and proteins, oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides are ubiquitous, and they are a biochemical platform for establishing molecular messages. Of note, the letters of the sugar code system (third alphabet of life) excel in coding capacity by making an unsurpassed versatility for isomer (code word) formation possible by variability in anomery and linkage position of the glycosidic bond, ring size and branching. The enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis (writers) realizes this enormous potential for building a large vocabulary. It includes possibilities for dynamic editing/erasing as known from nucleic acids and proteins. Matching the glycome diversity, a large panel of sugar receptors (lectins) has developed based on more than a dozen folds. Lectins &#8216;read&#8217; the glycan&#8208;encoded information. Hydrogen/coordination bonding and ionic pairing together with stacking and C&#8722;H/&#960;&#8208;interactions as well as modes of spatial glycan presentation underlie the selectivity and specificity of glycan&#8208;lectin recognition. Modular design of lectins together with glycan display and the nature of the cognate glycoconjugate account for the large number of post&#8208;binding events. They give an entry to the glycan vocabulary its functional, often context&#8208;dependent meaning(s), hereby building the dictionary of the sugar code.

         <title>Modular Design of Supramolecular Ionic Peptides with Cell&#8208;Selective Membrane Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly designed cationic peptides having low membrane activity undergo cell&#8208;specific enzyme triggered chemical transformation and self&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular cationic clusters with enhanced membrane activity. The cell&#8208;selective membrane activity by in&#8197;situ formed peptide assembly is a highly desirable feature for targeted molecular imaging and therapy.







Abstract
The rational design of materials with cell&#8208;selective membrane activity is an effective strategy for the development of targeted molecular imaging and therapy. Here we report a new class of cationic multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated molecular transformation followed by supramolecular assembly to form nanofibers in which cationic clusters are presented on a rigid &#946;&#8208;sheet backbone. This structural transformation, which is induced by cells overexpressing the specific enzymes, led to a shift in the membrane perturbation potential of the MDPs, and consequently enhanced cell uptake and drug delivery efficacy. We envision the directed self&#8208;assembly based on modularly designed MDPs as a highly promising approach to generate dynamic supramolecular nanomaterials with emerging membrane activity for a range of disease targeted molecular imaging and therapy applications.
