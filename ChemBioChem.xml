         <title>Engineered human induced pluripotent cells enable genetic code expansion in brain organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to amber stop codons. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA&#8208;bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site&#8208;directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC&#8208;derived cell types and complex tissue models.</dc:description>

         <title>Chimeric flaviviral RNA&#8208;siRNA molecules resist degradation by the exoribonuclease Xrn1 and trigger gene silencing in mammalian cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery, but the susceptibility of RNA to nuclease degradation remains a major barrier to its implementation in vivo. Here, we engineered flaviviral Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA (xrRNA) motifs to host small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. The xrRNA&#8208;siRNA molecules self&#8208;assemble in vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in 293T cells. The resistance of the molecules to Xrn1 does not translate to stability in blood serum. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that flavivirus&#8208;derived xrRNA motifs can confer Xrn1 resistance on a model therapeutic payload and set the stage for further investigations into using the motifs as building blocks in RNA nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Alpha Synuclein only Forms Fibrils In Vitro when Larger than its Critical Size of 70 Monomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical size for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to form a stable fibrils, which can then replicate by monomer addition and fragmentation, has been found to be 70 monomers. Preventing aggregates from reaching this critical size would be a key cellular protective mechanism.







Abstract
The aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into small soluble aggregates and then fibrils is important in the development and spreading of aggregates through the brain in Parkinson's disease. Fibrillar aggregates can grow by monomer addition and then break into fragments that could spread into neighboring cells. The rate constants for fibril elongation and fragmentation have been measured but it is not known how large an aggregate needs to be before fibril formation is thermodynamically favorable. This critical size is an important parameter controlling at what stage in an aggregation reaction fibrils can form and replicate. We determined this value to be approximately 70 monomers using super&#8208;resolution and atomic force microscopy imaging of individual &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates formed in solution over long time periods. This represents the minimum size for a stable &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril and we hypothesis the formation of aggregates of this size in a cell represents a tipping point at which rapid replication occurs.

         <title>Exosomes as targeted delivery platform of CRISPR/Cas9 for therapeutic genome editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic genome editing harnesses the power of genome editing tools to correct erroneous genes associated with disease pathology. To bring the CRISPR/Cas9 tool from the bench to the bedside, a critical hurdle is to safely and efficiently deliver the nucleic acid tool to the desired type of cells in patients. This review discusses the use of natural&#8208;born carriers, extracellular vesicles (EVs), in particular exosomes, to fill up the gap. Exosomes are lipid&#8208;containing nanovesicle released by various types of cells to mediate cell&#8208;cell communications. Their inherent long&#8208;distance transportation capability, biocompatibility, and engineerability have made EVs potential vehicles for delivering therapeutic drugs. We summarize the recent progress of harnessing exosomes as delivery vehicles for the CRISPR/Cas system to achieve therapeutic gene editing for disease treatment, with a focus on various strategies to achieve selective delivery to a particular type of cells and efficient packaging of the genome editing tools in the vesicles. Critical issues and possible solutions in the design and engineering of the targeting vehicles are highlighted. Taken together, we manifest EV/exosome&#8208;mediated packaging of the nucleic acid/protein tools and the cell/tissue&#8208;targeted delivery as a viable way towards the clinical translation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;canonical amino acid substrates of E. coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this comprehensive review, I focus on the twenty  E. coli  aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases and their ability to charge non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) onto tRNAs. The promiscuity of these enzymes has been harnessed for diverse applications including understanding and engineering of protein function, creation of organisms with an expanded genetic code, and the synthesis of diverse peptide libraries for drug discovery. The review catalogs the structures of all known ncAA substrates for each of the 20  E. coli  aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including ncAA substrates for engineered versions of these enzymes. Drawing from the structures in the list, I highlight trends and novel opportunities for further exploitation of these ncAAs in the engineering of protein function, synthetic biology, and in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Synthetic Nanobody Library in Mammalian Cells by dsDNA&#8208;Based Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nanobody is a type of antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antigen&#8208;binding domain. Mammalian cells are ideal platforms for identifying nanobodies targeting hard&#8208;to&#8208;display transmembrane proteins and nanobodies that function as modulators of cellular phenotypes. However, the introduction of a high&#8208;diversity nanobody library into mammalian cells is challenging. We developed two novel methods for constructing a nanobody library in mammalian cells. Complementarity&#8208;determining regions (CDRs) random sequences were first incorporated into upstream and downstream dsDNAs by PCR. In the first method, named dsDNA&#8208;HR, upstream and downstream dsDNAs containing an identical overlapping sequence were co&#8208;transfected into cultured mammalian cells to conduct intracellular homologous recombination that resulted in the formation of an intact nanobody library expression cassette. In the second method, named in vitro ligation, we generated full&#8208;length nanobody expression dsDNAs via ligation of restriction digested upstream and downstream dsDNAs. The obtained full&#8208;length dsDNAs were transfected into mammalian cells for nanobody library expression. Using both methods, we generated over a million unique nanobody sequences, as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Single&#8208;cell sequencing was employed to resolve the diversity of the dsDNA&#8208;HR nanobody library at the single&#8208;cell level. We also identified a small molecule, Nocodazole, which could enhance the efficacy of dsDNA&#8208;HR.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Nanorobots for Tumor&#8208;targeting Drug Delivery: From Dynamic Control to Stimuli&#8208;responsive Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanotechnology has been widely applied to the fabrication of drug delivery systems in the past few decades. Recently, with the progress made in the microfabrication approaches, nanorobots are steadily becoming promising approaches for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. In general, nanorobots can be divided into two categories: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. Nanomotors are nanoscale systems with the ability to convert surrounding energies into mechanical motion, whereas stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are featured with activatable capacity in response to various endogenous and exogenous stimulations. In this minireview, the dynamic control of nanomotors and the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are overviewed, with particular emphasis on their contribution to tumor&#8208;targeting therapy. Moreover, challenges and perspectives associated with the future development of nanorobots are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemical investigation of 3&#8208;sulfopropionaldehyde reductase HpfD</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoquinovose is the polar headgroup of plant sulfolipids and is a globally abundant organosulfur compound, and its degradation by bacteria is an important component of the sulfur cycle. Sulfoquinovose degradation by certain bacteria, including  Escherichia coli  , produces dihydroxypropanesulfonate (DHPS), which is further converted by anaerobic bacteria into 3&#8208;hydroxypropanesulfonate (3&#8208;HPS), through the catalytic action of DHPS dehydratase (a member of the glycyl radical enzyme family), and sulfopropionaldehyde reductase HpfD (a member of the metal&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family). Here we report biochemical investigation of  Hungatella hathewayi  HpfD. In addition to 3&#8208;HPS, HpfD also displayed high catalytic activities for NAD  +  &#8208;dependent oxidation of 4&#8208;hydroxybutanesulfonate (4&#8208;HBS) and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The highest activity was obtained with Fe  2+  or Mn  2+  as the divalent metal cofactor. Bioinformatics studies suggest that, in addition to DHPS degradation, 3&#8208;HPS and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyrate (GABA) degradations also involve HpfD homologs.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;rays actuate anticancer drugs: Opening new vistas in prodrug therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality employed in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. Despite proven clinical success, adverse side effects are one of the drawbacks of this approach. The prodrug strategy has emerged as an alternative approach with the aim of alleviating these drawbacks. Prodrug activation is typically achieved by either endogenous or exogenous triggers. Exogenous triggers like light are appealing as they are independent of inherent patient and/or cancer type variations. However, tissue penetration depth remains the Achilles&#8217;heel of this approach. In this context, usage of X&#8208;rays as the external trigger with infinite tissue penetration depth opens up exciting prospects in prodrug activation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic studies of acetyl group migration between the saccharide units in an oligomannoside trisaccharide model compound and a native galactoglucomannan polysaccharide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl group migration is a fundamental phenomenon in carbohydrate chemistry, recently shown to take place also between two non&#8208;adjacent hydroxyl groups, across the glycosidic bond, in a &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked mannan trisaccharide model compound. With the central mannoside unit containing acetyl groups at the O2 and O3 positions, the O2&#8208;acetyl was in the earlier study shown to migrate to O6 of the reducing end. Potential implications of the general acyl migration process on cell signaling events and plant growth in nature are an intriguing open question. In the present work, migration kinetics in this original trisaccharide model system were studied in more detail together with potential interactions of the model compound and the migration products with DC&#8208;SIGN lectin. Furthermore, we demonstrate here for the first time that similar migration may also take place in native polysaccharides, here represented by galactoglucomannan from Norway spruce.</dc:description>

         <title>An Advanced &#8216;clickECM&#8217; That Can be Modified by the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic glycoengineering was employed to incorporate dienophiles (terminal alkenes and a cyclopropene) into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ASCs). A subsequent inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction allowed the equipment of the ECM with bioactive molecules, opening numerous applications.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the natural environment of cells in tissue and therefore is a promising biomaterial in a variety of applications. Depending on the purpose, it is necessary to equip the ECM with specific addressable functional groups for further modification with bioactive molecules, for controllable cross&#8208;linking and/or covalent binding to surfaces. Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) enables the specific modification of the ECM with such functional groups without affecting the native structure of the ECM. In a previous approach (S.&#8197;M. Ruff, S. Keller, D.&#8197;E. Wieland, V. Wittmann, G.&#8197;E.&#8197;M. Tovar, M. Bach, P.&#8197;J. Kluger, Acta Biomater. 2017, 52, 159&#8211;170), we demonstrated the modification of an ECM with azido groups, which can be addressed by bioorthogonal copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Here, we demonstrate the modification of an ECM with dienophiles (terminal alkenes, cyclopropene), which can be addressed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. This reaction is cell friendly as there are no cytotoxic catalysts needed. We show the equipment of the ECM with a bioactive molecule (enzyme) and prove that the functional groups do not influence cellular behavior. Thus, this new material has great potential for use as a biomaterial, which can be individually modified in a wide range of applications.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>

         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring and engineered promiscuous halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues to be enzymatically synthesised and recycled, using simple and readily available alkyl iodides as alkyl donors. In combination with promiscuous methyltransferases (MTs), they dramatically expand the bioalkylation toolbox.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) and methyl iodide. Characterisation of a range of naturally occurring HMTs and subsequent protein engineering led to HMT variants capable of synthesising ethyl, propyl, and allyl analogues of SAM. Notably, HMTs do not depend on chemical synthesis of methionine analogues, as required by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). However, at the moment MATs have a much broader substrate scope than the HMTs. Herein we provide an overview of the discovery and engineering of promiscuous HMTs and how these strategies will pave the way towards a toolbox of HMT variants for versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

         <title>Preliminary Structural Data Revealed That the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 B.1.617 Variant's RBD Binds to ACE2 Receptor Stronger Than the Wild Type to Enhance the Infectivity</title>

Structural and biomolecular simulation techniques were used in this study to explore the impact of specific mutations in the B.1.617 variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on the binding of receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. The analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic stability, residual flexibility, and structural compactness.







Abstract
The evolution of new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants around the globe has made the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic more worrisome, further pressuring the health care system and immunity. Novel variations that are unique to the receptor&#8208;binding motif (RBM) of the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i.&#8201;e. L452R&#8208;E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R&#8208;E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic&#8208;stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural&#8208;dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants.

         <title>Multicomponent Bioluminescence Imaging with Naphthylamino Luciferins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 16, Page 2650-2654, August 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthylamino luciferins were used for rapid, multi&#8208;component bioluminescent imaging. The analogues were synthesized using a modular route, and activities were measured in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. Mutant luciferases were identified that could differentiate the substrates, and the unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs were compatible with existing bioluminescent probes. These substrates add to the growing set of bioluminescent tools for multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Bioluminescent tools have been used for decades to image processes in complex tissues and preclinical models. However, few distinct probes are available to probe multicellular interactions. We and others are addressing this limitation by engineering new luciferases that can selectively process synthetic luciferin analogues. In this work, we explored naphthylamino luciferins as orthogonal bioluminescent probes. Three analogues were prepared using an optimized synthetic route. The luciferins were found to be robust emitters with native luciferase in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. We further screened the analogues against libraries of luciferase mutants to identify unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs. The new probes can be used in conjunction with existing bioluminescent tools for multi&#8208;component imaging.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Conjugation of a Cationic Metalloporphyrin to BSA and HSA via &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>

Porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugates: We present a method for the conjugation between alkyne&#8208;functionalized BSA and HSA with a cationic azido&#8208;metalloporphyrin that yields conjugates that possess photodynamic activity when evaluated against human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29). Their natural fluorescent properties allow for determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting their potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
In this study, we present a convenient method for the labelling of tyrosine residues on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) and report for the first time their subsequent bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with porphyrins via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry. We demonstrate that these serum proteins can be labelled with an alkyne&#8208;diazonium heterobifunctional linker and can then undergo chemo&#8208;selective bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with a water&#8208;soluble azido metalloporphyrin via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield protein&#8208;conjugates that retain their photodynamic properties. In our hands, this method was found to be highly reproducible, scalable, and tuneable which allows for the production of bioconjugates where the porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugate not only retains an ability to generate singlet oxygen but possess an enhanced relative singlet oxygen quantum yields relative to the porphyrin alone. Furthermore, we have investigated the photochemical properties of these conjugates through photospectrometric techniques and have determined that the porphyrin macrocycles remain appreciably photostable under light irradiation. Our phototoxic protein&#8208;photosensitizer&#8208;conjugates show excellent photodynamic activity against a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (HT&#8208;29) with cell viabilities of 7.7&#177;0.5&#8201;% (IC50 8.76&#177;2.14&#8197;&#956;M) and 1.7&#177;1.9&#8201;% (IC50 8.48&#177;5.11&#8197;&#956;M) for BSA and HAS, respectively, when irradiated with 20&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of white&#8208;light. Importantly, neither of the conjugates was found to possess any significant &#8220;dark&#8221; toxicity even at concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the natural fluorescent properties of the bioconjugates allowed for the determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting the potential theranostic applications of these unique protein&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugates.

         <title>Discovery of the Class I Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide Arcumycin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 16, Page 2632-2640, August 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lasso peptides are a family of natural products that have shown potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. Using a targeted genome mining approach, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides. We validated this approach with the isolation, structural validation, and investigation of bioactivity of a novel class&#8197;I lasso peptide arcumycin.







Abstract
Lasso peptides are a structurally diverse superfamily of conformationally constrained peptide natural products, of which a subset exhibits broad antimicrobial activity. Although advances in bioinformatics have increased our knowledge of strains harboring the biosynthetic machinery for lasso peptide production, relating peptide sequence to bioactivity remains a continuous challenge. To this end, genome mining investigation of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides was performed to correlate predicted structure with antibiotic activity. Bioinformatic evaluation revealed eight putative novel class I lasso peptide sequences. Fermentation of one of these hits, Streptomyces NRRL F&#8208;5639, resulted in the production of a novel class I lasso peptide, arcumycin. Arcumycin exhibited antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis (4&#8197;&#956;g/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL), and Micrococcus luteus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL). Arcumycin treatment of B. subtilis liaI&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal promoter fusion reporter strain resulted in upregulation of the liaRS system by the promoter liaI, indicating arcumycin interferes with lipid&#8197;II biosynthesis. Cumulatively, the results illustrate the relationship between phylogenetically related lasso peptides and their bioactivity as validated through the isolation, structural determination, and evaluation of bioactivity of the novel class&#8197;I antimicrobial lasso peptide arcumycin.

The evolution of promiscuous halide methyltransferases enables the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues from alkyl iodides and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine. This facilitates the synthesis of analogues with alkyl groups larger than methyl groups, which can readily be used by methyltransferases. These processes provide access to diverse alkylated products with altered bioactivities, expanding the synthetic potential of methyltransferases. We expect a toolbox of protein&#8208;engineered halide methyltransferase variants to pave the way towards versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

Understanding drugs&#8217; mechanism of action is integral to successful antimalarial drug development. Recent advances in chemoproteomic methods have created an avenue to globally profile drug targets in the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Some of these strategies even allow direct measurement in living intracellular parasites. The cover feature highlights the achievement of probing the drug&#8211;protein interactome in an intact Plasmodium&#8208;infected erythrocyte.

Metal complexes for COVID&#8208;19&#8201;targets: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has caused a global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. Herein, metal complexes that have been reported to inhibit various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 enzymes and their proposed mechanism of action are discussed.







Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome &#8211; coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), the infectious agent responsible for COVID&#8208;19 &#8211; has caused more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide and triggered a global pandemic. Even with successful vaccines being delivered, there is an urgent need for novel treatments to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and other emerging viral diseases. While several organic small molecule drug candidates are in development, some effort has also been devoted towards the application of metal complexes as potential antiviral agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Herein, the metal complexes that have been reported to show antiviral activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 or one of its target proteins are described and their proposed mechanisms of action are discussed.

Chemoproteomics adapted to Plasmodium parasites enable proteome&#8208;wide assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions. These methods assist in target deconvolution of novel antimalarial compounds, commonly discovered in phenotypic screens, that have unknown mechanisms of action. In this review, we detail current methods of label&#8208;based and energetics&#8208;based chemoproteomics and their application for Plasmodium parasite drug target discovery.







Abstract
Emerging Plasmodium parasite drug resistance is threatening progress towards malaria control and elimination. While recent efforts in cell&#8208;based, high&#8208;throughput drug screening have produced first&#8208;in&#8208;class drugs with promising activities against different Plasmodium life cycle stages, most of these antimalarial agents have elusive mechanisms of action. Though challenging to address, target identification can provide valuable information to facilitate lead optimization and preclinical drug prioritization. Recently, proteome&#8208;wide methods for direct assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions have emerged as powerful tools in a number of systems, including Plasmodium. In this review, we will discuss current chemoproteomic strategies that have been adapted to antimalarial drug target discovery, including affinity&#8208; and activity&#8208;based protein profiling and the energetics&#8208;based techniques thermal proteome profiling and stability of proteins from rates of oxidation. The successful application of chemoproteomics to the Plasmodium blood stage highlights the potential of these methods to link inhibitors to their molecular targets in more elusive Plasmodium life stages and intracellular pathogens in the future.

Intracellular delivery of catalase DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells to activate a ROS&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein (RNase A&#8208;NBC) for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and potential cancer treatment.







Abstract
The conditional control of protein function in response to the physiological change of cells is of great interest for studying protein function in biological settings and developing protein therapeutics. We report herein that catalase (CAT) DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells by knocking down catalase expression, which could further activate a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, in&#8197;situ. Using an optimized lipid nanoparticle delivery system to simultaneously introduce CAT DNAzyme and RNase A&#8208;NBC into cells, we show that the pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, could be activated in a significantly enhanced manner to prohibit tumor cell growth in different types of cancer cells. We believe the methodology of regulating pro&#8208;protein activity using DNAzyme biocatalysis to differentiate intracellular environment could further be extended to other functional proteins, and even fundamental investigations in living systems to develop pro&#8208;protein therapeutics.

A single synthesis and screening strategy yields covalent inhibitors that inactivate bifunctional DNA polymerase &#946; by modifying lysine residues in different active site domains and prevent DNA binding.







Abstract
DNA polymerase &#946; (Pol &#946;) is a frequently overexpressed and/or mutated bifunctional repair enzyme. Pol &#946; possesses polymerase and lyase active sites, that are employed in two steps of base excision repair.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A single synthesis&lt;/b&gt; and screening strategy yields covalent inhibitors that inactivate bifunctional DNA polymerase &#946; by modifying lysine residues in different active site domains and prevent DNA binding.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA polymerase &#946; (Pol &#946;) is a frequently overexpressed and/or mutated bifunctional repair enzyme. Pol &#946; possesses polymerase and lyase active sites, that are employed in two steps of base excision repair. Pol &#946; is an attractive therapeutic target for which there is a need for inhibitors. Two mechanistically inspired covalent inhibitors (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=21.0&#8197;&#956;M; &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=18.7&#8197;&#956;M) that modify lysine residues in different Pol &#946; active sites are characterized. Despite modifying lysine residues in different active sites, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; inactivate the polymerase and lyase activities of Pol &#946;. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments indicate that they do so by preventing DNA binding. Inhibitors &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; provide the basis for a general approach to preparing domain selective inhibitors of bifunctional polymerases.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis Assisted Discovery of Proline&#8208;Rich Macrocyclic Peptides in Marine Sponges</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 16, Page 2614-2618, August 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting an integrated approach of chemoenzymatic synthesis of standards and HCD&#8208;MSn fragmentation, we have sequenced proline&#8208;rich cyclopeptide natural products from marine sponges. Our MSn fragmentation workflow successfully differentiated between leucine and isoleucine residues in the cyclopeptides and can be used to sequence low abundance cyclic peptides from sub&#8208;gram amounts of sponge biomass.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich macrocyclic peptides (PRMPs) are natural products present in geographically and phylogenetically dispersed marine sponges. The large diversity and low abundance of PRMPs in sponge metabolomes precludes isolation and structure elucidation of each individual PRMP congener. Here, using standards developed via biomimetic enzymatic synthesis of PRMPs, a mass spectrometry&#8208;based workflow to sequence PRMPs was developed and validated to reveal that the diversity of PRMPs in marine sponges is much greater than that has been realized by natural product isolation&#8208;based strategies. Findings are placed in the context of diversity&#8208;oriented transamidative macrocyclization of peptide substrates in sponge holobionts.

         <title>Differential Effect of Azetidine Substitution in Firefly Luciferin Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacing an&#160;  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylamino group in a classical fluorophore with a four membered azetidine ring provides an improved luminescence quantum yield.&#160;Herein, we extended this strategy to bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and evaluated its general validity.&#160;For this purpose, four types of luciferin cores were employed, and a total of 8 analogues were evaluated. Among these analogues, unexpectedly, only the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from an azetidine substitution and showed enhanced bioluminescence. In addition, fluorescence measurements revealed that an azetidine substitution improved the fluorescence quantum yield by 2.3&#8208;times compared to a&#160;  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylamino group. These findings clarify the differential effects of azetidine&#8208;substituents in luciferins and present one possible strategy for enhancing photon output in benzothiazole&#160;type luciferins through a synthetic approach.</dc:description>

         <title>B4GALNT2 controls Sda and SLex antigens biosynthesis in healthy and cancer human colon</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Sd  a  carbohydrate antigen and the corresponding biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 are primarily expressed in human normal colonic mucosa and are down&#8208;regulated to variable degrees in colon cancer. On the other hand, the tumor associated antigen SLe  x  is not detected in the healthy colon and is upregulated in colon cancer. High level of  B4GALNT2  gene expression appears to be a good marker of prognosis in colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating these carbohydrate antigens expression are still poorly understood. We review here the most recent progresses made towards understanding this balanced expression of blood group carbohydrate epitopes Sd  a  and SLe  x  . In particular these past years, we got a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulations of the  B4GALNT2  gene and of subcellular fate of B4GALNT2 isoforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine NMR spectroscopy enables to quantify the affinity between DNA and proteins in cell lysate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of the binding affinity quantifying the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is of crucial interest in biological and chemical research. Here, we have made use of sitespecific fluorine labeling of the cold shock protein from  Bacillus subtiliis  ,  Bs  CspB, enabling to directly monitor the interaction with single stranded DNA molecules in cell lysate. High&#8208;resolution  19  F NMR spectroscopy has been applied to exclusively report on resonance signals arising from the protein under study. We have found that this experimental approach advances the reliable determination of the binding affinity between single stranded DNA molecules and its target protein in this complex biological environment by intertwining analyses based on NMR chemical shifts, signal heights, line shapes and simulations. We propose that the here developed experimental platform offers a potent approach for the identification of binding affinities characterizing intermolecular interactions in native surroundings covering the nano&#8208;to&#8208;micromolar range that can be even expanded to  in cell  applications in future studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of a novel mesophilic CTP&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase and rational engineering to create its thermostable homologs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavins play a central role in metabolism as molecules that catalyze a wide range of redox reactions in living organisms. Several variations in flavin biosynthesis exist among the domains of life, and their analysis has revealed many new structural and mechanistic insights till date. The cytidine triphosphate (CTP)&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase in archaea is one such example &#8208; unlike most kinases that use adenosine triphosphate, archaeal riboflavin kinases utilize CTP to phosphorylate riboflavin and produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we present the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal CTP&#8208;utilizing riboflavin kinase homolog from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmpRibK), which is linked closely in sequence to the previously characterized thermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii homolog. We reconstitute the activity of MmpRibK, determine its kinetic parameters and molecular factors that contribute to its unique properties, and finally establish the residues that improve its thermostability using computation and a series of experiments.&#160; Our work advances the molecular understanding of flavin biosynthesis in archaea by the characterization of the first mesophilic CTP&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase. Finally, it validates the role of salt bridges and rigidifying amino acid residues in imparting thermostability to this unique structural fold that characterizes archaeal riboflavin kinase enzymes, with implications in enzyme engineering and biotechnological applications</dc:description>

         <title>M. tuberculosis&#160;indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase: a potential new tuberculosis drug target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogen  M. tuberculosis  , affects millions of people world&#8208;wide. Several TB drugs have lost efficacy due to emerging drug resistance and new anti&#8208;TB targets are needed. Recent research suggests that indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) in  M. tuberculosis  (  Mt  IGPS) could be such a target. IGPS is an (&#946;/&#945;)  8  &#8208;barrel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1&#8208;(o&#8208;carboxyphenylamino)&#8208;1&#8208;deoxyribulose 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (CdRP) into indole&#8208;glycerol&#8208;phosphate (IGP) in the bacterial tryptophan biosynthetic pathway.  M. tuberculosis  over expresses the tryptophan pathway genes during an immune response and inhibition of  Mt  IGPS allows CD4 T&#8208;cells to more effectively fight against  M. tuberculosis  . Here we review the published data on  Mt  IGPS expression, purification, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition. We also discuss  Mt  IGPS crystal structures and compare them to other IGPS structures to reveal potential structure&#8208;function relationships of interest for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.</dc:description>

M. tuberculosis  over expresses the tryptophan pathway genes during an immune response and inhibition of  Mt  IGPS allows CD4 T-cells to more effectively fight against  M. tuberculosis  . Here we review the published data on  Mt  IGPS expression, purification, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition. We also discuss  Mt  IGPS crystal structures and compare them to other IGPS structures to reveal potential structure-function relationships of interest for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Tyrphostin Analogues to Study Inhibition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pup Proteasome System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis is a global health problem caused by infection with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacteria. Although antibiotic treatment has dramatically reduced the impact of tuberculosis on the population, the existence and spreading of drug resistant strains urgently demands the development of new drugs that target Mtb in a different manner than currently used antibiotics. The prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (Pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development as it is unique to Mtb and related bacterial genera. Using a Pup&#8208;based fluorogenic substrate, we screened for inhibitors of Dop, the Mtb depupylating protease, and identified I&#8208;OMe&#8208;Tyrphostin AG538 (  1  ) and Tyrphostin AG538 (  2  ). The hits were validated and determined to be fast&#8208;reversible, non&#8208;ATP competitive inhibitors. We synthesized &gt;25 analogs of  1  and  2  and show that several of the synthesized compounds also inhibit the depupylation actions of Dop on native substrate, FabD&#8208;Pup. Importantly, the pupylation activity of PafA, the sole Pup ligase in Mtb, was also inhibited by some of these compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Building siRNAs with Cubes: Synthesis and Evaluation of Cubane&#8208;Modified siRNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
siRNA lego: Cubane&#8208;functionalized siRNAs lead to potent RNAi&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;silencing activity, and improved strand selection.







Abstract
Cubane molecules hold great potential for medicinal chemistry applications due to their inherent stability and low toxicity. In this study, we report the synthesis of a cubane derivative phosphoramidite for the incorporation of cubane into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Synthetic siRNAs rely on chemical modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profiles. However, they are still able to mediate sequence&#8208;specific gene silencing via the endogenous RNA interference pathway. We designed a library of siRNAs bearing cubane at different positions within the sense and antisense strands. All siRNAs showed excellent gene&#8208;silencing activity, with IC50 values ranging from 45.4 to 305&#8197;pM. Incorporating the cubane modification in both the sense and antisense strand led to viable duplexes with good biological activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of siRNAs bearing a cubane derivative within the backbone.

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule enzymology for diagnostics: profiling alkaline phosphatase activity in clinical samples.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes can be used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, profiling enzyme activity in clinical samples is challenging due to the heterogeneity in enzyme activity, and the low abundance of the target enzyme in biofluids. Single&#8208;molecule methods can overcome these challenges by providing information on the distribution of enzyme activities in a sample. Here, we describe the concept of using the single&#8208;molecule enzymology (SME) method to analyze enzymatic activity in clinical samples. We present recent work focused on measuring alkaline phosphatase isotypes in serum samples using SME. Future work will involve improving and simplifying this technology, and applying it to other enzymes for diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Surface Density of Ligands Controls In&#8208;Plane and Aggregative Modes of Multivalent Glycovesicle&#8208;Lectin Recognitions&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>Glycovesicles are ideal tools to delineate finer mechanisms of the interactions at the biological cell membranes.&#160; Multivalency forms the basis which, in turn, should surpass more than one mechanism in order to maintain multiple roles that the ligand&#8208;lectin interactions encounter.&#160; Ligand densities hold a prime control to attenuate the interactions.&#160; In the present study, mannose trisaccharide interacting with a cognate receptor, namely, Con A, is assessed at the vesicle surfaces.&#160; A synthetic (1&#8594;3)(1&#8594;6)&#8208;branched mannose trisaccharide is tethered with a diacetylene monomer and glycovesicles of varying sugar densities are prepared.&#160; The polydiacetylene vesicles are prepared by maintaining uniform lipid concentrations.&#160; The interactions of the glycovesicles with the lectin are probed through dynamic light scattering and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy techniques.&#160; Binding efficacies are assessed by surface plasmon resonance technique.&#160; Aggregative and in&#8208;plane modes of interactions follow a ligand density&#8208;dependant manner at the vesicle surface. Vesicles with sparsely populated ligands engage lectin in an aggregative mode (trans&#8208;), leading to a cross&#8208;linked complex formation.&#160; Whereas glycovesicles imbedded with dense ligands engage lectin interaction in an in&#8208;plane mode &#160;intramolecularly (cis&#8208;).&#160; Sub&#8208;nanomolar dissociation constants govern the intramolecular interaction occurring within the plane of the vesicle, relatively more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fungal metabolite Fosfonochlorin features a chloroacetyl moiety that is unusual within known phosphonate natural product biochemistry. Putative biosynthetic genes encoding Fosfonochlorin in  Fusarium  and  Talaromyces  spp. were investigated through reactions of encoded enzymes with synthetic substrates and isotope labelling studies. We show that early biosynthetic steps for Fosfonochlorin involves the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to form 2&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, followed by oxidative intramolecular cyclization of the resulting alcohol to form (  S  )&#8208;epoxyethylphosphonic acid. The latter reaction is catalyzed by FfnD, a rare example of a non&#8208;heme iron / 2&#8208;(oxo)glutarate dependent oxacyclase. In contrast, FfnD behaves as a more typical oxygenase with ethylphosphonic acid, producing (  S  )&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid. FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.</dc:description>

Functional protein nanotechnology: We have combined in&#8208;house developed micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology with N&#8208;terminal protein bioconjugation to synthesize diverse protein nanoparticles with advanced functions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric protease to form a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex &#8220;proteasome&#8221; enables targeted protein degradation in living cells. Naturally occurring proteasomes serve as an inspiration and blueprint for the design of artificial protein&#8208;based nanoreactors. Here we disclose a general chemical strategy for the design of proteasome&#8208;like nanoreactors. Micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology along with the N&#8208;terminal bioconjugation strategy is utilized for the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined monodisperse self&#8208;assembling semi&#8208;synthetic protease. The designed protein is programmed to self&#8208;assemble into a proteasome&#8208;like nanostructure which preserves the functional properties of native protease.

         <title>An Autophagy&#8208;Disrupting Small Molecule Promotes Cancer Cell Death via Caspase Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz), identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library, is reported. Autophazole is mainly internalized into lysosomes and disrupts their function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces LMP&#8208;mediated caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. We anticipate that Atz will be a useful chemical probe for elucidating details about the autophagic process and understanding the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I. Shin et&#8197;al.

         <title>Potent Tau aggregation inhibitor D&#8208;peptides selected against Tau&#8208;repeat 2 using mirror image phage display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Therefore, inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. Two hexapeptides within Tau, designated PHF6* (275&#8208;VQIINK&#8208;280) and PHF6 (306&#8208;VQIVYK&#8208;311), are known to promote Tau aggregation. Recently, the PHF6* segment has been described as the more potent driver of Tau aggregation. We employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides inhibited in vitro fibrillization of the PHF6* peptide, the repeat domain of Tau as well as full&#8208;length Tau. We have evidence that MMD3 prevents the formation of tau &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. NMR data suggested that the D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides bound to Tau monomers with rather low affinity, but ELISA data demonstrated binding to PHF6* and full lengths Tau fibrils. In addition, molecular insight into the binding mode of MMD3 to PHF6* fibrils were gained by in silico modelling. The identified PHF6*&#8208;targeting peptides were able to penetrate cells and might be suitable for AD therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP): A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate (DAP), a di&#8208;nitrogenous analogue of orthophosphate, is a versatile phosphorylating&#8208;activating reagent and amine source in the context of aqueous prebiotic chemistry compatible with both prebiotic&#8208; and bio&#8208;molecules. The promising potential of this reagent, enabling a continuous transition from abiotic&#8208;to&#8208;biotic needs to be investigated both from its geochemical provenance and its applicability to (bio)organic transformations.







Abstract
Known since the 1890s, diamidophosphate (DAP) has been investigated within the context of its inorganic chemistry. In 1999 &#8211; with the demonstration of DAP's potential as a&#8197;phosphorylating agent of sugars in aqueous medium &#8211; began the exciting phase of research about DAP's role as a&#8197;plausible prebiotic phosphorylating agent. More recently, in the last five years, there has been a steady increase in the publications that have documented the surprising versatility of DAP enabling the emergence of many classes of biomolecules of life, such as nucleic acids, peptides and protocells. Thus, though in its infancy, DAP seems to be uniquely positioned to play a central role in modelling abiotic&#8208; to prebiotic&#8208;chemical evolution. In this context, there is a need for systematic investigations for: (a)&#8197;establishing DAP's likely availability on the early Earth, and (b)&#8197;developing DAP's potential as a tool for use in synthetic and bioorganic chemistry.

         <title>Probing the Role of Chirality in Phospholipid Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular handedness, or chirality, can determine the nature of molecular interactions. A key feature of life is the homochirality of biological molecules, including phospholipids. Chemical probes have been used to understand stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes, which has been applied to the development of safer therapeutics and selective chemical tools.







Abstract
Nucleotides, amino acids, sugars, and lipids are almost ubiquitously homochiral within individual cells on Earth. While oligonucleotides and proteins exist as one natural chirality throughout the tree of life, two stereoisomers of phospholipids have separately emerged in archaea and bacteria, an evolutionary divergence known as &#8220;the lipid divide&#8221;. Within this review, we focus on the emergence of phospholipid homochirality and compare the stability of synthetic homochiral and heterochiral membranes in&#8197;vitro. We discuss chemical probes designed to study the stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes in&#8197;vitro. Overall, we aim to highlight studies that help elucidate the determinants of stereospecific interactions between lipids, peptides, and small molecule ligands. Continued work in understanding the drivers of favorable interactions between chiral molecules and biological membranes will lead to the design of increasingly selective chemical tools for bioorthogonal labeling of lipid membranes and safer membrane&#8208;associating pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Complex&#8208;Based G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Selective Luminescent &#8216;Light&#8208;up&#8217; Probe for RNase H Activity Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex&#8208;based, highly selective photoluminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; probe for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA has been developed and utilized for selective RNase H activity detection. The PL light&#8208;up is solely due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide sidearm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was supported by molecular docking analysis.







Abstract
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex, 1[PF6]2 of benzothiazole amide substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (bmbbipy) has been synthesized for the selective detection of G&#8208;quadruplex (GQ) DNA and luminescence&#8208;assay&#8208;based RNase H activity monitoring. Compound 1[PF6]2 exhibited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in water. Aggregate formation was supported by DLS, UV&#8208;vis, and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy results, and the morphology of aggregated particles was witnessed by SEM and TEM. 1[PF6]2 acted as an efficient GQ DNA&#8208;selective luminescent light&#8208;up probe over single&#8208;stranded and double&#8208;stranded DNA. The competency of 1[PF6]2 for selective GQ structure detection was established by PL and CD spectroscopy. For 1[PF6]2, the PL light&#8208;up is exclusively due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide side arm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was analyzed by molecular docking analysis. The GQ structure detection capability of 1[PF6]2 was further applied in the luminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; RNase H activity detection. The assay utilized an RNA:DNA hybrid, obtained from 22AG2&#8208;RNA and 22AG2&#8208;DNA sequences. RNase H solely hydrolyzed the RNA of the RNA:DNA duplex and released G&#8208;rich 22AG2&#8208;DNA, which was detected via the PL enhancement of 1[PF6]2. The selectivity of RNase H activity detection over various other restriction enzymes was also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>Protein engineering has been used to enhance the activities, selectivities, and stabilities of enzymes.&#160; Frequently tradeoffs are observed, where improvements in some features can come at the expense of others.&#160; Nature uses modular assembly of active sites for complex, multi&#8208;step reactions, and natural &#8220;swing arm&#8221; mechanisms have evolved to transfer intermediates between active sites. &#160;Biomimetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) swing arms modified with NAD(H) have been explored to introduce synthetic swing arms into fused oxidoreductases.&#160; Here we report that increasing NAD(H)&#8208;PEG swing arms can improve the activity of synthetic formate:malate oxidoreductases as well as the thermal and operational stabilities of the biocatalysts.&#160; The modular assembly approach enables the K  M  values of new enzymes to be predictable, based on the parental enzymes.&#160; We describe four unique synthetic transhydrogenases that have no native homologs, and this platform could be easily extended for the predictive design of additional synthetic cofactor&#8208;independent transhydrogenases.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;Denitrosylase&#8208;like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Conjugated with Xaa&#8208;His Dipeptide: Role of Proline Spacer as a Key Activity Booster</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study developed dipeptide&#8208;conjugated 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine (1), i.e., 1&#8208;Xaa&#8208;His, as a new class of S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic. The synthesized compounds, especially 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His, remarkably promoted S&#8208;denitrosylation of nitrosothiols (RSNO) via a catalytic cycle involving the reversible redox reaction between the diselenide and its corresponding diselenol ([SeH,SeH]) form with coexisting reductant thiols (R'SH), during which the [SeH,SeH] form as a key reactive species reduces RSNO to the corresponding thiol (RSH). Structural analyses of 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His suggested that the peptide backbone of [SeH,SeH] is rigidly bent to form a &#947;&#8208;turn, possibly including an NH&#183;&#183;&#183;Se hydrogen bond between the imidazole ring of His and selenol group, thus stabilizing the [SeH,SeH] form thermodynamically, and dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the synthetic compounds were found to prohibit S&#8208;nitrosylation&#8208;induced protein misfolding in the presence of RSNO, eventually implying their potential as a drug seed for misfolding diseases caused by the dysregulation of the S&#8208;denitrosylation system.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates is reported. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain.







Abstract
The reversible nature of disulfide functionality has been exploited to design intelligent materials such as nanocapsules, micelles, vesicles, inorganic nanoparticles, peptide and nucleic acid nanodevices. Herein, we report a new chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The disulfide functionality is strategically placed between the dendron and protein domains. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the protein assemblies is demonstrated using a suitable redox trigger.

         <title>The Chemical Biology&#8208;Medicinal Chemistry Continuum: EFMC&#8242;s Vision</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scientific continuum? EFMC covers the field of chemical biology to medicinal chemistry. What are these disciplines, and how do they differentiate, if at all? This article discusses EFMC's current understanding of chemical biology, and its relation to medicinal chemistry, biology and biochemistry. Chemical biology includes many activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools, and their use to probe, characterize or influence biological systems.







Abstract
The European Federation for Medicinal chemistry and Chemical biology (EFMC) is a federation of learned societies. It groups organizations of European scientists working in a dynamic field spanning chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. New ideas, tools, and technologies emerging from a wide array of scientific disciplines continuously energize this rapidly evolving area. Medicinal chemistry is the design, synthesis, and optimization of biologically active molecules aimed at discovering new drug candidates &#8211; a mission that in many ways overlaps with the scope of chemical biology. Chemical biology is by now a mature field of science for which a more precise definition of what it encompasses, in the frame of EFMC, is timely. This article discusses chemical biology as currently understood by EFMC, including all activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools and their use to probe, characterize, or influence biological systems.

         <title>Enzymatic Assays to Explore Viral mRNA Capping Machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To escape recognition by the host innate immune system, viruses often incorporate 5&#8242; caps into their mRNAs. The differences in mRNA capping make this process an interesting therapeutic target. Here, we review methods to explore the enzymes involved in cap biosynthesis. Such methods allow inhibitor selection, facilitating antiviral drug discovery, which is especially important considering the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks.







Abstract
In eukaryotes, mRNA is modified by the addition of the 7&#8208;methylguanosine (m7G) 5&#8242; cap to protect mRNA from premature degradation, thereby enhancing translation and enabling differentiation between self (endogenous) and non&#8208;self RNAs (e.&#8201;g., viral ones). Viruses often develop their own mRNA capping pathways to augment the expression of their proteins and escape host innate immune response. Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and facilitate drug discovery, e.&#8201;g., against viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks, such as beta&#8208;coronaviruses SARS&#8208;CoV (2002), MARS&#8208;CoV (2012), and the most recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, proper methods for the screening of large compound libraries are required to identify lead structures that could serve as a basis for rational antiviral drug design. This review summarizes the methods that allow the monitoring of the activity and inhibition of enzymes involved in mRNA capping.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Solid&#8208;Phase Assay for Substrate Profiling and Directed Evolution of Transketolase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (wild type or variants) in combination with donor (&#945;&#8208;ketoacids) and acceptor substrates (aldehydes), obviating enzyme extraction.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes, and specifically transketolases, form one of the most important families of biocatalytic tools for enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation yielding various hydroxyketones of biological interest. To enable substrate profiling of transketolases for acceptance of different donors and acceptors, a&#8197;simple, direct colorimetric assay based on pH reaction variation was developed to establish a&#8197;high&#8208;throughput solid&#8208;phase assay. This assay reduces the screening effort in the directed evolution of transketolases, as only active variants are selected for further analysis. Transketolase activity is detected as bicarbonate anions released from the &#945;&#8208;ketoacid donor substrate, which causes the pH to rise. A&#8197;pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase variants, obviating enzyme extraction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A pH indicator&lt;/b&gt;, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase from &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; (wild type or variants) in combination with donor (&#945;-ketoacids) and acceptor substrates (aldehydes), obviating enzyme extraction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes, and specifically transketolases, form one of the most important families of biocatalytic tools for enantioselective carbon-carbon bond formation yielding various hydroxyketones of biological interest. To enable substrate profiling of transketolases for acceptance of different donors and acceptors, a&#8197;simple, direct colorimetric assay based on pH reaction variation was developed to establish a&#8197;high-throughput solid-phase assay. This assay reduces the screening effort in the directed evolution of transketolases, as only active variants are selected for further analysis. Transketolase activity is detected as bicarbonate anions released from the &#945;-ketoacid donor substrate, which causes the pH to rise. A&#8197;pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase variants, obviating enzyme extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Peptide&#8208;PAINT Enables Investigation of Endogenous Talin with Molecular Scale Resolution in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PIPKI&#947;&#8208;peptide&#8208;PAINT approach is introduced in this study to enable quantitative investigation of the cell adhesion protein talin with single&#8208;molecule resolution in cells. The technique does not require genetic modifications and allows the analysis of endogenously expressed molecules. The first application reveals atypical adhesion structures in differentiating mesenchymal stem cells.







Abstract
Talin is a cell adhesion molecule that is indispensable for the development and function of multicellular organisms. Despite its central role for many cell biological processes, suitable methods to investigate the nanoscale organization of talin in its native environment are missing. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining single&#8208;molecule resolved PAINT (points accumulation in nanoscale topography) imaging with the IRIS (image reconstruction by integrating exchangeable single&#8208;molecule localization) approach, enabling the quantitative analysis of genetically unmodified talin molecules in cells. We demonstrate that a previously reported peptide can be utilized to specifically label the two major talin isoforms expressed in mammalian tissues with a localization precision of &lt;10&#8197;nm. Our experiments show that the methodology performs equally well as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;molecule localization techniques, and the first applications reveal a thus far undescribed cell adhesion structure in differentiating stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this peptide&#8208;PAINT technique to mouse tissues paving the way to single&#8208;protein imaging of endogenous talin proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Comparisons of &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Propensity Among Peptides with Homochiral or Heterochiral Strands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As predicted by Pauling and Corey, pairing of homochiral (all&#8208;L) peptide strands leads to pleated &#946;&#8208;sheets, while pairing of L and D strands leads to rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets. Our evidence indicates that heterochiral strand pairing in aqueous solution is less favorable than homochiral strand pairing.







Abstract
Assemblies of racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides have attracted attention for biomedical applications because racemic forms of peptides can self&#8208;associate more avidly than do single enantiomers. In 1953, Pauling and Corey proposed &#8220;rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; modes of H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated interstrand assembly for alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;peptide strands; this structural hypothesis was complementary to their proposal of &#8220;pleated &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; assembly for L&#8208;peptides. Although no high&#8208;resolution structure has been reported for a rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet, there is strong evidence for the occurrence of rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets in some racemic peptide assemblies. Here we compare propensities of peptide diastereomers in aqueous solution to form a minimum increment of &#946;&#8208;sheet in which two antiparallel strands associate. &#946;&#8208;Hairpin folding is observed for homochiral peptides with aligned nonpolar side chains, but no &#946;&#8208;hairpin population can be detected for diastereomers in which one strand contains L residues and the other contains D residues. These observations suggest that rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are stabilized by interactions between &#946;&#8208;sheet layers rather than interactions within these layers.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Imaging and Identification of Bacterial Toxins Causing Mushroom Soft Rot and Cavity Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of genome mining, metabolic profiling, and imaging techniques (MALDI and UV Raman spectroscopy) provided insight into the arsenal of antifungals produced by the mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola. Targeted gene knockouts and bioassays link these antifungals to prevalent symptoms of mushroom soft rot, browning, and impaired mycelium growth.







Abstract
Soft rot disease of edible mushrooms leads to rapid degeneration of fungal tissue and thus severely affects farming productivity worldwide. The bacterial mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola has been identified as the cause. Yet, little is known about the molecular basis of the infection, the spatial distribution and the biological role of antifungal agents and toxins involved in this infectious disease. We combine genome mining, metabolic profiling, MALDI&#8208;Imaging and UV Raman spectroscopy, to detect, identify and visualize a complex of chemical mediators and toxins produced by the pathogen during the infection process, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin, and sinapigladioside. Furthermore, targeted gene knockouts and in&#8197;vitro assays link antifungal agents to prevalent symptoms of soft rot, mushroom browning, and impaired mycelium growth. Comparisons of related pathogenic, mutualistic and environmental Burkholderia spp. indicate that the arsenal of antifungal agents may have paved the way for ancestral bacteria to colonize niches where frequent, antagonistic interactions with fungi occur. Our findings not only demonstrate the power of label&#8208;free, in&#8197;vivo detection of polyyne virulence factors by Raman imaging, but may also inspire new approaches to disease control.

         <title>Synthesis of KUE&#8208;siRNA Conjugates for Prostate Cancer Cell&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates were constructed based on propargyl&#8208;terminated siRNAs and lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE) ligands. These siRNA conjugates could selectively enter prostate cancer cells expressing prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to mediate the specific gene knockdown.







Abstract
The delivery of siRNAs to selectively target cells poses a great challenge in RNAi&#8208;based cancer therapy. The lack of suitable cell&#8208;targeting methods seriously restricts the advance in delivering siRNAs to extrahepatic tissues. Based on prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting ligands, we have synthesized a series of lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE)&#8208;siRNA conjugates and verified their effective cell uptake and gene silencing properties in prostate cancers. The results indicated that the KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates could selectively enter PSMA+ LNCaP cells, eventually down&#8208;regulating STAT3 expression. Based on post&#8208;synthesis modification and receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, this strategy of constructing ligand&#8208;siRNA conjugates might provide a general method of siRNA delivery for cell&#8208;targeted gene silencing.

         <title>Sphaeropsidin A: a Pimarane Diterpene with Interesting Biological Activities and Promising Practical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fungal pimarane diterpene sphaeropsidin A (SphA) has shown promising application in agriculture and medicine. This article reviews its biosynthetic origins, fungal sources, preparation of semisynthetic derivatives and biological activities as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies.







Abstract
Sphaeropsidin A (SphA) is a tetracyclic pimarane diterpene, first isolated as the main phytotoxin produced by Diplodia cupressi the causal agent of a severe canker disease of Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens&#8197;L.). It was also produced, together with several analogues, by different pathogenic Diplodia species and other fungi and showed a broad array of biological activities suggesting its promising application in agriculture and medicine. The anticancer activity of SphA is very potent and cell specific. Recent studies have revealed its unique mode of action. This minireview reports the structures of SphA and its family of natural analogues, their biosynthetic origins, their fungal sources, and biological activities. The preparation of various SphA derivatives is also described as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies and on their potential practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Sphaeropsidin A (SphA) is a tetracyclic pimarane diterpene, first isolated as the main phytotoxin produced by &lt;i&gt;Diplodia cupressi&lt;/i&gt; the causal agent of a severe canker disease of Italian cypress (&lt;i&gt;Cupressus sempervirens&lt;/i&gt;&#8197;L.). It was also produced, together with several analogues, by different pathogenic &lt;i&gt;Diplodia&lt;/i&gt; species and other fungi and showed a broad array of biological activities suggesting its promising application in agriculture and medicine. The anticancer activity of SphA is very potent and cell specific. Recent studies have revealed its unique mode of action. This minireview reports the structures of SphA and its family of natural analogues, their biosynthetic origins, their fungal sources, and biological activities. The preparation of various SphA derivatives is also described as well as the results of structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and on their potential practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Evaluation of an E. coli Cell Extract Prepared by Lysozyme&#8208;Assisted Sonication via Gene Expression, Phage Assembly and Proteomics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
E. coli extracts can be prepared using a simple combination of lysozyme incubation and ultrasonication. We evaluate their performance in cell&#8208;free protein expression via the expression of reporter proteins, the assembly of bacteriophages, and using proteomics. Our results show a synergistic effect of both lysis methods.







Abstract
Over the past decades, starting from crude cell extracts, a variety of successful preparation protocols and optimized reaction conditions have been established for the production of cell&#8208;free gene expression systems. One of the crucial steps during the preparation of cell extract&#8208;based expression systems is the cell lysis procedure itself, which largely determines the quality of the active components of the extract. Here we evaluate the utility of an E. coli cell extract, which was prepared using a combination of lysozyme incubation and a gentle sonication step. As quality measure, we demonstrate the cell&#8208;free expression of YFP at concentrations up to 0.6&#8197;mg/mL. In addition, we produced and assembled T7 bacteriophages up to a titer of 108&#8197;PFU/mL. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantitative proteomics was used to compare the produced extracts with each other and with a commercial extract. The differences in protein composition were surprisingly small between lysozyme&#8208;assisted sonication (LAS) extracts, but we observed an increase in the release of DNA&#8208;binding proteins for increasing numbers of sonication cycles. Proteins taking part in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, amino acid and nucleotide related pathways were found to be more abundant in the LAS extract, while proteins related to RNA modification and processing, DNA modification and replication, transcription regulation, initiation, termination and the TCA cycle were found enriched in the commercial extract.

         <title>Recent Developments and Strategies for Mutually Orthogonal Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of mutually exclusive &#8216;orthogonal bioorthogonal&#8217; reaction pairs has received increasing attention over the past decade. This minireview discusses strategies that have been employed to achieve successful dual and triple ligation systems that display both good kinetics and minimal cross&#8208;reactivities. These tools have potential applications for the observation of simultaneous biological processes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Over the past decade, several different metal&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions have been developed to enable simultaneous double&#8208;click labeling with minimal&#8208;to&#8208;no competing cross&#8208;reactivities; such transformations are termed &#8216;mutually orthogonal&#8217;. More recently, several examples of successful triple ligation strategies have also been described. In this minireview, we discuss selected aspects of the development of orthogonal bioorthogonal reactions over the past decade, including general strategies to drive future innovations to achieve simultaneous, mutually orthogonal click reactions in one pot.

High&#8208;resolution light microscopy of Helicobacter pylori&#8208;infected gastric tissue (400&#215; magnification): The picture shows a composite fluorescent image of gastric tissue stained with eosin (pseudo&#8208;colored blue) producing lactoferrin (pseudocolored overlay cyan), with the structure of lactoferrin in an inset (circular panel). H. pylori is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial pathogen that infects the stomach and causes ulcers and gastric cancer. The host innate immune system produces the glycoprotein lactoferrin as part of the antimicrobial response to bacterial infection, and this molecule can repress the oncogenic activity of the H. pylori cag T4SS in an iron&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Engineered RebH Halogenase Variants Demonstrating a Specificity Switch from Tryptophan towards Novel Indole Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two engineered halogenase enzymes were developed by switching substrate specificity of the parental enzyme from tryptophan to indole compounds. They can halogenate several industrially important indole derivatives more efficiently than the parental enzyme; this includes enzymatic chlorination/bromination of novel substrates that were not reported previously. The engineered enzymes could be useful in regioselective synthesis of drug intermediates.







Abstract
Activating industrially important aromatic hydrocarbons by installing halogen atoms is extremely important in organic synthesis and often improves the pharmacological properties of drug molecules. To this end, tryptophan halogenase enzymes are potentially valuable tools for regioselective halogenation of arenes, including various industrially important indole derivatives and similar scaffolds. Although endogenous enzymes show reasonable substrate scope towards indole compounds, their efficacy can often be improved by engineering. Using a structure&#8208;guided semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis approach, we have developed two RebH variants with expanded biocatalytic repertoires that can efficiently halogenate several novel indole substrates and produce important pharmaceutical intermediates. Interestingly, the engineered enzymes are completely inactive towards their natural substrate tryptophan in spite of their high tolerance to various functional groups in the indole ring. Computational modelling and molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic insights into the role of gatekeeper residues in the substrate binding site and the dramatic switch in substrate specificity when these are mutated.

         <title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Natural Products of Commensal Microbiota as an Environmental Selection Pressure for the Rise of New Variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico studies suggest that NPs like bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) produced by bacteria residing in the respiratory tract can interfere with the binding of the original strain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to the ACE2 receptor but not with the binding of the emerging variants having the N501Y mutation. Thus, it is hypothesized that NPs of respiratory tract bacteria are an environmental selection pressure for the rise of new variants of the virus with higher infectivity rate.







Abstract
Since the emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, little attention has been paid to the interplay between the interaction of virus and commensal microbiota. Here, we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations to study the interaction of some of the known metabolites and natural products (NPs) produced by commensal microbiota with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The results predict that NPs of commensal microbiota such as bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs), of which some are siderophores, bind to the wild&#8208;type RBD and interfere with its binding to the ACE2 receptor. N501Y mutation, which is present in many of the emerging variants of the virus, abolishes the predicted binding pocket of bile acids and NRPs. Based on these findings, available experimental data showing that bile acids reduce the binding affinity of wild&#8208;type RBD to the ACE2 receptor, and the data suggesting that the respiratory tract microbiota affect viral infection we put forward the following proposal: mutations such as N501Y enable the RBD to bind to the ACE2 receptor more effectively in the presence of NPs produced by the respiratory tract bacteria thereby, increasing the infectivity rate of the virus. We hope our data stimulate future works to better understand the interactions of NPs produced by commensal microbiota with respiratory viruses like SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In silico studies&lt;/b&gt; suggest that NPs like bile acids and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) produced by bacteria residing in the respiratory tract can interfere with the binding of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor but not with the binding of the emerging variants having the N501Y mutation. Thus, it is hypothesized that NPs of respiratory tract bacteria are an environmental selection pressure for the rise of new variants of the virus with higher infectivity rate.

         <title>An Autophagy&#8208;Disrupting Small Molecule Promotes Cancer Cell Death via Caspase Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz) is reported which was identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. Autophazole was found to disrupt lysosomal function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization&#8208;associated apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
A novel autophagy inhibitor, autophazole (Atz), which promoted cancer cell death via caspase activation, is described. This compound was identified from cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. The results showed that Atz was internalized into lysosomes of cells where it induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). This process generated nonfunctional autolysosomes, thereby inhibiting autophagy. In addition, Atz was found to promote LMP&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Specifically, LMP induced by Atz caused release of cathepsins from lysosomes into the cytosol. Cathepsins in the cytosol cleaved Bid to generate tBid, which subsequently activated Bax to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This event led to cancer cell death via caspase activation. Overall, the findings suggest that Atz will serve as a new chemical probe in efforts aimed at gaining a better understanding of the autophagic process.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Hydroxylated Vitamin D3 Derivatives and Their Metabolism by CYP27B1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of CYP27B1 in C1 hydroxylation of a series of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated D3 derivatives was explored. We found that the 24R and 26R metabolites were more effectively hydroxylated at C1 by CYP27B1 compared to the corresponding S diastereomers. However, CYP27B1 showed almost no activity towards either of the diastereomers of the 23&#8208;hydroxylated derivative. This is the first report to show that CYP27B1 metabolizes 26&#8208;hydroxylated D3, converting 25,26D3 to the corresponding 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated compound, 1,25,26D3.







Abstract
1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (abbreviated here as 1,25D3) is a hormonally active form of vitamin D3 (D3), and is produced from D3 by CYP27&#8197;A1&#8208;mediated hydroxylation at C25, followed by CYP27B1&#8208;mediated hydroxylation at C1. Further hydroxylation of 25D3 and 1,25D3 occurs at C23, C24 and C26 to generate corresponding metabolites, except for 1,25R,26D3. Since the capability of CYP27B1 to hydroxylate C1 of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated metabolites other than 23S,25D3 and 24R,25D3 has not been examined, we have here explored the role of CYP27B1 in the C1 hydroxylation of a series of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated D3 derivatives. We found that CYP27B1 hydroxylates the R diastereomers of 24,25D3 and 25,26D3 more effectively than the S diastereomers, but shows almost no activity towards either diastereomer of 23,25D3. This is the first report to show that CYP27B1 metabolizes 25,26D3 to the corresponding 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivative, 1,25,26D3. It will be interesting to examine the physiological relevance of this finding.

Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the dynamics of the cell&#8216;s molecular systems. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging of biomolecules in living cells, especially for G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, are introduced. The potential of a single&#8208;molecule imaging approach for chemical translational biology is discussed based on the recent progress in single&#8208;molecule imaging methods.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the motility of molecules in living cells. Considering the relationship between the motility of molecules and their function, information obtained from single&#8208;molecule imaging involves essential clues for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the processes of target molecules, and translation to applied sciences such as drug discovery. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging studies on G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are mainly introduced, and recent techniques of single&#8208;molecule imaging for overcoming the limitation of single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging are discussed. Based on these studies, the prospects of single&#8208;molecule imaging will be outlined.

         <dc:description>
Ubiquitination plays a prominent role in cell signaling networks. Enzymes governing ubiquitination include the conjugation machinery along with the deconjugating enzymes &#8208; deubiquitases. A MspA nanopore is demonstrated as a sensor for discriminating and quantifying various ubiquitin proteins. Real&#8208;time measurement of polymeric ubiquitin chain disassembly by a deubiquitinating enzyme was performed and enzyme kinetics were determined. The implementation of MspA into arrays could enable high throughput characterizations of unknown deubiquitinases as well as drug screening against disease&#8208;related enzymes. More information can be found in the Communication by Min Chen et&#8197;al.

A new class of propiolamide&#8208;based GPX4 inhibitors was discovered in an unbiased screen of 930 electrophilic fragments under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We show that the novel GPX4 inhibitors displayed normoxia&#8208;selective toxicity, which can be expanded to canonical ferroptosis inducers in three different cell lines. This underscores the importance of tumor oxygenation when developing GPX4 inhibitors for therapeutic use.







Abstract
The identification of growth inhibitory compounds with the ability to selectively target the cellular oxygenation state may be of therapeutic interest. Here, a phenotypic screen of a&#8197;covalent fragment library revealed diverse compounds containing propiolamide warheads with selective toxicity for liver cancer cells in normoxic conditions. Target identification and validation through CETSA and direct pulldown experiments demonstrated that several compounds target glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) and induce ferroptotic cell death. Although being an oxidative cell death mechanism, ferroptosis can be induced also under hypoxic conditions. Prompted by the selective toxicity discovered in the screen, we mapped the oxygen&#8208;dependence of several ferroptosis&#8208;inducing compounds across three different cell lines. These studies revealed combinations with notable reductions in sensitivity under hypoxic conditions. These observations are mechanistically interesting and may be relevant for the use of ferroptosis&#8208;inducers as anti&#8208;cancer agents.

         <title>Characterization of Fluorescent Proteins with Intramolecular Photostabilization**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental strategy is introduced to characterize the effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. &#945;&#8208;GFP variant A206C/L221C allowed attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides (trolox, nitrophenyl, cyclooctatetraene and azobenzene) on the &#946;&#8208;barrel in proximity to the chromophore. Increases of photostability were found upon conjugation of azobenzene with a photostability mechanism to be elucidated.







Abstract
Genetically encodable fluorescent proteins have revolutionized biological imaging in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. Despite their importance, their photophysical properties, i.&#8201;e., brightness, count&#8208;rate and photostability, are relatively poor compared to synthetic organic fluorophores or quantum dots. Intramolecular photostabilizers were recently rediscovered as an effective approach to improve photophysical properties of organic fluorophores. Here, direct conjugation of triplet&#8208;state quenchers or redox&#8208;active substances creates high local concentrations of photostabilizer around the fluorophore. In this paper, we screen for effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. We produced a double cysteine mutant (A206C/L221C) of &#945;&#8208;GFP for attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides on the &#946;&#8208;barrel near the chromophore. Whereas labelling with photostabilizers such as trolox, a&#8197;nitrophenyl group, and cyclooctatetraene, which are often used for organic fluorophores, had no effect on &#945;&#8208;GFP&#8208;photostability, a substantial increase of photostability was found upon conjugation to azobenzene. Although the mechanism of the photostabilizing effects remains to be elucidated, we speculate that the higher triplet&#8208;energy of azobenzene might be crucial for triplet&#8208;quenching of fluorophores in the blue spectral range. Our study paves the way for the development of fluorescent proteins with photostabilizers in the protein barrel by methods such as unnatural amino acid incorporation.

         <title>Enzymatic Asymmetric Reduction of Unfunctionalized C=C Bonds with Archaeal Geranylgeranyl Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases were tested for the biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of isolated unfunctionalized C=C bonds. The reduction of acyclic terpene chains with different head groups showed great tolerance for substrates, without affecting cyclic or terminal C=C bonds. Moreover, the introduction of a succinate hemiester significantly increased conversion. The reaction is highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (ee&gt;99&#8201;%).







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of activated C=C bonds such as enones is well established for non&#8208;enzymatic methods as well as in biocatalysis. However, the asymmetric reduction of unfunctionalized C=C bonds is mainly performed with transition metal catalysts whereas biocatalytic approaches are lacking. We have tested two FAD&#8208;dependent archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases (GGR) for the asymmetric reduction of isolated C=C bonds. The reduction of up to four double bonds in terpene chains with different chain lengths and head groups was confirmed. Methyl&#8208;branched E&#8208;alkenes were chemoselectively reduced in the presence of cyclic, terminal or activated alkenes. Using a removable succinate &#8220;spacer&#8221;, farnesol and geraniol could be quantitatively reduced (&gt;99&#8201;%). The reduction is strictly (R)&#8208;selective (enantiomeric excess &gt;99&#8201;%). Hence, GGRs are promising biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of unactivated isolated C=C bonds, opening new opportunities for the synthesis of enantiopure branched alkyl chains.

         <title>Enhancement of the Catalytic Activity of Hammerhead Ribozymes by Organic Cations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapentylammonium (TPeA) ions can enhance the turnover activity of the long&#8208;chain hammerhead ribozyme. The bulky cation decreases the stability of base&#8208;paired secondary structures of duplex, hairpin and self&#8208;forming structures that are formed by the ribozyme and substrate strands, but does not greatly destabilize the folded tertiary ribozyme&#8208;substrate complex.







Abstract
Catalytic turnover is important for the application of ribozymes to biotechnology. However, the turnover is often impaired because of the intrinsic high stability of base pairs with cleaved RNA products. Here, organic cations were used as additives to improve the catalytic performance of hammerhead ribozyme constructs that exhibit different kinetic behaviors. Kinetic analysis of substrate cleavage demonstrated that bulky cations, specifically tetra&#8208;substituted ammonium ions containing pentyl groups or a benzyl group, have the ability to greatly increase the turnover rate of the ribozymes. Thermal stability analysis of RNA structures revealed that the bulky cations promote the dissociation of cleaved products and refolding of incorrectly folded structures with small disruption of the catalytic structure. The use of bulky cations is a convenient method for enhancing the catalytic activity of hammerhead ribozymes, and the approach may be useful for advancing ribozyme technologies.

         <dc:description>
This picture shows the 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) motif which chelates the zinc ion of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). To identify non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases, the TFMAL motif was discovered by screening a metal chelator chemical library. Subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design led to the discovery of compounds that exhibit sufficient HDAC6 inhibitory activity and selectivity in both in vitro and in cellulo experiments. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Suzuki et&#8197;al.

         <title>Recent Advances in Light Energy Conversion with Biomimetic Vesicle Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicles can be used for the compartmentalization of chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembly of reaction partners. This minireview highlights recent advances in biomimetic and light&#8208;induced energy conversions with liposomes and polymersomes, relevant in the context of energy transfer, electron transfer, photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable self&#8208;assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane&#8208;facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer. The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer&#8208;membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light&#8208;driven reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vesicles&lt;/b&gt; can be used for the compartmentalization of chemical reactions and self-assembly of reaction partners. This minireview highlights recent advances in biomimetic and light-induced energy conversions with liposomes and polymersomes, relevant in the context of energy transfer, electron transfer, photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable self-assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane-facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer. The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer-membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light-driven reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>PEGylated Oligothioetheramide Prodrugs Activated by Host Serum Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High host toxicity presents a challenging barrier to clinical application of small&#8208;molecule antibiotics. PEG conjugation incorporating a reactivation mechanism triggered by host proteases effectively reduces toxicity through controlled release of the antibiotic. While highlighting the utility of synthetic, proteolytically stable compounds like oligoTEAs, this approach is translatable to similar therapeutics.







Abstract
Due to the increasing prominence of antibiotic resistance, novel drug discovery and delivery approaches targeting bacteria are essential. In this work we evaluate a prodrug design to improve the cytotoxic profile of polycationic oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs), which are promising antimicrobials. Herein we chemically modify the oligoTEA, PDT&#8208;4G, with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) and show that 1, 2, and 5&#8197;kDa PEGs mitigate cytotoxicity. As PEGylation reduces antibacterial activity, we evaluate two peptide linkers which, unlike oligoTEAs, are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in serum. To gain insight into the prodrug reactivation, two linkers were tested, the 5&#8208;residue peptide sequence LMPTG, and the dipeptide sequence VC&#8208;PABC. In the presence of 20&#8201;% serum, prodrugs made with the VC&#8208;PABC linker successfully inhibited bacterial growth. Overall, we observed reactivation of oligoTEAs facilitated by serum protease cleavage of the peptide linkers. This work opens the door to the future design of antimicrobial prodrugs with tunable release profiles.

         <title>Identification of Novel Histone Deacetylase 6&#8208;Selective Inhibitors Bearing 3,3,3&#8208;Trifluorolactic Amide (TFLAM) Motif as a Zinc Binding Group</title>

Non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors: We identified isoindoline compounds bearing 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel zinc binding group by screening a compound library and the subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design (SBDD). The identified inhibitor exhibited potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced Treg cell differentiation.







Abstract
Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer and immunological diseases. Most of the previously reported HDAC6 inhibitors have a hydroxamate group as a zinc binding group (ZBG), which coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion of HDAC6. The hydroxamate group is liable to metabolically generate mutagenetic hydroxylamine; therefore, non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors would be advantageous. In this study, to identify novel non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors, screening of a chemical library and the subsequent structural optimization were performed, which led to the identification of HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel ZBG. The identified inhibitor showed potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>

         <dc:description>
Few methods exist to site&#8208;specifically label loops of globular proteins without interfering with the function of the protein. A modular &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive perfluoro&#8208;aromatic probe was synthesized in only two&#8208;steps and used to selectively modify an internal, surface exposed loop of the major capsid protein of JC polyomavirus (VP1). The perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl probe reacts selectively with the cysteine in the &#960;&#8208;clamp (Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe) over 6 native cysteines present in VP1. Using microscopy, fluorescently labeled &#960;&#8208;clamp VP1 can be observed binding and entering human glial cells. More information can be found in the Communication by F.&#8197;M. Rossi, C.&#8197;D.&#8197;S. Nelson et&#8197;al.

         <title>Evaluation of Naturally Occurring HIF&#8208;1 Inhibitors for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1) leads to expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Six naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified using the developed cell&#8208;based assay. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors are thus effective in decreasing PDK1, which causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.







Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe progressive disorder characterized by high pulmonary artery pressure. Chronic hypoxia causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) is a key enzyme in Warburg effect increased by hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1). We constructed a cell&#8208;based luciferase assay system for HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors. Using this system, six HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified. Among these inhibitors, the effect of tagitinin&#8197;C (1) on PASMC was investigated. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. This result indicates that HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors effectively decrease PDK1 activity, which is a cause of the metabolic disorder and Warburg effect observed in PASMCs. Identifying naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors could provide novel insights into the development of PAH medications.

         <title>Photosensitized Oxidative Dimerization at Tyrosine by a Water&#8208;Soluble 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide</title>

We report an aerobic, visible light&#8208;dependent oxidation of Tyr&#8208;containing substrates promoted by a water&#8208;soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based photosensitizer. The developed procedure demonstrates the generation of o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers.







Abstract
The oxidation of proteins generates reactive amino acid (AA) residue intermediates, leading to protein modification and cross&#8208;linking. Aerobic studies with peptides and photosensitizers allow for the controlled generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive AA residue intermediates, providing mechanistic insights as to how natural protein modifications form. Such studies have inspired the development of abiotic methods for protein modification and crosslinking, including applications of biomedical importance. Dityrosine linkages derived from oxidation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues represent one of the more well&#8208;understood oxidation&#8208;induced modifications. Here we demonstrate an aerobic, visible light&#8208;dependent oxidation reaction of Tyr&#8208;containing substrates promoted by a water&#8208;soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based photosensitizer. The developed procedure converts Tyr&#8208;containing substrates into o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers. The regioselectively formed o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linkage is consistent with dimeric standards prepared using a known enzymatic method. A crossover study with two peptides provides a statistical mixture of three distinct o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers, supporting a mechanism that involves Tyr residue oxidation followed by intermolecular combination.

Aerobic studies with peptides and photosensitizers allow for the controlled generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive AA residue intermediates, providing mechanistic insights as to how natural protein modifications form. Such studies have inspired the development of abiotic methods for protein modification and crosslinking, including applications of biomedical importance. Dityrosine linkages derived from oxidation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues represent one of the more well-understood oxidation-induced modifications. Here we demonstrate an aerobic, visible light-dependent oxidation reaction of Tyr-containing substrates promoted by a water-soluble 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide-based photosensitizer. The developed procedure converts Tyr-containing substrates into &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;o&#8217;-&lt;/i&gt;Tyr-Tyr linked dimers. The regioselectively formed &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;o&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-Tyr-Tyr linkage is consistent with dimeric standards prepared using a known enzymatic method. A crossover study with two peptides provides a statistical mixture of three distinct &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;o&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-Tyr-Tyr linked dimers, supporting a mechanism that involves Tyr residue oxidation followed by intermolecular combination.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Core Steps to the Azaphilone Family of Fungal Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azaphilones are a polyketide&#8208;based family of fungal natural products with a highly oxygenated bicyclic pyrone&#8208;quinone structure, many of which have useful and interesting bioactivities. This minireview reveals the common steps in azaphilone biosynthetic pathways to aid the use of genome mining to identify orphan azaphilone biosynthetic gene clusters.







Abstract
Azaphilones are a family of polyketide&#8208;based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This minireview explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome&#8208;mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.

         <title>Stacked Thiazole Orange Dyes in DNA Capable of Switching Emissive Behavior in Response to Structural Transitions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;color fluorescent nucleic acids: Nucleic acids possessing multiple thiazole orange (TO) dyes were synthesized and their fluorescent behavior was investigated. The TO&#8208;conjugated DNA showed a spectral change from the typical monomer emission to the excimer&#8208;type red&#8208;shifted emission, which were dependent upon both the state of the DNA structure (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA) and the arrangement of the TO dyes.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids with the capability of generating fluorescence in response to hybridization events, microenvironment or structural changes are valuable as structural probes and chemical sensors. We now demonstrate the enzyme&#8208;assisted preparation of nucleic acids possessing multiple thiazole orange (TO) dyes and their fluorescent behavior, that show a spectral change from the typical monomer emission to the excimer&#8208;type red&#8208;shifted emission. We found that the fluorescent response and emission wavelength of the TO dyes were dependent on both the state of the DNA structure (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA) and the arrangement of the TO dyes. We showed that the fluorescent behavior of the TO dyes can be applied for the detection of RNA molecules, suggesting that our approach for preparing the fluorescent nucleic acids functionalized with multiple TO dyes could be useful to design a fluorescence bioimaging and detection technique of biomolecules.

         <title>The Innate Immune Glycoprotein Lactoferrin Represses the Helicobacter pylori cag Type IV Secretion System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicobacter pylori infection results in enhanced host production of lactoferrin which participates in nutritional immunity and can also serve as a source of nutrient iron for this pathogen, which can repress a major oncogenic virulence factor, the cag T4SS.







Abstract
Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric diseases including gastric cancer. Despite development of a robust immune response, H.&#8197;pylori persists in the gastric niche. Progression of gastric inflammation to serious disease outcomes is associated with infection with H.&#8197;pylori strains which encode the cag Type&#8197;IV Secretion System (cag&#8197;T4SS). The cag T4SS is responsible for translocating the oncogenic protein CagA into host cells and inducing pro&#8208;inflammatory and carcinogenic signaling cascades. Our previous work demonstrated that nutrient iron modulates the activity of the T4SS and biogenesis of T4SS pili. In response to H.&#8197;pylori infection, the host produces a variety of antimicrobial molecules, including the iron&#8208;binding glycoprotein, lactoferrin. Our work shows that apo&#8208;lactoferrin exerts antimicrobial activity against H.&#8197;pylori under iron&#8208;limited conditions, while holo&#8208;lactoferrin enhances bacterial growth. Culturing H.&#8197;pylori in the presence of holo&#8208;lactoferrin prior to co&#8208;culture with gastric epithelial cells, results in repression of the cag&#8197;T4SS activity. Concomitantly, a decrease in biogenesis of cag&#8197;T4SS pili at the host&#8208;pathogen interface was observed under these culture conditions by high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy analyses. Taken together, these results indicate that acquisition of alternate sources of nutrient iron plays a role in regulating the pro&#8208;inflammatory activity of a bacterial secretion system and present novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of H.&#8197;pylori&#8208;related disease.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor can occur naturally as a constituent of essential oils of several plants, including Cinnamomum camphora, or it can be obtained chemically from optically pure &#945;&#8208;pinene, which itself must be isolated from plants. Camphor is well known for its characteristic pungent odor and health benefits. While (+)&#8208;camphor can be isolated from various natural sources, (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor is more difficult to obtain. In our work, we demonstrate facile enantioselective kinetic resolution of renewable isobornyl esters for the synthesis of the valuable (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hofer, R. Kourist et&#8197;al.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native Sec incorporation is highly species&#8208;dependent, which makes it challenging to express selenoproteins recombinantly. This article reviews recent progress in the method development for selenoprotein production, including the uses of engineered tRNA, allo&#8208;tRNA and Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element as well as genetic code expansion approaches for efficient site&#8208;specific Sec incorporation.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation in vivo is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe the progress in selenoprotein production methodology.

         <title>Approaches to Introduce Helical Structure in Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides with a Bimane Group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical structure can be introduced into short peptides, known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha, by macrocyclization with an inherently fluorescent bimane linker. Alternatively, a bimane&#8208;modification on a cysteine residue stabilises helicity in a tryptophan&#8208;containing, or to a lesser extent, a tyrosine&#8208;containing sequence.







Abstract
An i&#8722;i+4 or i&#8722;i+3 bimane&#8208;containing linker was introduced into a peptide known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), in order to stabilise an &#945;&#8208;helical geometry. These macrocycles were studied by CD and NMR to reveal the i&#8722;i+4 constrained peptide adopts a 310&#8208;helical structure in solution, and an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation on interaction with the ER&#945; coactivator recruitment surface in silico. An acyclic bimane&#8208;modified peptide is also helical, when it includes a tryptophan or tyrosine residue; but is significantly less helical with a phenylalanine or alanine residue, which indicates such a bimane modification influences peptide structure in a sequence dependent manner. The fluorescence intensity of the bimane appears influenced by peptide conformation, where helical peptides displayed a fluorescence increase when TFE was added to phosphate buffer, compared to a decrease for less helical peptides. This study presents the bimane as a useful modification to influence peptide structure as an acyclic peptide modification, or as a side&#8208;chain constraint to give a macrocycle.

         <title>Lessons in Organic Fluorescent Probe Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of molecular science. This review provides an overview of the methods used to discover fluorescent natural products, beginning with classical synthetic approaches. Here, lessons are presented that provide modern examples for classical methods and identify new classics that chart novel avenues for probe discovery. The central focus of this work embodies an understanding of the fundamental properties that guide the development of fluorescent probes and the challenges within their design.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes have gained profound use in biotechnology, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, molecular and cell biology. The development of methods for the translation of fluorophores into fluorescent probes continues to be a robust field for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists, alike. Access to new experimental designs has enabled molecular diversification and led to the identification of new approaches to probe discovery. This review provides a synopsis of the recent lessons in modern fluorescent probe discovery.

         <title>Recent Advances in Bioactive Artificial Ionophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure&#8208;activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.







Abstract
Several life&#8208;threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non&#8208;toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations. In addition, their ability to disrupt cellular homeostasis and to alter lysosomal pH endow ionophores as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Overall, critically outlining the advances in artificial ionophores in terms of in vitro ion transport, possible modes of action and biological activities enables us to propose possible future roadmaps in this research area.

         <title>Advances in Strategies and Tools Available for Interrogation of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New exciting strategies are being used to study and control O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, an overview of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided.







Abstract
The attachment of a single O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of numerous proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and plays an important role as a regulator of various cellular processes in both healthy and disease states. Advances in strategies and tools that allow for the detection of dynamic O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins have helped to enhance our initial and ongoing understanding of its dynamic effects on cellular stimuli and given insights into its link to the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases. Furthermore, chemical genetic strategies and related tools have been successfully applied to a myriad of biological systems with a new level of spatiotemporal and molecular precision. These strategies have started to be used in studying and controlling O&#8208;GlcNAcylation both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, overviews of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided. In addition, chemical genetic strategies that have already been applied or are potentially usable in O&#8208;GlcNAc functional are also discussed.

         <title>Protein Macrocyclization for Tertiary Structure Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein function is often tightly linked to a particular tertiary structure. For many protein applications it is required to stabilize the tertiary structure and prevent unfolding. Here, we summarize strategies that have been used to cyclize expressed proteins aiming for the stabilization of their native fold.







Abstract
Proteins possess unique molecular recognition capabilities and enzymatic activities, features that are usually tied to a particular tertiary structure. To make use of proteins for biotechnological and biomedical purposes, it is often required to enforce their tertiary structure in order to ensure sufficient stability under the conditions inherent to the application of interest. The introduction of intramolecular crosslinks has proven efficient in stabilizing native protein folds. Herein, we give an overview of methods that allow the macrocyclization of expressed proteins, discussing involved reaction mechanisms and structural implications.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), by the fungus Pleurotus sapidus resulted in the formation of two vanilla&#8208;like aroma compounds: The highly valuable piperonal, which is used for the aromatization of different sweets and dairy products, such as chocolate and ice cream, and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde. The conversion was identified as the result of a co&#8208;oxidative reaction catalyzed by a lipoxygenase of P. sapidus in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. More information can be found in the Communication by N.&#8208;K. Krahe et&#8197;al.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane transporters are flexible proteins that cycle between structurally diverse conformations during transport. Yet, little is known about structural ensembles along transport paths, the transition speed between them, and particularly about the coupling between structures and transport. In this review the power of single&#8208;molecule FRET to answer some of these questions is highlighted and key studies on a broad variety of membranes transporters are discussed. More information can be found in the Review by H. Hofmann, C. L&#246;w et&#8197;al.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme engineering for the synthesis of a cosmetic ingredient: The osmolyte 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol is widely applied as a bioactive moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and personal&#8208;care products. It is produced on an industrial scale by exploiting the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of a sucrose phosphorylase, but the enzyme currently used suffers from poor thermostability. A homologous sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable was engineered to drastically improve its catalytic performance for the synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol, enabling the production of this compound at elevated temperatures. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Desmet et&#8197;al.

         <title>Strategies for Covalent Labeling of Long RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating long RNAs: This review discusses currently available approaches for the introduction of reporter groups into large RNA molecules at internal positions in a site&#8208;specific fashion to allow visualization, tracking and structural investigations on long RNAs.







Abstract
The introduction of chemical modifications into long RNA molecules at specific positions for visualization, biophysical investigations, diagnostic and therapeutic applications still remains challenging. In this review, we present recent approaches for covalent internal labeling of long RNAs. Topics included are the assembly of large modified RNAs via enzymatic ligation of short synthetic oligonucleotides and synthetic biology approaches preparing site&#8208;specifically modified RNAs via in&#8197;vitro transcription using an expanded genetic alphabet. Moreover, recent approaches to employ deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) and ribozymes for RNA labeling and RNA methyltransferase based labeling strategies are presented. We discuss the potentials and limits of the individual methods, their applicability for RNAs with several hundred to thousands of nucleotides in length and indicate future directions in the field.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time and Label&#8208;Free Measurement of Deubiquitinase Activity with a MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MspA nanopore is demonstrated as a sensor for discriminating and quantifying various ubiquitin proteins. Real&#8208;time measurement of polymeric ubiquitin chain disassembly by a deubiquitinating enzyme was performed and enzyme kinetics were determined.







Abstract
Covalently attaching ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins as a post&#8208;translational modification can result in altered function of modified proteins. Enzymes regulating Ub as a post&#8208;translational modification, such as ligases and deubiquitinases, are challenging to characterize in part due to the low throughput of in&#8208;vitro assays. Single&#8208;molecule nanopore based assays have the advantage of detecting proteins with high specificity and resolution, and in a label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time fashion. Here we demonstrate the use of a MspA nanopore for discriminating and quantifying Ub proteins. We further applied the MspA pore to measure the Ub&#8208;chain disassembly activity of UCH37, a proteasome associated deubiquitinase. The implementation of this MspA system into nanopore arrays could enable high throughput characterizations of unknown deubiquitinases as well as drug screening against disease related enzymes.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are a valuable tool for upcycling side&#8208;stream from renewable sources. We have found that EstB from Burkholderia gladioli could achieve high enantiopurity in upcycling &#945;&#8208;pinene, a side&#8208;product from turpentine production, whereas common lipases and esterases could not. This reaction can be easily integrated with the existing chemical synthetic route for the production of the racemic camphor with minimal adjustments as the route goes through an intermediate isobornyl acetate.







Abstract
Racemic camphor and isoborneol are readily available as industrial side products, whereas (1R)&#8208;camphor is available from natural sources. Optically pure (1S)&#8208;camphor, however, is much more difficult to obtain. The synthesis of racemic camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene proceeds via an intermediary racemic isobornyl ester, which is then hydrolyzed and oxidized to give camphor. We reasoned that enantioselective hydrolysis of isobornyl esters would give facile access to optically pure isoborneol and camphor isomers, respectively. While screening of a set of commercial lipases and esterases in the kinetic resolution of racemic monoterpenols did not lead to the identification of any enantioselective enzymes, the cephalosporin Esterase B from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB) and Esterase C (EstC) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed outstanding enantioselectivity (E&gt;100) towards the butyryl esters of isoborneol, borneol and fenchol. The enantioselectivity was higher with increasing chain length of the acyl moiety of the substrate. The kinetic resolution of isobornyl butyrate can be easily integrated into the production of camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene and thus allows the facile synthesis of optically pure monoterpenols from a renewable side&#8208;product.

         <title>Substrate Protection in Controlled Enzymatic Transformation of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly specific enzymes make protecting groups unnecessary in biology but some enzymes including proteases and kinases have multiple biological substrates and there is strong interest to stop a specific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction without inhibiting the enzyme itself. Recent developments in peptide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles allow precise protection of peptide substrates and open up previously impossible ways to manipulate enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Proteins are involved in practically every single biological process. The many enzymes involved in their synthesis, cleavage, and posttranslational modification (PTM) carry out highly specific tasks with no usage of protecting groups. Yet, the chemists&#8217; strategy of protection/deprotection potentially can be highly useful, for example, when a specific biochemical reaction catalyzed by a broad&#8208;specificity enzyme needs to be inhibited, during infection of cells by enveloped viruses, in the invasion and spread of cancer cells, and upon mechanistic investigation of signal&#8208;transduction pathways. Doing so requires highly specific binding of peptide substrates in aqueous solution with biologically competitive affinities. Recent development of peptide&#8208;imprinted cross&#8208;linked micelles allows such protection and affords previously impossible ways of manipulating peptides and proteins in enzymatic transformations.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This communication advances the recently developed &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;(Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe)&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for fluorescent labeling of JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV) pentamers. We show a concise (two steps) synthesis of a small molecule &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive probe that is easily tunable for a broad set of fluorescent reporters, solubility, and fluorophore distance from the modification site. With this probe we demonstrate labeling in a structured loop region of a protein and visualize cellular entry of JCPyV viral particles.







Abstract
The major capsid protein VP1 of JC Polyomavirus assembles into pentamers that serve as a model for studying viral entry of this potentially severe human pathogen. Previously, labeling of viral proteins utilized large fusion proteins or non&#8208;specific amine&#8208; or cysteine&#8208;functionalization with fluorescent dyes. Imaging of these sterically hindered fusion proteins or heterogeneously labeled virions limits reproducibility and could prevent the detection of subtle trafficking phenomena. Here we advance the &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for site&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of VP1&#8208;pentamers. We demonstrate a one&#8208;step synthesis of a probe consisting of a bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry handle bridged to a perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive electrophile by a polyethylene glycol linker. We expand the scope of the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation by demonstrating selective labeling of an internal, surface exposed loop in VP1. Thus, the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation offers a general method to selectively bioconjugate tags&#8208;of&#8208;interest to viral proteins without impeding their ability to bind and enter cells.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine to piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde: A lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus (LOXPsa1) was identified, which generated the highly valuable, vanilla&#8208;like aroma compound piperonal through co&#8208;oxidation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper, in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, which also presents a vanilla&#8208;like odor, was produced as second product.







Abstract
The valuable aroma compound piperonal with its vanilla&#8208;like olfactory properties is of high interest for the fragrance and flavor industry. A lipoxygenase (LOXPsa1) of the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was identified to convert piperine, the abundant pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), to piperonal and a second volatile product, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, with a vanilla&#8208;like odor through an alkene cleavage. The reaction principle was co&#8208;oxidation, as proven by its dependence on the presence of linoleic or &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid, common substrates of lipoxygenases. Optimization of the reaction conditions (substrate concentrations, reaction temperature and time) led to a 24&#8208;fold and 15&#8208;fold increase of the piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde concentration using the recombinant enzyme. Monokaryotic strains showed different concentrations of and ratios between the two reaction products.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmolyte synthesis at elevated temperatures: 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is produced on industrial scale using the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of sucrose phosphorylase. We engineered the catalytic efficiency and regioselectivity of a sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable than the one currently used in industry.







Abstract
2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by various bacteria and plants in response to environmental stress. It is widely applied as a bioactive moisturising ingredient in skin care products, for which it is manufactured via enzymatic glucosylation of glycerol by the sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This industrial process is operated at room temperature due to the mediocre stability of the biocatalyst, often leading to microbial contamination. The highly thermostable sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis could be a better alternative in that regard, but this enzyme is not fit for production of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol due to its low regioselectivity and poor affinity for glycerol. In this work, the thermostable phosphorylase was engineered to alleviate these problems. Several engineering approaches were explored, ranging from site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to conventional, binary, iterative or combinatorial randomisation of the active site, resulting in the screening of &#8764;3,900 variants. Variant P134Q displayed a 21&#8208;fold increase in catalytic efficiency for glycerol, as well as a threefold improvement in regioselectivity towards the 2&#8208;position of the substrate, while retaining its activity for several days at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Inhibitors of CA IX Enzyme Based on Polyhedral Boron Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review covers several classes of inhibitors specific for carbonic anhydrase IX enzyme that emerged recently from a non&#8208;traditional concept. This is characterized by combination of space&#8208;filing inorganic (metalla)carborane cluster with sulfamide and sulfonamide binding motif for Zn2+ in the active site. The structural factors essential for attaining high activity and selectivity for the CA IX isoform are discussed. Results from preclinical studies show relevance of these compounds for development of anticancer drugs.







Abstract
This review describes recent progress in the design and development of inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) based on space&#8208;filling carborane and cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters. CA IX enzyme is known to play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and metastases. The new class of potent and selective CA IX inhibitors combines the structural motif of a bulky inorganic cluster with an alkylsulfamido or alkylsulfonamido anchor group for Zn2+ ion in the enzyme active site. Detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of a large series containing 50 compounds uncovered structural features of the cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors that are important for efficient and selective inhibition of CA IX activity. Preclinical evaluation of selected compounds revealed low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics and ability to reduce tumor growth. Cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors of CA IX can thus be considered as promising candidates for drug development and/or for combination therapy in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).
