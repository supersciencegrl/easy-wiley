         <title>The Advancement of Prime Editing Technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advent of CRISPR/Cas genome editing has spurred major breakthroughs across life sciences, offering vast potential across numerous research and application fields. Among the expanding toolkit of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;derived methods, prime editing (PE) stands out for its versatility and specificity, enabling precise point mutations and small insertions or deletions without requiring double&#8208;stranded DNA breaks. Since its introduction, PE has undergone multiple rounds of optimization to improve performance. In this review, we first outline the core components and mechanism of prime editors, followed by four key evolution strategies: protein engineering, pegRNA modifications, accessory protein recruitment, and paired pegRNA approaches. We then discuss persistent challenges and outline possible refinements, highlighting how further innovations can expand prime editing&#8217;s utility across diverse areas of research, biotechnology, and potential therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanophenylalanine as an Infrared Probe for Iron&#8208;Sulfur Cluster Redox State in Multi&#8208;Centre Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that the noncanonical amino acid, para&#8208;cyanophenylalanine (CNF), when incorporated into metalloproteins, functions as an infrared spectroscopic probe for the redox state of iron sulfur clusters, offering a strategy for determining electron occupancy in the electron transport chains of complex metalloenzymes. We observe a redshift of &#8776; 1 &#8208; 2 cm&#8208;1 in the NC stretching frequency following reduction of spinach ferredoxin modified to contain CNF close to its [2Fe&#8208;2S] centre, and this shift is reversed on re&#8208;oxidation. We extend this to CNF positioned near to the proximal [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. In combination with a distal [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster and the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster of the active site &#8216;H&#8208;cluster&#8217; ([4Fe&#8208;4S]H), the proximal cluster forms an electron relay connecting the active site to the surface of the protein. Again, we observe a reversible shift in wavenumber for CNF following cluster reduction in either apo&#8208;protein (containing the iron&#8208;sulfur clusters but lacking the active site) or holo&#8208;protein with intact active site, demonstrating general applicability of this approach to studying complex metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tagatose 1,6&#8208;bisphosphate aldolases, the unloved DHAP&#8208;aldolases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tagatose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate aldolases (TagA) have been understudied. The limited publications on the subject report a poor stereoselectivity, which quickly led to their classification among the less interesting aldolases. This conclusion, which appeared inadequate, discouraged further investigation by other researchers. The objective here is to re&#8208;examine all these studies in detail to finally uncover inconsistencies and unexplained observations regarding the behaviour of these enzymes. Ultimately, there is a significant lack of research that could deepen our understanding of TagA, which would likely reveal its potential to be as valuable as its counterparts: fructose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate, rhamnulose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate, and fuculose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate aldolases.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocarbon stapling enables improvement of antimicrobial activity and proteolytic stability of host&#8208;defense peptide ocellatin&#8208;3N</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ocellatin&#8208;3N is a cationic, amphiphilic host&#8208;defense peptide with 19 residues, which was isolated from the Caribbean frog Leptodactylus nesiotus. Its analogue Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 shows potent inhibitory activity against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, and has great potential as a broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial agent. However, the application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 as an antimicrobial agent is limited due to its both unstable structure and susceptibility to degradation by proteases. In this research, a series of hydrocarbon&#8208;stable analogs of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 were synthesized and evaluated for their chemical and biological properties to improve potential application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 in the field of antimicrobial drug development. Some analogs showed remarkable improvement not only in protease resistance, but also in antimicrobial activity when compared to the parent peptide. In particular, the stapled peptide Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;5 showed promising prospects for novel antimicrobial drug development. This study can provide a reference for the development of antimicrobial drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of the fungal cyclic lipodepsipeptide pleosporacin, a new selective inhibitor of the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioactivity&#8208;guided isolation led to the identification of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide pleosporacin (1) from the mycelia extract of fungal strain Pleosporales sp. IBWF 020&#8208;21, a potent selective inhibitor of the fungal phytopathogen Botrytis&#160;cinerea. The structure and stereochemistry of 1 were elucidated by NMR and Marfey analysis, respectively. Genome mining identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a hexamodular NRPS, PleA, a fatty acyl&#8208;AMP ligase, PleB, and an aspartate decarboxylase, PleC. Reconstitution of pleABC allowed for heterologous production of 1 in Aspergillus&#160;oryzae and confirmed the identity of the ple cluster. Based on our findings we propose a biosynthetic route, with PleB catalyzing lipoinitiation and PleC providing the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid &#946;&#8208;alanine for the assembly of 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Microbubble Formation via Near&#8208;Infrared Femtosecond Laser Ablation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Focused near&#8208;infrared femtosecond (NIR fs) laser irradiation induces efficient photochemical breakdown of intracellular molecules, resulting in the formation of gas microbubbles that ultimately lead to cell death and removal. This study characterizes these microbubbles using high&#8208;speed imaging. Microbubbles generated within cells by single&#8208;pulse irradiation were consistently larger than those formed in the surrounding culture medium across a broad pulse energy range. Notably, the energy threshold for intracellular microbubble formation was several tens of nanojoules lower than in the culture medium, enabling precise cell ablation without inducing extracellular bubbling. Repeated pulse irradiation at 1 kHz frequency further reduced the energy threshold and increased bubble size, with saturation observed after approximately 30 pulses. Near&#8208;threshold pulse irradiation was then employed to develop a precise method for investigating cellular motility in vitro. Cell&#8208;free zones were created within cell monolayers, enabling motile cells to migrate into the cleared zones. This method was validated using the A549 lung cancer cell line and the plant flavonoid apigenin, which exhibited dose&#8208;dependent reduction in A549 cell motility. These findings highlight the method's potential for evaluating cellular behaviours and screening chemical compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and evaluation of pseudoglucosinolates (psGSLs) releasing isothiocyanates (ITCs) in the presence of azoreductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring isothiocyanates (ITCs) display multiple interesting bioactivities, but their medicinal exploitation is very limited as ITCs are non&#8208;druglike compounds with problematic pharmacokinetic properties. The concept of pseudoglucosinolates (psGSLs) provides a novel prodrug approach for the release of ITCs which can be adjusted to different triggers such as enzymatic and chemical microenvironments. Here, we report the first adaptation of this concept towards the release of ITCs in the presence of azoreductases within a turn&#8208;on fluorescence probe and underline its applicability in covalent protein labelling.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Organometallic Gold(III) Complexes as Precision Scaffolds for Next&#8208;Generation Therapeutic and Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(III) organometallic complexes, particularly cyclometalated Au(III) compounds, have emerged as powerful tools in catalysis and bioinorganic chemistry, offering unique reactivity distinct from their Au(I) counterparts. Among their most interesting transformations, C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have become a selective strategy for cysteine arylation, enabling site&#8208;specific modifications of peptides and proteins. This review provides a comprehensive overview of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes in C&#8211;S bond formation, detailing the mechanistic insights, ligand effects, and electronic factors that dictate their reactivity. The role of ancillary ligands in tuning stability and selectivity is critically assessed, alongside advancements in structural modifications that enhance catalytic efficiency. Beyond fundamental C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling, we explore the broader applications of these gold(III) complexes, including enzyme inhibition, metabolic disruption, and transmembrane protein modulation, with implications in anticancer therapy, antimicrobial strategies, and&#160;in vivo&#160;catalytic transformations. By bridging fundamental organometallic reactivity with innovative biomedical applications, this review highlights the potential of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes as next&#8208;generation catalysts for both synthetic and therapeutic innovations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultraviolet Ozone Pretreatment Enhances selective PETase Biodegradation of Textiles Compared to Sunlight and Alkali Treatments.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid growth of the fashion industry has led to increasing textile waste, exacerbating environmental pollution and climate change. To support sustainability and circular economy goals, this study investigates the enzymatic degradation of cotton/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mixed textiles using PETase, comparing wild&#8208;type (WT) and mutant (MUT S238F/W159H) variants.
To improve enzyme accessibility, we evaluated three pretreatment strategies: alkali treatment, ultraviolet&#8208;ozone (UVO) exposure, and natural sunlight weathering. The effects were assessed by measuring textile weight loss, surface morphology (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and yields of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET).
Alkali treatment produced the highest weight loss, while UVO pretreatment moderately degraded textiles and significantly enhanced enzymatic TPA production. In contrast, prolonged sunlight exposure had negligible effects. ^1H NMR analysis of supernatants confirmed the formation of oxidized PET products following UVO exposure, indicating surface chemical modifications that increase enzymatic susceptibility.
Our results reveal differential effects on PET and cotton fibers, highlighting UVO as a promising, selective pretreatment for mixed textile waste. This study demonstrates the potential of combining photochemical oxidation and enzymatic processes for targeted PET degradation, contributing to more efficient textile recycling strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, we discuss current insights into GT promiscuity, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Recognition Tag of Human Origin for Bioorthogonal Generation of Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates using Microbial Biotin Ligase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human&#8208;derived recognition tag of Pyrococcus horikoshii biotin ligase is fused to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab at the C&#8208;termini of either light or heavy chain. These fusion antibodies allow for the PhBL&#8208;mediated introduction of desthiobiotin azide and the subsequent attachment of DBCO&#8208;AF488 and DBCO&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PAB&#8208;MMAE via strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The generated antibody&#8208;drug conjugates exhibit single&#8208;digit nanomolar potency on Her2&#8208;expressing cell lines.

The use of enzymes, such as microbial transglutaminase, lipoate protein ligase A, or sortase A, for the generation of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates has proven to be a powerful tool for the site&#8208;specific payload conjugation to tumor&#8208;specific antibodies. Herein, the extension of this enzymatic toolbox by Pyrococcus horikoshii biotin ligase is reported. To this end, the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab is equipped with p67, the 67 amino acid carboxyl&#8208;terminal domain of human propionyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase &#945; subunit, at the C&#8208;terminus of either the light or heavy chain (Trz&#8208;LC:p67 and Trz&#8208;HC:p67). Upon incubation with PhBL, the azide&#8208;bearing linker desthiobiotin azide is site&#8208;specifically coupled to the p67 domains at the antibody. Subsequent strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with DBCO&#8208;AF488 and DBCO&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PAB&#8208;MMAE yielded conjugates near to full conversion. In cellular assays, these constructs exhibit single&#8208;digit nanomolar EC50 values in cellular proliferation assays on SK&#8208;BR&#8208;3 and A431 cells, where no significant difference in the performance between the two variants Trz&#8208;LC:p67&#8208;MMAE and Trz&#8208;HC:p67&#8208;MMAE is observed. On high Fc&#8208;&#947;IIIa receptor expressing Jurkat cells, Trz&#8208;HC:p67&#8208;MMAE exhibits higher potency than Trz&#8208;LC:p67&#8208;MMAE, indicating an Fc&#8208;blocking effect of p67 when fused to the light chain.

This study showcases the power of a single methyl group in a large DNA binding molecule, a semisynthetic analogue of mithramycin, to alter the structural and functional properties of this molecule. These properties include selective cytotoxicity against cells of Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric cancer.

Mithramycin (MTM) is a polyketide anticancer natural product, which functions by noncovalent binding to DNA in the minor groove without intercalation, resulting in inhibiting transcription at G/C&#8208;rich promoters. MTM is a potent inhibitor of cancer cells, such as Ewing sarcoma, driven by abnormal fusions involving E26 transformation&#8208;specific (ETS) family transcription factors friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1) and ETS&#8208;related gene (ERG). However, MTM is rather toxic and nonselective; therefore, safer, selective analogues of MTM are required for use in the clinic as anticancer drugs. Herein, by using a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic, biophysical, and cell and molecular biological techniques, the structural and functional consequences of 3&#8208;side chain methylation at positions 5, 6, and 7 of the indole ring of the potent analogue MTM SA&#8208;Trp are explored. The conformation of the analogues in complexes with DNA, their DNA binding function, cytotoxicity, selectivity, and potency as transcription antagonists depended on the position of the methylation. MTM SA&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;Trp emerged as the most selective analogue, presumably due to the right balance of the DNA binding and the solvent exposure of the 3&#8208;side chain. This study demonstrates that minor chemical changes can have strong effects in analogue development and paves the way to further development of next&#8208;generation MTM analogues.

         <title>Identification of Key Active&#8208;Site Positions Controlling the Chemoselectivity of Aspergillus Brasiliensis Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) from Aspergillus brasiliensis AbrUPO catalyzes the aromatic hydroxylation of substituted benzenes. By integrating structural elements from well&#8208;characterized UPOs in AbrUPO variants, position 186 was identified as a critical determinant of enzyme chemoselectivity. The A186F substitution prevents aromatic hydroxylation of substituted benzenes in favor of benzylic hydroxylation.

Heme&#8208;containing unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have attracted significant attention as biocatalysts for oxidation reactions due to their ability to function without expensive nicotinamide cofactors. In the recent study, the UPO from aspergillus brasiliensis (AbrUPO) is found to catalyze the aromatic hydroxylation of substituted benzenes, a feature that distinguishes AbrUPO from other reported wild&#8208;type UPOs. To elucidate the underlying factors in the active site and substrate access channel of AbrUPO&#8212;which contains fewer phenylalanine residues compared to other UPOs that primarily catalyze benzylic hydroxylation&#8212;twenty two AbrUPO variants with single, double, triple, or quadruple amino acid substitutions were constructed to mimic the active sites or substrate access channels of other UPOs. A number of mutated variants exhibited altered activity and selectivity, and several positions were identified that influence enzyme chemoselectivity. Among them, substitution of alanine at position 186 with bulkier residues such as phenylalanine or leucine lead to a shift in chemoselectivity toward alkyl chain hydroxylation of substituted benzenes. Molecular docking studies indicated that the A186F mutation restricts the flexibility and reorientation of ethylbenzene in the active site of AbrUPO, thereby preventing oxidation at the aromatic ring while promoting benzylic hydroxylation.

         <title>Preorganized Electric Fields in Voltage&#8208;Gated Sodium Channels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes are reported to catalyze reactions by generating electric fields that promote the evolution of the reaction in the active site. Although seldom used outside enzymatic catalysis, electrostatic preorganization theory and the language of electric fields can be generalized to other biological macromolecules. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of human Nav1.5, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. We show that in the absence of an external potential, charged and uncharged residues generate strong electric fields that assist in Na+ motion in the pore. Our work emphasizes the importance of charge&#8208;dipole interactions in modulating Na+&#160;dynamics, in addition to charge&#8208;charge interactions, the focus of a majority of previous studies. Finally, we find that residues share a high level of mutual information through electric fields that can enable the optimization of allosteric pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective [9&#8208;15N] Guanosine for NMR Studies of Large RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNAs regulate various cellular processes using malleable 3D structures, and understanding the factors that control RNA structure and dynamics is critical for understanding their mechanisms of action. To mitigate factors that have limited studies of large, functionally relevant RNAs by solution NMR spectroscopy, we have extended a recently described 2H&#8208;enhanced, 1H&#8208;15N correlation approach by developing a chemoenzymatic labeling technology that grafts selectively labeled [9&#8208;15N]&#8208;Guanine on to any labeled ribose to make [9&#8208;15N]&#8208;GTP. Our approach exploits advantageous NMR properties of the N9 nucleus which, when combined with extensive ribose deuteration and optimized NMR pulse sequences, affords sharp signals without complications that can arise using uniform [15N]&#8208;guanine labeling. The utility of the approach for NMR signal assignment and dynamics analysis is demonstrated for three large RNAs (20&#8208;78 kDa) that play critical roles in viral replication. With this approach, NMR studies of RNAs comprising 200 nt or more should now be feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Clade III Synthases Add Cyclic And Linear Terpenoids To The Psilocybe Metabolome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psilocybe &#8220;magic mushrooms&#8221;&#160;are best known for their indolethylamine psilocybin, yet they encode enzymes for a much more diverse arsenal of small and potentially bioactive molecules. Here, we report on four Psilocybe cubensis clade III sesquiterpene synthases, CubB&#8208;CubE, whose genes are differently expressed in fruiting bodies compared to vegetative mycelium. CubB&#8208;CubE were functionally characterized in vitro by product formation assays with heterologously produced enzymes and in vivo by transgene expression in Aspergillus niger, followed by extensive GC&#8208;MS analyses. CubB was identified as a single product (3R,6E)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;nerolidol synthase. CubC is a multi&#8208;product enzyme producing &#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, &#946;&#8208;elemene, &#945;&#8208;humulene, and &#946;&#8208;farnesene. CubD and CubE catalyzed (near&#8208;)exclusively sterpurene formation. P. cubensis young fruiting bodies and vegetative mycelium were analyzed for sesquiterpenes which verified the presence of the CubB product &#945;&#8208;(3R,6E)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;nerolidol. As various Psilocybe species encode highly similar enzymes, this study contributes generally to the as yet little understood secondary metabolome of the genus.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phenotypic effect induced by a Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) can depend on several factors, including the E3 ligase recruited. For the discovery of a first&#8208;in&#8208;class PROTAC for a target of interest, the E3 ligases commonly hijacked remain the Von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL) and Cereblon (CRBN) since potent and accessible ligands are readily available to recruit them. Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) E3 ligase stands out because it regulates p53 levels to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, the synthesis of the most potent MDM2 ligands remains very complex. Here we report the discovery of novel MDM2&#8208;recruiting PROTACs incorporating rac&#8208;Nutlin&#8208;3 as a ligand with an easier synthetic tractability, further demonstrating its potential in this technology. The most promising degrader, PROTAC 3, showed preferential degradation of the BRD4 short isoform and c&#8208;Myc compared with MZ1, a validated VHL&#8208;based PROTAC.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Thrombosis Initiation with Lasso Peptide Variants as Inhibitors to the von Willebrand Protein&#8211;Collagen Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrangling the potential of natural product scaffolds: Lasso peptides, natural products of bacterial origin, have a unique interlocked [1]rotaxane peptide structure. The lasso peptide microcin J25&#160;can tolerate the substitution of several amino acids in the loop region to become tuned inhibitors that target protein&#8211;protein interactions, such as between von Willebrand factor and collagen, that initiate thrombosis.

Currently, there are no peptide&#8208;based therapeutics that safely target thrombosis initiation. Anticlot medications are mostly focused on platelet interactions, leading to side effects and complications. Herein, we utilize the unique [1]rotaxane architecture of&#160;lasso peptides as a scaffold for the development of new inhibitors to the protein&#8211;protein interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWF) and collagen, which is paramount to clot initiation. The microcin J25 lasso peptide tolerates the substitution of four contiguous amino acids within its loop, leading to two variants with LWEQ and FRSH sequences grafted within the loop. Each variant shows low micromolar activity in a fluorescently linked immunosorbent assay, an in vitro test for inhibition of the collagen&#8211;vWF interaction. In addition, the lasso peptides were treated with a panel of proteases and showed exceptional stability. These peptides launch a new class of potential antithrombosis agents and also help probe the connection between peptide structure and its inhibitory, drug&#8208;like characteristics.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized Fluorescence based Kinase Sensing Systems for Signaling in Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinases are an essential class of enzymes that regulate cellular processes through phosphorylation, influencing signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of kinase activity is a hallmark of cancer, contributing to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, precise detection and monitoring of kinase activity are essential for understanding cancer biology and advancing diagnostics and therapeutics. Among various detection methods, fluorescence&#8208;based kinase sensing systems have emerged as highly sensitive, real&#8208;time tools for investigating kinase function. These systems leverage fluorescent moieties, either genetically encoded or chemically synthesized, to provide spatial and temporal insights into kinase activity in complex biological environments. This review focuses on chemically synthesized fluorescence&#8208;based kinase sensing systems, which offer unique advantages, including precise control over concentrations and compatibility with in vitro and in vivo applications. We have classified the chemically synthesized sensing systems into three categories: specific peptide substrate&#8208;based, ATP/ADP&#8208;recognition&#8208;based, and inhibitor&#8208;based sensing systems, each tailored to specific kinase activities. Compared to genetically encoded systems, chemically synthesized sensors demonstrate greater versatility and are better suited for quantitative high&#8208;throughput applications. This review explores the design, mechanisms, and applications of these systems in cancer biology, highlighting their potential for identifying kinase biomarkers, optimizing targeted therapies, and advancing personalized medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted ATP derivatives and their use in enzymatic synthesis and postsynthetic labelling of RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of adenosine triphosphate derivatives bearing chloro, fluoro, amino, methyl, vinyl and ethynyl groups at position 2 were synthesized and tested as substrates for RNA and DNA polymerases. The modified nucleotides worked well in in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase and primer extension (PEX) using engineered DNA polymerases (TGK, 2M) except for the bulkier 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208; and 2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;ATP derivatives that gave truncated products. However, in single nucleotide incorporation followed by PEX they still could be used for site&#8208;specific incorporation of reactive modifications into RNA that could be further used for post&#8208;synthetic labelling through thiol&#8208;ene or CuAAC reactions. All modified ATPs worked in polyadenylation catalyzed by poly(A) polymerase (ScPAP) to form long 3&#8217;&#8208;polyA tails containing the modifications that also can be used for labelling.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Peptide Inhibitor Targeting the C&#8208;SH2 Domain of the SHP2 Phosphatase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Src homology 2 (SH2) domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) mediates important signal transduction upon cell surface receptor stimulation, regulating multiple cellular functions. In addition to the catalytically active phosphotyrosine (pTyr) phosphatase domain, SHP2 contains two regulatory pTyr&#8208;binding domains: the N&#8208;SH2 and C&#8208;SH2 domains. While the role of the N&#8208;SH2 domain is well understood, the role of the C&#8208;SH2 domain is less clear. To support studies on the involvement of the domains in SHP2 function, here we describe the development of a peptide inhibitor containing a non&#8208;hydrolysable pTyr mimetic, which selectively binds to the C&#8208;SH2 domain of SHP2 and blocks its protein&#8208;protein interactions. Incorporation of the pTyr mimetic&#160;l&#8208;O&#8208;malonyltyrosine (l&#8208;OMT) resulted in robust binding affinity to the C&#8208;SH2 domain, while the widely used pTyr mimetic phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp) abolished binding, showing&#160;that this mimetic is not a general binder of SH2 domains, which challenges existing notions. Our C&#8208;SH2 inhibitor peptide (CSIP) is stable, selective, cell permeable and non&#8208;cytotoxic. CSIP enriches the toolbox of inhibitors with different modes of action targeting SHP2, and&#160;will support studies to better understand SHP2 regulation and interactions, which can ultimately inform new drug discovery efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Ephedrine is Initiated by Pyridoxal Phosphate&#8208;Dependent Formation of Cathinone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ephedra alkaloids possess some of the most basic structures of alkaloids. Despite their importance for human use and their commercial relevance, the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids has remained enigmatic. The predominant biosynthetic pathway in the literature proposes a thiamine&#8208;dependent caboligation followed by a transaminase, although no candidate enzymes have yet been identified in ephedra alkaloid producers. In this work, an alternative pathway in plants to ephedra alkaloids via (S)&#8208;cathinone was investigated that circumvents the formation of 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione as an intermediate and is in full agreement with previous biosynthetic studies. This alternative pathway involves the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent carboligation of benzoyl&#8208;CoA and l&#8208;alanine in a single step. The PLP&#8208;dependent formation of labeled and unlabeled (S)&#8208;cathinone was detected in plant lysate of young stem tissue of various Ephedra species that contained Ephedra alkaloids, as well as in young leaf tissue of Catha edulis. The incorporation of labeled nitrogen from l&#8208;alanine into (S)&#8208;cathinone supports the hypothesis that an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase (AOS) catalyzes the formation of (S)&#8208;cathinone, bypassing the dione as an intermediate. These results demonstrate the involvement of a PLP&#8208;dependent AOS as a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Cubamyces Menziesii Terpenome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome of Cubamyces menziesii reveals 18 putative sesquiterpene cyclase genes. These genes are cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding 10 active enzymes. Using farnesyl diphosphate as substrate, the enzymes are analyzed, and the products characterized after bioconversion, uncovering diverse sesquiterpene structures. This study highlights the phylogenetic prediction and the ecological and biotechnological relevance of C. menziesii sesquiterpenes.

Long&#8208;lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, the genome of Cubamyces (C.) menziesii and identified 18 genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases (STCs) is explored. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, the 18 codon&#8208;optimized open reading frames are cloned and overproduced the C. menziesii STCs in Escherichia coli. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme is purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these 10 enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes is determined by (GC&#8208;MS) gas chromatography mass spectrometry and (NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Among the 10 enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds, and the remaining two acted as a multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore C. menziesii and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.

         <title>An Indole Dearomatization Strategy for the Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indole&#8208;dearomatization/reduction strategy is developed to expand a collection of indole&#8208;containing pseudo&#8208;NPs. This approach enhances the three&#8208;dimensionality of the original compound classes through hybridization&#8208;changing conversions leading to topologically distinct novel structures. Morphological profiling reveals bioactivities that persist throughout the compound classes.

The indole moiety is a privileged fragment that frequently populates existing bioactive compound collections. The development of an indole&#8208;dearomatization sequence and its application for library expansion of a collection of indole&#8208;containing pseudo&#8208;natural products (NPs) are described. The resulting compounds are topologically distinct from the original compound class. Phenotyping by means of the cell painting assay initially indicates that the dearomatized compounds are morphologically different than the original pseudo&#8208;NP compound class and guiding NPs. However, analysis by means of a new subprofile analysis of the same cell painting assay data indicates that similar morphologies persist throughout the compound classes. Further biological studies support the findings of the subprofile analysis and highlight its potential to more effectively characterize novel compounds. The biological findings suggest that a plethora of indole&#8208;dearomatization reactions can be applied to existing indole&#8208;containing compound collections to rapidly access new biologically relevant scaffolds.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Multiplexing with Environment&#8208;Sensitive Chemigenetic Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HaloTag (HT) is a versatile self&#8208;labeling protein that has been widely adopted in fluorescence microscopy. Besides its established use as an intensity&#8208;based marker and sensor, interest in using HT for multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has recently arisen. In this work, we explored the application of an environment&#8208;sensitive fluorophore in FLIM multiplexing with the free dye and HT mutants. We chose the extended coumarin COUPY scaffold because of its structural simplicity and the strong sensitivity of its photophysical properties to the environment. We demonstrated that three&#8208;channel imaging is possible by taking advantage of the propensity of the dye to accumulate in mitochondria and the efficient labeling of two distinct HT mutants. We further investigated different dehalogenase proteins and their FLIM multiplexing capabilities when paired with an HT mutant.&#160;Finally, we identify the polarity of the protein binding pocket as a key feature that affects the lifetime of this kind of fluorescent molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting SpyTag/SpyCatcher Technology To Design New Artificial Catalytic Copper Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing artificial metal binding sites within a protein is challenging since amino acid residues need to be placed in desired positions in the final construct and the use of non&#8208;natural amino acids is difficult. The alternative approach of directing the insertion of artificial metal coordination systems presents the difficulty of grafting such site in a single desired position. Spy protein is composed by a protein component (SpyCatcher) which binds spontaneously an oligopeptide (SpyTag) with formation of an isopeptide bond. We designed a SpyTag peptide equipped with an ATCUN (Amino Terminal Copper and Nickel) binding site which binds copper(II) with high femtomolar affinity both in the absence of SpyCatcher and in the reconstituted Spy construct. The Cu2+ ATCUN site in the reconstituted Spy protein presents a catalytic activity in ROS production, higher than that of the SpyTag peptide alone. This method offers a novel approach for constructing artificial metalloproteins by incorporating functional metal binding sites into a peptide, which can then be clicked onto its protein counterpart. The small size and modularity of this construct make it versatile for integration into other protein systems, eventually moving the complexity from a protein to a peptide and highlighting its potential for protein design.</dc:description>

Stereoselective Total Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharides Using Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery and Evaluation of their Immune&#8208;Enhancing Activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (&#945;&#8208;GOSs) 1&#8208;6 with different galactose chain lengths was achieved by the boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery , and their immune&#8208;enhancing activities in macrophage J774.1 cells. The results indicate that &#945;&#8208;GOS 2 exhibits the highest promotion of macrophage phagocytosis and increasing production of cytokines among &#945;&#8208;GOSs tested, which has the potential as a natural immunomodulatory agent.

&#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (&#945;&#8208;GOSs) are natural oligomeric saccharides found in plants that have garnered significant interest due to their indigestible nature and various biological activities. However, they often exist as inseparable mixtures, particularly long&#8208;chain substances. This study successfully achieves the total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;GOSs 1&#8208;6, featuring different lengths of galactose chains, using the boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery method developed in our laboratory. Additionally, this study investigates the immune&#8208;enhancing activity and structure&#8208;activity relationships of the chemically synthesized &#945;&#8208;GOSs. It reveals that the length of the galactose chain in the &#945;&#8208;GOSs significantly influences their immune&#8208;enhancing properties. Specifically, &#945;&#8208;GOS 2, which contains two galactose units, is found to markedly promote macrophage phagocytosis and increase the production of cytokines such as IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IL&#8208;1&#946;. These results suggest that &#945;&#8208;GOS 2 could serve as a natural immunomodulatory agent in functional foods.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Cleavable Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide&#8211;Cargo Conjugate via Low&#8208;Equivalent of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide Activated by 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Dithiodipyridine</title>

         <dc:description>
Serving as a sulfur exchange reagent, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dithiodipyridine (DPDS) permits the use of low&#8208;equivalent cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) to produce CPP&#8211;cargo conjugates with a high conversion rate. Using this method, CPP&#8211;cargo conjugates are synthesized and ubiquitin (Ub) is effectively delivered into cells.

Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) are favored for protein delivery due to their efficiency, rapidity, and low toxicity. However, conjugation of CPPs to proteins often requires significant amounts of CPPs to ensure yields, which also may result in increased protein dimer formation. Herein, it is reported that the use of low equivalents 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dithiodipyridine (DPDS)&#8208;activated CPP for conjugation cargo allows for high&#8208;conversion&#8208;rate CPP&#8211;cargo conjugates. Using this strategy, high&#8208;conversion&#8208;rate conjugates of cyclic deca&#8208;arginine peptide (cR10) with ubiquitin (Ub) and UbcH7 are obtained using only low equivalents of cR10. Furthermore, three CPPs are successfully conjugated to cargo via DPDS, and their successful cytosolic delivery is confirmed through fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Conformational Constraint for Prevention of Aging of Organophosphate&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging of organophosphate&#8208;inhibited acetylcholinesterase has been a barrier to treatments for toxicity from exposure. Unexpected results led &#160;to exploration of &#160;the use of allosteric effectors to regulate the inhibitor reaction pathway. In addition, an assay was developed to be used as a platform for screening for molecules that prevent or reverse aging.

The covalent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphate compounds (OPCs) prevents the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, and results in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leading to severe cholinergic crisis. To treat toxic exposure to OPCs, the focus has been on using reactivator compounds (e.g., oximes) to reverse the adduct formation in the enzyme's active site, and to release the regenerated, active form of AChE. However, the interaction between the OPC inhibitor and the enzyme is usually followed by a secondary dealkylative reaction in which the OPC &#8220;ages&#8221;, that is, produces an oxyanion on the phosphoryl group that cannot be recovered with standard reactivators. The unexpected discovey that immobilization of AChE prevented aging of OPC adducts led &#160;to the hypothesis that the inhibition and recovery pathways in AChE could be regulated by allosteric effectors that bind to the enzyme at a distance away from the site of inhibition. To demonstrate this, resistance to aging was replicated using bifunctional crosslinking of AChE in solution. This work provides the foundation to expand these principles to other potential effectors.

         <title>Discovery and In&#8201;Vitro Reconstitution of Closoxazole Biosynthesis from Pyxidicoccus fallax</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax is found to be a producer of benzoxazole&#8208;containing natural products named closoxazoles. In vitro studies with the biosynthetic enzymes reveal new insights into the reaction mechanism for closoxazole formation. The biosynthetic plasticity enables the production of new closoxazoles with different substitution patterns, increasing the structural diversity of benzoxazole&#8208;containing natural products.

Benzoxazoles are important structural components of both bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical active ingredients. In this study, a putative benzoxazole gene cluster originating from the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax is investigated. This gene cluster is found to confer the ability for production of closoxazoles, which were recently discovered in the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium cavendishii. To obtain further insights into the biosynthetic mechanism, the required key enzymes are subjected to in&#8201;vitro studies. Notably, significant differences to the biosynthetic pathway in C. cavendishii are observed. First, the condensing amidohydrolase uses an unstable ester as substrate and, thus, establishes a C&#63743;N bond for benzoxazole formation. In contrast, the homolog from C. cavendishii is thought to use an amide substrate. Second, both AMP ligases encoded in this pathway attach a third aryl carboxylic acid building block to the benzoxazole intermediate, but these enzymes exhibit different regioselectivities. This facilitates the production of closoxazole A and B but also gives access to new derivatives in which a third building block is linked to the phenolic amine of the benzoxazole. The substrate flexibility of these enzymes allows us to introduce other building blocks into the biosynthetic pathway and thus expand the structural diversity of benzoxazole&#8208;containing natural products.

         <title>Engineering of small ribozymes acting on RNA: What is needed to make a new function work with an existing catalyst?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engineering of nucleic acids has been a longstanding objective in research, with the field gaining significant attention following the discovery of ribozymes in the early 1980s. Numerous nucleic acid catalysts have been developed to catalyze a wide range of reactions, and the structures of ribozymes have been modified to allow allosteric regulation by an external cofactor. All these constructs hold considerable promise for applications in biosensors for medical and environmental diagnostics, as well as in molecular tools for regulating cellular processes. In addition to the development of nucleic acid enzymes through in vitro selection, rational design offers a robust strategy for engineering ribozymes with customized properties. The structures and mechanisms of numerous nucleic acid catalysts have been thoroughly elucidated, making structural modulation a viable approach for designing their functional properties. Rational design necessitates the consideration of several parameters, and a range of tools is available to guide sequence design. In this review, we discuss sequence, structural, and functional design, primarily using the example of the hairpin ribozyme, to highlight the challenges and opportunities of rational nucleic acid enzyme engineering.</dc:description>

In this contribution we critically discuss the challenges and opportunities offered by using aqueous and micellar media in the chemical synthesis of peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Monomeric and Tetrameric Amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 Peptides with D&#8208;Aspartic Acid Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 (A&#946;1&#8208;42) peptide includes three aspartic acid (Asp) residues. It is known that these Asp residues undergo stereoinversion to D&#8208;Asp in aging tissues, a process that promotes &#946;&#8208;sheet structure formation. In this study, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers and tetramers containing D&#8208;Asp residues were analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Seven types of mutants were generated by stereoinverting the three Asp residues, and monomer MD simulations were performed using an implicit solvent model for all seven mutants and the wild type. Following these implicit solvent simulations, tetramer MD simulations using explicit water molecules were conducted for the wild type and three mutants previously reported to form secondary structures in experimental studies. The MD simulations of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers with implicit solvent successfully reproduced the trend of increased &#946;&#8208;structure formation caused by D&#8208;Asp7 and D&#8208;Asp23. However, the effects of D&#8208;Asp1 were only captured in tetramer simulations using explicit water. These findings suggest that explicit water is necessary to accurately model peptide&#8208;peptide interactions and that multimer simulations are essential for investigating structural features, such as &#946;&#8208;sheet formations and aggregation in proteins containing D&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Peptide&#8208;Graphene Conjugates for Enhanced Cell Spreading, Osteogenic Differentiation, and Angiogenesis in Bone Defects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traumatic bone injury is one of the most common injuries that require surgical intervention, and current treatments suffer severe drawbacks. Modern research in bone regeneration focuses on implants will support and enhance native tissue regeneration. One scaffold material that shows promise is graphene oxide (GO), a 2D nanomaterial made from oxidation of graphite. GO is biocompatible, strong, osteoinductive, is safely and slowly resorbed by the body, has a cheap, facile, and scalable synthesis, and is highly tailorable and functionalizable. The bioactivity of GO can be enhanced via functionalization with biomolecules such as peptides, proteins, and small molecules. Here, short peptides RGD, DGEA, and KKGHK are covalently bound to GO through a Claisen modification (CG) to create new functional graphenic materials that are cell&#8208;adhesive, osteogenic, and angiogenic, respectively. These peptide&#8208;Claisen graphenes (peptide&#8208;CGs) are found to be cytocompatible, to encourage cell spreading on the graphenic surface, to promote osteogenesis in stem cells, and to induce angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells. They show promise as next&#8208;generation bone regeneration scaffolds by overcoming challenges frequently faced by bone regeneration scaffolds, namely retaining implanted and recruited cells, promoting their survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and ensuring a sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply to new tissue.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Stability and Substrate Profile of Transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi with Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine transaminases (ATAs), belonging to the class III transaminases within the superfamily of pyridoxal&#8208;5'&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyze transamination reactions between amino donors and amino acceptors. These enzymes are particularly appealing for their role in the stereospecific synthesis of chiral amines. However, the stability of most ATAs is not satisfying, limiting their suitability for industrial applications. Among them, the amine transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi (Sp&#8208;ATA) has drawn attention due to its high activity and broad substrate scope under mild conditions and high pH. Nevertheless, maintaining the activity at higher temperatures presents a challenge. Previous research to enhance enzyme function through directed evolution has shown promise, yet predicting the cooperative effects of individual stabilizing mutations remains challenging. Computational approaches have been explored but often rely on structural information and are resource&#8208;intensive. An alternative strategy is ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), which is based on gene sequences to create a more or less artificial phylogenetic tree. This study aims to leverage ASR techniques to explore the thermostability, solvent tolerance, and substrate profile of Sp&#8208;ATA, to find highly stable transaminases. By using Sp&#8208;ATA as a template and incorporating insights from ancestral sequences, this strategy offers a promising approach for developing robust biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Proline amide catalyzes formation of toxic crotonaldehyde from acetaldehyde under physiologically relevant conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crotonaldehyde is a human toxin that reacts with nucleophilic groups on DNA and proteins. Putative crotonaldehyde&#8208;derived adducts on DNA are reported in cells and patients after ethanol exposure, which implies that crotonaldehyde is formed in cells. Here, we show that proline amide, which is a model of N&#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing proteins, catalyzes the aldol condensation of the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde to crotonaldehyde under physiologically relevant conditions. This reaction was more efficient at neutral pH than under acidic or basic conditions, but is inhibited by competing imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one formation. Crotonaldehyde formation is also slower than the analogous aldol condensation of propionaldehyde. Comparative studies additionally suggest that proline amide is a more efficient catalyst than other amino acid amides. Overall, the work evidences a biochemically plausible mechanism for intracellular crotonaldehyde formation and implies that proline amide derivatives can catalyse aldol chemistry in humans.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactive Specialized Metabolites from Staphylococcus: Diversity, Biosynthesis, and Biotechnological Potential</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staphylococci colonize diverse ecological niches and have evolved sophisticated survival strategies, like the production and secretion of a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites. This review examines the biosynthesis, mechanism of action, and potential applications of these metabolites, with a particular focus on unusual biosynthetic pathways and emerging strategies to unlock the hidden metabolic potential of staphylococci.

Staphylococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria capable of colonizing diverse ecological niches and adopting a wide variety of lifestyles. While several strains are known as notorious, multidrug&#8208;resistant human pathogens, others are harmless inhabitants of soil, water, and food products, or beneficial members of the skin microbiota. To survive and remain competitive under challenging environmental conditions, staphylococci have evolved the ability to assemble and secrete a diverse range of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides, nonribosomal peptides, terpenes, siderophores, and other specialized metabolites with antibiotic, immunomodulating and metal chelating activities. In this review, an overview of the bioactive metabolite arsenal of staphylococci is provided with a focus on their biosynthetic pathway, mode of action, and industrial application potential. Also, unexplored natural product biosynthetic pathways in staphylococci, along with strategies to access this hidden potential, are highlighted.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Naphthoyl Thiourea&#8208;Based Binuclear Ruthenium(II) Arene Complexes: Studies on Anticancer Activity and Apoptotic Mechanism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct set of naphthoyl thiourea&#8208;based binuclear ruthenium(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes is constructed and characterized. All the complexes display excellent cytotoxicity against various human cancer cells. Furthermore, apoptosis induction is assessed by acridine orange&#8208;ethidium bromide, Hoechst 33&#8201;342, mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species detection, and quantified by flow cytometry.

Herein, the synthesis, characterization, and anticancer activity of ruthenium(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes comprising naphthoyl thiourea&#8208;based ligands are described. The synthesized N^O and N^S chelating ruthenium(II) complexes (1&#8211;3) are fully characterized by elemental analysis and spectral (fourier transform&#8208;infrared, Ultraviolet&#8208;visible, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass) methods. The structure of complex 2 has been elucidated by employing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which verifies the two bidentate N^O and N^S coordination of the thiourea ligand to two Ru(II) centers. All the complexes have been screened for their anticancer efficacy in breast (MCF&#8208;7), colon (HT&#8208;29), liver (HepG2) cancerous cells, and noncancerous kidney (Hek&#8208;293) cells. Among them, complex 2 with an IC50 concentration of 3.59&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.72&#8201;&#956;m exhibits the most potent activity in HT&#8208;29 cells, surpassing the positive control, cisplatin. This may be due to the hydrophobic nature of the p&#8208;cymene moiety and electron&#8208;releasing methoxy group in the ligand scaffold. In addition, acridine orange&#8208;ethidium bromide and Hoechst labeling of all the complexes (1&#8211;3) on HT&#8208;29 cells reveal morphological alterations such as nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation resulting from the death of cancerous cells via apoptosis. Biochemical assays such as reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and flow cytometry strongly confirm the cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction&#8208;mediated apoptosis.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, the synthesis, characterization, and anticancer activity of ruthenium(II) &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene complexes comprising naphthoyl thiourea-based ligands are described. The synthesized N^O and N^S chelating ruthenium(II) complexes (&lt;b&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt;) are fully characterized by elemental analysis and spectral (fourier transform-infrared, Ultraviolet-visible, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass) methods. The structure of complex 2 has been elucidated by employing single-crystal X-ray diffraction, which verifies the two bidentate N^O and N^S coordination of the thiourea ligand to two Ru(II) centers. All the complexes have been screened for their anticancer efficacy in breast (MCF-7), colon (HT-29), liver (HepG2) cancerous cells, and noncancerous kidney (Hek-293) cells. Among them, complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of 3.59&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.72&#8201;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; exhibits the most potent activity in HT-29 cells, surpassing the positive control, cisplatin. This may be due to the hydrophobic nature of the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene moiety and electron-releasing methoxy group in the ligand scaffold. In addition, acridine orange-ethidium bromide and Hoechst labeling of all the complexes (&lt;b&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt;) on HT-29 cells reveal morphological alterations such as nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation resulting from the death of cancerous cells via apoptosis. Biochemical assays such as reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and flow cytometry strongly confirm the cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Substituted Tricyanofuran&#8208;Based Fluorogenic Probes for the Sensitive Detection of Glycosidases under Acidic pH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricyanofuran&#8208;based fluorogenic probes are developed for the sensitive detection of lysosomal glycosidases in cancer cells. By introducing bromine to the ortho&#8208;position of phenolic alcohol, the fluorescence of the probe is enhanced over a wide pH range. These probes are used to effectively image glycosidase activities in live cells, and the results agree with those obtained from biochemical assays.

Glycosidases participate in modulating a number of biological processes, and their overexpression is a hallmark of several human diseases. Considering the localization of glycosidases predominantly in the lysosomes, it is imperative to develop molecular probes that are resistant to interference from acidic pH. Herein, tricyanofuran&#8208;based long&#8208;wavelength fluorogenic probes are synthesized, and it is demonstrated that the introduction of bromine to the ortho&#8208;position of the phenol alcohol of the probe substantially enhances its fluorescence over an acidic pH range of 3.0&#8211;10.0. These probes, when modified with glycosyl substrates, have proved applicable for the sensitive fluorogenic detection of glycosidases under acidic pH, and fluorescence&#8208;based imaging of endogenous &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and &#946;&#8208;glucosidase activities in live cells. The imaging results are validated by quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting.

         <title>Impact of Mutational Status on Intracellular Effects of Cell&#8208;Permeable CaaX Peptides in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work deals with intracellular effects of cell&#8208;permeable CaaX&#8208;peptides, designed to influence prenylated proteins like KRas. The results show that after CaaX&#8208;1 treatment, not only KRas expression and signaling are specifically altered in mutated pancreatic cancer cells, but also plasma membrane localization of KRas is affected. Thus, CaaX&#8208;peptides are promising tools to manipulate prenylation&#8208;dependent proteins.

Prenyltransferases add a lipid group to the cysteine of a CaaX motif of proteins. This posttranslational modification enables proteins to attach to membranes where they are essential hubs for signaling, trafficking, and apoptosis. Recently, cell&#8208;permeable CaaX&#8208;peptides are developed as possible tools to interfere with the prenylation machinery. These peptides cause cytotoxic effects, particularly in KRas mutant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC&#8208;1) in which they also alter downstream signaling of Ras proteins. Herein, the aim is to get more clues about the relevance of the mutational status of KRas. Therefore, the activity of CaaX&#8208;peptides in KRas wildtype BxPC&#8208;3 and KRas mutated PANC&#8208;1 cells is compared. CaaX&#8208;peptides differently influence these two cell lines, although they internalize pretty much to the same extent. Indeed, an altered KRas plasma membrane localization in PANC&#8208;1 cells is observed, probably induced by disturbed KRas prenylation based on the presence of CaaX&#8208;peptides. The impact of CaaX&#8208;peptides on KRas signaling is likely dependent on the KRas mutation in PANC&#8208;1 cells in which they further trigger effects on KRas&#8208;dependent regulators, e.g., Neurofibromin &#8722;1 (NF1) and son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1). All in all, CaaX peptides are identified as promising tools for studying and manipulating the function of therapeutically important prenylated proteins.

         <title>Hybrid Molecules of Small Molecular and Peptidic HIV Fusion Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the membrane fusion step is the last chance to block the virus extracellularly, membrane fusion is an important target as anti&#8208;HIV agents. We previously found that dimeric derivatives of C34, which is contained in the HIV&#8208;1 envelope protein gp41, linked by a disulfide bridge or a pegylated linker at its C&#8208;terminus have more potent anti&#8208;HIV activity than the C34 peptide monomer, and that bivalent inhibitors crosslinking two peptidomimetic small compounds have more potent anti&#8208;HIV activity than the parent small compounds. In the present study, the hybrids of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptides (SC34 (2) and SC22EK (3)) were designed as heterodimeric molecules (10&#8211;15) to compensate the drawbacks of the above homodimeric molecules. Some hybrid molecules of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptide SC22EK (3) have remarkably higher anti&#8208;HIV activity than peptide SC22EK (3). Crosslinking small compounds and peptide (3) was found to be critical for an increase of anti&#8208;HIV activity. Hybrid molecules with small compounds and peptides are useful HIV&#8208;1 fusion inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Visual detection and identification of influenza A viruses by nucleic acid probe&#8208;enabled lateral flow assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diagnosis of influenza A viral infection is crucial for preventing disease transmission and providing effective clinical treatments. There is an increasing need for convenient detection methods to enable simple yet precise identification of viral infections. Here, we developed a nucleic acid probe&#8208;enabled lateral flow assay (NALFA) to realize visual detection and identification of influenza A viral infections (H1N1 and H3N2) of high sensitivity and specificity. Viral RNA targets were recognized by a padlock probe, which was circularized to induce rolling circle amplification (RCA). RCA products were enzymatically cleaved into short amplicons to complex with capture DNA probes for gold colloidal&#8208;induced visual lateral flow assay. NALFA achieved attomolar (aM) sensitivity for both standard viral RNAs, along with high specificity. While applying clinical samples (16 H1N1 patients, 12 healthy controls), NALFA exhibited high detection accuracy to successfully discriminate infected samples from noninfected samples. NALFA represents a potent and convenient nucleic acid detection assay that shall find its applications in fields of viral detection and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>First Steps toward the Design of Peptides that Influence the Intracellular Palmitoylation Machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, DC peptides consisting of the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide sC18* and a Asp&#8211;His&#8211;His&#8211;Cys (DHHC) motif derived from human ZDHHC palmitoyltransferase are highlighted. DC peptides demonstrate high cellular internalization into various cellular models, exert cytotoxic effects against cancerous cells, and alter the function and localization of known palmitoylation substrate proteins.

Protein S&#8208;palmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational modification transferring the 16&#8208;carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteines. It plays a critical role in many cellular processes by influencing protein function, localization, stability, and protein&#8211;protein interactions and has a significant impact on various physiological and pathological conditions. This emphasizes the need to develop new technologies to study and treat diseases associated with aberrant palmitoylation. To address these challenges, cell&#8208;permeable peptides containing an Asp&#8211;His&#8211;His&#8211;Cys (DHHC) palmitoylation motif are presented aiming to affect intracellular protein S&#8208;palmitoylation. A small library of peptides is generated and screened for cellular uptake and cell compatibility. Interestingly, the newly designed peptides internalize to high extent into different cell lines and human breast cell spheroids dependent on their palmitoylation motif. In addition, out of this screen, DC&#8208;2 is identified as very potent and this peptide is investigated in more detail concerning its impact on palmitoylated proteins that are connected to cancer progression. These initial explorations highlight that DC&#8208;2 affected the localization of HRas and altered S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;related signaling cascades of epidermal growth factor receptor. These findings suggest a peptide&#8208;driven impact on proteins having palmitoylation sites and highlight cell&#8208;permeable DHHC peptides as a potential tool to be further evolved in the context of palmitoylation and cancer.

         <title>Recent Advances in Enzymes and Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Tetrasaccharide Linkage Region of Proteoglycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteoglycans (PGs) play roles in many important biological events including growth factor signaling, wound repair, blood coagulation, brain development, and neural stem cell migration. As the glycosaminoglycan chain of PGs is attached to the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, it is important to decipher the intricate control of the multitude of enzymes engaged in biosynthesis of the linkage region. During the past two decades, significant advances have been achieved in our understanding of the identity and interactions of these enzymes as well as the control of their activities. Furthermore, the knowledge gained on biosynthesis of the linkage region has enabled the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined proteoglycan associated glycopeptides. The expression, activity, and substrate profile of enzymes and the latest development of chemoenzymatic synthesis of linkage region bearing glycopeptides are summarized in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromenone derivatives as CRM1 Inhibitors for Targeting Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers. Due to the complexity and redundancy within signaling networks in GBM, targeted inhibitors of specific pathways have shown only limited success. The nuclear export receptor Chromosome Region Maintenance 1 (CRM1) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target, as its inhibition can simultaneously disrupt multiple key oncogenic drivers. In this study, we explore whether chromenone derivatives, known for detecting thiol&#8208;containing molecules, can function as CRM1 inhibitors. We synthesized several chromenone&#8208;based derivatives and demonstrated that they inhibit CRM1&#8208;driven nuclear export in a structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent manner. A preliminary structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) was established, providing a rationale for selective CRM1 binding based on molecular docking studies. Additionally, we showed that the active chromenone derivatives effectively inhibit the nuclear export of endogenous nuclear export signal (NES)&#8208;containing substrates in glioblastoma cells. Several of these compounds exhibit selective cytotoxicity against glioblastoma cell lines, highlighting their potential as targeted therapies for GBM.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ligase&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Step Approach for the Generation of Bicyclic Peptides Containing a Benzylphenyl Thioether Framework</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy for the construction of bicyclic peptides containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. The bicyclization reaction in this strategy can occur under low concentrations of tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene, which shows little effect on the phage infectivity and will help maintain the diversity of phage displayed cyclic peptides.

This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy to prepare a unique type of bicyclic peptide molecules containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. Different from the conventional bicyclic peptide construction method, this study first utilizes peptide ligases (SrtA or OaAEP1) to introduce an arylthiol group into the parent peptides and then performs bicyclization of the peptides by using TBMB to generate the desired bicyclic peptides. Since the pKa of aryl thiols is lower than that of alkyl thiols, the bicyclization reaction of the peptides in our system can occur under low concentrations of TBMB or low pH conditions. The low concentrations of TBMB have little effect on the phage infectivity, which will help maintain the diversity of phage&#8208;displayed cyclic peptides. This study establishes a biocompatible ligase&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step strategy for the preparation of bicyclic peptides, which has potential applications in the discovery of bioactive cyclic peptide ligands.

         <title>The Molecular Toolbox for Linkage Type&#8208;Specific Analysis of Ubiquitin Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitin modifications regulate virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology through an array of polyubiquitin chain signals that adopt distinct structures, enabling the individual polyubiquitin linkages to mediate specific functions in cells. Herein, molecular tools available for enrichment, detection, and characterization of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling, are reviewed.

Modification of proteins and other biomolecules with ubiquitin regulates virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. Ubiquitin can be attached to substrates as a monomer or as an array of polyubiquitin chains with defined linkages between the ubiquitin moieties. Each ubiquitin linkage type adopts a distinct structure, enabling the individual linkage types to mediate specific functions or outcomes in the cell. The dynamics, heterogeneity, and in some cases low abundance, make analysis of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling a challenging and complex task. Herein, the strategies and molecular tools available for enrichment, detection, and characterization of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling, are reviewed. The molecular &#8220;toolbox&#8221; consists of a range of molecularly different affinity reagents, including antibodies and antibody&#8208;like molecules, affimers, engineered ubiquitin&#8208;binding domains, catalytically inactive deubiquitinases, and macrocyclic peptides, each with their unique characteristics and binding modes. The molecular engineering of these ubiquitin&#8208;binding molecules makes them useful tools and reagents that can be coupled to a range of analytical methods, such as immunoblotting, fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics, or enzymatic analyses to aid in deciphering the ever&#8208;expanding complexity of ubiquitin modifications.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Adapted Lipid A from Polaribacter sp. SM1127: A Study of Structural Heterogeneity and Immunostimulatory Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This analysis reveals structural heterogeneity in the lipopolysaccharide lipid A from the cold&#8208;adapted Gram&#8208;negative bacterium Polaribacter sp. SM1127, with variations in fatty acid chain number, length, branching, saturation, and hydroxylation degree, likely aiding bacterial adaptation to cold environmental stressors. Lipopolysaccharide is shown to be a weak activator of Toll&#8208;like receptor 4&#8208;mediated pathway, highlighting its potential as an immunomodulatory molecule.

Polaribacter sp. SM1127, a cold&#8208;adapted marine Gram&#8208;negative bacterium isolated from Laminaria in Arctic waters, plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and biopolymer degradation in cold environments. Additionally, its exopolysaccharide (EPS) exhibits promising biotechnological potential, including antioxidant and wound&#8208;healing properties. This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of lipid A, the glycolipid component of Polaribacter sp. SM1127 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by bypassing full LPS extraction and working directly with the ethanol precipitation product containing both EPS and bacterial cells. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals significant structural heterogeneity in the lipid A, with variations in fatty acid chain length, branching, saturation, and hydroxylation. These features likely enable the bacterium to fine&#8208;tune its response to fluctuating temperatures or other cold&#8208;related environmental stresses, contributing to resilience in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. Furthermore, immunological assays demonstrate that both LPS and EPS produced by Polaribacter sp. SM1127 induce weak Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 activation and, in general, poorly stimulate the nuclear factor kappa&#8208;light&#8208;chain&#8208;enhancer of activated B cells pathway, compared to Escherichia coli LPS. These findings suggest their potential as immunomodulatory agents, like vaccine adjuvants.

         <title>SAAP&#8208;148 Oligomerizes into a Hexamer Forming a Hydrophobic Inner Core</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly cationic and hydrophobic antimicrobial peptide SAP&#8208;148 effectively eradicates multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, persistent cells, and biofilms without inducing resistance. Its efficiency is likely due to its ability to disrupt bacterial membranes as an oligomer, forming a stable alpha&#8208;helical hexameric bundle with three parallel dimers that create a hydrophobic core.

Human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 derivative, the 24&#8208;mer SAAP&#8208;148, is highly effective in&#8201;vitro in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria without inducing resistance. SAAP&#8208;148 has a high cationic charge (+11) and 46% hydrophobicity, which, once the peptide folds into an alpha helix, forms a wide hydrophobic face. This highly amphipathic nature facilitates on the one hand its insertion into the membrane's fatty acyl chain region and on the other hand it&#180;s interaction with anionic membrane components, which aids in killing bacteria. However, the contributions of the secondary and quaternary structures have not been thoroughly investigated so far. To address this, we applied circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray scattering, AlphaFold 3 protein folding software, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that SAAP&#8208;148 adopts a stable hexameric bundle composed of three parallel dimers, that together form a hydrophobic core of aromatic side chain residues. The hexameric structure is retained at the membrane interface, whereby, MD simulation studies indicated the formation of a fiber&#8208;like structure in the presence of anionic membranes. This certainly seems plausible, as oligomers are stabilized by aromatic residues, and the exposure of positively charged side chains on the surface likely facilitates the transition of the peptide into fibrils on anionic membranes.

         <title>Optimization and Application of the Purified Cell&#8208;Free System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein synthesis using recombinant elements system has been broadly studied and optimized for its promising and practical application in several biotechnological research fields, including prototyping, non&#8208;canonical amino acid incorporation, and synthetic cell construction. Herein, the optimization progress and the cutting&#8208;edge application in recent years are summarized. Moreover, the future challenges and direction are discussed.

Cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) is extensively applied in biotechnological research. Unlike the lysate&#8208;based CFPS system, the alternative purified cell&#8208;free system, protein synthesis using recombinant elements (PURE), has garnered a great attention due to its controllability and flexibility of adjusting individual component for in&#8201;vitro transcription and translation research. The PURE system has been widely studied in the synthetic biological field, and optimized for its application in prototyping research, non&#8208;canonical amino acid incorporation and synthetic cell construction. Herein, the recent optimization strategies for a simple and enhanced PURE system are discussed. In addition, the recent application via the PURE system and the current challenges for the development of a more robust and controllable PURE are highlighted.

         <title>Computational Studies and Functional Validation of Eugenol and Ferulic Acid as Inhibitors of Against Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the binding of natural compounds to EfSrtA by computational and experimental methods. Computational studies reveal that the ligands interacted with the protein significantly. Further to confirm the results, an enzymatic assay and functional validation on bacterial growth are also reported. The study indicates that the ligands bind to EfSrtA with significant interactions and show promising results.







Abstract
Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is commonly occurring pathogen associated with nosocomial infections. Infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) nature and their tendency to form biofilms. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches to treatment. In this regard, targeting an important protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface&#8208;exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it's a promising drug target for the development of anti&#8208;microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development. To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have expressed and purified E. faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA&#916;N59). Structural studies using homology modelling along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were also done. The results were confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti&#8208;biofilm assays and inhibition assays of selected ligands were also done against E. faecalis individually and in synergistic combinations. Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to EfSrtA&#916;N59 with significant interactions and show promising results.

         <title>Linker Ratio&#8208;Dependent Physicochemical Properties of ZIF&#8208;8 Encapsulated Mini Protein 20 Mimicking Uricase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the effect of varying Zn to 2&#8208;HmIm molar ratios on the synthesis of nanoporous ZIF&#8208;8 for encapsulating the mini protein mimicking uricase (mp20) as a model biomolecule. The results reveal that a 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio exhibits high encapsulation efficiency and thermal stability, while a 1&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio yields well&#8208;crystallized biocomposites with optimal particle size and surface area, enhancing their structural integrity and surface interactions for intended applications.







Abstract
Despite a growing interest in zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8), notably for their potential as a host for various bio&#8208; and molecules, including peptides, the critical factors affecting their physicochemical properties and encapsulation efficiency are relatively unknown, limiting their widespread use. Herein, mini protein 20 (mp20), biomolecule mimicking uricase was used as a model to be hosted within ZIF&#8208;8 (mp20@ZIF&#8208;8) biocomposites. ZIF&#8208;8 were synthesized over a range of molar ratio of Zn to 2&#8208;methylimidazole(2&#8208;HmIm). By systematically exploring the impacts of various linker ratios, we found that a Zn to 2&#8208;HmIm ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 offers the highest encapsulation efficiency and thermal stability, making it particularly suitable for applications where these properties are critical. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio, on the other hand, makes biocomposites with the most crystallized and a well&#8208;balanced combination of particle size and surface area, which are advantageous for applications requiring high structural integrity and surface interaction. This approach not only advances our understanding of protein encapsulation in MOFs but also provides new insights into how the linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio can be optimized for different applications. Subsequent studies could expand upon these findings by implementing the enhanced biocomposites in practical applications, examining the encapsulation of biomolecules, or assessing the durability the long&#8208;term stability and functionality of these materials in various conditions.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoates From Sucrose by Recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sucrose&#8208;utilization pathway was developed in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 using sacC from Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which encodes a &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. MCL&#8208;PHA and P(3HB) were successfully produced in recombinant P. putida KT2440 expressing SacC from sucrose as a sole carbon source.







Abstract
A sucrose&#8208;utilization pathway was developed in Pseudomonas putida using sacC from Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which encodes a &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Excretion of &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase into the culture medium was confirmed via western blot analysis. In nitrogen&#8208;limited cultivation, P. putida expressing SacC produced 10.52&#8197;wt&#8201;% medium&#8208;chain&#8208;length polyhydroxyalkanoate (MCL&#8208;PHA), while P. putida expressing SacC along with poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] biosynthesis genes produced 9.16&#8197;wt&#8201;% P(3HB) from sucrose. Batch and fed&#8208;batch cultures of recombinant P. putida suggested that the glucose and fructose derived from sucrose can be completely utilized for cell growth and P(3HB) production. In fed&#8208;batch cultures, sucrose supplied into the fermentor to maintain its concentration around 20&#8197;g/L was rapidly hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose supporting the production of 30.2&#8197;g/L P(3HB) with 38.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The engineered P. putida reported herein can facilitate the production of PHAs from sucrose, an abundant and inexpensive carbon source.

&lt;p&gt;A sucrose-utilization pathway was developed in &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt; KT2440 using sacC from &lt;i&gt;Mannheimia succiniciproducens&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a &#946;-fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. MCL-PHA and P(3HB) were successfully produced in recombinant P. putida KT2440 expressing SacC from sucrose as a sole carbon source.

&lt;p&gt;A sucrose-utilization pathway was developed in &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;sacC&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Mannheimia succiniciproducens&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a &#946;-fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Excretion of &#946;-fructofuranosidase into the culture medium was confirmed via western blot analysis.

         <title>Conjugation of Human N&#8208;Glycans Improves the Drug Properties of Existing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylation, which can impart the beneficial properties of N&#8208;glycans to peptides and proteins, can be applied by a glycoconjugation approach at the post&#8208;synthesis stage in an aqueous environment. The synthesis of glycoconjugation&#8208;ready N&#8208;glycans does not require the manipulation of glycan carbohydrate protecting groups, allowing for their use in unprotected form.







Abstract
Glycosylation is one of the most ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modifications observed in peptides and proteins. It affects the structural and functional characteristics of these macromolecules, thereby exerting a profound influence on a multitude of biological processes. N&#8208;Glycans are expected to be a beneficial modifier for increasing the solubility and in&#8197;vivo half&#8208;life, and reducing the aggregation and immunogenicity of native bioactive peptides and proteins, which have seen limited clinical utility due to their short blood half&#8208;life and unsuitable physicochemical properties. Chemoselective glycosylation reactions that can be conducted post&#8208;synthesis and in aqueous conditions are a promising strategy for the high&#8208;throughput development of peptide/protein drugs. This &#8220;glycoconjugation&#8221; approach is particularly advantageous in that manipulation of glycan protecting groups is not necessary, thereby allowing conjugation reactions to be carried out between target molecules and unprotected glycans. By providing a single glycosylation profile, i.&#8201;e., glycan structure, number, and position, glycoconjugation not only allows the beneficial properties of N&#8208;glycans to be exploited, but also facilitates the investigation of N&#8208;glycan function.

         <title>Unveiling the Architecture of Human Fibrinogen: A Full&#8208;Length Structural Model</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first full&#8208;length three&#8208;dimensional structure of human fibrinogen was obtained through homology modelling, coarse&#8208;grained and all&#8208;atoms molecular dynamics simulations. Large sections that play important roles in fibrin assembly (coloured) and whose structures were missing in the crystallographic structure (grey) and therefore were unknown, were in silico modelled and analysed. This will allow the construction of a protofibril to shed light on the polymerization process.







Abstract
Fibrinogen is a protein involved in the haemostasis process playing a central role by forming the fibrin clot. An understanding of protein structure is vital to determining biological function. Despite many studies on the fibrin polymerization process, its molecular mechanism remains elusive mainly due to the absence of a full&#8208;length three&#8208;dimensional model of human fibrinogen. Amino&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;terminal regions of the three pairs of chains that form this molecule are missing in the crystallographic structure, being the carboxyl&#8208;terminal of the A&#945; chain the most affected with a section of more than 400 amino acids missing. To have a full structure of the fibrinogen molecule would allow the creation of a model of protofibril, shedding light into the fibrin formation process through computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations. Absent regions were explored using homology modelling and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations. Later on, the model was refined and stabilized with atomistic molecular dynamic simulations. In the present study, we obtained the first realistic full&#8208;length structure of fibrinogen, with features in accordance with previous results obtained by experimental techniques.

         <title>A Cryptic Loop that Modulates Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction: Implications in PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2 Late&#8208;stage Binding Event</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of computational and experimental approaches revealed the role of a cryptic loop in the late&#8208;stage binding of Plasmodium falciparum proteins PfAMA1 and PfRON2, crucial for malaria parasite entry into human red blood cells. Simulations captured loop dynamics, while experiments validated binding kinetics, identifying, fort the first time, key residues in PfRON2&#8217;s helix region essential for binding.







Abstract
Disease&#8208;related protein&#8208;protein interactions are important molecular targets for drug discovery campaigns. The dynamics of a disordered loop, which are commonly found in the receptor binding domain of many proteins, often plays a decisive role during protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;small molecule binding events. One notable example is the interactions between two proteins from Plasmodium falciparum, PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2, which are crucial for the malaria parasite's invasion into human red blood cells. A thorough understanding of the interactions between these macromolecular binding partners is important for designing better therapeutics against this ancient disease. The available crystal structures of the PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2 complex show insufficient electron density, making it challenging to fully understand the molecular&#8208;level association of the domain II (DII) loop with the PfRON2. To address this, we have computationally simulated the dynamics and free energetics of DII loop closing processes, identifying a set of key amino acid residues in the PfRON2 helix that are essential for binding. The subsequent experimental validation of the relative importance of residues in context provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular recognition event between PfAMA1 and PfRON2, specifically in the post&#8208;binding stage. This insight could potentially open up new avenues to drug discovery against malaria.

         <title>Silencing of O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Attenuated O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and Metastatic Potentials of Melanoma Cells Through Suppression of Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B Signaling Pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in the metastasis of melanoma. O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes are elevated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors and normal tissues. Suppression of OGT by siRNA showed that O&#8208;GlcNAcylation regulates melanoma metastasis via Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway, consequence in the expression of metastatic related genes.







Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is an important biological process in regulating the function of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins in cells. Enhancement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation was associated with cancer development and progression. Here, we demonstrated the involvement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in melanoma metastasis. Using the data from GEO database, we found that O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes, including glutamine fructose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and O&#8208;GlcNAcase (OGA); were elevated in metastatic melanoma compared with primary tumors and normal tissues. Functional analyses in melanoma cell lines &#8211; MNT&#8208;1, SK&#8208;MEL&#8208;28, and A&#8208;375 showed that suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation by siRNA against OGT significantly reduces the migration and invasion abilities of the cells. Phosphorylation of Akt and NF&#954;B was drastically suppressed after the knockdown of OGT, suggesting the role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating the Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway. In addition, we found that the NF&#954;B target genes, such as ZEB&#8208;2 and MCT&#8208;1, were significantly upregulated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors. MCT&#8208;1 expression in melanoma tissues was also correlated with the O&#8208;GlcNAcylation level. Taken together, we have demonstrated in this study the possible role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in controlling melanoma metastasis via upregulating MCT&#8208;1 expression through activation of the Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcylation is an important biological process in regulating the function of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins in cells. Enhancement of &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcylation was associated with cancer development and progression. Here, we demonstrated the involvement of &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcylation in melanoma metastasis. Using the data from GEO database, we found that &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes, including glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcase (OGA); were elevated in metastatic melanoma compared with primary tumors and normal tissues. Functional analyses in melanoma cell lines &#8211; MNT-1, SK-MEL-28, and A-375 showed that suppression of &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcylation by siRNA against OGT significantly reduces the migration and invasion abilities of the cells. Phosphorylation of Akt and NF&#954;B was drastically suppressed after the knockdown of OGT, suggesting the role of &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcylation in regulating the Akt-NF&#954;B signaling pathway. In addition, we found that the NF&#954;B target genes, such as ZEB-2 and MCT-1, were significantly upregulated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors. MCT-1 expression in melanoma tissues was also correlated with the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-GlcNAcylation level. Taken together, we have demonstrated in this study the possible role of &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;GlcNAcylation in controlling melanoma metastasis via upregulating MCT-1 expression through activation of the Akt-NF&#954;B signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Native CB2 Receptor Mobility in Plasma Membranes of Living Cells by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates CB2 receptor (CB2R) mobility in live cells using the fluorescent probe RO7304924 and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Results demonstrate the probe&#8216;s efficiency in quantifying receptor diffusion and mobility, with CB2R showing high mobile fractions and diffusion coefficients. This approach provides a non&#8208;invasive and precise tool for studying CB2R dynamics, relevant to cellular processes and receptor functions.







Abstract
In this study, we employed a novel fluorescent probe, RO7304924 &#8211; which selectively targets cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) &#8211; to assess the lateral mobility of CB2R within the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing a functional, untagged receptor variant. Utilizing confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we quantified the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of CB2R, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of RO7304924 as an innovative tool for elucidating the dynamics of this major endocannabinoid&#8208;binding G protein&#8208;coupled receptor. Our present findings highlight the potential of combining advanced ligand&#8208;based fluorescent probes with FRAP for future investigations into the biochemical details of CB2R mobility in living cells, and its impact on receptor&#8208;dependent cellular processes.

         <title>Protein Fusion of Biosynthetic Enzymes and a Thermo&#8208;Responsive Polypeptide Expedites Facile Access to Biocatalysts for Nucleotide Sugars</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green preparation and recycle avenue to biocatalysts for nucleotide sugars was established by protein fusion and a thermo&#8208;responsive tag. Using this strategy, five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64 and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) were successfully constructed and applied as biocatalysts. In addition, the ELP&#8208;tagged bifunctional enzymes may also be recycled from reaction solution by simple ITC process.







Abstract
Nucleotide sugars (NSs) are essential building blocks for the enzymatic assembly of glycans. In this study, we established a preparation and recycling avenue to the biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs. This approach involves fusing two enzymes into a bifunctional chimera and using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ET64) as a purification tag, which allows for easy recovery of these biocatalysts without the need for chromatography. We successfully constructed and obtained five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) for the synthesis of five common NSs (UDP&#8208;Gal, UDP&#8208;GlcNAc, GDP&#8208;Man, GDP&#8208;Fuc, and CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac). These enzymes were obtained using the Inverse Transition Cycling (ITC) process in yields ranging from 60 to 124&#8197;mg per liter of fermentation. The enzymatic synthesis of NSs was carried out on a scale from hundreds of milligrams to multiple grams using these biocatalysts. Furthermore, we investigated the reusability of these biocatalysts by recycling them from the reaction solution using the ITC process. The recycling of GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64 was effectively achieved for 15, 13, 3, and 4 times, respectively. These biocatalysts could be used not only for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs but also for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycan biomolecules when coupled with glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Covalently Mercurated 6&#8208;Phenylcarbazole Residues Promote Hybridization of Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organomercury derivatives of 6&#8208;phenylcarbazole can stabilize triple helices when placed at the termini of triplex&#8208;forming homothymine oligonucleotides. In some cases, this stabilization could be attributed to direct coordination of a Hg(II) ion to adenine&#8208;N7 or cytosine&#8208;N4. For Hg(II)&#8208;mediated interaction with both partners of a base pair, the carbazole scaffold would have to be further extended.







Abstract
Homothymidine DNA oligonucleotides bearing a 3'&#8208;terminal 6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole C&#8208;nucleoside, mercurated at position 1, 8 or both, were synthesized and tested for their potential to form triple helices with homoadenine&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;homothymine duplexes. The monomercurated triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides favored hybridization with fully matched double helices and in some cases considerable increase of the melting temperature could be attributed to Hoogsteen&#8208;type Hg(II)&#8208;mediated interaction with the homoadenine strand. The dimercurated one, on the other hand, favored hybridization with double helices placing a homo mispair opposite to the carbazole residue, suggesting that simultaneous coordination of each of the two Hg(II) ions to a different strand is only possible in the absence of competition from Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing.

Late embryogenic abundant (LEA) peptides are short, disordered peptides that enhance Escherichia coli&#8242;s drought stress tolerance. Cyclization of LEA peptides can further improve their properties, such as anti&#8208;desiccation, thereby expanding their potential applications







Abstract
LEA peptides, which are designed based on late embryogenic abundant (LEA) protein sequences, have demonstrated chaperone&#8208;like functions, such as improving drought stress tolerance of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Previous studies have focused on the biological functions of linear LEA peptides. However, the function of cyclic LEA peptide still unknown. This study aimed to explore the cyclic LEA peptides&#8217; bio function like enhance the drought stress tolerance of E. coli by cyclizing the LEA peptide using SICLOPPS (Split Intein Circular Ligation of Peptides and Proteins). The results indicated that cyclization significantly improved the function and extended the potential applications. At the same time, we found that peptides containing numerous lysine residues exhibited reduced performance, which may be due to the exteins&#8217; residues affecting the SICLOPPS efficiency.

         <title>Lanthanides Gd and Tm Can Inhibit Carnitine/Acylcarnitine Transporter: Insights from All&#8208;Atoms Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibition of CAC transporter, an important mitochondrial protein, by Pr3+, Gd3+ and Tm3+ lanthanides is studied in the framework of all&#8208;atoms MD simulations. In presence of cations, it is shown that c&#8208;state to m&#8208;state conformational change occurs spontaneously, providing atomistic explanation of the protein's channel occlusion and inhibition.







Abstract
Recent experimental evidence highlighted the inhibition of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), an important mitochondrial transmembrane protein for living organisms, by the early lanthanide Pr3+. A possible explanation of such a behaviour was found in the preference of the cation for amino acids like aspartate and glutamate containing a carboxylate in the side chain, laying in the inter&#8208;membrane space. Interaction of the cation with these residues can cause halt the transfer of the protein&#8216;s substrates between the matrix and cytoplasm thus opening to new scenarios concerning the CAC&#8208;metal interactions and its relative inhibition. In the present work, the panel of metals binding the CAC protein is predictively expanded including Gd3+ and Tm3+, selected as representative species of middle and late lanthanides, respectively. A more realistic membrane&#8208;containing model of the protein was built and the comparative analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CAC apo&#8208;form with its complexed systems, named CAC&#8722;Pr, CAC&#8722;Gd and CAC&#8722;Tm, was performed. The analysis of the trajectories revealed that the inhibition is caused by the coordination of D132 and E179 to the cations and that such interactions generate a reorganization of important salt&#8208;bridges inside the framework of CAC. In detail, MD simulations highlighted that a spontaneous conformational change from cytoplasmatic&#8208;state (c&#8208;state) to matrix&#8208;state (m&#8208;state) induced by cations and that, in this condition, the protein channel is occluded, thus explaining the inhibition.

         <title>Development of an Environmentally Responsive Fluorescent Ligand for Vitamin D Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized a novel fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time observation of ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes in the vitamin&#8197;D receptor (VDR). Incorporating a dansyl fluorophore at the C11 position of 1&#945;,25(OH)&#8322;D&#8323;, the probe exhibits turn&#8208;on fluorescence with intensity and wavelength shifts upon VDR binding, reflecting its environmentally responsive properties.







Abstract
Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a critical role in regulating multiple biological processes, including bone metabolism and cell differentiation, by mediating transcriptional activation in response to ligand binding. We have constructed an environmentally fluorescent probe 2 for VDR to facilitate real&#8208;time observation of its ligand&#8208;dependent conformational changes in living cells. This probe 2 was synthesized by introducing a dansyl fluorophore via an ethynyl group at the C11 position of 1&#945;,25(OH)&#8322;D&#8323;. Probe 2 exhibited strong environmentally responsive fluorescence, showing increased intensity and a blue shift of the peak wavelength upon binding to VDR due to the increased hydrophobicity of the environment.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Cobalt Alloy@Graphene&#8208;Engineered Milk Extracellular Vesicles for Gastric Retentive Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To establish a gastric&#8208;retentive drug delivery system, FeCo@G&#8208;engineered milk extracellular vesicles are developed. This platform integrates the protective properties of milk extracellular vesicles, shielding drugs from degradation, with FeCo@G's robust magnetic retention capabilities. These features enable efficient mucosal penetration and significantly extend gastric retention time, enhancing therapeutic efficacy in gastric environments.







Abstract
Oral drug delivery is widely used for treating gastric diseases as it allows drugs to act directly on gastric lesions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. However, its efficacy is hindered by the specific gastric environment, such as the gastric mucosal barrier, which limits drug penetration, and the short gastric emptying time, which results in transient residence time. Raw milk&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (M&#8208;EVs) offer promise as a gastric drug delivery platform. Their high cellular affinity, stability under gastrointestinal conditions, and ability to protect drugs from acidic and enzymatic degradation make them suitable for this purpose. Incorporating mangetic nanoparticles encapsulated in M&#8208;EV provides magnetic navigation and active mucosal penetration capabilities. Herein, we developed a gastric drug delivery system based on iron&#8208;cobalt alloy@graphene (FeCo@G)&#8208;engineered M&#8208;EV (M&#8208;FNP). M&#8208;FNP serves as a versatile drug carrier that can load both small molecules and proteins through simple physical approach. And it demonstrates stability in the simulated gastric fluid system for at least 6&#8197;hours. Under magnetic field guidance, it penetrates the simulated mucosal layer and is internalized by cells within 4&#8197;hours significantly enhancing cellular drug uptake. M&#8208;FNP is expected to serve as an innovative drug delivery platform with enhanced retention capabilities within the stomach.

         <title>Coelenterazine&#8208;dependent Bioluminescence in the Cyclopoid Copepod, Triconia conifera</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calanoid copepod has been know to be bioluminescent using coelenterazine. The cyclopoid copepod, Triconia conifera emits blue light. In this study, we identified the presence of luciferase activity to coelenterazine in T. conifera. The presence of coelenterazine in the specimen was confirmed by LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS. These results suggested that coelenterazine&#8208;dependent bioluminescence was evolved parallelly at least twice in copepod lineages.







Abstract
Species in the cyclopoid copepod Triconia are known to be bioluminescent, emitting blue light by mechanical stimulus. In this study in Triconica conifera, we identified the presence of luciferase activity to coelenterazine, a substrate for the bioluminescence in various marine taxa such as luminous cnidarians, fishes, and crustaceans including calanoid copepods. The molecular size estimated by gel&#8208;filtration chromatography and pH dependency of the luciferase activity were similar to those in calanoid copepods. On the other hand, the reaction rate and inhibitory effect by magnesium ion were much different between them. The presence of coelenterazine in the specimen was confirmed by LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS. Taken together with the phylogenetically distant relationship between Cyclopoida and Calanoida, our findings suggested that coelenterazine&#8208;dependent bioluminescence was evolved parallelly at least twice in copepod lineages.

         <title>Activation of Caged Functional RNAs by An Oxidative Transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sUrd) in place of uridine (Urd) can exhibit loss of function. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide can convert 2sUrd to Urd. We show that a 2sUrd&#8208;containing aptamer and ribozyme can exhibit recovery of function upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, allowing for redox&#8208;switched functional behavior.







Abstract
RNA exhibits remarkable capacity as a functional polymer, with broader catalytic and ligand&#8208;binding capability than previously thought. Despite this, the low side chain diversity present in nucleic acids (two purines and two pyrimidines) relative to proteins (20+ side chains of varied charge, polarity, and chemical functionality) limits the capacity of functional RNAs to act as environmentally responsive polymers, as is possible for peptide&#8208;based receptors and catalysts. Here we show that incorporation of the modified nucleobase 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sU) into functional (aptamer and ribozyme) RNAs produces functionally inactivated polymers that can be activated by oxidative treatment. 2&#8208;thiouridine lacksthe 2&#8208;position oxygen found in uridine, altering its hydrogen bonding pattern. This limits critical interactions (e.&#8201;g., G&#8722;U wobble pairs) that allow for proper folding. Oxidative desulfurization of the incorporated 2&#8208;thiouridine moieties to uridine relieves this inability to fold properly, enabling recovery of function. This demonstration of expanded roles for RNA as environmentally responsive functional polymers challenges the notion that they are not known to be redox&#8208;sensitive. Harnessing redox switchability in RNA could regulate cellular activities such as translation, or allow switching RNA between a &#8220;template&#8221; and a &#8220;catalytic&#8221; state in &#8220;RNA World&#8221; scenarios or in synthetic biology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA exhibits remarkable capacity as a functional polymer, with broader catalytic and ligand-binding capability than previously thought. Despite this, the low side chain diversity present in nucleic acids (two purines and two pyrimidines) relative to proteins (20+ side chains of varied charge, polarity, and chemical functionality) limits the capacity of functional RNAs to act as environmentally responsive polymers, as is possible for peptide-based receptors and catalysts. Here we show that incorporation of the modified nucleobase 2-thiouridine (2sU) into functional (aptamer and ribozyme) RNAs produces functionally inactivated polymers that can be activated by oxidative treatment. 2-thiouridine lacksthe 2-position oxygen found in uridine, altering its hydrogen bonding pattern. This limits critical interactions (e.&#8201;g., G&#8722;U wobble pairs) that allow for proper folding. Oxidative desulfurization of the incorporated 2-thiouridine moieties to uridine relieves this inability to fold properly, enabling recovery of function. This demonstration of expanded roles for RNA as environmentally responsive functional polymers challenges the notion that they are not known to be redox-sensitive. Harnessing redox switchability in RNA could regulate cellular activities such as translation, or allow switching RNA between a &#8220;template&#8221; and a &#8220;catalytic&#8221; state in &#8220;RNA World&#8221; scenarios or in synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Antibacterial Activity to Molecular Mechanism: Case Study of Hexapeptide RWWRWW and Its Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8208; and L&#8208;isomers of designed hexapeptides are studied. Sum frequency generation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that D&#8208;isomer forms aggregates via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing the capability to disrupt bacterial membrane; while L&#8208;isomers form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, enabling them to interact with and leading to effective disruption of the membrane.







Abstract
In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a potent weapon against the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Among AMPs, the ones containing tryptophan (W) and arginine (R) exhibit enhanced antimicrobial properties, benefiting from the unique physicochemical features of the two amino acids. Herein, we designed three hexapeptides, including WR, DWR (D&#8208;isomer), and RF, derived from the original sequence, RWWRWW&#8208;NH2 (RW). By combining sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG&#8208;VS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we examined AMPs&#8217; interactions with model bacterial membrane at the molecular level. Our findings revealed the innate different structural features associated with molecular aggregation and membrane activity between L&#8208;(WR, RF and RW) and D&#8208;isomer. The D&#8208;isomer was demonstrated to aggregate via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which reduced its membrane adsorption quantity and consequently weakened its disruptive effect on the model membrane; while L&#8208;isomers rarely aggregated and thus could fully interact with the model membrane. D&#8208;isomer was proven to lack a stable helical structure, while L&#8208;isomers adopted helical structures, which was believed to be the reason for DWR's tendency to aggregate easily. This study should contribute to designing novel short&#8208;chain AMPs with high efficiency, especially in the case that D&#8208;isomers will be used.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the C&#8208;Glycosylated Depside Arenicolin B</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenicolin B is a C&#8208;glucosylated depside assembled by a combination of highly&#8208;reducing (HRPKS) and non&#8208;reducing polyketide synthases (NRPKS) to afford the aglycone depside precursor. Depside bond formation is catalyzed by the NRPKS thioesterase (TE) domain. Tailoring by a C&#8208;glycosyltransferase selectively mono&#8208;glycosylates the depside to furnish arenicolin B.







Abstract
We uncovered the biosynthetic pathway of the C&#8208;glycosylated depside arenicolin B from Phialomyces arenicola through genome mining, heterologous reconstitution and biochemical characterization. The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of arenicolin B is comprised of a HRPKS, a NRPKS, and a C&#8208;glycosyltransferase. Through biochemical dissection and evaluation, we demonstrate the NRPKS thioesterase (TE) domain catalyses depside formation.

         <title>Structural Study of DNA in Simulated Crowded Fluids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short, double stranded DNA shows similar synchrotron radiation circular dichroism profiles in dilute buffers and in crowded solutions containing polyethylene glycol (10,000) and sucrose. On one hand, DNA duplexes are stabilized by polyethylene glycol, on the other hand, DNA strand exchange is promoted by polyethylene glycol, but not by sucrose.







Abstract
This work studied the structure and hybridization properties of DNA in simulated crowded media containing polyethylene glycol 10,000 and sucrose. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism revealed that the overall CD profiles of a 21&#8208;mer and a d(CG)9 duplex remain similar in the simulated crowded fluids compared with those in Tris buffer, but the amplitude ratios of individual maxima and minima vary with the concentration of DNA and the media, suggesting possible conformational changes. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, this work confirmed that hairpin and duplex formations are not affected by the crowding condition. On the other hand, the duplex dynamics is affected by the crowding condition, where strand exchanges were promoted by the presence of PEG, but unaffected by sucrose.

         <title>Structural and Functional Information of Human Hemoglobin Subunit &#956;</title>

Hb subunit: The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human subunit &#956; C49S/C104S mutant was determined, which adopts the typical protein fold of globins, whereas the distal Met62 is self&#8208;oxidized to the sulfoxide form (Met&#8208;SO).







Abstract
The human hemoglobin subunit &#956; (Hb&#8208;&#956;) has been identified as a potential biomarker for &#945;&#8208;thalassemia. However, little structural and functional information is available for this subunit. Here, we have overexpressed and purified a double mutant of C49S/C104S Hb&#8208;&#956; and solved its X&#8208;ray crystal structure. It adopts a typical protein fold of the globins, similar to that of the &#945;&#8208;subunit. The structure also reveals that the protein undergoes self&#8208;oxidation of Met62 in the heme distal site, producing the form of sulfoxide (Met&#8208;SO). The property and function have also been studied by spectroscopy, which shows that the protein has considerable peroxidase activity due to the presence of a catalytic His&#8208;Arg pair in the heme distal site. The structure&#8208;function relationship of Hb&#8208;&#956; obtained in this study may provide useful insights into Hb&#8208;related diseases.

         <dc:description>
Upon photo&#8208;irradiation, homobifunctional photocaged 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dials (bis&#8208;PBDAs) react with amine&#8208;rich biomolecules to form stable, well&#8208;defined crosslinks. In addition to their use in biopolymer preparation, bis&#8208;PBDAs facilitate effective cell fixation without significantly altering cellular morphology or interfering with biochemical analyses, such as protein/mRNA extraction and immunofluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Crosslinking amine&#8208;rich biomolecules with aldehydes, such as paraformaldehyde (PFA) and glutaraldehyde (GA), is a widely used method for biomaterial fabrication and cell fixation. In this study, we introduce homobifunctional photocaged 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dials (bis&#8208;PBDAs) as novel amine&#8208;reactive photo&#8208;crosslinkers. Compared to PFA and GA, bis&#8208;PBDAs are inherently less toxic. Upon photo&#8208;deprotection, bis&#8208;PBDAs efficiently react with the amino groups of biomolecules, such as carboxymethyl chitosan and histone H3, forming stable, well&#8208;defined crosslinks. Even at low concentrations (~100&#8197;&#956;M), bis&#8208;PBDAs facilitate effective cell fixation without significantly altering cellular morphology or interfering with biochemical analyses, including protein/mRNA extraction and immunofluorescence imaging. Therefore, bis&#8208;PBDAs are promising reagents for crosslinking amine&#8208;rich biopolymers and hold great potential in biomaterial fabrication and the fixation of living cells and tissues.

     alt="Homobifunctional Photocaged 2-Butene-1,4-dials (bis-PBDAs) as Amino-Reactive Photo-Crosslinkers for Biomaterial Fabrication and Cell Fixation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon photo-irradiation, homobifunctional photocaged 2-butene-1,4-dials (bis-PBDAs) react with amine-rich biomolecules to form stable, well-defined crosslinks. In addition to their use in biopolymer preparation, bis-PBDAs facilitate effective cell fixation without significantly altering cellular morphology or interfering with biochemical analyses, such as protein/mRNA extraction and immunofluorescence imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crosslinking amine-rich biomolecules with aldehydes, such as paraformaldehyde (PFA) and glutaraldehyde (GA), is a widely used method for biomaterial fabrication and cell fixation. In this study, we introduce homobifunctional photocaged 2-butene-1,4-dials (bis-PBDAs) as novel amine-reactive photo-crosslinkers. Compared to PFA and GA, bis-PBDAs are inherently less toxic. Upon photo-deprotection, bis-PBDAs efficiently react with the amino groups of biomolecules, such as carboxymethyl chitosan and histone H3, forming stable, well-defined crosslinks. Even at low concentrations (~100&#8197;&#956;M), bis-PBDAs facilitate effective cell fixation without significantly altering cellular morphology or interfering with biochemical analyses, including protein/mRNA extraction and immunofluorescence imaging. Therefore, bis-PBDAs are promising reagents for crosslinking amine-rich biopolymers and hold great potential in biomaterial fabrication and the fixation of living cells and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Modification of Native IgGs with Flexible Drug&#8208;Load</title>

ADC generation from native IgG: using short, positively charged peptides like RAK enables the direct modification of IgG at the glutamine Q295 without the need for engineering. Using azide&#8208; and thiol&#8208;group containing RAK, the generation of ADCs with different drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios (DARs) is demonstrated and their properties analyzed in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo.







Abstract
Homogeneous, site&#8208;specifically conjugated antibodies have shown to result in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with improved efficacy and tolerability compared to stochastically conjugated ADCs. However, precisely controlling the drug load as well as attaching multiple payload moieties to the antibody remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the simple and direct modification of native IgG&#8208;antibodies at the residue glutamine 295 (Q295) without the need for any protein engineering with flexible drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios of one or multiple payloads. The conjugation is enabled through short, positively charged lysine containing peptides and native, commercially available microbial transglutaminase. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, HER2&#8208;targeting ADCs based on trastuzumab were generated with drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios (DARs) of 2 and 4 of the same or different payloads using orthogonal conjugation chemistries. Quantitative biodistribution studies performed with 111In&#8208;radiolabeled conjugates showed high tumour uptake and low accumulation of radioactivity in non&#8208;targeted tissues. A single dose study of trastuzumab conjugated to the highly potent payload &#945;&#8208;Amanitin demonstrated complete and long&#8208;lasting tumour remission and was well&#8208;tolerated at all dose levels tested.

         <title>Unraveling the Molecular Basis for G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binders to ALS/FTD&#8208;Associated G4C2 Repeats of the C9orf72 Gene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some neurodegenerative disorders can be driven by recurrent mutations in the C9orf72 gene. These sequences can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex secondary structures. Here, by performing in silico investigations coupled with FRET DNA melting assays, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of organic and organometallic C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders.







Abstract
The most recurrent familial cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the presence of an abnormal number of intronic GGGGCC (G4C2) repetitions in the C9orf72 gene, which has been proposed to drive ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that such G4C2 repetitions can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary structures. These G4s have been selectively stabilized by small&#8208;molecule binders, furnishing proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that targeting these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid sequences represents a novel and effective therapeutic strategy to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. However, precise information on the mechanism of action of these compounds is still lacking. Here, by performing in silico investigations, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of known structurally related C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders. Moreover, we investigated the binding properties of a strong and selective metal&#8208;based G4 stabilizer, the AuI bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex &#8211; Au(TMX)2 &#8211; showing that it moderately stabilizes G4C2 G4 RNA by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) DNA melting assays. Using metadynamics (metaD) simulations, the Au(TMX)2 binding mode and the associated free&#8208;energy landscape were also evaluated. This information paves the way for developing improved compounds to tackle ALS/FTD neurodegenerative disorders.

         <title>Mutagenesis to Orient Conjugation and Preserve Self&#8208;adjuvant Properties of Flagellin in Conjugates</title>

Guide to control: Rational replacement of surface&#8208;exposed residues of flagellin with cysteines directs conjugation to specific residues while preserving the critical TLR5 binding domains D0 and D1 and potentiates the use of flagellin as self&#8208;adjuvanting carrier in conjugate vaccines.







Abstract
Bacterial flagellins are unique for their capacity to activate both the innate and the adaptive immune response through a Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 (TLR5) signaling cascade. Used as a carrier protein in conjugate vaccines, it is crucial to preserve their self&#8208;adjuvant properties during the conjugation step. Considering the absence of cysteine in the Salmonella enterica flagellin FliC sequence, we have investigated the impact of five mutations (A2&#8197;C, K180&#8197;C, T240&#8197;C, D251&#8197;C and S306&#8197;C) alone or in combination on TLR5 activation. The FliC mutated at the four positions K180&#8197;C, T240&#8197;C, D251&#8197;C and S306&#8197;C displayed much the same activity as native flagellin whether the cysteine residues were free or conjugated. These results pave the way for the preparation of self&#8208;adjuvanting conjugate vaccines based on cysteine&#8208;mutated FliC as a carrier protein.

         <title>Copper Depletion in Tumors Boosts Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increased levels of copper are associated with promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion. In this article, we highlight an innovative and effective approach to enhance immunotherapies for neuroblastoma patients using copper chelation as an adjunct therapy. Copper chelation may be a promising adjunct therapy for cancer treatment by altering the tumor microenvironment, making cancer cells more vulnerable.







Abstract
Copper depletion is being billed as a viable approach for cancer treatment. Vittorio and co&#8208;workers successfully demonstrated that Cuprior, an FDA&#8208;approved drug that binds with copper, effectively enhances anti&#8208;GD2 immunotherapy and improves the responses for neuroblastoma patients. These findings highlight the important role of copper chelation in modulating the tumor microenvironment. This study presented a novel approach to potentiate immunotherapies for neuroblastoma patients, warranting further investigations into copper depletion as a potential adjuvant therapy for other tumors.

         <title>Nanomaterial&#8208;Enhanced Red Blood Cell Biopreservation: From Refrigeration to Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are crucial in clinical and military medicine, but preservation is challenged by storage&#8208;induced damage. Traditional methods have limited effectiveness, while nanomaterials offer a promising alternative. This review examines storage and cryolesions, evaluates nanomaterials&#8217; potential to mitigate damage, and discusses key challenges in improving RBC biopreservation strategies.







Abstract
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions represent a cornerstone of clinical practice, with RBCs constituting the primary component in transfusion therapy. Extending the preservation of RBCs while maintaining their functional integrity would offer considerable advancements for both transfusion medicine and military healthcare. Despite decades of research, progress in achieving long&#8208;term RBC preservation has been limited. A key challenge is the range of physical and biochemical damage RBCs incur during storage, leading to marked changes in their morphology, physiological function, and viability. While traditional preservation techniques have provided partial mitigation of these damages, their efficacy remains suboptimal. In contrast, nanomaterials, with their distinctive spatial architectures and surface properties, offer a promising avenue for minimizing storage&#8208;related damage and extending RBC preservation. This review provides an overview of the major categories of damage encountered during RBC biopreservation, classified into storage lesions and cryolesions. We also highlight the key role of nanomaterials in enhancing the storage quality of RBCs and prolonging their preservation duration. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and pressing issues faced by nanomaterial&#8208;based RBCs biopreservation.

         <title>Oligomerization of STING and Chemical Regulatory Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights strategies for regulating STING oligomerization, including agonists targeting the C&#8208;terminal cytoplasmic domain (CTD) and the N&#8208;terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). From a mechanical perspective, they function via multi&#8208;interaction or by directly inducing oligomerization of STING.







Abstract
Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a crucial role in innate immunity. Upon the recognition of cytosolic dsDNA, STING undergoes several structural changes, with oligomerization playing a key role in initiating a cascade of immune responses. Therefore, controlling the STING pathway by manipulating STING oligomerization is a practical strategy. This review focuses on the detailed mechanism of STING oligomerization, highlighting its decisive role. It also describes oligomerization&#8208;based strategies to regulate STING protein, such as the use of small&#8208;molecule agonists and biomacromolecules, highlighting their interaction modes and potential therapeutic applications. This knowledge may lead to the development of innovative approaches for treating cancer and immune disorders.

         <title>Vanadium Complexes for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This highlight covers recent advances in mitochondria&#8208;targeted vanadium complexes for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in cancer treatment. These complexes demonstrate selective in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity toward cancer cells without harming the normal cells. This review combines stable vanadium complexes with their ROS generation and DNA crosslinking capabilities, this work opening the way for translational research and future clinical applications in targeted cancer therapies.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based drugs have the potential to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy by exhibiting key properties such as appropriate charge, thermodynamic stability, hydrolytic stability, oral bioavailability, and dual functional capability. These properties are critical for effective intracellular uptake, as drugs or prodrugs must cross cellular membranes to target specific organelles like mitochondria, essential for maximizing therapeutic impact. Bio&#8208;essential metal ions such as copper, zinc, and iron are transported through specialized active channels, whereas others depend on passive diffusion to enter cells. Vanadium has gained significant attention in research because of its remarkable coordination flexibility, lipid&#8208;lowering characteristics, and potential anticancer effects. The coordination flexibility of vanadium has led to its investigation in pharmaceuticals, given its demonstrated insulin&#8208;mimetic effects, lipid&#8208;lowering properties, and promising antitumor activities. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a targeted cancer treatment approach through light&#8208;activated compounds that selectively generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cell death. Among metal&#8208;based photosensitizers, vanadium complexes are emerging as effective agents due to their unique redox properties and known biological activity. This minireview explores mitochondria&#8208;targeting vanadium complexes within PDT. Mitochondria serve as an ideal ROS generation site, triggering apoptosis while minimizing damage to healthy cells. We examine key strategies in designing vanadium complexes that enhance mitochondrial localization, photodynamic efficiency, and cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. This review highlights the challenges like photostability and selective targeting, and future directions for advancing vanadium&#8208;based photosensitizers as next&#8208;generation PDT cancer therapies.

This review explores the transformative integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems for biosensing and therapeutic applications. It covers advances in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, detailing synthesis methods, functional classifications, and applications in detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Emphasis is placed on the unique synergies between DNA and nanomaterials, addressing challenges, and forecasting future opportunities in precision medicine.







Abstract
The integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems has emerged as a transformative approach in biosensing and therapeutic applications. Unique features of DNA, like its programmability and specificity, complement the diverse functions of nanomaterials, leading to the creation of advanced systems for detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Here, we review the developments in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, emphasizing their enhanced functionalities and potential across various biomedical applications. We first discuss the methodologies for synthesizing these conjugates, distinguishing between covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. We then categorize DNA&#8208;nanomaterials conjugates based on the properties of the DNA and nanomaterials involved, respectively. DNA probes are classified by their application into biosensing or therapeutic uses, and, several nanomaterials are highlighted by their recent progress in living biological. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field, anticipating that significant progress in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates will greatly enhance precision medicine.

         <title>The History of Studies on Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a detailed overview of the development of oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis. By summarizing these developments, we hope that this review will provide comprehensive and valuable insights into oxetane formation in the biosynthesis of paclitaxel and will be useful for metabolic engineering of paclitaxel in the future.







Abstract
There is no doubt that breakthroughs in the enzyme&#8208;mediated formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis constitute significant milestones in the biosynthesis of complex natural products. In this review, we summarize the understanding of the biosynthesis of the oxetane ring of paclitaxel from different viewpoints. Generally, it covers five aspects, (1)&#8197;a different understanding of the mechanistic formation of the oxetane ring on the basis of sound chemical reasoning, (2)&#8197;a reasonable speculation of the biosynthetic pathways and suitable surrogate substrates for oxetane ring formation based on the natural and chemical logical analysis, (3)&#8197;Taxus genome&#8208;enabled enzymes identification, (4)&#8197;the discovery of different enzymes that mediate oxetane ring formation, and (5)&#8197;a mechanistic investigation involving the use of isotopic labelling experiments and quantum chemical calculations. This review provides a detailed overview of the history of the studies on the oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis, which may be useful for a better understanding this process in combined view of nature, chemistry and biology logics, also for efficient heterologous reconstruction of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway in the future.

         <title>Strategies to Enhance the Therapeutic Efficacy of GLP&#8208;1 Receptor Agonists through Structural Modification and Carrier Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article briefly introduces several common GLP&#8208;1RAs and their limitations. Taking exendin&#8208;4 as an example, it focuses on the research progress of improving bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy based on structural modification and carrier delivery strategies, aiming to provide reference for the development of new GLP&#8208;1RAs treatment systems.







Abstract
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient endogenous insulin production or impaired sensitivity to insulin. In recent years, a class of incretin&#8208;based hypoglycemic drugs, glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs), have attracted great attention in the management of type&#8197;2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their benefits, including stable glycemic control ability, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction for patients. However, like other peptide drugs, GLP&#8208;1RAs face challenges such as instability, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and immunogenicity, which severely limit their clinical application. In recent years, various strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of GLP&#8208;1RAs, including structural modification and carrier&#8208;mediated delivery. This article briefly introduces the research and application status of several common GLP&#8208;1RAs and their limitations. Taking exendin&#8208;4 as an example, we focus on the research progress of improving bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy based on structural modification and carrier delivery strategies, aiming to provide reference for the development of new GLP&#8208;1RAs treatment systems.

         <title>Advances in Drug Delivery Systems for Atopic Dermatitis Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. AD is incurable and prone to recurrence, and the treatment options are limited, we systematically summarize the current common drug delivery systems (DDS) such as liposomes, hydrogels, and nanoparticles, as well as the design of these drug delivery systems for the treatment of AD, the mechanism of the treatment process, and the advantages compared to traditional therapies.







Abstract
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus and impaired skin barrier function. Advances in drug delivery systems have transformed AD treatment by enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Drug delivery systems such as liposomes, hydrogels, and microneedles enable deeper skin penetration, prolonged drug retention, and controlled release, reducing side effects and treatment frequency. Liposomes improve drug absorption and stability, while hydrogels offer high water content and responsive drug release. Microneedles facilitate painless, localized drug delivery, enhancing patient compliance. These systems address the limitations of traditional therapies like topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants, which are associated with adverse effects and poor patient adherence. Recent innovations include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics targeting immune pathways, demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing inflammation and symptoms. Drug delivery systems offer a safer, more efficient alternative for delivering these advanced therapies. By improving therapeutic outcomes and patient experience, drug delivery systems represent a crucial advancement in AD management.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 8, April 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
mFNA, a novel nanomaterial that combines the self&#8208;assembly precision of FNAs with the stability of metal nanomaterials, hold great potential in fields such as biomedicine, chemical sensing, materials science, and energy conversion. This article is the first to define &#8220;metal&#8208;framework nucleic acids,&#8221; exploring their construction methods and functional characteristics, while also providing a forward&#8208;looking analysis of research challenges and future trends, offering readers a comprehensive perspective on this field.







Abstract
Based on the Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing principle, precisely programmable metal&#8208;framework nucleic acids (mFNA) have evolved from one&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale structures, a technological advancement attributed to progress in DNA nanotechnology. mFNA are a new type of nanomaterial formed by using framework nucleic acids (FNAs) as precise templates to guide the ordered assembly and self&#8208;assembly of metal ions, metal salts (such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, etc.), metal nanoclusters, metal nanoparticles, or metal oxide nanoparticles. Compared to traditional FNAs, mFNA not only inherits the powerful programmed self&#8208;assembly capabilities of nucleic acids but also incorporates the unique physicochemical properties of inorganic metal nanomaterials. This intersection of organic and inorganic chemistry presents broad application prospects in fields such as biology, chemistry, materials science, and energy science. This review, based on the principles related to FNAs, introduces the concept of mFNA for the first time, aiming to explore the fundamental connections between nanoscale FNAs and metal materials. Additionally, the article focuses on the construction methods and functional characteristics of mFNA. Finally, the current challenges faced by mFNA are reviewed, and their future development is anticipated, providing detailed information for a comprehensive understanding of the research progress in mFNA.

         <title>Induction and Manipulation of Biomolecular Condensates Through Spatially Heterogeneous Solution Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article, it is discussed how spatial control over the formation and movement of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) can be achieved and how this type of control can help in the reliable generation and study of BMCs. Spatial control over BMCs is crucial in&#8201;vivo and therefore also desirable for in&#8201;vitro studies in order to approach relevant scenarios.

The study of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) is of great current interest because of the proposed roles of these types of assemblies in biological function and disease. In living cells, BMCs form in a highly heterogeneous environment and are influenced by concentration gradients of various relevant species. Furthermore, the biological functionality of the BMCs requires precise spatial control of their formation in some cases. In recent years, a number of in&#8201;vitro experimental approaches have emerged that allow the generation, study, and manipulation of BMCs through the creation of well&#8208;defined spatially heterogeneous solution conditions relevant for BMC formation. In this concept article, it is presented in what way such methods can contribute to improved understanding and control of BMCs.

         <title>Inhibition of Surfactin Biosynthesis in Bacillus Subtilis Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Adenylation Domain Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;based adenylation domain inhibitors with the modification of 2&#8242;&#8208;OH in the adenosine skeleton are synthesized. Coupled with affinity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), their activities toward surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in Bacillus subtilis are evaluated. Finally, the ability of inhibiting the production of surfactin in the bacterial cells is confirmed.

Several natural bacterial virulence factors are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, NRPSs producing such natural products have emerged as attractive antibiotic targets. N&#8208;(aminoacyl)sulfamoyladenosine (aminoacyl&#8208;AMS) derivatives with chemical modifications at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group of the adenosine skeleton are previously reported that inhibit NRPS amino acid adenylation (A) domains in recombinant enzyme systems, cellular lysates, and bacterial cells. The introduction of a couple of functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group preserves the binding affinity toward NRPS amino acid A&#8208;domains and improves cell permeability of the AMS scaffold. However, the effects of these compounds on secondary metabolism have not yet been explored. In this study, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) probe, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne, is validated for in&#8208;cell applications, including imaging of NRPS activities in bacteria. Next, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives incorporating methyl, benzyl, and cyanomethyl functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group are synthesized and their inhibitory activity toward intracellular surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in the surfactin&#8208;producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 are investigated using the AfBPP probe. Finally, the attenuation of surfactin production using a Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne probe and L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives in B. subtilis is demonstrated. These results indicate that chemical modifications at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group provide a way to develop cell&#8208;permeable and functional NRPS A&#8208;domain inhibitors.

         <title>Structure&#8208;affinity relationship analysis and affinity maturation of a calprotectin&#8208;binding peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide 3 is an 18&#8208;amino acid linear peptide binding with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity to the inflammation marker calprotectin. Its application in point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic assays has shown promising results, yet improving its affinity for calprotectin could facilitate the development of sensitive and robust assays. Herein we report a detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship analysis of Peptide 3 to better understand the importance of each individual amino acid for the binding to calprotectin. Moreover, we have followed two different approaches, one based on prolonging the peptide with random sequences and phage display selection, and one on screening chemically synthesized peptide variants containing non&#8208;canonical amino acids, to increase its binding affinity. Combining several mutations that enhance affinity by small factors yielded Peptide 4 binding human calprotectin with a KD of 39 &#177; 5 nM measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, which is a 5&#8208;fold improvement compared to the previously reported Peptide 3.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipid Metabolism and Immune Function: Chemical Tools for Insights into T&#8208;Cell Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores how lipids regulate immune responses, particularly in T&#8208;cell function. Advances in metabolomics and proteomics provide insights into lipid&#8208;mediated immunity. Fluorescent lipids enable single&#8208;cell analysis of lipid uptake and metabolism. Click chemistry offers a precise method to track lipid dynamics, overcoming traditional limitations and expanding therapeutic possibilities for immune&#8208;related diseases.

Lipids are essential biomolecules playing critical roles in cellular processes, including energy storage, membrane structure, and signaling. This review highlights the chemical tools that have been developed to study the role of lipid metabolism in immune function, focusing on T&#8208;cell biology. Fatty acids (FAs), as core lipid components, influence immune responses through structural, signaling, and metabolic roles. Recent studies reveal how specific FAs modulate T&#8208;cell activation, proliferation, and function, with implications for regulatory and effector subsets. Emerging tools, such as fluorescence&#8208;based lipids and click chemistry, enable precise tracking of lipid uptake and metabolism at the single&#8208;cell level, addressing limitations of traditional bulk methods. Advances in metabolomics and proteomics offer further insights into lipid&#8208;mediated immune regulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides opportunities to target lipid metabolism in therapeutic strategies for cancer and other immune&#8208;related diseases. The integration of lipidomic technologies into immunology uncovers novel perspectives on how lipids shape immune responses at cellular and molecular scales.

         <title>Phase Separation in Biological Systems: Implications for Disease Pathogenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase separation in biological systems is discussed in various aspects including mechanisms involving various biomolecules, molecular complexes, and at cellular and organism level. Further, technologies to study phase separation, its implications in biological physiology, and diseases mechanisms and progression are discussions along with the potential targets and future therapeutics to probe and program phase separation in biological systems.

Phase separation is the phenomenon where distinct liquid phases, within solution, play a critical role in the organization and function of biomolecular condensates within cells. Dysregulation of phase separation has been implicated, which can be witnessed in various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of phase separation in disease pathogenesis, which focuses on single amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Molecular mechanisms underlying phase separation are also discussed with specific examples of diseases associated with dysregulated phase separation. Furthermore, consideration of therapeutic strategies targeting phase separation for disease intervention is explored.

         <title>Purine Chemistry in the Early RNA World at the Origins of Life: From RNA and Nucleobases Lesions to Current Key Metabolic Routes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the nascent processes of the beginnings and evolution of life, nucleobases and especially purines, ribonucleos(t)ides and primitive RNAs have been continuously modified. A RNA&#8208;peptide world and key metabolic pathways probably have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications resulting from adenine deamination, purine alkylation and, acylation from amino acids, purine ring&#8208;opening reactions and rearrangements, RNA depurination and abasic site formation.

In early life, RNA probably played the central role and, in the corresponding RNA world, the main produced amino acids and small peptides had to react continuously with RNA, ribonucleos(t)ides and nucleobases, especially with purines. A RNA&#8208;peptide world and key metabolic pathways have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications such as the translation process performed by the ribosome. Some interesting reactions of the purine bicycle and of the corresponding ribonucleos(t)ides are performed under plausible prebiotic conditions and described RNA chemical lesions are reviewed with the prospect to highlight their connection with some major steps of the purine and histidine biosynthetic pathways that are, in an intriguingly way, related through two key metabolites, adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate and the imidazole ribonucleotide 5&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide ribonucleotide. Ring&#8208;opening reactions of purines stand out as efficient accesses to imidazole ribonucleotides and to formamidopyrimidine (Fapy) ribonucleotides suggesting that biosynthetic pathway&#8217; first steps have emerged from RNA and ribonucleos(t)ide damages. Also, are summarized the works on the formation and catalytic properties, under plausible prebiotic conditions, of N6&#8208;derivatives of the purine base adenine as potential surrogates of histidine in catalysis accordingly to their structural relationship.

         <title>Sulfur(IV) Chemistry Based Peptide and Protein Late&#8208;Stage Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of precise and controllable chemical modification tools for peptides and proteins represents a great challenge in elucidating their structure&#8208;activity relationships and regulatory mechanisms, as well as a powerful driver for advancing macromolecular therapeutic strategies. However, current technologies predominantly rely on irreversible covalent labeling or genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids, exhibiting significant limitations in reversible modification, in situ functional regulation, and adaptability to complex physiological environments. In recent years, breakthrough advancements in sulfur(IV) chemistry have provided a novel paradigm for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins. Through synergistic innovations in sulfur(IV)&#8208;based reagent design, intermediate modulation, and bioorthogonal reactions, a more multifaceted modification toolbox has been progressively established, integrating site selectivity, condition responsiveness, and functional rescue. Providing current challenges and future perspectives in this field, this review focuses on sulfur(IV) chemistry&#8208;driven strategies for peptide and protein modification, as well as their applications in proximity&#8208;labeling strategies and drug delivery/therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Styryl Dye Complexes for Fluorescent Recognition of DNA and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recognition properties in solution and in cancer cells: a two dicationic cyanine dyes with different functionalities were developed and studied for their fluorescent properties, cytotoxicity and cellular imaging. The effect of encapsulation was checked using synthetic molecular container of cucurbit[7]uril. Two cancer lines were used for staining living and fixed cells.







Abstract
This paper focused on the DNA&#8208;binding properties of novel dicationic cyanine dyes, in which pyridinium centers are linked by bridges of different functionalities. We found that dye 1, bearing a flexible butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylpyridinium terminal fragment, has the ability to bind to the DNA groove. The attachment of a quite rigid para&#8208;xylylene&#8208;4&#8208;methylpyridinium unit as a terminal group in dye 2 contributed to dual DNA&#8208;binding modes: intercalation and groove binding. We tested the encapsulation ability and the effect on the dye&#8208;DNA binding mode by using a synthetic molecular container such as CB[7]. Unexpectedly, monitoring dye&#8208;DNA interaction in the presence of CB[7] revealed that dye molecules partially remain in DNA frameworks, even though they had a higher affinity towards CB[7]. In the case of dye 1, the transformation of dimeric forms to the left&#8208;handed aggregates to yield a ternary system CB[7]&#8208;dye&#8208;DNA occurred. As for dye 2, reversibility of intercalation and a slight right&#8208;handed aggregation templated by DNA are observed. A cytotoxicity and ability of dyes to stain the living cells in their free and encapsulated forms have been investigated. These findings provide useful information about ligand&#8211;DNA interactions, which are valuable for the rational design of drug delivery systems and platforms for cellular imaging and therapy.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Postlabeling Reveals Nuclear Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Half&#8208;Sandwich Ir(III) Tetrazine Complex in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the synthesis of five tetrazine&#8208;coordinated, half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes and extensively describe their reactivity. Live cell fluorescent bioorthogonal labeling reveals the nuclear tropism of the most cytotoxic complex.

Intracellular imaging of anticancer metallodrugs often relies on prelabeling with organic fluorophores, which significantly affects their physicochemical properties and intracellular distribution. On the other hand, the reported postlabeling strategies based on click&#8208;chemistry reactions require cell fixation and permeabilization. Here, this study presents a postlabeling approach based on the catalyst&#8208;free, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (iEDDA) between a strained fluorescein&#8208;tagged bicyclononyne derivative (BCN&#8208;FAM) and half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes containing bidentate ligands comprising a tetrazine (Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;) entity. Five half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes with formula [Cp*Ir(Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;)Cl]0/+ have been synthesized and fully characterized, including the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of three of the five derivatives. Investigations of their stability and their reactivity in aqueous solution and in a model iEDDA reaction reveal the strong influence of the tetrazine ligand structure on the chemical properties of the corresponding complexes. A highly cytotoxic metallodrug candidate (Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me) is identified from biological studies, and chemical reactivity studies disclose an unusual preference for binding of methionine over cysteine. Postlabeling of Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me in live HeLa cells highlights its preferential accumulation within the nucleus, suggesting its retention through covalent modifications of nuclear proteins in good agreement with other half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes.

         <title>Leaf&#8208;Like Nanostructures Self&#8208;Assembled by Silver&#8208;Coordinated Photosensitizers as Collaborative Antimicrobial Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel approach to combat bacterial infections in wounds using self&#8208;assembled leaflike nanostructures. These structures, formed by coordination between the photosensitizers Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;mPy and silver ions, combine the antibacterial properties of silver with photoinduced singlet oxygen generation to enhance wound healing.

This research introduces an innovative approach to addressing bacterial infections in wounds using leaflike nanostructures, which are self&#8208;assembled via coordination between the photosensitizer phenylcarbazole&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;f]benzotriazole&#8208;m&#8208;pyridine and silver ions. These nanostructures combine photosensitizer&#8208;generated singlet oxygen with silver's antibacterial effects, synergistically promoting wound healing. When incorporated into a Carbopol 941 hydrogel matrix, these nanostructures achieve near&#8208;total bacterial eradication (0.04% survival) while accelerating wound healing and tissue regeneration in a mouse model. This dual&#8208;functional mechanism allows the nanostructures to perform exceptionally well against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, even in biofilm environments, where conventional strategies solely on individual components often fail.

         <title>Identification of Endogenous Sequences Interacting with METTL3/METTL14 RNA Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endogenous RNA sequences interacting with METTL3/METTL14 RNA methyltransferases (MTD3/14) are identified using RNA&#8208;capturing microsphere particles (R&#8208;CAMPs) that immobilize RNA fragments derived from the endogenous RNAs of human cells. Potential G&#8208;quadruplex sequences are isolated as binding targets and are preferentially methylated by MTD3/14, indicating a strong relationship between RNA modification and RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structure.

N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification in mRNA and regulates various biological processes. The RNA&#8208;binding properties of m6A writer proteins play an important role in determining RNA modification sites. METTL3 and METTL14 form the core of the m6A writer complex, with METTL3 as the catalytic methyltransferase and METTL14 as the RNA&#8208;binding scaffold. Thus far, the comprehensive RNA&#8208;binding properties of METTL3/14 remain unknown. Using RNA&#8208;capturing microsphere particles (R&#8208;CAMPs), immobilizing RNA fragments derived from endogenous RNAs of human lung carcinoma cells, RNA fragments that interacted with the METTL3/14 methyltransferase domain are isolated. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that the pool of isolated sequences contains significantly more regions with the potential to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rG4s) than the randomly extracted RNA sequence pool and that the (GGA) repeat sequences are most enriched. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, gel mobility shift assays, and methylation experiments demonstrate that METTL3/14 binds to RNA sequences containing (GGA) repeats that form rG4 structure much stronger than RNAs that do not form rG4s. This study shows the potential of RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures as a modulator of epitranscriptomic modification of m6As.

         <title>Tuning Tetrazine Substituents to Enhance Vinyltetrazine Labeling Performance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;position&#8208;modified vinyltetrazines are thiol&#8208;specific reagents for precision biomedicine. Six derivatives show tunable thiol&#8208;labeling (k2&#8201;=&#8201;17.7&#8211;227&#8201;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1) and rapid bioorthogonal kinetics (k2&#8201;=&#8201;1.4&#8211;5.7&#8201;&#215;&#8201;103&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). High peptide labeling yields (88%&#8211;99%), serum/reduced glutathione&#160;stability, improved cellular uptake via charge/lipophilicity optimization, pretargeted cell imaging, and radionuclide labeling are achieved.

The site&#8208;specific labeling of peptides and proteins is a powerful tool for investigating biological processes. It is demonstrated that the powerful thiol&#8208;specific labeling reagent vinyltetrazine activates prodrugs and enables 18F and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;modality imaging. It is predicted that substitutions at the 3&#8208;position of tetrazine can affect the labeling efficiency, bioorthogonal kinetics, and stability. Six vinyltetrazines with different 3&#8208;position modifications exhibit rapid labeling and, subsequently, bioorthogonal kinetics and excellent stability. Vinyltetrazine labeling modifies the charge characteristics and lipophilicity of target peptides, thereby improving cellular uptake. This research on tuning tetrazine substituents will aid in the construction of a comprehensive vinyltetrazine library, leading to the development of new peptide conjugates and pretargeted immuno&#8208;positron emission tomography (immune&#8208;PET) imaging.

         <title>Diversity Of ThDP&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Forming Chiral Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes are well known biocatalysts for C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. While this enzyme class is mainly investigated for the formation of acyloins of secondary alcohols, recent studies have expanded its scope to utilize ketones as electrophiles in asymmetric carboligation reactions for the formation of tertiary alcohols. Chiral tertiary alcohols are ubiquitous motifs in natural products and important building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive compounds. ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes are emerging as one of the most promising classes of biocatalysts for synthesizing a wide range of products due to the variety of possible substrate combinations, accessible starting materials, high enantioselectivity, and advantageous self&#8208;regeneration of the catalytic ThDP cofactor. This review provides an overview of the tertiary alcohol&#8208;forming ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, focusing on the substrate scope, diversity of physiological functions, and future perspectives. Of nine superfamilies of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, three (decarboxylases, DC; transketolases, TK; &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase superfamily 2, &#945;KADH2) are known to use ketones as acceptor substrates. It is unknown whether other superfamilies of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes hold similar potential. Inspired by nature, an even broader diversity of classes and substrate specificities is expected in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Cholane&#8211;Phenanthrene&#8211;Cholane Trimers for Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of phosphodiester&#8208;linked cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers is described. The morphology of the formed nanostructures depends on the phenanthrene isomer used and on the cooling rate during the assembly process leading to nanosheets, worm&#8208;like structures, or nanotubes. Doping with pyrene results in a strong increase in the quantum yield, demonstrating the potential of these assemblies as artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems.

The self&#8208;assembly of two isomeric amphiphilic cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers and the light&#8208;harvesting properties of the formed supramolecular assemblies in aqueous medium are presented. Distinct differences in the supramolecular nanostructures are observed based on the type of phenanthrene isomer used, as well as on the cooling rate applied during the thermal self&#8208;assembly process. A fast cooling rate results in the formation of 2D objects (nanosheets) with both trimers. In contrast, a slow cooling process results in the observation of 3D objects, with worm&#8208;like nanostructures for the self&#8208;assembled 3,6&#8208;disubstituted phenanthrene trimer and nanotubes for the 2,7&#8208;isomer. Upon doping with an acceptor chromophore, the supramolecular phenanthrene assemblies demonstrate efficient energy transfer. The presence of small quantities (6%) of a pyrene acceptor results in a fivefold increase in the quantum yield compared to the phenanthrene trimer alone, highlighting their potential as artificial light&#8208;harvesting complexes. This work underscores the versatility of amphiphilic phenanthrene derivatives as building blocks for light&#8208;harvesting supramolecular systems.

&lt;p&gt;The self-assembly of phosphodiester-linked cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers is described. The morphology of the formed nanostructures depends on the phenanthrene isomer used and on the cooling rate during the assembly process leading to nanosheets, worm-like structures, or nanotubes. Doping with pyrene results in a strong increase in the quantum yield, demonstrating the potential of these assemblies as artificial light-harvesting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biochemical Characterization of Multimodular Xylanolytic Carbohydrate Esterases from the Marine Bacterium Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodular carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes often combine different catalytic activities for efficient polysaccharide degradation. In this work, the structural and functional characterization of three multimodular xylan&#8208;targeting esterases, Fl6, Fll1 and Fll4 from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48, are presented. Each protein shows novelty in its architecture, with particular emphasis on the enzyme Fll4, which consists of three esterase domains, resulting in bifunctional esterase activity.

Carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes) are critical for sustainable biomass utilization due to their ability to degrade complex polysaccharides. Frequently, a multimodularity can be observed combining several CAZyme domains and activities in close proximity which can benefit this degradation process. In this study, three multimodular xylanolytic carbohydrate esterases (CEs), named Fl6, Fll1, and Fll4, originating from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48 that represent a novel arrangement of catalytic and/or binding domains, are investigated. While Fl6 acts as a glucuronyl esterase, it also contains a carbohydrate binding module which is normally associated with xylanase activity. Fll1 combines xylosidase with acetylxylan esterase (AXE) activity mediated by a CE3 domain. The third enzyme, Fll4, is the first enzyme that comprises three distinct CE domains and shows bifunctional activity as an AXE and a feruloyl esterase (FAE). Investigation of the single domains reveals that the CE6 domain of Fll4 mediates its AXE activity while one of the putative CE1 domains, CE1a, mediates the FAE activity. This investigation of multimodularity of marine CAZymes not only enhances our understanding of these enzymes but may provide a promising route toward more efficient algal biomass utilization for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Dynamic G&#8208;Quadruplexes in the Rous Sarcoma Virus Genome: Scaffolds for Protein Interaction and Potential Anti&#8208;Viral Targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(A) The RSV&#8208;DNA contains three G4 elements characterised by CD&#8208;spectroscopy. (B) The CD data was analysed by PCA and SVD to identify the structural forms of these G4s. (C) These G4s are potential anti&#8208;viral targets as G4&#8208;specific small&#8208;molecule ligands recognise them. (D) Further, the importance of these G4s in the viral life cycle is established by their interaction with the host&#8208;protein nucleolin.







Abstract
Summarising the study, RSV is an important pathogen that causes oncogenic transformation in its host via the action of a protein kinase that it expresses. The RSV genome is reverse&#8208;transcribed into its complementary DNA, which then integrates into the host genome. This DNA thereafter serves as a template for transcription to manufacture viral proteins. The viral life cycle can, therefore, be inhibited if the functional elements of this DNA are altered. In this aspect, G4s may play an important role due to their involvement in hijacking the host machinery. Interestingly, the RSV&#8208;DNA contains multiple probable G4 forming elements, among which the sequences with the highest G4 forming propensity are located within the GAG and POL genes. Additionally, a sequence within the SRC oncogene also has G4 forming potential. In this study, we verified the G4 formation in these sequences via various biophysical assays. Further, the structural topology of these G4s has also been studied using computational and biophysical methods. We have established that GG4 forms a parallel G4 structure while PG4 and SG4 form highly dynamic G4s, switching between various structural forms. Such molecular switching behaviour may also aid in the functional properties of these G4s in&#8197;vivo. However, further studies are required to elucidate the functional properties of these elements. We have also analysed the binding of these G4s to specific small&#8208;molecule ligands and the structural changes induced by the binding of Braco&#8208;19 on the G4s. Finally, we have observed that the G4 forming sequences in the RSV&#8208;DNA are recognised and bound by human nucleolin, which is highly similar in structure to the chicken nucleolin. This suggests that the G4s in the RSV&#8208;DNA may be implicated in various biological functions. These studies conclude that G4s are formed in the RSV&#8208;DNA at multiple locations, and these G4s show molecular switching properties under physiological conditions. Further, these G4s are also bound by small&#8208;molecule ligands and proteins, which induce structural changes. Thus, these G4s may be targetable sites for the control of RSV infection.

         <title>Thermal Folding of Peptides into Single &#945;&#8208;Helical Turns</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single &#945;&#8208;helical turns (S&#945;HT) are biorelevant peptide structures with potential applications in drug design. We envisioned augmented applications for thermal folding (T&#8208;folding) S&#945;HT, wherein, a dynamic S&#945;HT in equilibrium with non&#8208;helical conformers can be biased to favor S&#945;HT by increasing the temperature. Short peptides cannot fold into native S&#945;HT due to large conformational entropy. Covalent hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) for the peptide H&#8208;bond have been designed to counter the entropy and enable such S&#945;HT folds. Here, HBS&#8208;constrained S&#945;HT are synthesized. NMR, CD spectral and computational analyses reveal their existence in a S&#945;HT conformer which is in equilibrium with non&#8208;helical conformers. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral analyses reveal their T&#8208;folding behaviour, the extent of which can be controlled by varying the number of C&#945;&#8208;substituents at the i+1st and i+2nd residues and solvent polarities. The conformational transition of the minor non&#8208;helical conformers to S&#945;HT with increasing temperature, is at the origin of T&#8208;folding. T&#8208;folding molecules can uniquely serve as therapeutics with thermally augmentable potencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Avoiding Misreading during Genetic Reprogramming in mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology, but the in&#8201;vitro translation system it uses to create screening libraries is imperfect. This study examines the prevalence of errors during in&#8201;vitro translation and provides best practices for avoiding such errors to researchers who are designing mRNA display libraries.

mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology. It takes advantage of a reconstituted in&#8201;vitro transcription and translation system to generate highly diverse affinity screening libraries. However, this process relies on the faithful translation of genetically encoded peptides, a conversion that is imperfect. Errors in translational decoding of mRNA can occur, decoupling the produced library from its genetic code. Because mRNA display affinity selections are analyzed with sequencing of the encoding DNA, rather than direct detection of the peptides, misreading silently reduces library diversity and complicates analysis. Herein, the presence of significant translational misreading during the production of mRNA display libraries is confirmed, best practices for genetic reprogramming are developed, and those rules are deployed to minimize the disconnect between genotype and phenotype in peptide affinity selections.

         <title>Engineering and Structural Elucidation of a Sac7d&#8208;Derived IgG Fc&#8208;Specific Affitin and Its Application for the Light&#8208;Controlled Affinity Purification of Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affitin derived from the Sac7d scaffold enables the light&#8208;controlled affinity purification of antibodies under physiological conditions, thus overcoming limitations of protein A chromatography. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and affinity measurements reveal complex formation with Fc at the CH2/CH3 junction, similar to protein A/G and FnRn. Combined with the light&#8208;responsive Azo&#8208;tag, this tiny adapter molecule opens new applications in antibody research.

While protein A affinity chromatography is widely established for antibody purification, the acidic elution conditions often lead to protein aggregation and deamidation. Here, an alternative approach is described for the purification of antibodies utilizing an engineered binding protein based on the archaebacterial Sac7d scaffold in combination with light&#8208;controlled &#945;&#8208;CD affinity chromatography (Excitography). Starting from a published affitin molecule, a monomeric protein version (C3A24) was engineered by substituting the unpaired thiol side chain Cys24 within the binding site by Ala, and, unexpectedly, its binding activity towards the human IgG1 Fc region was even improved (KD&#8201;=&#8201;76&#8201;nM). X&#8208;ray analysis of the cocrystallized C3A24 with a recombinant human Fc fragment revealed a 2:1 stoichiometry, with a binding site at the junction between the CH2 and CH3 domains. Interestingly, this binding site coincides with the ones of protein A, protein G, and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The affitin/Fc interaction is dominated by a network of hydrogen bonds, whereas, unpredicted by the initial affitin design, the two C&#8208;terminal Lys residues are also involved via a salt bridge and another hydrogen bond. Using the Azo&#8208;tagged C3A24, we purified clinically relevant antibodies from cell culture medium in a single step under physiological buffer conditions.

         <title>Mining Thermophile Genomes for New PETases with Exceptional Thermostabilities Using Sequence Similarity Networks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted genome mining identified thermostable enzymes (PETases) that hydrolyze the commonly used plastic polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Thermostable enzymes are identified from thermophilic microbial sources. Experimental results reveal enzymatic activity on authentic PET films, highlighting potential for industrial application. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of one PETase is solved to understand its exceptional thermostability. These findings pave the way for engineering catalysts for a circular PET economy.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a promising technology for advancing a circular PET economy. Several PET&#8208;degrading &#945;/&#946; hydrolases have been identified, but the full potential of this enzyme family to catalyze PET hydrolysis remains largely unexplored. To address this, sequence similarity networks are employed to investigate the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold&#8208;5 subfamily (IPR029059) for new PETases. Priority is given to sequences from thermophiles, as thermostable enzymes are likely more suitable for industrial applications. Ten enzymes with &#8776;20% sequence identity to the well&#8208;known LCC&#8208;PETase are identified, and seven are successfully overexpressed and purified for in vitro characterization. Each enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl butyrate, a mimic of trimeric PET, and emulsified PET nanoparticles. Notably, three enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing PET films. Novel PETases exhibit melting temperatures (Tm) exceeding 55&#8201;&#176;C and only modest losses of activity after incubation at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;h. The crystal structure of AroC (Tm&#8201;=&#8201;85&#8201;&#176;C) is resolved to 2.2&#8201;&#197;, revealing several salt bridges that likely confer thermostability, and a unique loop that is conserved among the PETases described here. These novel enzymes will enable engineering campaigns to generate thermostable and catalytically efficient PETases for use as industrial biocatalysts.

         <title>Artificial Lipidation of Antifungal Proteins and Antifungal Behavior: A Case Study with Cholesterylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antifungal behavior of artificial palmitoylated or cholesterylated chitinase domain is studied from biological, chemical, and physical properties, highlighting the importance of the chemical properties of the lipid moiety covalently attached to chitinase domain to obtain effective antifungal activity by artificial protein lipidation through a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;mediated reaction.

Lipid&#8208;based formulation of antifungal small drugs is used to mitigate drug toxicity while retaining effective antifungal activity. Herein, the effect of artificial cholesterylation of is studied, both of which were site&#8208;specifically modified using a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;reactive Q&#8208;tag (LysM&#8208;Q and CatD&#8208;Q). This produced protein&#8211;lipid conjugates (LysM&#8208;cholesteryl [Chol] or &#8208;palmitoyl [Pal] and CatD&#8208;Chol or &#8208;Pal). Although lipidation of these chitinase domains enhances the antifungal activity against Trichoderma viride, palmitoylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Pal and CatD&#8208;Pal) show stronger antifungal effects than cholesterylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Chol and CatD&#8208;Chol) both in the absence and presence of amphotericin B. Further characterization with lipidated LysM&#8208;fused green fluorescent protein (LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol) shows that the cholesterylation of proteins promotes distribution to dextran&#8208;rich phase in an aqueous two&#8208;phase system consisting of polyethylene glycol and dextran. Fluorescence microscopic analyses of the phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar vesicles reveal a distinct anchoring behavior between LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol to lipid membranes, which is possibly correlated with aggregate formation. These results highlight that the chemical properties of the lipid moiety are crucial to achieve effective enhancement of antifungal activity through artificial lipidation.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Gapmer Oligonucleotides Containing 4&#8242;&#8208;Carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;Carbamoyl&#8208;Thymidine Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs in the gap region are synthesized and evaluated. Derivatization of the ONs is performed via postsynthetic modification. The synthesized ONs can form a stable duplex with target RNA regardless of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents and elicit RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of the RNA, and the RNA degradation rate is depending on the type of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents.

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) contain a gap region consisting of DNA, whose heteroduplex with RNA can be a substrate for RNase H. Herein, the synthesis and properties of gapmer ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs at the gap region are reported. Synthesis of the ONs was performed by postsynthetic modification of 4&#8242;&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)thymidine through hydrolysis and nucleophilic substitution. Concerning the synthesis of ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;(propylcarbamoyl)thymidine, postsynthetic conversion of 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxythymidine or 4&#8242;&#8208;(phenoxycarbonyl)thymidine on the support is effective. The duplex stabilities of the modified ONs are comparable to those of the unmodified ON. Several types of modified ONs can elicit the RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of target RNA. Furthermore, modified ON containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208;thymidine at the gap region shows improved stability in fetal bovine serum solution. The analogs used in this study can be modified nucleosides for the gap region of gapmer ONs.

The duplex stabilities of the modified ONs are comparable to those of the unmodified ON. Several types of modified ONs can elicit the RNase H-mediated degradation of target RNA. Furthermore, modified ON containing 4&#8242;-carboxy-thymidine at the gap region shows improved stability in fetal bovine serum solution. The analogs used in this study can be modified nucleosides for the gap region of gapmer ONs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interdomain Coordination Determines Polyketide Extender Unit Specificity in UK&#8208;2A Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current understanding suggests that the specificity of extender unit incorporation is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domain, along with ketosynthase and thioesterase domains, In this work, it shows that the specificity extender unit incorporation is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire polyketide synthase module, rather than individual domains, offering new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

Controlling the incorporation of extender units is a key strategy for manipulating polyketide scaffolds. Current understanding suggests that extender unit incorporation by modular polyketide synthase (PKS) is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domains, along with ketosynthase, ketoreductase, and thioesterase domains. In this study, the mechanism is investigated underlying the specific incorporation of the benzyl side chain at the C7 position of UK&#8208;2A, both in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro. These findings reveal that the incorporation of the benzylmalonyl&#8208;CoA extender unit is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire PKS module, rather than being controlled by individual domains. These results challenge previous recognition and offer new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

         <title>The Persistent Myth of Limonene's Smell</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural monoterpenes stir our sense of smell in a special way. The scent of the monoterpene limonene, a major component of citrus oils, is thoroughly investigated. Still, the information on its smell is confusing. In this Perspective article, the smell of citrus oils and its odorant components are discussed, focusing especially on the two enantiomers of limonene.

The scent of the well&#8208;known monoterpene limonene is thoroughly investigated. Despite this, the scientific community does not reach consensus. In this Perspective article, a discussion is contributed by giving a simple overview of the olfactory system, as well as presenting the smell of well&#8208;known compounds and their odor threshold values in citrus oils, from which (R)&#8208;limonene is extracted. In particular, the composition of oils from orange and lemon peel and their association with the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantiomers of limonene, respectively, are considered. Then, the controversy surrounding the odors of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;limonene and the myth that has been spun from this are reported, particularly in the organic chemistry literature, before an argument for why this myth should be dismantled. Based on the chemical and physiological processes involved in the sense of smell, whether the odor attributed to a certain compound is from that compound and/or from derivatives produced by enzymes associated with the olfactory system is also briefly discussed.

         <title>Lienhwalides: Unique Tropolone&#8211;Maleidride Hybrids from Hypoxylon lienhwacheense</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lienhwalides are novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecules unique in nature. Absolute configuration is solved by semisynthetic approaches and X&#8208;ray analysis. Interplay between both lwt and lwm biosynthetic gene clusters is responsible for the production of lienhwalides.

Hypoxylon lienhwacheense, a fungal species with an unclear taxonomic placement within the Hypoxylaceae, presents a highly rare stromatal secondary metabolite profile. Isolation of its major stromatal constituents leads to the discovery of a novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecule, lienhwalide A 5, in addition to the known cordyanhydride B 6, its new derivative 7, and binaphthalenetetraol 8. Unexpectedly, Hypoxylon lienhwacheense produces in liquid cultures various lienhwalide A congeners 9&#8211;11. Their structures and relative configurations are elucidated using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry&#160;and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with their absolute configurations determined using X&#8208;ray analysis of a semisynthetic brominated derivative of 9 and synthesizing &#945;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylphenylacetyl&#160;esters of 11. Feeding experiments with 13C&#8208;labeled precursors (13C&#8208;methionine; 1&#8208;13C&#8208; and U&#8208;13C6&#8208;glucose) reveal insights into the biogenesis of tropolone and maleidride moieties, according to 13C couplings and incredible natural abundance double quantum transfer NMR data. Genome analysis identifies two separate biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for these moieties, and heterologous expression experiments provide further insights into the interplay of both clusters during the biosynthesis of these hybrid natural products. Remarkably, lienhwalides exhibit reduced toxicity and enhance antibacterial selectivity compared to related fungal tropolones.

Directed Evolution of Fluorescent Genetically Encoded Biosensors: Innovative Approaches for Development and Optimization of Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution significantly facilitates development of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, enabling the development of brighter and more specific biosensors. Novel methods enhance screening processes, decrease resources and costs, and integrate machine learning for optimized outcomes. Promising directions include near&#8208;infrared and photochromic biosensors, alongside de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains.

Fluorescent protein&#8208;based biosensors are indispensable molecular tools in cell biology and biomedical research, providing non&#8208;invasive dynamic measurements of metabolite concentrations and other cellular signals. Traditional methods for developing these biosensors rely on rational design, but directed evolution methods offer a more efficient alternative. This review discusses recent advancements in the development of biosensors using directed evolution, including methods for optimizing domain fusions, sequence optimization, and new screening and selection systems. Additionally, the incorporation of machine learning into the directed evolution process is explored, highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency and cost reduction of biosensor development. Finally, emerging trends in the development of near&#8208;infrared biosensors and photochromic sensors are discussed, along with the opportunities presented by de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains and biosensors.

Cationic Polymers for Gene Delivery: Properties and Functional Optimization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, three types of cationic polymers, the nonbiodegradable polymers polyethyleneimine and polyamidoamine, the biodegradable natural polymers chitosan and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin , and the biodegradable synthetic polymers poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s, are reviewed. The modification of these cationic polymers includes four general strategies, which improve the overall performance of gene carriers.

Developing safe and efficient nucleic acid delivery systems has been a major challenge for gene therapy. Cationic polymers, with their easily modifiable chemical structure and high nucleic acid loading capacity, can meet a wide range of needs for gene delivery. Research on using these polymers as gene delivery vectors is rapidly developing. In this paper, cationic polymers are briefly categorized into three types: nonbiodegradable polymers, biodegradable natural polymers, and biodegradable synthetic polymers. Among these three types, several representative delivery carriers are selected to be discussed in detail, which are polyethyleneimine, polyamidoamine, chitosan, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, and poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s. The physicochemical properties and structure optimization strategies of these representative types of carriers are outlined. The deficiencies and common major modification strategies of these vectors are summarized in comparison, which can provide new ideas for the design and development of cationic polymer gene vectors in the future.

         <title>Peptide Stapling Using Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogashira coupling of sidechains has been employed for stapling a series of peptides. The iodide and alkynyl derivatives required for the stapling reaction were introduced at the i and i+4 or i and i+7 positions as 4&#8208;iodophenylalanine and 4&#8208;propargyloxyphenylalanine, respectively. It is shown through CD analysis that a linear peptide showed increased helicity after stapling.







Abstract
An efficient method for the stapling of peptides by linking residues at the i and i+4 or i and i+7 positions through Sonagashira coupling is reported. The alkyne and aryl iodide functionality required are introduced by modifying tyrosine residues to 4&#8208;iodophenylalanine (PhI) and 4&#8208;propargyloxyphenylalanine (TyP) residues. Comparing the conformations of a stapled peptide with the corresponding linear peptide using CD spectroscopy reveals a more helical structure for the stapled peptide.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reactions for Bioactive Sulfur Species Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the concept of bioorthogonal reactions triggered bioactive sulfur species delivery and summarizes representative delivery systems developed by this strategy in recent years. This approach offers a promising solution to realize precise and controllable small sulfuric molecule release. These bioorthogonal prodrug strategies also have enhanced benefits, including organelle targeting ability, spatiotemporal fluorescence feedback, and orthogonality with other reactions.

Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for the development of controllable drug delivery systems. Bioactive sulfur species, which participate in complex sulfur signaling pathways, play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, achieving precise and controlled administration of these sulfur species remains challenging due to their unique physicochemical properties. Over the past few years, a growing number of delivery strategies, which are triggered by different stimuli, have been developed to enhance our understanding of sulfur signaling. Bioorthogonal triggers not only offer excellent controllability but also provide advantages such as tunability, targeted delivery, and spatiotemporal feedback. This review highlights representative donors that can be activated through bioorthogonal reactions and their applications in studying the biological mechanisms and therapeutic functions of the bioactive sulfur species.

         <title>Target&#8208;Guided Design and Synthesis of Aryl&#8208;Functionalized Promysalin Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, target&#8208;guided analog design was employed to enhance the interactions of promysalin, a species&#8208;specific Pseudomonad inhibitor, with succinate dehydrogenase. We hypothesized that aromatic analogs could target an unexplored region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions leading to more potent compounds. Here, we report the in&#8208;silico design, scalable route, and biological characterization against a panel of clinically relevant strains.

The development of new narrow&#8208;spectrum antibiotics is a promising approach to combat antibiotic resistance. Promysalin, a secondary metabolite isolated from Pseudomonas putida, exhibits potent species&#8208;specific inhibition of the pathogen P. aeruginosa (IC50 21&#8201;nM). Herein, the total synthesis and stereochemical assignment of promysalin, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, and the identification of its molecular target, succinate dehydrogenase, are previously reported by the group. These findings enable computational studies of promysalin's interactions with succinate dehydrogenase, revealing a novel binding site region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions with a nearby tryptophan residue. It is hypothesized that new aromatic analogs of promysalin can target this beneficial interaction, potentially leading to more potent inhibitors of P. aeruginosa growth. Herein, the in silico design of these analogs, a scalable and general synthetic route to access them, and characterization of their activity against a panel of clinically relevant P. aeruginosa strains are reported.

         <title>Degradation of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Megasynthetases SrfAA and SrfAB by Acyldepsipeptide&#8208;Activated ClpP in Bacillus Subtilis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsZ is the only target protein that has been biochemically confirmed to be hydrolyzed both in&#8201;vitro and in bacterial cells. Coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP1 proteolytic complex that degrades the surfactin synthetases SrfAA and SrfAB in cell lysates and bacterial cells is demonstrated.

Protein degradation is a tightly controlled biological process and is essential for maintaining bacterial proteostasis. ClpPs are a highly conserved family of serine proteases that interact with ATPases and play key roles in diverse cellular activities, including heat&#8208;shock response, expression of virulence factors, and protein turnover and homeostasis. Owing to their vital roles, drugs targeting ClpP&#8208;ATPases have attracted interest in treating bacterial infections. The mode of action of the antibiotic acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) is uncontrolled proteolysis by an ATPase&#8208;independent ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. The cell division protein FtsZ is the only bacterial protein confirmed to be hydrolyzed by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex in recombinant enzyme systems and cells. Here, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that causes degradation of the secondary metabolite nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) SrfAA and SrfAB in Bacillus subtilis is reported. Using in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro studies coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of NRPSs, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that degrades SrfAA and SrfAB is demonstrated. Furthermore, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex is reconstructed in cell lysates, confirming that SrfAA and SrfAB are sensitive to degradation by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. These findings demonstrate that SrfAA and SrfAB are protein substrates for the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex, providing novel insights into the ClpP degradation machinery.

         <title>Design of Short Peptides for the Reduction of Silver Ions and Stabilization of Nanocomposites in Combating Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of amino acids, amphiphilic peptides, oligopeptides, and cationic antimicrobial peptides is crucial for reducing silver ions and stabilizing nanocomposites. The silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites can be formed with and without the assistance of ultraviolet/sunlight but without any toxic reagents and plant extracts or microorganism, and they effectively inhibit bacterial strains by disrupting membranes and generating reactive oxygen species.

Combating bacterial infections has become a formidable challenge in healthcare due to the rise of antibiotic resistance. Recently, short peptide&#8208;based nanobiomaterials, assembled through silver metal and peptide building blocks, have emerged as promising antibiotic agents for treating resistant bacterial infections. In this minireview, recent advances in silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites are highlighted, both with and without the assistance of UV or sunlight, for antibacterial applications. The chemical design of biomolecules such as amphiphilic short peptides, amino acids, and oligopeptides plays a crucial role in the reduction, stabilization, and biocompatibility of silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites. Noncovalent interactions involved in the formation of nanocomposites are explored in the context of the structure&#8211;function relationship. The antibacterial activities and underlying mechanisms, which depend on specific peptide building blocks, are also reviewed. Finally, the conclusion and the outlook provide insights into the design of novel peptide building blocks for the development of silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites with enhanced antibacterial activities.

         <title>Direct Preparation of Site&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates with Unpurified Antibodies in Culture Medium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K248 site&#8208;specific conjugation strategy enabling direct preparation of homogeneous antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) from unpurified cell culture media is established in this study. The method can be conducted under mild conditions with rapid completion, eliminating antibody pretreatment. It demonstrates broad compatibility with diverse payloads , , offering a streamlined, scalable solution for both laboratory and industrial ADCs&#160;production.

In comparison with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) have been extensively employed in cancer therapy due to their high selectivity and low systemic toxicity.

Conventional ADC production involves multistep purification processes, which significantly increase the costs. Herein, an approach for the direct preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs in an antibody expression system that is derived from the reported K248 site&#8208;specific modification technology is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A K248 site-specific conjugation strategy enabling direct preparation of homogeneous antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) from unpurified cell culture media is established in this study. The method can be conducted under mild conditions with rapid completion, eliminating antibody pretreatment. It demonstrates broad compatibility with diverse payloads , , offering a streamlined, scalable solution for both laboratory and industrial ADCs&#160;production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) have been extensively employed in cancer therapy due to their high selectivity and low systemic toxicity. However, the structural complexity of ADCs makes its preparation process more intricate and time-consuming. Conventional ADC production involves multistep purification processes, which significantly increase the costs.

         <title>Valdiazen Derivatives for Chemoproteomic Studies in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valdiazen is a&#8201;quorum&#8208;sensing signal isolated from B. c. H111. Using diazeniumdiolate chemical probes, several valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins are identified, many of which are involved in structural and metabolic processes. This study offers valuable chemical tools and advances our understanding of the interactome associated with diazeniumdiolate signaling molecules.

Quorum sensing (QS) allows bacteria to coordinate community&#8208;wide behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence, and symbiosis. The diazeniumdiolate valdiazen is identified in the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 as a novel quorum&#8208;sensing signal, yet its protein interactome remains unexplored. In this study, a chemoproteomic pulldown approach is used to identify potential valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins. For these pulldown experiments, a series of alkyne&#8208;linked and biotin&#8208;conjugated valdiazen probes are synthesized. Affinity&#8208;based pulldown experiments using biotin&#8208;valdiazen conjugates successfully identify several putative proteins including an ATP synthase subunit, a succinylglutamate desuccinylase/aspartoacylase, a granule&#8208;associated protein, an acetyl&#8208;CoA hydrolase, a serine protease and an OmpA/MotB precursor. Overall, this study provides insights into the valdiazen&#8211;protein interactome in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111, advancing our understanding of the role of valdiazen in bacterial QS.

         <title>A Bacterial Sulfotransferase Catalyzes an Unusual Di&#8208;Sulfation in Natural Products Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a unique sulfotransferase, AdpST, is identified from the adp biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) in Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 and demonstrates that AdpST possesses di&#8208;sulfation activity, which is unprecedented for bacterial phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS)&#8208;dependent sulfotransferases. It is further shown that the adp BGC contains a dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette essential for improving sulfation capacity.

Sulfation is a widely used strategy in nature to modify the solubility, polarity, and biological activities of molecules. The enzymes catalyzing sulfation, sulfotransferases (STs), are typically highly specific to a single sulfation site in a molecule. Herein, the identification and characterization of sulfated adipostatins is reported and reveals a novel sulfotransferase, AdpST, which is responsible for di&#8208;sulfation at two sites of adipostatins. The initial bioinformatic analysis in search of adipostatin analogs from Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 identifies adpST and a 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthetic cassette, which are co&#8208;clustered with the adipostatin&#8208;encoding type III polyketide synthase. Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfated adipostatin analogs are discovered in the extracts of S. davaonensis DSM101723, whereas di&#8208;sulfated bacterial natural products has not been reported. Using a series of in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro experiments, it is confirmed that AdpST is solely responsible for both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfation of adipostatins, a catalytic activity which has not been identified in bacterial PAPS&#8208;dependent STs to date. It is further demonstrated that the dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette improves di&#8208;sulfation capacity. Lastly, it is determined that AdpST shares similarity with a small group of uncharacterized STs, suggesting the presence of additional unique bacterial STs in nature, and that AdpST is phylogenetically distant from many characterized STs.

         <title>Investigation of the Mechanism of Action of Natural and Synthetic Monoterpenoids: For a New Route in Antimycotic Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Bromothymol shows a stunning in&#8201;vivo antimycotic efficacy, even on resistant molds and yeast. Discrete Fourier transform and molecular dynamics approaches reveal that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a high affinity toward the bilayer. Noteworthy, it forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the phosphate in the lipid head, altering its structure and conceivably triggering a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; that affects the overall membrane stability.

Monoterpenoids are well&#8208;recognized natural antimycotic agents, but their mechanism of action is still unclear. Interestingly, synthetic derivatives, such as 4&#8208;bromothymol (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;5&#8208;methylphenol), are emerging as promising alternatives to natural molecules, due to their even greater biological activity. Herein, the antimycotic efficacy of 4&#8208;bromothymol is evaluated: in vivo experiments on species of acclaimed resistance demonstrate that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a minimum inhibitory concentration up to 6 times lower than thymol. In silico investigations, sweeping from partition coefficient (LogP) determination through density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations based on a minimum bias approach, support its improved antifungal activity with respect to thymol, carvacrol, and thymyl acetate. A structural insight of the mechanism of action is proposed. Even though all the analyzed compounds are able to penetrate the cellular membrane, 4&#8208;bromothymol shows a higher predicted affinity for the bilayer, and it causes a strong perturbation at the water/bilayer interface, altering the stability of the membrane, thus leading to cell death.

         <title>Designing Enzymatic Reactivity with an Expanded Palette</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovation in biocatalysis is rapidly increasingly the diversity of catalytic reactivity that can be mediated by enzymes, addressing a key bottleneck for their widespread adoption in industrial chemical synthesis. A key approach to this is building enzymes with unnatural catalytic components that provide an expanded palette with new possibilities for enzymatic reactivity.

The expanding applications of biocatalysis in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors herald a greener future for these industries. Yet, the range of chemical reactions known to enzymes only covers a small fraction of what is required for modern synthetic routes. To continue the increases in sustainability afforded by converting chemical processes into enzymatic ones, fundamentally new kinds of biocatalytic reactivity are required. Perhaps the very components from which enzymes are constructed, a palette of canonical amino acids and cofactors, inherently limit their catalytic possibilities, even if all the available natural sequence space can be explored. In recent years, there has been an explosion of strategies to produce new biocatalytic function through the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids and synthetic cofactors, new colors which are added to the enzyme design palette. This has enabled new enzymatic reactions that proceed via organocatalytic, organometallic, and photocatalytic mechanisms. Aside from designing new enzymatic activities from scratch, exogenous photocatalysts have recently also been used in synergy with natural enzyme active sites to diverge their reactivity towards radical pathways. This review will highlight recent developments in enriching enzymatic chemistry with new unnatural components, providing an outlook for future directions and needed developments for practicality and sustainability.

The liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of charged proteins was examined using super charged GFP in the polyamine synthetase knock down HT873 strain. Following ATP depletion and polyamine treatment, negatively charged GFP (&#8722;27) exhibited phase separation through charge&#8208;charge interactions with polyamines, indicating that polyamines are the main drivers for the formation of condensates of negatively charged proteins.

Protein liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has attracted significant attention due to its involvement in cellular functions and has been believed to be the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the primary mechanisms governing its formation and function remain unclear. Since most of proteins involved in condensation in cells are charged, it is hypothesized that charge&#8211;charge interactions mediated by small charged biomolecules, such as adenosine tri&#8208;phosphate (ATP) and polyamines, would be the primary driving force behind the protein LLPS. In the previous study, it is showed that small charged biomolecules are to be a main driver of protein LLPS through charge&#8211;charge interaction. Furthermore, multivalently charged small molecules play a crucial role in creating protein condensates when the protein themselves are charged, effectively acting as bridges between charged proteins. Having said that, the effect of endogenous polyamine molecules in protein condensation in cells could not be ruled out. In this study, an E. coli strain is utilized with a polyamine synthetase knocked&#8208;down, HT873, to investigate the role of polyamines in the aggregation of both negatively and positively charged green fluorescence proteins. This study suggests that both ATP and polyamine, as small charged biomolecules, play critical roles in the LLPS of charged proteins in cells.

         <title>Macrocycles of Saxitoxin: Insights into the Structure of Zetekitoxin AB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic macrocycles of (+)&#8208;saxitoxin, the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning, have been prepared. These are designed to mimic the macrocyclic core of the proposed structure for zetekitoxin AB. Interestingly, these synthetic macrocycles do not form the C12 hydrate as commonly observed in this family of toxins, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin AB.

Zeteketoxin AB is the only macrocyclic member of the bis&#8208;guanidinium ion toxins, and the only member reported to be more potent than the parent (+)&#8208;saxitoxin. A rationale for this exquisite potency remains difficult to develop due to the scarcity of natural material and a lack of consensus around the specific structure of the toxin itself. A strategy is reported, leveraging an intramolecular Michael addition to forge macrocycles bridging the saxitoxin core, mimicking the proposed structure of zetekitoxin AB. Intriguingly, these analogs do not form a hydrate at C12. Experimental and computational studies suggest that a macrocyclic framework destabilizes the hydrate, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin. Preliminary activity screening utilizing calcium imaging&#8208;based constellation pharmacology demonstrates several analogs to have potent pharmacological activity similar to (+)&#8208;saxitoxin despite the lack of the C12 hydrated ketone.

         <title>Facile Conjugation Method of CpG&#8208;ODN Adjuvant to Intact Virions for Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vaccines are a pivotal achievement in public health, offering inexpensive, distributable and highly effective protection against infectious diseases. Despite significant advancements in vaccine development, there are still many diseases for which vaccines are unavailable or offer limited protection. The global impact of the deficiency in vaccine&#8208;induced immunity against these diseases is profound, leading to increased rates of illness, more frequent hospitalizations, and higher mortality rates. Recent studies have demonstrated conjugation mechanisms and delivery methods to co&#8208;present adjuvants and protein epitopes to antigen&#8208;presenting cells, significantly enhancing adaptive immunity. We introduce a novel approach to incorporate an adjuvant into the vaccine by covalently attaching it to whole enveloped virions. Using "clickable" azide&#8208;enabled viral particles, generated through metabolic incorporation of N&#8208;azidoacetyl glucosamine (GlcNAz), we conjugated the virions with a cyclo&#8208;octyne&#8208;modified CpG&#8208;ODN. Conjugation yielded a potent adjuvant&#8208;virus complex, eliciting higher TLR9&#8208;mediated cell activation of cultured bone marrow&#8208;derived macrophages relative to co&#8208;administered adjuvants and virions. Administration of covalent adjuvant&#8208;virion conjugates increase immune cell stimulation and may provide a generalizable and effective strategy for eliciting a heightened immune response for vaccine development.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling Serine Hydrolases in the Leishmania Host&#8208;Pathogen Interactome Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Activity&#8208;Based Fluorophosphonate Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leishmaniasis, a vector borne neglected tropical disease, caused by the protozoan parasite&#160;Leishmania, is a major global public health challenge with millions of new cases annually.&#160;Treatment of leishmaniasis is difficult for many reasons including a multiple life&#8208;cycle stages, involving both an infective insect vector form, the promastigote, and a disease causing intracellular mammalian host form, the amastigote, and increasing drug&#8208;tolerance that are all linked by the interplay between parasite and host.&#160;We employed activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) using new cell&#8208;permeable fluorophosphonate probes to explore serine hydrolases (SHs) in&#160;Leishmania mexicana&#160;with subsequent analysis enabled by secondary reaction with an affinity reagent. Importantly, these cell&#8208;permeable probes can access all life&#8208;cycle stages including the disease&#8208;critical intramacrophage amastigote. Probe efficacy is a combination of both target engagement and subsequent accessibility to the affinity agent. Fourteen SHs, including peptidases and lipases, were identified in the&#160;L. mexicana&#160;proteome with comparative profiling of different parasite life&#8208;stages revealing significant changes in SH activity across the life&#8208;cycle stages. This intra&#8208;cellular ABPP approach provides insights into the host&#8208;parasite interactome demonstrating that SHs function as important virulence factors with Z&#8208;Pro&#8208;Prolinal, a known prolyloligopeptidase inhibitor, being able to reduce parasite infectivity in the macrophage by altering multiple SH targets.</dc:description>
