      <title>A Step toward Molecular Evolution of RNA: Ribose Binds to Prebiotic Fatty Acid Membranes, and Nucleosides Bind Better than Individual Bases Do</title>
      <dc:description>
Membranes set the stage for RNA formation. RNA is a polymer of bases, sugar (ribose), and phosphate. Binding of these building blocks to prebiotic, fatty&#8208;acid membranes may have facilitated RNA's formation. On their own, some bases bind weakly to membranes, whereas a base linked to ribose or phosphoribose binds more strongly. Thus, simple membranes could have selected and concentrated linked versions of RNA's building blocks prior to their polymerization. More information can be found in the communication by R.&#8197;A. Black et&#8197;al.

     alt="A Step toward Molecular Evolution of RNA: Ribose Binds to Prebiotic Fatty Acid Membranes, and Nucleosides Bind Better than Individual Bases Do"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Membranes set the stage for RNA formation&lt;/b&gt;. RNA is a polymer of bases, sugar (ribose), and phosphate. Binding of these building blocks to prebiotic, fatty&#8208;acid membranes may have facilitated RNA's formation. On their own, some bases bind weakly to membranes, whereas a base linked to ribose or phosphoribose binds more strongly. Thus, simple membranes could have selected and concentrated linked versions of RNA's building blocks prior to their polymerization. More information can be found in the &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202000260communication by R.&#8197;A. Black et&#8197;al.&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Engineering of Thermostable &#946;&#8208;Hydroxyacid Dehydrogenase for the Asymmetric Reduction of Imines</title>
      <dc:description>
Get more from your enzyme: A &#946;&#8208;hydroxyacid dehydrogenase from Thermocrinus albus was engineered to accept two different imine compounds as substrates. The variants were applied to biocatalytic asymmetric reductions at elevated temperatures leading to an enhanced product formation.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hydroxyacid dehydrogenase from Thermocrinus albus (Ta&#8208;&#946;HAD), which catalyzes the NADP+&#8208;dependent oxidation of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyacids, was engineered to accept imines as substrates. The catalytic activity of the proton&#8208;donor variant K189D was further increased by the introduction of two nonpolar flanking residues (N192&#8197;L, N193&#8197;L). Engineering the putative alternative proton donor (D258S) and the gate&#8208;keeping residue (F250&#8197;A) led to a switched substrate specificity as compared to the single and triple variants. The two most active Ta&#8208;&#946;HAD variants were applied to biocatalytic asymmetric reductions of imines at elevated temperatures and enabled enhanced product formation at a reaction temperature of 50&#8201;&#176;C.

      <title>Chemoproteomics: Towards Global Drug Target Profiling</title>
      <dc:description>
Improved ID parade: Recent advances in chemoproteomic methods provide invaluable tools for drug target identification and quantifying the drugs&#8217; effect on protein thermodynamic stability at the proteomic level. Integrating these methods into the drug&#8208;development pipeline can help optimize the lead compounds and prioritize compounds for entering clinical trials.







Abstract
Illuminating drugs&#8217; mechanisms of action and their effects on the biomolecules of pathogens and humans is a much&#8208;needed next step to facilitate pharmaceutical development. Although studies have linked some drugs to their therapeutic targets by using transcriptomics and genomics, these approaches have intrinsic limitations and cannot directly assess drugs&#8217; effects on their protein targets. In this regard, chemoproteomic methods can detect protein&#8211;ligand interactions and quantitate the chemical or thermal stability changes of the entire detectible proteomes induced by drugs of interest. These widely applicable techniques have recently been adapted to deconvolute the mechanisms of action of antiparasitic drugs and successfully identified an essential target that was previously not known to be druggable. A continued effort to Integrate chemoproteomics into the drug&#8208;development pipeline could greatly improve our understanding of drugs&#8217; mechanisms, toxicity and pharmacodynamic properties.

Interacting with interactions: Chemical proteomics has taken shape as a powerful technique that seeks to understand small&#8208;molecule and protein function in the physiological system.

Abstract
Abstract. Over the past decade, chemical proteomics has emerged as a powerful technique to understand small molecule and protein function in the physiological system and plays a key role in unravelling the cellular targets of pharmacological modulators. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome. A much larger fraction of the human proteome can now be targeted by small molecules than estimated by past predictions of protein druggability.

      <title>Nanofactories for Controlled Synthesis and Delivery of Nucleoside Analogue Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>
A visionary nanofactory: A nanofactory for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and targeted delivery of a nucleoside therapeutic is envisioned. It requires an engineered form of a radical&#8208;SAM enzyme, is functionalized with a multicopper oxidase to generate anaerobic microenvironment, and uses a flavodoxin&#8211;flavodoxin reductase system to supply electrons for catalysis.







Abstract
The ultimate nanomedicine will be a cell&#8208;like machinery capable of reaching a specific target in the body and performing a desired therapeutic action in a controlled fashion. To make such machinery a reality, we need to combine fundamental knowledge and technological developments in different areas including polymer chemistry, biology, enzymology, and biochemical engineering. In this viewpoint, I put forward my vision of creating a nanofactory as a step towards developing cell&#8208;like nanomedicines. To make the proposed nanofactory a reality there are many challenges ahead. I propose plausible solutions to address some of the main challenges.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: A New Platform for Enzyme Immobilization</title>
      <dc:description>
Freeze frame: Enzyme immobilization is an emerging technology that can overcome the inherently fragile nature of enzymes. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as ideal matrices for enzyme immobilization. In this concept, we will impart the typical strategies to construct enzymes@MOFs, as well as their characteristics and potential applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with attractive properties such as high surface area, tunable porosity, designable functionality and excellent stability, have aroused great interest from researchers as the matrices for enzyme immobilization. Recently, several efficient strategies including surface immobilization, post&#8208;synthetic infiltration and in&#8197;situ encapsulation have been explored. MOF&#8208;immobilized enzymes, named enzymes@MOFs, show remarkably enhanced stability and recyclability, accelerating cell&#8208;free biocatalysis in diverse applications. This concept will impart the typical strategies for enzyme immobilization with MOFs, and their potential applications.

      <title>The in Vitro Antiplasmodial and Antiproliferative Activity of New Ferrocene&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Aminocresols Targeting Hemozoin Inhibition and DNA Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Multitarget attack: Compounds incorporating ferrocene in a aminocresol scaffold showed antiplasmodial and anticancer activity. SAR studies revealed that an OH group and rotatable C&#8211;NH bond are vital for biological activity, with spectrophotometric techniques and docking simulations suggesting a dual mode of action involving hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction. Targeting multiple pathways could delay the development of clinical resistance.







Abstract
The conjugation of organometallic complexes to known bioactive organic frameworks is a proven strategy revered for devising new drug molecules with novel modes of action. This approach holds great promise for the generation of potent drug leads in the quest for therapeutic chemotypes with the potential to overcome the development of clinical resistance. Herein, we present the in&#8197;vitro antiplasmodial and antiproliferative investigation of ferrocenyl &#945;&#8208;aminocresol conjugates assembled by amalgamation of the organometallic ferrocene unit and an &#945;&#8208;aminocresol scaffold possessing antimalarial activity. The compounds pursued in the study exhibited higher toxicity towards the chemosensitive (3D7) and &#8208;resistant (Dd2) strains of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite than to the human HCC70 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell line. Indication of cross&#8208;resistance was absent for the compounds evaluated against the multi&#8208;resistant Dd2 strain. Structure&#8208;activity analysis revealed that the phenolic hydroxy group and rotatable &#963; bond between the &#945;&#8208;carbon and NH group of the &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;o&#8208;cresol skeleton are crucial for the biological activity of the compounds. Spectrophotometric techniques and in silico docking simulations performed on selected derivatives suggest that the compounds show a dual mode of action involving hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction via minor&#8208;groove binding. Lastly, compound 9&#8201;a, identified as a possible lead, exhibited preferential binding for the plasmodial DNA isolated from 3D7 P. falciparum trophozoites over the mammalian calf thymus DNA, thereby substantiating the enhanced antiplasmodial activity of the compounds. The presented research demonstrates the strategy of incorporating organometallic complexes into known biologically active organic scaffolds as a viable avenue to fashion novel multimodal compounds with potential to counter the development drug resistance.

      <title>A PNA&#8208;DNA2 Triple&#8208;Helix Molecular Switch&#8208;Based Colorimetric Sensor for Sensitive and Specific Detection of microRNAs from Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care cancer catching? A novel PNA&#8208;DNA2 triplex consisting of a homopurine PNA strand and two homopyrimidine DNA strands is reported for the first time. On the basis of this phenomenon, a simple, inexpensive colorimetric PNA&#8208;DNA2 triple&#8208;helix molecular switch&#8208;based sensing platform for sensitive and selective detection of miRNAs from cancer cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), the synthetic DNA mimics that can bind to oligonucleotides to form duplexes, triplexes, and quadruplexes, could be advantageous as probes for nucleic acid sequences owing to their unique physicochemical and biochemical properties. We have found that a homopurine PNA strand could bind to two homopyrimidine DNA strands to form a PNA&#8208;DNA2 triplex. Moreover, the cyanine dye DiSC2(5) could bind with high affinity to this triplex and cause a noticeable color change. On the basis of this phenomenon, we have designed a label&#8208;free colorimetric sensing platform for miRNAs from cancer cells by using a PNA&#8208;DNA2 triple&#8208;helix molecular switch (THMS) and DiSC2(5). This sensing platform can detect miRNA&#8208;21 specifically with a detection limit of 0.18&#8197;nM, which is comparable to that of the THMS&#8208;mediated fluorescence sensing platform. Moreover, this colorimetric platform does not involve any chemical modification or enzymatic signal amplification, which boosts its applicability and availability at the point of care in resource&#8208;limited settings. The universality of this approach can be simply achieved by altering the sequences of the probe DNA for specific targets.

      <title>A Sweet Galactose Transfer: Metabolic Oligosaccharide Engineering as a Tool To Study Glycans in Plasmodium Infection</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmodium glycobiology: The use of artificial galactose derivatives and labelling through iEDDA reaction in the liver stage of Plasmodium infection showed increased uptake in infected hepatic cells, through participation of GLUT1 transporters. Furthermore, unprotected derivatives are transferred from the mosquito host to the Plasmodium berghei parasite. This strategy has the potential to provide new insights into Plasmodium glycobiology.







Abstract
The introduction of chemical reporter groups into glycan structures through metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) followed by bio&#8208;orthogonal ligation is an important tool to study glycosylation. We show the incorporation of synthetic galactose derivatives that bear terminal alkene groups in hepatic cells, with and without infection by Plasmodium berghei parasites, the causative agent of malaria. Additionally, we demonstrated the contribution of GLUT1 to the transport of these galactose derivatives, and observed a consistent increase in the uptake of these compounds going from na&#239;ve to P. berghei&#8208;infected cells. Finally, we used MOE to study the interplay between Plasmodium parasites and their mosquito hosts, to reveal a possible transfer of galactose building blocks from the latter to the former. This strategy has the potential to provide new insights into Plasmodium glycobiology as well as for the identification and characterization of key glycan structures for further vaccine development.

      <title>Efficient Synthesis of Phenylacetate and 2&#8208;Phenylethanol by Modular Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Green and sustainable synthesis of chemicals from renewable feedstocks is emerging as an alternative approach to petroleum&#8208;based chemical synthesis. In this work, a one&#8208;pot cascade biotransformation was developed to efficiently synthesize 2&#8208;phenylethanol and phenylacetic acid from biobased l&#8208;phenylalanine, tyrosol and p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid from biobased l&#8208;tyrosine.







Abstract
The green and sustainable synthesis of chemicals from renewable feedstocks by a biotransformation approach has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we developed enzymatic cascades to efficiently convert l&#8208;phenylalanine into 2&#8208;phenylethanol (2&#8208;PE) and phenylacetic acid (PAA), l&#8208;tyrosine into tyrosol (p&#8208;hydroxyphenylethanol, p&#8208;HPE) and p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p&#8208;HPAA). The enzymatic cascade was cast into an aromatic aldehyde formation module, followed by an aldehyde reduction module, or aldehyde oxidation module, to achieve one&#8208;pot biotransformation by using recombinant Escherichia coli. Biotransformation of 50&#8197;mM l&#8208;Phe produced 6.76&#8197;g/L PAA with more than 99&#8201;% conversion and 5.95&#8197;g/L of 2&#8208;PE with 97&#8201;% conversion. The bioconversion efficiencies of p&#8208;HPAA and p&#8208;HPE from l&#8208;Tyr reached to 88 and 94&#8201;%, respectively. In addition, m&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylalanine was further employed as an unnatural aromatic amino acid substrate to obtain m&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylacetic acid; &gt;96&#8201;% conversion was achieved. Our results thus demonstrated high&#8208;yielding and potential industrial synthesis of above aromatic compounds by one&#8208;pot cascade biocatalysis.

     alt="Efficient Synthesis of Phenylacetate and 2&#8208;Phenylethanol by Modular Cascade Biocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green and sustainable synthesis of chemicals from renewable feedstocks is emerging as an alternative approach to petroleum&#8208;based chemical synthesis. In this work, a one&#8208;pot cascade biotransformation was developed to efficiently synthesize 2&#8208;phenylethanol and phenylacetic acid from biobased &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;phenylalanine, tyrosol and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid from biobased &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;tyrosine.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green and sustainable synthesis of chemicals from renewable feedstocks by a biotransformation approach has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we developed enzymatic cascades to efficiently convert &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;phenylalanine into 2&#8208;phenylethanol (2&#8208;PE) and phenylacetic acid (PAA), &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;tyrosine into tyrosol (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxyphenylethanol, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;HPE) and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;HPAA). The enzymatic cascade was cast into an aromatic aldehyde formation module, followed by an aldehyde reduction module, or aldehyde oxidation module, to achieve one&#8208;pot biotransformation by using recombinant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. Biotransformation of 50&#8197;mM &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Phe produced 6.76&#8197;g/L PAA with more than 99&#8201;% conversion and 5.95&#8197;g/L of 2&#8208;PE with 97&#8201;% conversion.

      <title>Could We Really Be Made of Swiss Cheese? Xenobiology as an Engineering Epistemology for Biological Realization</title>
      <dc:description>
Possible building blocks of life: According to the multiple realizability thesis in the philosophy of science, there should exist radically different ways to build systems with the functions we value in complex life. Xenobiology's exploration of the viability of unfamiliar biochemistries provides the first serious empirical test of this idea.







Abstract
Besides having potential medical and biosafety applications, as well as challenging the foundations of biological engineering, xenobiology can also shed light on the epistemological and metaphysical questions that puzzle philosophers of science. This paper reviews this philosophical aspect of xenobiology, focusing on the possible multiple realizability of life. According to this hypothesis, what ultimately matters in understanding life is its function, not its particular building blocks. This is because there should, in theory, be many different ways to build the same function. The possibility of multiple realizability was originally raised in the context of AI's hypothesized capacity to realize mental functions. Because we still do not have any incontrovertible examples of digital minds, not to mention alien life of foreign biochemistry, the best way to test this philosophical idea is to examine the recent results and practices of synthetic biology and xenobiology.

      <title>Recent Progress of Nanozymes in the Detection of Pathogenic Microorganisms</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanozymes for biosensing: Nanozymes are a class of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties. Many of them including noble metal&#8208;, metal oxide&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, and metal complex&#8208;based nanozymes have demonstrated the ability to detect pathogenic micro&#8208;organisms. These nanozymes and some issues for future research are highlighted and summarized in this review.







Abstract
Infectious diseases are among the world's principal health problems. It is crucial to develop rapid, accurate and cost&#8208;effective methods for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. Recently, considerable progress has been achieved in the field of inorganic enzyme mimics (nanozymes). Compared with natural enzymes, nanozymes have higher stability and lower cost. More interestingly, their properties can be designed for various demands. Herein, we introduce the latest research progress on the detection of pathogenic microorganisms by using various nanozymes. We also discuss the current challenges of nanozymes in biosensing and provide some strategies to overcome these barriers.

      <title>Intersecting Xenobiology and Neometabolism To Bring Novel Chemistries to Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Outside the box: Xenoelements can be incorporated into the chemistry of microbial cells by combining several approaches. Engineered hosts are programmed through neometabolism to accept nonbiological atoms, incorporated into xenometabolites. Some of these molecules are added&#8208;value chemicals in themselves; others (e.&#8201;g., modified amino acids) can be integrated into proteins to explore emergence of novel functions.







Abstract
The diversity of life relies on a handful of chemical elements (carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus) as part of essential building blocks; some other atoms are needed to a lesser extent, but most of the remaining elements are excluded from biology. This circumstance limits the scope of biochemical reactions in extant metabolism &#8211; yet it offers a phenomenal playground for synthetic biology. Xenobiology aims to bring novel bricks to life that could be exploited for (xeno)metabolite synthesis. In particular, the assembly of novel pathways engineered to handle nonbiological elements (neometabolism) will broaden chemical space beyond the reach of natural evolution. In this review, xeno&#8208;elements that could be blended into nature's biosynthetic portfolio are discussed together with their physicochemical properties and tools and strategies to incorporate them into biochemistry. We argue that current bioproduction methods can be revolutionized by bridging xenobiology and neometabolism for the synthesis of new&#8208;to&#8208;nature molecules, such as organohalides.

      <dc:description>
The cover feature picture shows a tRNA that is being transported through the bacterial &#8220;RNA maintenance factory&#8221; after being damaged through direct methylation. Here, we report how E. coli classifies RNA damage into three major categories. The first class of damage, such as 7&#8208;methylguanosine is being ignored by the bacterium. The second class, for example, 2&#8208;methylthiocytidine, is repaired through enzymatic demethylation. In the front, our newly discovered RNA damage, 4&#8208;methylthiouridine, is shown; this is lost from tRNA through an as yet unknown mechanism. More information can be found in the communication by S. Kellner et&#8197;al.

      <title>Surface Ligand&#8208;Density Switches Glycovesicles Between Monomeric and Multimeric Lectin Recognitions</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions define multitude of cellular recognition events. We present herein synthetic glycovesicles as cell surface mimics in order to switch the nature of the lectin recognitions.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions define multitude of cellular recognition events. We present herein synthetic glycovesicles as cell surface mimics in order to switch the nature of the lectin recognitions. The covalent glycovesicles, constituted with diacetylene monomers of varying ligand densities at their surfaces, are prepared through photo&#8208;polymerization. Vesicles imbedded with sparsely populated ligands engage a lectin interaction, leading to a dense cross&#8208;linked multimeric complex formation.

      <title>Characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant containing a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogenase converts N  2  to NH  3  , and CO to hydrocarbons, at its cofactor site. Here, we report a biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant expressed in an  Azotobacter vinelandii  strain containing a deletion of  nifV  , the gene encoding the homocitrate synthase. Designated NifDK  Cit  , the catalytic component of this Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant contains a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor analog. Activity analysis of NifDK  Cit  reveals a shift of CO&#8208;reduction from H  2  &#8208;evolution toward hydrocarbon&#8208;formation and an opposite shift of N  2  &#8208;reduction from NH  3  &#8208;formation toward H  2  &#8208;evolution. Consistent with a shift in the Mo K&#8208;edge energy of NifDK  Cit  relative to that of its wildtype counterpart, EPR analysis demonstrates a broadening of the line&#8208;shape and a decrease in the intensity of the cofactor&#8208;originated  S  = 3/2 signal, suggesting a change in the spin properties of the cofactor upon citrate substitution. These observations point to a crucial role of homocitrate in substrate reduction by nitrogenase and the possibility to tune product profiles of nitrogenase reactions via organic ligand substitution.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous Visualization of Wet Cells and Nanostructured Biomaterials in SEM using Ionic Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>This work presents a successful methodology to image mammalian cells adhered to nanostructured titanium using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operating in low&#8208;vacuum mode following ionic liquid treatment. Human osteoblast&#8208;like Saos&#8208;2 cells were treated with a room&#8208;temperature ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, and subsequently imaged on titanium utilizing SEM. Titanium substrates were modified to create laser&#8208;induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) for visualizing at the sub&#8208;micron scale. Using a combination of fluorescence&#8208;based cell metabolism along with light microscopy and SEM image analysis, the shape and location of irradiated cells were confirmed to be unchanged after multiple irradiation sessions while the viability of minimally irradiated cells was unaltered. The wet imaging conditions combined with a rapid facile protocol using ionic liquid allows this technique to fulfill a niche in examining cellular behavior on biomaterials with sub&#8208;micron surface features. The demonstrated method to track observed cell adhesion to sub&#8208;micron surface features with SEM has great implications for the understanding of cell migration on nanostructured surfaces as well as on the exploration of simpler SEM preparation methods for cellular imaging.</dc:description>

Metals in medicine: Metal complexes offer unique properties in comparison to organic drugs. Herein, the generally underestimated potential of metal&#8208;containing compounds in comparison to organic compounds, as exemplified by photodynamic therapy, is highlighted.







Abstract
The vast majority of investigated compounds in modern medicine are based on organic molecules. Within the last decades, the field of medicinial chemistry is shifting towards the application of metal complexes. These compounds offer different mechanisms of action in comparison to organic molecules due to their unique properties, making them novel drug candidates. Herein, the successful combination of metal containing compounds and medicine is highlighted by their application for photodynamic therapy.

      <title>Pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid probes capable of cross&#8208;linking with DNA: Effects of terminal and internal modifications on cross&#8208;link efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we describe a furan&#8208;modified acpcPNA as a probe that can form an interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) with its DNA target upon activation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). To overcome the problem of the furan instability under acidic conditions, a simple and versatile post&#8208;synthetic methodology for the attachment of the furan group to the PNA probe is developed. Unlike other designs, the furan was placed at the end of the PNA molecule or tethered to the PNA backbone with all the base pairs in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplexes fully preserved. Hence, the true reactivity of each nucleobase towards the cross&#8208;linking could be compared. We show that all DNA bases except T could participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction when the furan was placed at the end of the PNA strand. The cross&#8208;linking process was sensitive to mispairing, and lower cross&#8208;linking efficiency was observed in the presence of a base&#8208;mismatch in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplex. In contrast, when the furan was placed at the internal positions of the acpcPNA&#8208;DNA duplex, no ICL was observed which was explained by the inability of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobase to participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The cross&#8208;linking efficiency was considerably improved, despite lower duplex stability, when an unpaired base (in the form of C&#8208;insertion) was present in the complementary DNA strand close to the furan modification site.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we describe a furan&#8208;modified acpcPNA as a probe that can form an interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) with its DNA target upon activation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). To overcome the problem of the furan instability under acidic conditions, a simple and versatile post&#8208;synthetic methodology for the attachment of the furan group to the PNA probe is developed. Unlike other designs, the furan was placed at the end of the PNA molecule or tethered to the PNA backbone with all the base pairs in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplexes fully preserved. Hence, the true reactivity of each nucleobase towards the cross&#8208;linking could be compared. We show that all DNA bases except T could participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction when the furan was placed at the end of the PNA strand. The cross&#8208;linking process was sensitive to mispairing, and lower cross&#8208;linking efficiency was observed in the presence of a base&#8208;mismatch in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplex. In contrast, when the furan was placed at the internal positions of the acpcPNA&#8208;DNA duplex, no ICL was observed which was explained by the inability of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobase to participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The cross&#8208;linking efficiency was considerably improved, despite lower duplex stability, when an unpaired base (in the form of C&#8208;insertion) was present in the complementary DNA strand close to the furan modification site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Discovery of the 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone biosynthesis genes in Aspergillus oryzae</title>
      <dc:description>The filamentous fungus  Aspergillus oryzae  has 27 putative iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, but secondary metabolites produced by them are mostly unknown. Here, we focused on eight clusters which were reported to be expressed at relatively high levels in a transcriptome analysis. By comparison of metabolites between an octuple&#8208;deletion mutant of these eight PKS gene clusters and its parent strain, we found that  A. oryzae  produced 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  1  ) and its precursor, 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  3  ), in a specific liquid medium. Furthermore, an iterative type I PKS (PpsB) encoded by AO090102000166 and an acetyl&#8208;CoA ligase (PpsA) encoded downstream from  ppsB  were shown to be essential for their biosynthesis. PpsC, encoded upstream from  ppsB  , was shown to have  3  &#8208;binding activity (  K  d  ; 26.0 &#177; 6.2 &#956;M) and is suggested to be involved in the conversion of  3  to  1  .

      <title>Short RNA Universal Coding for Topological Transformation Nanobarcoding Application</title>

      <title>The &#8220;Carbonyl Story&#8221; and Beyond; Experiences, Lessons and Implications</title>
      <dc:description>
Lessons in discovery and development: The way to bring a 99mTc imaging agent into and through clinical trials is a long one. Although &#8220;carbonyl technology&#8221; has been known for almost two decades, only one compound made it that far. The different reasons for this are discussed in the paper together with scientific developments inspired by but beyond the carbonyl technology.







Abstract
The complex [99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ has become a versatile building block in radiopharmaceutical chemistry, applied by many groups worldwide. However, despite widespread efforts, only one compound has made it right the way through clinical trials. Along the way from its discovery to its development into an eventual product, the author experienced issues that he would handle differently in retrospect. In this article, these experiences are turned into &#8220;lessons&#8221; that might be helpful for young researchers finding themselves in similar situations. Beside issues with patenting and company strategies, the carbonyl story has provided scientific implications beyond its own story, and insights from which any future 99mTc&#8208;based chemistry for radiopharmacy or molecular imaging might benefit.

      <title>Structural cues for understanding eEF1A2 moonlighting</title>
      <dc:description>Spontaneous mutations in the  EEF1A2  gene cause epilepsy and severe neurological disabilities in children.

      <title>A pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle lights up transfer RNA upon binding at the Mg2+ binding site</title>
      <dc:description>Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are fundamental molecules in cellular translation. In the present study we have highlighted a fluorescence&#8208;based perceptive approach for tRNA using quinoxaline small molecule. We have synthesized a water soluble fluorescent pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle containing a mandatory piperazine tail (  DS1  ) with a large stokes shift (~ 160 nm). The interaction between  DS1  and tRNA results in significant fluorescence enhancement of the molecule with a K  d  ~ 5 &#181;M and multiple binding sites. Our work reveals that  DS1  binding site overlaps with the specific Mg  2+  ion binding site in the D loop of tRNA. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the molecule inhibited Pb  2+  induced cleavage of yeast tRNA  Phe  in the D loop. In competitive binding assay, the fluorescence of DS1&#8208;tRNA complex is quenched by a known tRNA&#8208;binder, tobramycin. This indicates the displacement of  DS1  and indeed a substantiation of a specific binding at the site of tertiary interaction in the central region of tRNA. The ability of compound  DS1  to bind tRNA with higher affinity compared to DNA and single&#8208;stranded RNA offers a promising approach in developing tRNA based biomarker diagnostics in future.</dc:description>

PDIs are oxidoreductases, capable of forming new or breaking existing disulfide bonds.

      <dc:description>Metabolic engineering uses genetic strategies to drive flux through desired pathways. Recent work with electrochemical, photochemical, and chemocatalytic setups has revealed that these systems can also expand metabolic pathways and manipulate flux in whole cells. Electrochemical systems add or remove electrons from metabolic pathways to direct flux to more or less reduced products. Photochemical systems act as synthetic light harvesting complexes and yield artificial photosynthetic organisms. Biocompatible chemocatalysis increases product scope, streamlines syntheses, and yields single&#8208;flask processes that deliver products that would be challenging to synthesize through biosynthetic means alone.

      <title>Evaluation of i&#8208;Motif Formation in the Serotonin Transporter&#8208;Linked Polymorphic Region</title>
      <dc:description>Neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) arise from a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of synaptic serotonin (5&#8208;HT) and its inhibition is an important pharmacological target for treating MDD. The serotonin transporter&#8208;linked polymorphic region (5&#8208;HTTLPR) contains two major variants (short and long) which have been implicated in modulating the susceptibility to MDD by altering the level of expression of SERT. Both variants contain C&#8208;rich repeats that conform to consensus i&#8208;motif folding sequences. i&#8208;Motifs are quadruplex DNA structures that have been proposed to have a role in transcriptional regulation. With spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that both alleles are able to form i&#8208;motifs at acidic pH, and at neutral pH under conditions of molecular crowding. This highlights the potential for i&#8208;motif formation to contribute to transcriptional regulation of the serotonin transporter, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulating CRISPR/Cas9 Function through Conditional Guide RNA Control</title>
      <dc:description>Conditional control of CRISPR/Cas9 has been developed using a variety of different approaches, many focusing on manipulation of the Cas9 protein itself. However, more recent strategies for governing CRISPR/Cas9 function are based on guide RNA (gRNA) modifications. They include control of gRNAs by light, small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides. These designs have unique advantages compared to other approaches and have allowed for precise regulation of gene editing and transcription.

      <title>Covalently Mercurated Molecular Beacon for Discriminating the Canonical Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>A highly nucleobase discriminating metalated nucleoside analog, 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;methylaniline, was incorporated into an oligonucleotide molecular beacon. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured after the addition of four different complementary strands, where the nucleobase opposite of the metalated analog varies. The fluorescence results showed a clear binding selectivity at room temperature, in the order G&gt;T&gt;C&gt;A. The selectivity is based on the different affinities between the metalated nucleoside analog and the canonical nucleobases. The synthesized probe is capable of robust discrimination between the two purine as well as the two pyrimidine bases by fluorescence at room temperature, and more sophisticated temperature analysis allows clear separation of every canonical nucleobase. The probe would, hence, be a suitable method for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms.</dc:description>

Importantly, we observed multiple nonenzymatic interconversions of these analogues in aqueous solutions and organic solvents. Furthermore, the same biosynthetic origin of these compounds was supported by one mined gene cluster. The dominant analogue (  1  ) demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to androgen&#8208;sensitive prostate cancer cells and HIF&#8208;depleted colorectal cells and mild antiaging activities, linking the bioactivity to oxidative stress.

      <title>Exploring epigenetic marks by analysis of non&#8208;covalent interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Epigenetic marks are modest chemical modifications on DNA and histone proteins that regulate the activation or silencing of genes, through modulation of the intermolecular interactions between the DNA strands and the protein machinery. The process is complex and not always well understood. One of the systems studied in greater detail is the epigenetic mark on H3K9: the lysine 9 of the histone 3. The degree of methylation or acetylation of this histone is linked to silencing or activation of the corresponding gene, but it is not clear which effect each mark has in gene expression. We shed light on this particular methylation process using density functional theory calculations (DFT) First, we built a model consisting of a DNA double strand containing three base pairs and a sequence of three amino acids of the histone&#8217;s tail. Then, we computed the modulation introduced in the intermolecular interactions by each epigenetic modification: from mono to tri&#8208;methylation and acetylation. The calculations show that while acetylation and tri&#8208;methylation results in a reduction of the DNA&#8208;peptide interaction; non&#8208;, mono&#8208;, and di&#8208;methylation increase the intermolecular interactions. Such observations compare well with the findings reported in the literature, highlighting the correlation between the balance of intermolecular forces and biological properties and advancing quantum mechanical studies of large biochemical systems at molecular level through the use of DFT methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Incorporation of halogenated amino acids into antibody fragments at multiple specific sites enhances antigen binding</title>
      <dc:description>The expansion of the amino&#8208;acid repertoire with synthetic derivatives introduces novel structures and functionalities into proteins. In the present study, we improved the antigen binding of antibodies by incorporating halogenated tyrosines at multiple selective sites. Tyrosines in the Fab fragment of an anti&#8208;EGF&#8208;receptor antibody 059&#8208;152 were systematically replaced with 3&#8208;bromo&#8208; and 3&#8208;chlorotyrosines, and simultaneous replacements at 4 specific sites were thus found to cause a 10&#8208;fold increase in the affinity toward the antigen. Structure modeling suggested that this effect was due to enhanced shape complementarity between the antigen and antibody molecules. On the other hand, we showed that chlorination in the constant domain, far from the binding interface, of Rituximab Fab also increased the affinity significantly (up to 17&#8208;fold). Our results showed that antigen binding is tunable with the halogenation&#160;in and out of the binding motifs.</dc:description>

In this minireview, we highlight several recent studies that illustrate how non&#8208;canonical amino acids have been used to capture and characterize reactive intermediates, fine&#8208;tune the catalytic properties of enzymes, and stabilize short&#8208;lived protein&#8208;protein complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Discovery of Six Ramoplanin Family Gene Clusters and the Lipoglycodepsipeptide Chersinamycin</title>
      <dc:description>Ramoplanins and enduracidins are peptidoglycan lipid intermediate II&#8208;binding lipodepsipeptides with broad&#8208;spectrum activity against methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Targeted genome mining using probes from conserved sequences within the ramoplanin/enduracidin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) was used to identify six microorganisms with BGCs predicted to produce unique lipodepsipeptide congeners of ramoplanin and enduracidin. Fermentation of&#160;  Micromonospora chersina  &#160;yielded a novel lipoglycodepsipeptide, called chersinamycin, which exhibited good antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria (1&#8208;2 &#181;g/mL) similar to the ramoplanins and enduracidins. The covalent structure of chersinamycin was determined by NMR and tandem mass spectrometry methods in conjunction with chemical degradation studies. These six new BGCs and isolation of a new antimicrobial peptide provide much&#8208;needed tools to investigate the fundamental aspects of lipodepsipeptide biosynthesis and to facilitate efforts to produce novel antibiotics capable of combating antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections.</dc:description>

      <title>Site Selective Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclized peptides have seen a rise in popularity in the pharmaceutical industry as drug molecules.

However, efficient methods of cyclization without the formation of side products have still remained a great challenge. Herein, we review the cyclization approaches that focus on site selective chemistry. Site selectivity in macrocyclization decreases the generation of side products, lending to a greater yield of desired peptide macrocycles.

      <dc:description>The thermostabilization of enzymes while retaining their activity and enantioselectivity for applied biocatalysis is an important topic in protein engineering. Rational and computational design strategies as well as directed evolution have been used successfully to thermostabilize enzymes. Here, we describe an alternative mutability&#8208;landscape approach that identified three single mutations (R11Y, R11I and A33D) within the enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), which has potential as a biocatalyst for pharmaceutical synthesis, that gave rise to significant increases in apparent melting temperature  T  m  (up to 20 &#176;C) and in half&#8208;life at 80 &#176;C (up to 111&#8208;fold). Introduction of these beneficial mutations in an enantioselective but thermolabile 4&#8208;OT variant (M45Y/F50A) afforded improved triple&#8208;mutant enzyme variants showing an up to 39 &#176;C increase in  T  m  value, with no reduction in catalytic activity or enantioselectivity.

      <dc:description>Anti&#8208;apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL&#8208;2) family proteins were proven targets for human cancers. Targeting the BH3&#8208;binding pockets of these anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins could reactivate apoptosis in BCL&#8208;2&#8208;depedent cancers. BFL&#8208;1 is a BCL&#8208;2 family protein overexpressed in various chemoresistant cancers. A unique cysteine at the binding interface of the BH3 and BFL&#8208;1 was previously proven as an intriguing targeting site to irreversibly inhibit BFL&#8208;1 functions with stabilized cyclic peptide bearing a covalent warhead. Recently, we developed a sulfonium tethered peptide cyclization strategy to construct peptide ligands which could selectively and efficiently react with cysteine(s) of target proteins nearby the interacting interface. Utilizing this method, we constructed a BFL&#8208;1 peptide inhibitor B4&#8208;MC, which could selectively conjugate with BFL&#8208;1 both in vitro and in cell.

      <title>Enantioselective Cascade Biocatalysis for Deracemization of Racemic &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols to Enantiopure (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols Employing Cyclohexylamine Oxidase and &#969;&#8208;Transaminase</title>
      <dc:description>Optically active &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols are very useful chiral intermediates frequently used in the preparation of pharmaceutically active substances. Herein, a novel cyclohexylamine oxidase (ArCHAO) was identified from the genome sequence of  Arthrobacter  sp. TYUT010&#8208;15 with the (  R  )&#8208;stereoselective deamination activity of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol. ArCHAO was cloned and successfully expressed in  E. coli  BL21, purified and characterized. Substrate specific analysis revealed that ArCHAO has high activity (4.15 to 6.34 U mg  &#8208;1  protein) and excellent enantioselectivity toward the tested &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Using the purified ArCHAO, a wide range of racemic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols were resolved, (  S  )&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols were obtained in &gt;99% ee. Deracemization of racemic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols was conducted by ArCHAO catalyzed enantioselective deamination and transaminase catalyzed enantioselective amination, affording (  S  )&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent conversion (78&#8208;94%) and enantiomeric excess value (&gt;99%). Preparative scale deracemization was carried out with 50 mM (6.859 g L  &#8210;1  ) racemic 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethanol, (  S  )&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethanol was obtained in 75% isolated yield and &gt;99%  ee  .</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optically active &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols are very useful chiral intermediates frequently used in the preparation of pharmaceutically active substances. Herein, a novel cyclohexylamine oxidase (ArCHAO) was identified from the genome sequence of  Arthrobacter  sp. TYUT010&#8208;15 with the (  R  )&#8208;stereoselective deamination activity of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol. ArCHAO was cloned and successfully expressed in  E. coli  BL21, purified and characterized. Substrate specific analysis revealed that ArCHAO has high activity (4.15 to 6.34 U mg  &#8208;1  protein) and excellent enantioselectivity toward the tested &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Using the purified ArCHAO, a wide range of racemic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols were resolved, (  S  )&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols were obtained in &amp;gt;99% ee. Deracemization of racemic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols was conducted by ArCHAO catalyzed enantioselective deamination and transaminase catalyzed enantioselective amination, affording (  S  )&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent conversion (78&#8208;94%) and enantiomeric excess value (&amp;gt;99%). Preparative scale deracemization was carried out with 50 mM (6.859 g L  &#8210;1  ) racemic 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethanol, (  S  )&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethanol was obtained in 75% isolated yield and &amp;gt;99%  ee  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>

      <title>Prebiotic origin of pre&#8208;RNA building blocks in a urea &#8220;warm little pond&#8221; scenario.</title>
      <dc:description>Urea appears to be a key intermediate of important prebiotic synthetic pathways. Concentrated pools of urea likely existed on the surface of the early Earth, as urea is synthesized in significant quantities from hydrogen cyanide or cyanamide (widely accepted prebiotic molecules), it has extremely high water solubility, and it can concentrate to form eutectics from aqueous solutions. The dual nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic character of urea makes it an ideal precursor for the formation of nitrogenous bases. We propose a model for the origin of a variety of canonical and non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, including some known to form supramolecular assemblies that contain Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;like base pairs. These reactions involve urea condensation with other prebiotic molecules (e.g., malonic acid) that could be driven by environmental cycles (e.g., freezing/thawing, drying/wetting). The resulting heterocycle assemblies are compatible with the formation of nucleosides and, possibly, the chemical evolution of molecular precursors to RNA. We show that urea eutectics at moderate temperature represent a robust prebiotic source of nitrogenous heterocycles. The simplicity of these pathways, and their independence from specific or rare geological events, support the idea of urea being of fundamental importance to the prebiotic chemistry that gave rise to life on Earth.</dc:description>

      <title>Simple analysis of primary and secondary bile salt hydrolysis in mouse and human gut microbiome samples using fluorogenic substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Animals produce bile to maximize absorption of lipophilic nutrients in the gut. The physical properties of bile are largely dictated by amphipathic bile salt molecules, which also participate in signalling pathways by modulating physiological processes upon binding host receptors. Upon excretion of bile salts from the gall bladder into the intestine, the gut microbiome can create metabolites with modified signaling capabilities. The category and magnitude of bile salt metabolism can have positive or negative effects on the host. A key modification is bile salt hydrolysis, which is a prerequisite for all additional microbial transformations. We have synthesized five different fluorogenic bile salts for simple and continuous reporting of hydrolysis in both murine and human fecal samples. Our data demonstrate that most gut microbiomes have the highest capacity for hydrolysis of host&#8208;produced primary bile salts, but some microbially modified secondary bile salts also display significant turnover.</dc:description>

      <title>NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) Complexes Containing &#945;&#8208;Oligothiophenes for Applications in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>The design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;active photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;based cancer treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a challenge. While several NIR&#8208;Ru(II) scaffolds have been reported, this approach has not been proven in cells. This is the first report of NIR&#8208;Ru(II) PSs that are phototoxic to cancer cells, including highly pigmented B16F10 melanoma cells. The PS family incorporated a bis(1,8&#8208;naphthyridine)&#8208;based ligand (tpbn), a bidentate thiophene&#8208;based ligand (nT; n=0&#8211;4), and a monodentate 4&#8208;picoline ligand (4&#8208;pic). All compounds absorbed light &gt;800 nm with maxima near 730 nm. Transient absorption (TA) measurements indicated that n&#8805;4 thiophene rings (4T) positioned the PDT&#8208;active triplet intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT) excited state in energetic proximity to the lowest lying triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT). 4T had low micromolar phototoxicity with PIvis and PI733nm values as large as 90 and 12, respectively. Spectroscopic studies suggested that the long&#8208;lived (&#964;TA=3&#8211;6 &#181;s) 3ILCT was accessible from the 3MLCT state, but energetically uphill in the overall photophysics. The study highlights that phototoxic effects can be achieved with NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) PSs as long as the reactive 3ILCT states are energetically accessible from the low&#8208;energy 3MLCT states. It also demonstrates that tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR light can be used to activate the PSs in highly pigmented cells where melanin attenuates shorter wavelengths of light.</dc:description>

      <title>Development of Gene&#8208;Targeted Polypyridyl Triplex Forming&#160;Oligonucleotide Hybrids</title>
      <dc:description>In the field of nucleic acid therapy there is major interest in the development of libraries of DNA&#8208;reactive small molecules which are tethered to vectors that recognize and bind specific genes.&#160;&#160;This approach mimics enzymatic gene&#8208;editors, such as ZFNs, TALENs and CRISPR&#8208;Cas, but overcomes limitations imposed by the delivery of a large protein endonuclease which is required for DNA cleavage.&#160;&#160;Here, we introduce a chemistry&#8208;based DNA cleavage system comprising an artificial metallo&#8208;nuclease (AMN) that oxidatively cuts DNA, and a triplex forming oligonucleotide (TFO) that sequence&#8208;specifically recognises duplex DNA.&#160;&#160;The AMN&#8208;TFO hybrids coordinate Cu(II) ions to form chimeric catalytic complexes that are programmable&#8212;based on the TFO sequence employed&#8212;to bind and cut specific DNA sequences.&#160;&#160;Use of the alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition &#8216;click&#8217; reaction allows scalable and high&#8208;throughput generation of hybrid libraries that can be tuned for specific reactivity and gene&#8208;of&#8208;interest knockout.&#160;&#160;As a first approach, we demonstrate targeted cleavage of purine&#8208;rich sequences, optimisation of the hybrid system to enhance stability, and discrimination between target and&#160;off&#8208;target sequences.&#160;&#160;Our results highlight the potential of&#160;this approach where the cutting unit, which mimics the endonuclease cleavage machinery, is directly bound to a TFO guide by click chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>An Engineered Escherichia coli Strain with Synthetic Metabolism for In&#8208;cell Production of Translationally Active Methionine Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>In the last decades, it became clear that the canonical amino acid repertoire codified by the universal genetic code is not up to the needs of the emerging biotechnologies. For such reason, extensive genetic code re&#8208;engineering is essential to expand the scope of ribosomal protein translation, leading to reprogrammed microbial cells equipped with an alternative biochemical alphabet to be exploited as potentially factories for biotechnological purposes. The prerequisite for this to happen is a continuous intracellular supply of non&#8208;canonical amino acids from simple and cheap precursors via synthetic metabolism. We engineered an  E. coli  bacterial system that fulfills these requirements through the reconfiguration of the methionine biosynthetic pathway and the introduction of an exogenous direct transsulfuration pathway. Our metabolic scheme operates  in vivo,  rescuing intermediates from core cell metabolism, and combining them with small bio&#8208;orthogonal compounds. Our reprogrammed  E. coli  strain is capable of in&#8208;cell production of  L&#8208;azidohomoalanine, which is directly incorporated into proteins in response to methionine codons. We thereby constructed a prototype suitable for economic, versatile, green sustainable chemistry, pushing towards enzyme chemistry and biotechnology&#8208;based production.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress in the Synthesis of Homogeneous Erythropoietin (EPO) Glycoforms</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting just what you want: The FDA&#8208;approved glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) is an important therapeutic agent and is manufactured by using recombinant protein synthesis, generating a mixture of glycoforms. We highlight recent alternative approaches employing chemical protein synthesis or semisynthesis that produce a single EPO glycoform, thus allowing the roles of the glycans to be more fully understood.







Abstract
Erythropoietin (EPO) has been regarded as a therapeutic glycoprotein for the clinical treatment of anaemia since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Commercial production of the 165&#8208;residue glycoprotein is by recombinant protein expression using mammalian cell lines that renders a complex mixture of glycoforms that have an identical amino acid sequence but variations in the structures of the pendant glycans. This heterogeneous nature of human recombinant EPO restricts structural and bioactivity studies in medicinal chemistry. Consequently, chemical synthesis provides an elegant approach for the preparation of complex homogeneous glycoproteins from a readily accessible pool of amino acids and sugars. In addition, the combination of chemical and biosynthesis enables robust and large&#8208;scale production of homogeneous EPO. The scope of this minireview is to summarise the recent advances in the chemical and semisyntheses of homogeneous EPO glycoforms, highlighting the versatile approaches to the preparation and structural manipulations of the carbohydrate chains incorporated into synthetic EPO glycoproteins.
