         <title>Stereodivergent Biocatalytic Formal Reduction of &#945;&#8208;Angelica Lactone to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone in a One&#8208;Pot Cascade</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formal asymmetric and stereodivergent enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone to both enantiomers of &#947;&#8208;valerolactone was achieved in a one&#8208;pot cascade by uniting the promiscuous stereoselective isomerization activity of Old Yellow Enzymes with their native reductase activity. In addition to running the cascade with one enzyme for each catalytic step, a bifunctional isomerase&#8208;reductase biocatalyst was designed by fusing two Old Yellow Enzymes, thereby generating an unprecedented case of an artificial enzyme catalyzing the reduction of nonactivated C=C bonds to access (R)&#8208;valerolactone in overall 41% conversion and up to 91% ee. The enzyme BfOYE4 could be used as single biocatalyst for both steps and delivered (S)&#8208;valerolactone in up to 84% ee and 41% overall conversion. The reducing equivalents were provided by a nicotinamide recycling system based on formate and formate dehydrogenase, added in a second step. This enzymatic system provides an alternative asymmetric approach to generate valuable chiral building blocks from an abundant bio&#8208;based chemical.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photocontrol of Microtubule Stability by Spiropyran&#8208;Conjugated Tau&#8208;Derived Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal modulation of microtubules by light has become an important aspect of the biological and nanotechnological applications of microtubules. We previously developed a Tau&#8208;derived peptide as a binding unit to the inside of microtubules. Here, we conjugated the Tau&#8208;derived peptide to spiropyran, which is reversibly converted to merocyanine by light, as a reversible photocontrol system to stabilize microtubules. Among the synthesized peptides with spiropyran/merocyanine at different positions, several peptides were bound to the inside of microtubules and stabilized the structures of microtubules. The peptide with spiropyran at the N&#8208;terminus induced polymerization and stabilization of microtubules, whereas the same peptide with the merocyanine form did not exert these effects. Reversible formation and dissociation of microtubules were achieved using the peptide with spiropyran conjugated at the N&#8208;terminus and irradiation with UV and visible light. Spiropyran&#8208;conjugated Tau&#8208;derived peptides would be useful for spatiotemporal modulation of microtubule stability through reversible photocontrol of binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycosphingolipid and Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Affect Each Other in and on the Cell</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosphingolipid (GSL) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) are the two major glycolipids expressed by eukaryotic cells, and their metabolisms share the same machineries. Moreover, both GSLs and GPI&#8208;anchored proteins (GPI&#8208;APs) are localized in the cholesterol&#8208;rich regions, namely the lipid rafts, of the cell membrane, where many other signaling molecules are compartmentalized as well. Therefore, the interaction between GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs and their interactions with other molecules in the lipid rafts are inevitable. This review is focused on the influences of GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs on each other&#8217;s biosynthesis, trafficking, cell membrane distribution, and biological functions, e.g., signal transduction.</dc:description>

Eclectic: Chemical biology has become an influential discipline thanks to synergistic relationships between students from diverse scientific backgrounds.

Abstract
Chemical biology has developed into an influential discipline in biological research, largely thanks to synergistic relationships that have arisen from the inclusion of students from diverse scientific backgrounds. We believe the greatest strengths of our field rely on active communication between fields and the fluency of chemical biologists in traversing them. In this special issue, besides cutting&#8208;edge chemical biology research articles, we will also highlight nonscientific topics about scientific training and mentorship to foster the training of next&#8208;generation chemical biologists.

         <title>Systematic investigation of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering efficiency in intestinal cells using a dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;monosaccharide conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) of cells with synthetic monosaccharides can introduce functionality to the glycans of cell membranes. Unnatural sugars (e.g., peracetylated mannose&#8208;azide) can be expressed on the cell surface with the azide group in place. After MOE, the azide group can participate in a copper&#8208;free click reaction with an alkyne (e.g., dibenzocyclooctyne, DBCO) probe. This allows the metabolic fate of monosaccharides in cells to be understood. However, in a drug delivery context it is desirable to have azide groups on the probe (e.g. a drug delivery particle) and the alkyne (e.g. DBCO) on the cell surface. Consequently, the labelling efficiency of intestinal cell lines (Caco&#8208;2 and HT29&#8208;MTX&#8208;E12) treated with N&#8208;dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;tetra&#8208;acetylmannosamine, and the concentration&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent labelling were determined. Furthermore, the labelling of mucus in HT29&#8208;MTX&#8208;E12 cells with DBCO was shown. This study highlights the potential for using MOE to target azide&#8208;functionalised probes to intestinal tissues for drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Chemoproteomics Reveals MARK2/3 as Cell Migration&#8208;Relevant Targets of the ALK Inhibitor Brigatinib</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metastasis poses a major challenge in cancer management, including EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;rearranged non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As cell migration is a critical step during metastasis, we assessed the anti&#8208;migratory activities of several clinical ALK inhibitors in NSCLC cells and observed differential anti&#8208;migratory capabilities despite similar ALK inhibition, with brigatinib displaying superior anti&#8208;migratory effects over other ALK inhibitors. Applying an unbiased in&#8208;situ mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomics approach, we determined the proteome&#8208;wide target profile of brigatinib in EML4&#8208;ALK+ NSCLC cells. Dose&#8208;dependent and cross&#8208;competitive chemoproteomics suggested MARK2 and MARK3 as relevant brigatinib kinase targets. Functional validation showed that combined pharmacological inhibition or genetic modulation of MARK2/3 inhibited cell migration. Consistently, brigatinib treatment induced inhibitory YAP1 phosphorylation downstream of MARK2/3. Collectively, our data suggest that brigatinib exhibits unusual cross&#8208;phenotype polypharmacology as, despite similar efficacy for inhibiting EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;dependent cell proliferation as other ALK inhibitors, it more effectively prevented migration of NSCLC cells due to co&#8208;targeting of MARK2/3.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Ligation&#8208;assisted Reconstitution of Split HRP Fragments for Facile Production of HRP fusion Proteins in E. coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is a pivotal biocatalyst for biosensor development and fine chemical synthesis. HRP proteins are mostly extracted and purified from the roots of horseradish because the solubility and productivity of recombinant HRP in bacteria are significantly low. In this study, we investigate the reconstitution system of split HRP fragments to improve its soluble expression levels in E. coli allowing the cost&#8208;effective generation of bioactive HRPs. To promote the effective association between two HRP fragments (HRPn and HRPc), we exploit SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry, a versatile protein coupling method with high affinity and selectivity. Each HRP fragment was genetically fused with SpyTag and SpyCatcher, respectively, exhibiting soluble production in the E. coli cytoplasm. The engineered split HRPs were effectively and irreversibly reconstituted into a biologically active and stable assembly that can catalyze intrinsic enzymatic reactions. Compared to the chaperone co&#8208;expression system, our approach shows that the degree of solubility enhancement of HRP is comparable, but the purity of the final product is relatively high. Therefore, our results can be applied to the high&#8208;yield production of recombinant HRP variants and other difficult&#8208;to&#8208;express proteins in bacteria without complex downstream processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Backbone Alteration in Non&#8208;hairpin &#946;&#8208;Turns: Impacts on Tertiary Folded Structure and Folded Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of &#946;&#8208;turns to protein folding has motivated extensive efforts to stabilize the motif with non&#8208;canonical backbone connectivity. Prior work has focused almost exclusively on turns between strands in a &#946;&#8208;sheet (i.e., hairpins). Turns in other structural contexts are also common in nature and have distinct conformational preferences; however, design principles for their mimicry remain poorly understood. Here, we report strategies that stabilize non&#8208;hairpin &#946;&#8208;turns through systematic evaluation of the impacts of backbone alteration on the high&#8208;resolution folded structure and folded stability of a helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix prototype protein. Several well&#8208;established hairpin turn mimetics are shown detrimental to folded stability and/or hydrophobic core packing, while less&#8208;explored modification schemes that reinforce alternate turn types lead to improved stability and more faithful structural mimicry. Collectively, these results have implications in control over protein folding through chemical modification as well as the design of protein mimetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taking Synthetic Biology to the Seas &#8211; From Blue Chassis Organisms to Marine Aquaforming</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oceans cover 71% of Earth&#8217;s surface and are home to hundreds of thousands of species, many of which are microbial. Knowledge about marine microbes has strongly increased in the past decades due to global sampling expeditions and hundreds of detailed studies on marine microbial ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry. However, the translation of this knowledge into biotechnological applications or synthetic biology approaches using marine microbes has been limited so far. This review highlights key examples of marine bacteria in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and outlines possible future work based on the emerging marine chassis organisms Vibrio natriegens and Halomonas bluephagenesis. Furthermore, the valorization of algal polysaccharides by genetically enhanced microbes is presented as an example for the opportunities and challenges associated with blue biotechnology. Finally, new roles for marine synthetic biology in tackling pressing global challenges, including climate change and marine pollution, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Characterization of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase using Sequence Similarity Network Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases&#160;(BVMOs) are important flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes which perform oxygen insertion reactions leading to valuable products. As reported in many studies, BVMOs are usually unstable during application, preventing a wider usage in biocatalysis. Here, we discovered a novel NADPH&#8208;dependent BVMO which originates from&#160;Halopolyspora algeriensis&#160;using sequence similarity networks (SSNs). The enzyme is stable at temperatures between 10&#176;C to 30&#176;C up to five days after the purification, and yields the normal ester product. In this study,the substrate scope was investigated for a broad range of aliphatic ketones and the enzyme was biochemically characterized to identify optimum reaction conditions. The best substrate (86% conversion) was 2&#8208;dodecanone using purified enzyme. This novel BVMO could potentially be applied as part of an enzymatic cascade or in bioprocesses which utilize aliphatic alkanes as feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Constraining and modifying peptides using Pd&#8208;mediated cysteine allylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, several strategies for inducing and stabilizing secondary structure formation in peptides have been developed to increase their proteolytic stability and their binding affinity to specific interaction partners. Here, we report how our recently introduced chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cysteine allylation reaction can be extended to stapling and how the resulting alkene&#8208;containing staples themselves can be further modified to introduce additional probes into such stabilized peptides. The latter is demonstrated by introducing a fluorophore as well as a PEG moiety into different stapled peptides using bioorthogonal thiol&#8208;ene and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Furthermore, we investigated structural implications of our allyl staples when used to replace conformationally relevant disulfide bridges. To this end, we chose a selective binder of integrin &#945;3&#946;1 (LXY3), which is only active in its cyclic disulfide form. We replaced the disulfide bridge by different stapling reagents in order to increase stability and binding affinity towards integrin &#945;3&#946;1</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global problem with more than 1 million deaths due to AMR infection in 2019 alone. New and innovative therapeutics are required to overcome this challenge. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a rapidly growing area of research poised to provide much needed help in the fight against AMR. aPDT works by administering a photosensitizer (PS), which is activated only when irradiated with light, allowing high spatiotemporal control and selectivity. The PS typically generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage a variety of key biological targets, potentially circumventing existing resistance mechanisms. Metal complexes are well known to display excellent optoelectronic properties and recent focus has begun to shift towards their application in tackling microbial infections. We herein review the last 5 years of progress in the emerging field of small molecule metal complex PSs for aPDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes for Cancer Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is an emerging cancer treatment methodology in which low&#8208;intensity ultrasound activates ultrasound&#8208;active chemical compounds termed sonosensitizers. Recently metal complexes have attracted much attention as new&#8208;generation sonosensitizers due to their tunable energetics. This concept article summarized the current developments in metal&#8208;based SDT. We also provided future outlook on this area of research.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for cancer treatment is gaining attention owing to its non&#8208;invasive property and ultrasound&#8216;s (US) deep tissue penetration ability. In SDT, US activates the sonosensitizer at the target deep&#8208;seated tumors to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which ultimately damage tumors. However, drawbacks such as insufficient ROS production, aggregation of sonosensitizer, off&#8208;target side effects, etc., of the current organic/nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers limit the effectiveness of cancer SDT. Very recently, metal complexes with tunable physiochemical properties (such as sonostability, HOMO to LUMO energy gap, ROS generation ability, aqueous solubility, emission, etc.) have been devised as effective sonosensitizers, which could overcome the limitations of organic/nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers. This concept introduces all the reported metal&#8208;based sonosensitizers and delineates the prospects of metal complexes in cancer sonodynamic therapy. This new concept of metal&#8208;based sonosensitizer can deliver next&#8208;generation cancer drugs.

This concept introduces all the reported metal-based sonosensitizers and delineates the prospects of metal complexes in cancer sonodynamic therapy. This new concept of metal-based sonosensitizer can deliver next-generation cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;biofilm Activity of Human Milk Oligosaccharides in Clinical Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae with Diverse Capsular and Sequence Types</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>

Shooting down a film: Purified human milk oligosaccharides have potent anti&#8208;biofilm activity against diverse colonizing and invasive clinical isolates of Group&#8197;B Streptococcus. HMOs can inhibit and dismantle biofilm in both invasive and colonizing strains of GBS, which is more clinically relevant than eradicating only their free&#8208;floating counterparts.







Abstract
Group&#8197;B Streptococcus (GBS) is an encapsulated Gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathogen that causes severe perinatal infections. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are short&#8208;chain sugars that have recently been shown to possess antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against a variety of bacterial pathogens, including GBS. We have expanded these studies to demonstrate that HMOs can inhibit and dismantle biofilm in both invasive and colonizing strains of GBS. A cohort of 30 diverse strains of GBS were analyzed for susceptibility to HMO&#8208;dependent biofilm inhibition or destruction. HMOs were significantly effective at inhibiting biofilm in capsular&#8208;type&#8208; and sequence&#8208;type&#8208;specific fashion, with significant efficacy in CpsIb, CpsII, CpsIII, CpsV, and CpsVI strains as well as ST&#8208;1, ST&#8208;12, ST&#8208;19, and ST&#8208;23 strains. Interestingly, CpsIa as well as ST&#8208;7 and ST&#8208;17 were not susceptible to the anti&#8208;biofilm activity of HMOs, underscoring the strain&#8208;specific effects of these important antimicrobial molecules against the perinatal pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae.

         <title>Acyltransferase Domain Exchange between Two Independent Type&#8197;I Polyketide Synthases in the Same Producer Strain of Macrolide Antibiotics</title>

Fair exchange: AT domain&#8208;swapping between two independent PKSs in the same producer strain resulted in the production of two new macrolide antibiotics without supply problems of the unique extender units or loss of cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells.







Abstract
Streptomyces graminofaciens A&#8208;8890 produces two macrolide antibiotics, FD&#8208;891 and virustomycin&#8197;A, both of which show significant biological activity. In this study, we identified the virustomycin&#8197;A biosynthetic gene cluster, which encodes type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKSs), ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA biosynthetic enzymes, methoxymalony&#8208;acyl carrier protein biosynthetic enzymes, and post&#8208;PKS modification enzymes. Next, we demonstrated that the acyltransferase domain can be exchanged between the Vsm PKSs and the PKSs involved in FD&#8208;891 biosynthesis (Gfs PKSs), without any supply problems of the unique extender units. We exchanged the malonyltransferase domain in the loading module of Gfs PKS with the ethylmalonyltransferase domain and the methoxymalonyltransferase domain of Vsm PKSs. Consequently, the expected two&#8208;carbon&#8208;elongated analog 26&#8208;ethyl&#8208;FD&#8208;891 was successfully produced with a titer comparable to FD&#8208;891 production by the wild type; however, exchange with the methoxymalonyltransferase domain did not produce any FD&#8208;891 analogs. Furthermore, 26&#8208;ethyl&#8208;FD&#8208;891 showed potent cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells, like natural FD&#8208;891.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Isocoumarin Derivatives Fusamarins is Mediated by the PKS8 Gene Cluster in Fusarium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusaria are plant&#8208;pathogenic fungi infecting several staple crops, and accumulating often toxic compounds during infection and hence threaten food security worldwide. The full chemical potential of these notorious pathogens is still elusive. Here, we characterized the previously cryptic PKS8 gene cluster and show that four genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of the dihydroisocoumarin derivates fusamarins with moderate cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
Fusarium mangiferae causes the mango malformation disease (MMD) on young mango trees and seedlings resulting in economically significant crop losses. In addition, F.&#8197;mangiferae produces a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs), including mycotoxins that may contaminate the harvest. Their production is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. Here, we show that lack of the H3&#8197;K9&#8208;specific histone methyltransferase, FmKmt1, influences the expression of the F.&#8197;mangiferae polyketide synthase (PKS) 8 (FmPKS8), a so far cryptic PKS. By a combination of reverse genetics, untargeted metabolomics, bioinformatics and chemical analyses including structural elucidation, we determined the FmPKS8 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and linked its activity to the production of fusamarins (FMN), which can be structurally classified as dihydroisocoumarins. Functional characterization of the four FMN cluster genes shed light on the biosynthetic pathway. Cytotoxicity assays revealed moderate toxicities with IC50 values between 1 and 50&#8197;&#956;M depending on the compound.

         <dc:description>
New modification in an old pathway: Using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, we report msms2io6A as a novel derivative of the ms2io6A biosynthesis pathway of tRNAs from S.&#8197;typhimurium. This new redox hydroxylation reaction depends on the activity of tRNA&#8208;hydroxylase enzyme MiaE.







Abstract
Post&#8208;transcriptional modifications of tRNA nucleotide are important determinants in folding, structure and function. We have successfully identified and characterized a new modified base named 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;methylenethio&#8208;N6&#8208;(cis&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyisopentenyl)adenosine, which is present at position 37 in some tRNAs. We also showed that this new modified adenosine is derived from the known 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;methylenethio&#8208;N6&#8208;(isopentenyl)adenosine nucleoside by a catalytic cycle of the tRNA&#8208;diiron monooxygenase, MiaE, present in Salmonella typhimurium.

         <title>Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa: Improving the Bioactivity of a p53/MDM2 Interaction Inhibitor by Introducing a Solvent&#8208;Exposed Methylene Group</title>

Look away. Modification of the p53/MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin&#8208;3a with an exocyclic methylene group generated the more potent inhibitor Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa. X&#8208;ray analysis of MDM2&#8208;bound Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa indicated that the exocyclic methylene group of Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa faces away from the protein surface. Our data suggest the introduction of exocyclic methylene groups as a possible approach by which to optimize the conformation of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Nutlin&#8208;3a is a reversible inhibitor of the p53/MDM2 interaction. We have synthesized the derivative Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa bearing an additional exocyclic methylene group in the piperazinone moiety. Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa is more active than Nutlin&#8208;3a against purified wild&#8208;type MDM2, and is more effective at increasing p53 levels and releasing transcription of p53 target genes from MDM2&#8208;induced repression. X&#8208;ray analysis of wild&#8208;type MDM2&#8208;bound Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa indicated that the orientation of its modified piperazinone ring was altered in comparison to the piperazinone ring of MDM2&#8208;bound Nutlin&#8208;3a, with the exocyclic methylene group of Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa pointing away from the protein surface. Our data point to the introduction of exocyclic methylene groups as a useful approach by which to tailor the conformation of bioactive molecules for improved biological activity.

         <title>Exploring the Flexibility of the Glycopeptide Antibiotic Crosslinking Cascade for Extended Peptide Backbones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) crosslinking is performed by cytochrome P450 (Oxy) enzymes and is essential for antibiotic activity. We show that these Oxy enzymes are tolerant of extension at the N but not the C termini of their peptide substrates. Alterations in peptide length were also able to alter the order of activity observed for the Oxy enzymes.







Abstract
The glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are a clinically approved class of antimicrobial agents that classically function through the inhibition of bacterial cell&#8208;wall biosynthesis by sequestration of the precursor lipid&#8197;II. The oxidative crosslinking of the core peptide by cytochrome&#8197;P450 (Oxy) enzymes during GPA biosynthesis is both essential to their function and the source of their synthetic challenge. Thus, understanding the activity and selectivity of these Oxy enzymes is of key importance for the future engineering of this important compound class. Recent reports of GPAs that display an alternative mode of action and a wider range of core peptide structures compared to classic lipid&#8197;II&#8208;binding GPAs raises the question of the tolerance of Oxy enzymes for larger changes in their peptide substrates. In this work, we explore the ability of Oxy enzymes from the biosynthesis pathways of lipid&#8197;II&#8208;binding GPAs to accept altered peptide substrates based on a vancomycin template. Our results show that Oxy enzymes are more tolerant of changes at the N terminus of their substrates, whilst C&#8208;terminal extension of the peptide substrates is deleterious to the activity of all Oxy enzymes. Thus, future studies should prioritise the study of Oxy enzymes from atypical GPA biosynthesis pathways bearing C&#8208;terminal peptide extension to increase the substrate scope of these important cyclisation enzymes.

         <title>Biochemical Analysis Leads to Improved Orthogonal Bioluminescent Tools</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
If you can stand the heat: The substrate selectivity and thermostability of mutant luciferases were analyzed by using a biochemical approach. Mutants derived from two popular luciferases, Pecan and Cashew, were made and assessed to find key residues for selectivity. The mutants were optimized by layering thermal stabilizing mutations. These mutants showed increased substrate preference and activity at higher temperatures. These new enzyme&#8211;substrate pairs provide a blueprint for engineering optimized imaging probes.







Abstract
Engineered luciferase&#8208;luciferin pairs have expanded the number of cellular targets that can be visualized in tandem. While light production relies on selective processing of synthetic luciferins by mutant luciferases, little is known about the origin of selectivity. The development of new and improved pairs requires a better understanding of the structure&#8722;function relationship of bioluminescent probes. In this work, we report a biochemical approach to assessing and optimizing two popular bioluminescent pairs: Cashew/d&#8208;luc and Pecan/4&#8242;&#8208;BrLuc. Single mutants derived from Cashew and Pecan revealed key residues for selectivity and thermal stability. Stability was further improved through a rational addition of beneficial residues. In addition to providing increased stability, the known stabilizing mutations surprisingly also improved selectivity. The resultant improved pair of luciferases are &gt;100&#8208;fold selective for their respective substrates and highly thermally stable. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of mechanistic insight for improving bioluminescent pairs and provides significantly improved Cashew and Pecan enzymes which should be immediately suitable for multicomponent imaging applications.

         <dc:description>
Fusaria are plant&#8208;pathogens known to produce various secondary metabolites (SMs). Yet, the majority of them is still cryptic due to low production levels in axenic culture, and even less are assigned to their respective biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Expression of such greatly depends on the chromatin structure that determines the accessibility of the associated DNA. Genetic manipulation of the histone H3K9&#8208;trimethyltransferase revealed the isocoumarin derivatives fusamarins, and allowed to assign these SMs to the respective BGC.

Glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) crosslinking is performed by cytochrome P450 (Oxy) enzymes and is essential for antibiotic activity. Here, we symbolise the process by which we screen for Oxy activity toward altered peptide substrates, which revealed that these enzymes are tolerant of extension at the N&#8208;termini of their peptide substrates.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Glycocalyx Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New advances in developing tools to engineer surface glycocalyx on live cells and donor organs have paved a transformative road towards glycotherapy for anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammation, and anti&#8208;autoimmune agents, as well as transplantation and other uses.







Abstract
A heavy layer of glycans forms a brush matrix bound to the outside of all the cells in our bodies; it is referred to as the &#8220;sugar forest&#8221; or glycocalyx. Beyond the increased appreciation of the glycocalyx over the past two decades, recent advances in engineering the glycocalyx on live cells have spurred the creation of cellular drugs and novel medical treatments. The development of new tools and techniques has empowered scientists to manipulate the structures and functions of cell&#8208;surface glycans on target cells and endow target cells with desired properties. Herein, we provide an overview of live&#8208;cell glycocalyx engineering strategies for controlling the cell&#8208;surface molecular repertory to suit therapeutic applications, even though the realm of this field remains young and largely unexplored.

         <title>Synthetic Multienzyme Assemblies for Natural Product Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing multienzyme complexes has become an effective way to optimize metabolic flux and increase the titer of natural products in metabolic engineering recently. In this review, we summarize strategies for constructing synthetic multienzyme complexes in microbial cells and their applications in promoting natural product biosynthesis.







Abstract
In nature, enzymes that catalyze sequential reactions are often assembled as clusters or complexes. The formation of multienzyme complexes, or metabolons, brings the enzyme active sites into proximity to promote intermediate transfer, decrease intermediate leakage, and streamline the metabolic flux towards the desired products. We and others have developed synthetic versions of metabolons through various strategies to enhance the catalytic rates for synthesizing valuable chemicals inside microbes. Synthetic multienzyme complexes range from static enzyme nanostructures to dynamic enzyme coacervates. Enzyme complexation optimizes the metabolic fluxes inside microbes, increases the product titer, and supplies the field with high&#8208;yield microbe strains that are amenable to large&#8208;scale fermentation. Enzyme complexes constructed inside microbial cells can be separated as independent entities and catalyze biosynthetic reactions ex vivo; such a feature gains these complexes another name, &#8220;synthetic organelles&#8221; &#8211; new subcellular entities with independent structures and functions. Still, the field is seeking new strategies to better balance dynamicity and confinement and to achieve finer control of local compartmentalization in the cells, as the natural multienzyme complexes do. Industrial applications of synthetic multienzyme complexes for the large&#8208;scale production of valuable chemicals are yet to be realized. This review focuses on synthetic multienzyme complexes that are constructed and function inside microbial cells.

         <title>Towards Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few proteins are known to be involved in drug&#8208;triggered ICD effects, some are related to ER stress and others imply new modes of action. Here, the triggering mechanisms underlying drug&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death along with the main biotargets and key mediators involved are reviewed.







Abstract
The discovery of immunogenic cell death (ICD) by small molecules (e.&#8201;g., chemotherapeutic drugs) intrigued medicinal chemists and led them to exploit anticancer agents with such a trait because ICD agents provoke anticancer immune responses in addition to their cytotoxicity. However, the unclear molecular mechanism of ICD hampers further achievements in drug development. Fortunately, increasing efforts have been made in this area in recent years by using either chemical or biological approaches. Here, we review the current achievements towards understanding the mechanisms of small molecule&#8208;induced ICD effects. Based on the established role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in ICD, we classify the mechanisms of different inducers by their dependency on UPR. Key proteins and pathways with important implications are discussed in depth. We also give our perspectives on the research strategies for future investigation in this field.

The design of artificial enzymes has emerged as a promising tool for the generation of potent biocatalysts able to promote new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions. This review aims to give a general overview of suitable protein scaffolds, that could be functionalized with an artificial moiety to develop versatile artificial catalysts.







Abstract
The design of artificial enzymes has emerged as a promising tool for the generation of potent biocatalysts able to promote new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions with improved catalytic performances, providing a powerful platform for wide&#8208;ranging applications and a better understanding of protein functions and structures. The selection of an appropriate protein scaffold plays a key role in the design process. This review aims to give a general overview of the most common protein scaffolds that can be exploited for the generation of artificial enzymes. Several examples are discussed and categorized according to the strategy used for the design of the artificial biocatalyst, namely the functionalization of natural enzymes, the creation of a new catalytic site in a protein scaffold bearing a wide hydrophobic pocket and de novo protein design. The review is concluded by a comparison of these different methods and by our perspective on the topic.

         <title>Missing Pieces in Structure Puzzles: How Hyperpolarized NMR Spectroscopy Can Complement Structural Biology and Biochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>

Accessing inaccessible spaces: The inclusion of hyperpolarized NMR in established experimental methods can provide complementary information about formerly inaccessible conformational spaces. Structural models under physiological conditions or of short&#8208;lived intermediates can be depicted in high detail through the use of hyperpolarized buffers, especially in the context of dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DDNP).







Abstract
Structure determination lies at the heart of many biochemical research programs. However, the &#8220;giants&#8221;: X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance, among others, leave quite a few dark spots on the structural pictures drawn of proteins, nucleic acids, membranes, and other biomacromolecules. For example, structural models under physiological conditions or of short&#8208;lived intermediates often remain out of reach of the established experimental methods. This account frames the possibility of including hyperpolarized, that is, dramatically signal&#8208;enhanced NMR in existing workflows to fill these spots with detailed depictions. We highlight how integrating methods based on dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization can provide valuable complementary information about formerly inaccessible conformational spaces for many systems. A particular focus will be on hyperpolarized buffers to facilitate the NMR structure determination of challenging systems.

         <title>Understanding the Interactions of Guanine Quadruplexes with Peptides as Novel Strategies for Diagnosis or Tuning Biological Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
G4s for control and diagnosis: We review the study of the specific interactions between G4 (either DNA or RNA) and small synthetic and natural peptides. In particular, we highlight the complementary role of spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling and simulation, while pointing out the future perspectives in the field.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid structures exhibiting a complex structural behavior and exerting crucial biological functions in both cells and viruses. The specific interactions of peptides with G4s, as well as an understanding of the factors driving the specific recognition are important for the rational design of both therapeutic and diagnostic agents. In this review, we examine the most important studies dealing with the interactions between G4s and peptides, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current analytic approaches. We also show how the combined use of high&#8208;level molecular simulation techniques and experimental spectroscopy is the best avenue to design specifically tuned and selective peptides, thus leading to the control of important biological functions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;G4s for control and diagnosis&lt;/b&gt;: We review the study of the specific interactions between G4 (either DNA or RNA) and small synthetic and natural peptides. In particular, we highlight the complementary role of spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling and simulation, while pointing out the future perspectives in the field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid structures exhibiting a complex structural behavior and exerting crucial biological functions in both cells and viruses. The specific interactions of peptides with G4s, as well as an understanding of the factors driving the specific recognition are important for the rational design of both therapeutic and diagnostic agents. In this review, we examine the most important studies dealing with the interactions between G4s and peptides, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current analytic approaches. We also show how the combined use of high-level molecular simulation techniques and experimental spectroscopy is the best avenue to design specifically tuned and selective peptides, thus leading to the control of important biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stairway to Stereoisomers: Engineering Short&#8208; and Medium&#8208;Chain Ketoreductases To Produce Chiral Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 6, March 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most chiral alcohols are generated in labs by using short&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductases. In the natural world, they produce biopolymers, active pharmaceutical intermediates and bioactive compounds. Different engineering and catalysis methods have helped turn these enzymes into effective catalysts; however, the ever&#8208;increasing number of new molecules with chiral centres entails an introspection into engineering these catalysts. This review attempts to encapsulate and summarize the structural hotspots focussed on obtaining chiral synthons of interest.







Abstract
The short&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamilies are responsible for most chiral alcohol production in laboratories and industries. In nature, they participate in diverse roles such as detoxification, housekeeping, secondary metabolite production, and catalysis of several chemicals with commercial and environmental significance. As a result, they are used in industries to create biopolymers, active pharmaceutical intermediates (APIs), and are also used as components of modular enzymes like polyketide synthases for fabricating bioactive molecules. Consequently, random, semi&#8208;rational and rational engineering have helped transform these enzymes into product&#8208;oriented efficient catalysts. The rise of newer synthetic chemicals and their enantiopure counterparts has proved challenging, and engineering them has been the subject of numerous studies. However, they are frequently limited to the synthesis of a single chiral alcohol. The study attempts to defragment and describe hotspots of engineering short&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenases/reductases for the production of chiral synthons.

         <title>Structural basis for activation of cobalt&#8208;carbon bond and control of adenosyl radical in coenzyme B12 catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or coenzyme B12 is a naturally occurring organometallic compound that serves as a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze intramolecular group&#8208;transfer reactions and ribonucleotide reduction in a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to animals. AdoCbl&#8208;dependent enzymes are radical enzymes and generate an adenosyl radical by homolysis of the coenzyme&#8217;s cobalt&#8208;carbon (Co&#8208;C) bond for catalysis. How do the enzymes activate and cleave the Co&#8208;C bond to form the adenosyl radical? How do the enzymes utilize the high reactivity of adenosyl radical for catalysis by suppressing undesirable side reactions? Our recent structural studies aimed to solve these problems with diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase established the crucial importance of steric strain of the Co&#8208;C bond and conformational stabilization of adenosyl radical for coenzyme B12 catalysis. We outline here our results obtained with these eliminating isomerases and compare them with those obtained with other radical B12 enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Computationally supported inversion of ketoreductase stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas directed evolution and rational design by structural inspection are established tools for enzyme redesign, computational methods are less mature but have the potential to predict small sets of mutants with desired properties without laboratory screening of large libraries. We have explored the use of computational enzyme redesign to change the enantioselectivity of a highly thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermus thermophilus in the asymmetric reduction of ketones. The enzyme reduces acetophenone to (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol. To invert the enantioselectivity, we used an adapted CASCO workflow which included Rosetta for enzyme design and molecular dynamics simulations for ranking. To correct for unrealistic binding modes, we used Boltzmann weighing of binding energies computed by a linear interaction energy approach. This computationally cheap method predicted four variants with inverted enantioselectivity, each with 6&#8208;8 mutations around the substrate&#8208;binding site, causing only modest reduction (2&#8208; to 7&#8208;fold) of kcat/KM values. Laboratory testing showed that three variants indeed had inverted enantioselectivity, producing (R)&#8208;alcohols with up to 99% enantiomeric excess. The broad substrate range allowed reduction of acetophenone derivatives with full conversion to highly enantioenriched alcohols. The results demonstrate the use of computational methods to control ketoreductase stereoselectivity in asymmetric transformation with minimal experimental screening.</dc:description>

To correct for unrealistic binding modes, we used Boltzmann weighing of binding energies computed by a linear interaction energy approach. This computationally cheap method predicted four variants with inverted enantioselectivity, each with 6-8 mutations around the substrate-binding site, causing only modest reduction (2- to 7-fold) of kcat/KM values. Laboratory testing showed that three variants indeed had inverted enantioselectivity, producing (R)-alcohols with up to 99% enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Incorporating a Polyethyleneglycol Linker to Enhance the Hydrophilicity of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Triphenylphosphonium Constructs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The targeting of bioactive molecules and probes to mitochondria can be achieved by coupling to the lipophilic triphenyl phosphonium (TPP) cation, which accumulates several hundred&#8208;fold within mitochondria in response to the mitochondrial membrane potential (Dym). Typically, a simple alkane links the TPP to its &#8220;cargo&#8221;, increasing overall hydrophobicity. As it would be beneficial to enhance the water solubility of mitochondria&#8208;targeted compounds we explored the effects of replacing the alkyl linker with a polyethylene glycol (PEG). We found that the use of PEG led to compounds that were readily taken up by isolated mitochondria and by mitochondria inside cells. Within mitochondria the PEG linker greatly decreased adsorption of the TPP constructs to the matrix&#8208;facing face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. These findings will allow the distribution of mitochondria&#8208;targeted TPP compounds within mitochondria to be fine&#8208;tuned.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Validation Approach for Tools to Study the DNA Repair Enzyme SNM1A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a two&#8208;step validation approach to evaluate the suitability of metal&#8208;binding groups for targeting DNA damage repair metalloenzymes, using model enzyme SNM1A. A fragment&#8208;based screening approach was first used to identify metal&#8208;binding fragments suitable for targeting the enzyme. Effective fragments were then incorporated into oligonucleotides via the copper&#8208;catalysed azidealkyne cycloaddition reaction. These modified oligonucleotides were recognised by SNM1A at &gt;1000&#8208;fold lower concentrations than their fragment counterparts. The exonuclease SNM1A is a key enzyme involved in the repair of interstrand crosslinks, a highly cytotoxic form of DNA damage. However, SNM1A and other enzymes of this class are poorly understood as there is a lack of tools available to facilitate their study. Our novel approach of incorporating functional fragments into oligonucleotides is broadly applicable to generate modified oligonucleotide structures with high affinity for DNA damage repair enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Etoposide&#8208;Entrapped Progesterone&#8208;Cationic Lipid Nanoaggregates as Selective Therapeutics against Etoposide&#8208;Resistant Colorectal Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug resistance majorly impacts the treatment of several cancers.&#160;&#160;This is mainly due to the overexpression of cellular drug efflux proteins. Hence, drug delivery systems that can avoid this resistance are needed. We report PR10, a progesterone&#8208;cationic lipid conjugate, as a self&#8208;assembling nanoaggregate that delivers etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor, as drug cargo selectively to cancer cells. In this study, we observed that etoposide nanoaggregates (P:E) caused selective and enhanced toxicity in etoposide&#8208;resistant CT26 cancer cells (IC50&#160;9&#160;mM) compared to when etoposide (IC50&#160;&gt; 20&#160;mM) was used alone. Concurrently, no toxicity was observed in etoposide&#8208;sensitive HEK293 for P:E treatment (IC50&#160;&gt; 20&#160;mM).&#160;&#160;The P:E&#8208;treated cancer cells seems to have no effect on ABCB1 expression, but etoposide&#8208;treated cells exhibited two&#8208;fold increase in ABCB1 expression, a potent efflux protein for several xenobiotic compounds. This observation supports the notion that the enhanced toxicity of P:E nanoaggregates is due to its ability to keep reduced expression of ABCB1, thus allowing longer intracellular residence of etoposide. In a BALB/c orthotopic colorectal cancer model, the nanoaggregates led to enhanced survival (45 days) as compared to etoposide&#8208;treated mice (39 days). These findings suggest that PR10 could be used as a potential cancer&#8208;selective etoposide delivery vehicle to treat several etoposide&#8208;resistant cancers with fewer side effects due to nonspecific toxicity of the drug.</dc:description>

In this study, we observed that etoposide nanoaggregates (P:E) caused selective and enhanced toxicity in etoposide-resistant CT26 cancer cells (IC50&#160;9&#160;mM) compared to when etoposide (IC50&#160;&amp;gt; 20&#160;mM) was used alone. Concurrently, no toxicity was observed in etoposide-sensitive HEK293 for P:E treatment (IC50&#160;&amp;gt; 20&#160;mM).&#160;&#160;The P:E-treated cancer cells seems to have no effect on ABCB1 expression, but etoposide-treated cells exhibited two-fold increase in ABCB1 expression, a potent efflux protein for several xenobiotic compounds. This observation supports the notion that the enhanced toxicity of P:E nanoaggregates is due to its ability to keep reduced expression of ABCB1, thus allowing longer intracellular residence of etoposide. In a BALB/c orthotopic colorectal cancer model, the nanoaggregates led to enhanced survival (45 days) as compared to etoposide-treated mice (39 days). These findings suggest that PR10 could be used as a potential cancer-selective etoposide delivery vehicle to treat several etoposide-resistant cancers with fewer side effects due to nonspecific toxicity of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection and Imaging of Active Substances in Early Atherosclerotic Lesions using Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atherosclerosis (AS) is a vascular disease caused by chronic inflammation and lipids, which is the main cause of myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is often difficult to detect in early stages due to the absence of clinically significant vascular stenosis. This is not conducive to the early intervention and treatment of the disease. Over the past decade, researchers have developed various imaging methods for the detection and imaging of atherosclerosis. At the same time, more and more biomarkers are being found that can be used as targets for detecting atherosclerosis. Therefore, the development of a variety of imaging methods and a variety of targeted imaging probes is an important project to achieve early assessment and treatment of atherosclerosis. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optical probes used to detect and target atherosclerosis imaging in recent years, and describes the current challenges and future development directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Bio&#8208;epoxidation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric epoxidation reactions of a variety of unactivated alkenes, including aliphatic chain olefins, cyclic olefins, and aromatic olefins, have been widely studied. This review lists three main types of engineered enzymes for the epoxidation reaction of unactivated alkenes, and discusses their substrate preference, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Optically active epoxides play important roles in pharmaceutical, agricultural and fine chemical syntheses. There are many chiral medications with pharmacodynamic activity in nature that can be synthesized by chiral epoxides. In recent years, researchers have developed a variety of biocatalysts for the asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes, which use oxygen or hydrogen peroxide as eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost oxidants, to provide better chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under moderate reaction conditions. In this paper, the advances, opportunities and challenges of the asymmetric epoxidation of unactive alkenes by biocatalyst are reviewed.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell MALDI&#8208;ToF MS Coupled with Untargeted Metabolomics Facilitates Investigations of Microbial Chemical Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screening microbial chemical interactions: A high&#8208;throughput whole&#8208;cell MALDI method has been developed for screening chemical interactions between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This enabled identification of natural product compounds produced by candidate airway probiotics (Bacillus&#8208;related strains isolated from the mouse respiratory tract) and a model respiratory pathogen (Burkholderia thailandensis) when cultured together in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
The emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens necessitates the development of new countermeasures. In this regard, the introduction of probiotics to directly attack or competitively exclude pathogens presents a useful strategy. Application of this approach requires an understanding of how a probiotic and its target pathogen interact. A key means of probiotic&#8208;pathogen interaction involves the production of small molecules called natural products (NPs). Here, we report the use of whole&#8208;cell matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MALDI&#8208;ToF) mass spectrometry to characterize NP production by candidate probiotics (mouse airway microbiome isolates) when co&#8208;cultured with the respiratory pathogen Burkholderia. We found that a Bacillus velezensis strain inhibits growth of and elicits NP production by Burkholderia thailandensis. Dereplication of known NPs detected in the metabolome of this B.&#8197;velezensis strain suggests that a previously unannotated bioactive compound is involved. Thus, we present the use of whole&#8208;cell MALDI as a broadly applicable method for screening the NP composition of microbial co&#8208;cultures; this can be combined with other &#8208;omics methods to characterize probiotic&#8208;pathogen and other microbe&#8208;microbe interactions.

         <title>Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: Drug Delivery Vehicles for Antidiabetic Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are promising nanomaterials for use in biomedical applications. MSN&#8208;based nanocomposites have been used to deliver antidiabetic drugs like insulin. The functionalisation properties of MSNs make them capable of co&#8208;delivery, controlled delivery and stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery. This review focuses on the delivery of antidiabetic therapeutics with special emphasis on the functionalisation of MSNs and stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are promising nanomaterials that are widely used in biomedical applications like drug delivery, diagnosis, bio&#8208;sensing and cell tracking. MSNs have been investigated meticulously in the drug&#8208;delivery field due to their unique chemical and pharmacokinetic properties, such as highly ordered mesopores, high surface area and pore volume, tuneable pore size, stability, surface functionalisation, and biocompatibility. MSN&#8208;based nanocomposites have been used to deliver therapeutic molecules like insulin, GLP&#8208;1, exenatide, DPP&#8208;4 inhibitor and plasmid&#8208;containing GLP&#8208;1 genes for managing diabetes mellitus for the last decade. The functionalisation properties of MSNs make them substantially capable of the co&#8208;delivery, controlled delivery and stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery of antidiabetic drugs. This review focuses on the delivery of antidiabetic therapeutics with special emphasis on the functionalisation of MSNs and stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery.

         <title>Metabolomics Reveals a &#8220;Trimeric&#8221; &#947;&#8208;Actinorhodin from Streptomyces coelicolor M145</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimeric actinorhodin discovery: The discovery of &#952;&#8208;actinorhodin was enabled by differing culture conditions of Streptomyces coelicolor and the use of high&#8208;resolution LC&#8211;MS/MS to perform extensive metabolomics analysis.







Abstract
Streptomyces coelicolor is a prolific producer of natural products and serves as a model organism for their study. It produces several pigmented antibiotics, the best&#8208;studied of which are the actinorhodins. We used a combination of liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS) and computational tools used for annotating the detected species (e.&#8201;g., spectral matching, in&#8208;silico predictors, molecular networking) to identify putative new actinorhodin analogs. These studies led to the discovery of the first trimeric benzoisochromanequinone, &#952;&#8208;actinorhodin (1). Further metabolomics analysis revealed that the relative amounts of shunt products produced were similar between the two growth conditions explored. This suggests that, while substantially different products were being produced, the biosynthetic gene clusters were similarly active. Overall, this work describes the discovery of the first trimeric benzoisochromanequinone and explores the biosynthetic processes that might lead to its production by metabolomics analysis of relevant intermediates.

         <title>Unique Crosslinking Properties of Psoralen&#8208;conjugated Oligonucleotides developed by Novel Psoralen N&#8208;Hydroxysuccinimide Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psoralens and their derivatives, such as trioxsalen, have unique crosslinking features to DNA. However, psoralen monomers do not have sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking ability with the target DNA. With the development of psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides (Ps&#8208;Oligos), sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking with target DNA has become achievable, thereby expanding the application of psoralen&#8208;conjugated molecules&#160;in gene transcription inhibition, gene knockout, and targeted recombination by genome editing. In this study, we developed two novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters that allow the introduction of psoralens into any amino&#8208;modified oligonucleotides.&#160;&#160;Quantitative evaluation of the photo&#8208;crosslinking efficiencies of the Ps&#8208;Oligos to target single&#8208;stranded DNAs revealed that the crosslinking selectivity to 5&#8208;mC is the unique feature of trioxsalen. We found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide&#160;via&#160;a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target double&#8208;stranded DNA. We believe our findings are essential information for the development of Ps&#8208;Oligos as novel gene regulation tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the chemical space of active&#8208;site targeted covalent ligands for protein tyrosine phosphatases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are an important class of enzymes that modulate essential cellular processes through protein dephosphorylation and are dysregulated in various disease states. There is demand for new compounds that target the active sites of these enzymes, for use as chemical tools to dissect their biological roles or as leads for the development of new therapeutics. In this study, we explore an array of electrophiles and fragment scaffolds to investigate the required chemical parameters for covalent inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Our analysis juxtaposes the intrinsic electrophilicity of these compounds with their potency against several classical PTPs, revealing chemotypes that inhibit tyrosine phosphatases while minimizing excessive, potentially non&#8208;specific reactivity. We also assess sequence divergence at key residues in PTPs to explain their differential susceptibility to covalent inhibition. We anticipate that our study will inspire new strategies to develop covalent probes and inhibitors for tyrosine phosphatases.</dc:description>

         <title>Derivatization of Mirror&#8208;image&#160;L&#8208;Nucleic Acids with 2'&#8208;OMe Modification for Thermal and Structural Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To further expand the functionality and enhance the stability of mirror&#8208;image nucleic acid as advanced agent for basic research and therapeutic design, we have synthesized the 2'&#8208;deoxy2'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;L&#8208;uridine phosphoramidites and incorporate it into L&#8208;DNA and L&#8208;RNA via solid&#8208;phase synthesis quantitatively. We found that the thermostability of L&#8208;nucleic acids is dramatically improved after introducing the modifications. Moreover, we successfully crystallized both L&#8208;DNA and L&#8208;RNA duplexes containing the 2'&#8208;OMe modifications and sharing the identical sequence. The crystal structure determination and analysis reveal the overall structures of the mirrorimage nucleic acids, and for the first time interpretate the structural deviation caused by 2'&#8208;OMe and 2'&#8208;OH groups in the oligonucleotides which are highly similar. This novel chemical modification of nucleic acid has the potential to be used to design nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutic and material in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering the Modular Architecture of Galectins Affects its Binding with Synthetic &#945;&#8208;Dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated Core M1 Glycoconjugates In situ</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multifunctionality of galectins helps regulate a broad range of fundamental cellular processes via cis&#8208;binding and trans&#8208;bridging activities and has gained widespread attention with respect to the importance of the natural specificity/selectivity of this lectin family to its glycoconjugate receptors. Combining galectin (Gal)&#8208;1, &#8208;3, &#8208;4, and &#8208;9 variant test panels, achieved via rational protein engineering, and a synthetic &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan (DG) O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptide library, a detailed comparative analysis was performed, utilizing microarray experiments to delineate the design&#8208;functionality relationships within this lectin family. Enhancement of prototype Gal&#8208;1 and chimera&#8208;type Gal&#8208;3 cis&#8208;binding toward the prepared ligands is possible by transforming these lectins into tandem&#8208;repeat type and prototypes, respectively. Furthermore, Gal&#8208;1 variants demonstrated improved trans&#8208;bridging capabilities between core M1 &#945;&#8208;DG glycopeptides and laminins in microarray, suggesting the possible translational applications of these galectin variants in the treatment of some forms of &#945;&#8208;dystroglycanopathy.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Biology Approaches Toward Precise Structure Control of IgG&#8208;based Antibody&#8208;Oligonucleotide Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates (AOCs) are important tools for drug development and biochemical analysis. However, the structural heterogeneity of AOCs synthesized through conventional coupling methods raises reproducibility and safety concerns in clinical trials. To address these issues, different covalent coupling approaches have been developed to synthesize AOCs with precise site&#8208;specificity and degree of conjugation. This concept article categorizes these approaches as linker&#8208;free or linker&#8208;mediated and provides details on their chemistry and potential applications. Several factors, including site&#8208;specificity, conjugation control, accessibility, stability, and efficiency, are highlighted when evaluating the pros and cons of these approaches. The article also discusses the future of AOCs, including the development of better conjugation chemistries to ensure stimuli&#8208;responsive release and the application of high&#8208;throughput methods to facilitate their development.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;based Ligands: Design, Synthesis and Their Utilization for Optical Assignment of Polymorphic Disease Associated Protein Aggregates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of ligands for detecting protein aggregates is of great interest, since these aggregated proteinaceous species are the pathological hallmarks of several devastating diseases, including Alzheimer&#180;s disease. In this regard, thiophene&#8208;based ligands have emerged as powerful tools for fluorescent assessment of these pathological entities. The intrinsic conformational sensitive photophysical properties of poly&#8208; and oligothiophenes have allowed for optical assignment of disease associated protein aggregates in tissue sections, as well as for real time in vivo imaging of protein deposits. Herein, we recount the chemical evolution of different generations of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, as well as exemplify their utilization for optical distinction of polymorphic protein aggregates. Furthermore, the chemical determinants for achieving superior fluorescent thiophene&#8208;based ligand, as well as the next generation of thiophene&#8208;based ligands targeting distinct aggregated species are described. Finally, the future research directions for the chemical design of thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can aid in resolving the scientific challenges around protein aggregation diseases are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Glycopeptides to Explore the Role of Mucin 1 Glycosylation in Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Posttranslational modifications affect protein biology in physiological and pathological conditions. Efficient methods for the preparation of peptides and proteins carrying defined, homogeneous modifications are fundamental tools for investigating these functions. In the case of Mucin 1 (MUC1) an altered glycosylation pattern is observed in carcinogenesis. To better understand the role of MUC1 glycosylation in interaction and adhesion of cancer cells, we prepared a panel of homogeneously O&#8208;glycosylated MUC1 peptides using a quantitative chemoenzymatic approach. Cell adhesion experiments with MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells on surfaces carrying up to 6 differently glycosylated MUC1 peptides demonstrated that different glycans significantly impact adhesion. This finding suggests a distinct role of MUC1 glycosylation patterns in cancer cell migration and/or invasion. To decipher the molecular mechanism for the observed adhesion we investigated conformation of the glycosylated MUC1 peptides by NMR. These experiments revealed only minor differences in peptide structure, therefore clearly relating the adhesion behaviour to the type and number of glycans linked to MUC1.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinformatic analysis of immobilized enzymes: towards a better understanding of the guiding forces</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein bioinformatics has been applied to a myriad of opportunities in biocatalysis, from enzyme engineering to enzyme discovery, but its application in enzyme immobilization is still very limited. Enzyme immobilization brings clear advantages form the sustainability and cost&#8208;efficiency terms but is nowadays still limited in its implementation. This, because it is a technique that remains tied to a quasi&#8208;blind protocol of trial and error, and therefore, is regarded as a time intensive and costly approach. Here, we present the use of a set of bioinformatic tools to rationalize results of protein immobilization that have been previously described. The study of this proteins through these new tools, allows the discovery of key driving forces in the process of immobilization that explain the obtained results, moving us a step forward to the final goal: predictive enzyme immobilization protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Activities of Major Families of Enzymes in Bacterial Peptidoglycan Assembly and Breakdown</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacteria encode multiple enzymes to build and break down the essential peptidoglycan polymer. We discuss recent biochemical characterisations of major peptidoglycan enzymes that elucidate their activities, substrate preferences, regulation and potential inhibition strategies. These insights are valuable for the development of peptidoglycan&#8208;targeting antibiotic drugs, as well as for harnessing the immune&#8208;stimulatory effects of bacterial peptidoglycan fragments.







Abstract
Serving as an exoskeletal scaffold, peptidoglycan is a polymeric macromolecule that is essential and conserved across all bacteria, yet is absent in mammalian cells; this has made bacterial peptidoglycan a well&#8208;established excellent antibiotic target. In addition, soluble peptidoglycan fragments derived from bacteria are increasingly recognised as key signalling molecules in mediating diverse intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;species communication in nature, including in gut microbiota&#8208;host crosstalk. Each bacterial species encodes multiple redundant enzymes for key enzymatic activities involved in peptidoglycan assembly and breakdown. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the biochemical activities of major peptidoglycan enzymes, including peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGT) and transpeptidases (TPs) in the final stage of peptidoglycan assembly, as well as peptidoglycan glycosidases, lytic transglycosylase (LTs), amidases, endopeptidases (EPs) and carboxypeptidases (CPs) in peptidoglycan turnover and metabolism. Biochemical characterisation of these enzymes provides valuable insights into their substrate specificity, regulation mechanisms and potential modes of inhibition.

         <title>Asymmetric Ene&#8208;Reduction by F420&#8208;Dependent Oxidoreductases B (FDOR&#8208;B) from Mycobacterium smegmatis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first investigation of asymmetric ene&#8208;reductions by FDOR&#8208;Bs and exploration of additional ene&#8208;reductase candidates from FDOR family will advance our understanding of FDORs as industrial biocatalysts. Due to their presence in a greater variety of bacterial genera than FDOR&#8208;A enzymes, FDOR&#8208;Bs are expected to offer greater versatility in the search for potent activity against industrially relevant substrates.







Abstract
Asymmetric reduction by ene&#8208;reductases has received considerable attention in recent decades. While several enzyme families possess ene&#8208;reductase activity, the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family has received the most scientific and industrial attention. However, there is a limited substrate range and few stereocomplementary pairs of current ene&#8208;reductases, necessitating the development of a complementary class. Flavin/deazaflavin oxidoreductases (FDORs) that use the uncommon cofactor F420 have recently gained attention as ene&#8208;reductases for use in biocatalysis due to their stereocomplementarity with OYEs. Although the enzymes of the FDOR&#8208;As sub&#8208;group have been characterized in this context and reported to catalyse ene&#8208;reductions enantioselectively, enzymes from the similarly large, but more diverse, FDOR&#8208;B sub&#8208;group have not been investigated in this context. In this study, we investigated the activity of eight FDOR&#8208;B enzymes distributed across this sub&#8208;group, evaluating their specific activity, kinetic properties, and stereoselectivity against &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds. The stereochemical outcomes of the FDOR&#8208;Bs are compared with enzymes of the FDOR&#8208;A sub&#8208;group and OYE family. Computational modelling and induced&#8208;fit docking are used to rationalize the observed catalytic behaviour and proposed a catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Replication Protein A Enhances Kinetics of Uracil DNA Glycosylase on ssDNA and Across DNA Junctions: Explored with a DNA Repair Complex Produced with SpyCatcher/SpyTag Ligation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA repair proteins participate in extensive protein&#8208;protein interactions that promote the formation of DNA repair complexes. To understand how complex formation affects protein function during base excision repair, we tested SpyCatcher/SpyTag ligation to produce a covalent complex between human uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2) and replication protein A (RPA). Our covalent &#8220;RPA&#8208;SpyUNG2&#8221; complex could identify and excise uracil bases in duplex areas next to ssDNA&#8208;dsDNA junctions slightly faster than the wild&#8208;type proteins, but this was highly dependent on DNA structure, as the turnover of the RPA&#8208;Spy&#8208;UNG2 complex slowed at DNA junctions where RPA tightly engaged long ssDNA sections. Conversely, the enzymes preferred uracil sites in ssDNA where RPA strongly enhanced uracil excision by UNG2 regardless of ssDNA length. Finally, RPA was found to promote UNG2 excision of two uracil sites positioned across a ssDNA&#8208;dsDNA junction, and dissociation of UNG2 from RPA enhanced this process. Our approach of ligating together RPA and UNG2 to reveal how complex formation affects enzyme function could be applied to examine other assemblies of DNA repair proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Peptide Enrichment From Complex Samples Using a Rink&#8208;Amide&#8208;Based Catch&#8208;and&#8208;Release Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uptake and processing of antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs) is a key step in the initiation of the adaptive immune response. Studying these processes is complex as the identification of low abundant exogenous antigens from complex cell extracts is difficult. Mass&#8208;spectrometry based proteomics &#8211; the ideal analysis tool in this case &#8211; requires methods to retrieve such molecules with high efficiency and low background. Here, we present a method for the selective and sensitive enrichment of antigenic peptides from APCs using click&#8208;antigens; antigenic proteins expressed with azidohomoalanine (Aha) in place of methionine residues. We here describe the capture of such antigens using a new covalent method namely, alkynyl functionalized PEG&#8208;based Rink amide resin, that enables capture of click&#8208;antigens via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne [2+3] cycloaddition (CuAAC). The covalent nature of the thus formed linkage allows stringent washing to remove a&#8208;specific background material, prior to retrieval peptides by acid&#8208;mediated release. We successfully identified peptides from a tryptic digest of the full APC proteome containing femtomole amounts of Aha&#8208;labelled antigen, making this a promising approach for clean and selective enrichment of rare bioorthogonally modified peptides from complex mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Investigation of a Foldamer based Iodine&#8208;Supported Artificial Glycosidases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosidases are a type of enzymes that hydrolytically cleave the carbohydrate and form glycans for biologically important processes. The inadequacy of glycosidases or their genetic abnormalities is responsible for various diseases. Thus, the development of the glycosidases mimetic is of great importance. We have designed and synthesized an enzyme mimetic containing L&#8208;phenylalanine, a&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), L&#8208;leucine, and m&#8208;Nifedipine. From X&#8208;ray crystallography, the foldamer adopts a b&#8208;hairpin conformation stabilized by two 10&#8208;members and one 18&#8208;member NH&#8230;.O=C hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the foldamer was found to be highly efficient to hydrolyses ethers and glycosides in the presence of iodine at room temperature. Further, from X&#8208;ray analysis, the backbone conformation of the enzyme mimetic is almost unchanged after the glycosidases reaction. This is the first example of an iodine&#8208;supported artificial glycosidase activity with an enzyme mimic at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing covalent catalytic intermediates by enzyme mutants: recent advances in methodologies and applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent catalytic intermediates provide valuable information to reveal the catalytic mechanism, probe the enzyme activity and identify substrate specificity. However, naturally formed covalent intermediates are too rapidly degraded for general biological studies. In order to capture transient covalent intermediates, a variety of chemical strategies are developed over decades to extend the half&#8208;life of enzyme&#8208;substrate intermediates (or close analogues) required for the downstream structural and functional studies. This review summarizes three general mechanism&#8208;based strategies for trapping covalent catalytic intermediates. In particular, the enzyme mutant&#8208;based approaches, especially the introduction of genetically encoded 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid to replace the catalytic cysteine/serine in proteases for acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate trapping are described. In addition, the applications of trapped intermediates in structural, functional and protein labelling studies are presented, and the potential new directions of utilizing enzyme substrate traps are discussed at the end of the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Resorc[4]arene modifiers for supramolecular site&#8208;directed immobilization of antibodies on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the main problems in developing immunosensors featuring carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is immobilizing antibodies (Abs) onto the CNT surface to afford selective binding to target antigens (Ags). In this work, we developed a practical supramolecular Ab conjugation strategy based on resorc[4]arene modifiers. To improve the Ab orientation on the CNTs surface and optimizing the Ab/Ag interaction, we exploited the host&#8208;guest approach by synthesizing two newly resorc[4]arene linkers R1 and R2via well&#8208;established procedures. The upper rim was decorated with eight methoxyl groups to promote selective recognition of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the Ab. Moreover, the lower rim was functionalized with 3&#8208;bromopropyloxy or 3&#8208;azidopropiloxy substituents to bind the macrocycles on the multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) surface. Accordingly, several chemical modifications of MWCNTs were evaluated. After the morphological and electrochemical characterization of nanomaterials, the resorc[4]arene&#8208;modified MWCNTs were deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode surface to evaluate their potential applicability for label&#8208;free immunosensor development. The most promising system showed an improved electrode active area (AEL) of almost 20% and a site&#8208;oriented immobilization of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein S1 antibody (Ab&#8208;SPS1). The developed immunosensor revealed a good sensitivity (23.64 &#181;A mL ng&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) towards the SPS1 antigen and a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.01 ng mL&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive and Reversible A&#8208;motif Based DNA Hydrogel: Synthesis and Biosensing Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report&#160;an A&#8208;motif functional DNA hydrogel that does not require any sequence design. A&#8208;motif DNA is a non&#8208;canonical parallel DNA duplex structure comprises homopolymeric deoxyadenosines (poly&#8208;dA) strands which undergo conformational changes from single strands at neutral pH to a parallel duplex DNA helix at acidic pH.&#160; We successfully synthesized DNA hydrogel utilizing A&#8208;motif as a reversible handle to polymerize DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ). The composed A&#8208;motif hydrogel was initially characterized by electro mobility shift assay (EMSA), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), which shows that the formation of higher&#8208;order structures. Further, we utilized imaging techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) validating its hydrogel like highly branched morphology. pH&#8208;induced conformational transformation from monomers to gel is quick and reversible, and was analysed for multiple acid&#8208;base cycles. The sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel transitions and gelation properties is further examined using rheological studies. The use of A&#8208;motif hydrogel in the visual detection of pathogenic target nucleic acid sequence is demonstrated for the first time using the capillary assay. Moreover, the pH&#8208;induced hydrogel formation is observed&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;as a layer over the mammalian cells. The proposed A&#8208;motif DNA scaffold has enormous potential in designing stimuli&#8208;responsive nanostructures that can be utilized for many biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Approach for the Isolation and Immobilization of a Recombinant Transaminase: Applying an Advanced Nanocomposite System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In one go: Combining nanoparticles with affinity tags and polymeric nanofibers provides an advanced nanocomposite that allows the isolation and immobilization a recombinant enzyme. The developed method reduced the time and cost required for enzyme isolation, purification and immobilization compared to a classical stepwise technique.







Abstract
The increasing application of recombinant enzymes demands not only effective and sustainable fermentation, but also highly efficient downstream processing and further stabilization of the enzymes by immobilization. In this study, a novel approach for the isolation and immobilization of His&#8208;tagged transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvTA) has been developed. A recombinant of CvTA was simultaneously isolated and immobilized by binding on silica nanoparticles (SNPs) with metal affinity linkers and additionally within poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanofibers. The linker length and the nature of the metal ion significantly affected the enzyme binding efficiency and biocatalytic activity of CvTA&#8208;SNPs. The formation of PLA nanofibers by electrospinning enabled rapid embedding of CvTA&#8208;SNPs biocatalysts and ensured enhanced stability and activity. The developed advanced immobilization method reduces the time required for enzyme isolation, purification and immobilization by more than fourfold compared to a classical stepwise technique.

         <title>Modulation of A&#946;42 Aggregation Kinetics and Pathway by Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extraneuronal deposition of amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigate the effect of modulators and inhibitors on early&#8208;stage A&#946;42 aggregation. A differential impact was observed in terms of monomer consumption by real&#8208;time solution NMR spectroscopy and fibril formation by thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence change. Further structural information was provided by transmission electron microscopy.







Abstract
The aggregation of amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) is directly related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we have investigated the early stages of the aggregation process, during which most of the cytotoxic species are formed. A&#946;42 aggregation kinetics, characterized by the quantification of A&#946;42 monomer consumption, were tracked by real&#8208;time solution NMR spectroscopy (RT&#8208;NMR) allowing the impact that low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) inhibitors and modulators exert on the aggregation process to be analysed. Distinct differences in the A&#946;42 kinetic profiles were apparent and were further investigated kinetically and structurally by using thioflavin&#8197;T (ThT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. LMW inhibitors were shown to have a differential impact on early&#8208;state aggregation. Insight provided here could direct future therapeutic design based on kinetic profiling of the process of fibril formation.

         <title>Advances in synthetic biology of fungi and contributions to the discovery of new molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sequencing of fungal genomes is becoming increasingly accessible, with a wealth of data already available. In parallel, the prediction of putative biosynthetic pathways responsible for the synthesis of potential new natural products is also increasing. The difficulty of translating computational analyses into available compounds is becoming evident, slowing down a process that was thought to be faster with the advent of the genomic era. Advances in gene techniques made it possible to genetically modify a wider range of organisms, including fungi typically considered recalcitrant to DNA manipulation. However, the possibility of screening many gene cluster products for new activities in a high&#8208;throughput manner remains unfeasible. Nonetheless, some updates on the synthetic biology of fungi may provide interesting insights that could help to achieve this goal in the future.</dc:description>

Advances in gene techniques made it possible to genetically modify a wider range of organisms, including fungi typically considered recalcitrant to DNA manipulation. However, the possibility of screening many gene cluster products for new activities in a high-throughput manner remains unfeasible. Nonetheless, some updates on the synthetic biology of fungi may provide interesting insights that could help to achieve this goal in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tracking the Message: Applying Single Molecule Localization Microscopy to Cellular RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA function is increasingly appreciated to be more complex than merely communicating between DNA sequence and protein structure. RNA localization has emerged as a key contributor to the intricate roles RNA plays in the cell, and the link between dysregulated spatiotemporal localization and disease warrants an exploration beyond sequence and structure. However, the tools needed to visualize RNA with precise resolution are lacking in comparison to methods available for studying proteins. In the past decade, many techniques have been developed for imaging RNA, and in parallel super resolution and single&#8208;molecule techniques have enabled imaging of single molecules in cells. Of these methods, single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has shown significant promise for probing RNA localization. In this review, we highlight current approaches that allow super resolution imaging of specific RNA transcripts and summarize challenges and future opportunities for developing innovative RNA labeling methods that leverage the power of SMLM.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Membrane Transport in Polymeric Biomimetic Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling membrane permeability: Polymeric biomimetic nanoreactors are compartmentalized catalytic systems with applications in nanomedicine and biomimicry. Membrane permeability of biomimetic nanoreactors is a key feature that determines their function and applicability. This article describes strategies to control membrane permeability and highlights applications of these systems as artificial organelles and in biomedicine.







Abstract
Polymersome&#8208;based biomimetic nanoreactors (PBNs) have generated great interest in nanomedicine and cell mimicry due to their robustness, tuneable chemistry, and broad applicability in biologically relevant fields. In this concept review, we mainly discuss the state of the art in functional polymersomes as biomimetic nanoreactors with membrane&#8208;controlled transport. PBNs that use environmental changes or external stimuli to adjust membrane permeability while maintaining structural integrity are highlighted. By encapsulating catalytic species, PBNs are able to convert inactive substrates into functional products in a controlled manner. In addition, special attention is paid to the use of PBNs as tailored artificial organelles with biomedical applications in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, facilitating the fabrication of next&#8208;generation artificial organelles as therapeutic nanocompartments.

         <title>A Nucleophilic Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Profiling of PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first activity&#8208;based probe for PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes is reported. The trifunctional probe contains an N&#8208;hydroxyalanine warhead, a linear diazirine, and an alkyne to enable enrichment. The essential protein LysA was identified as the primary target of the probe.







Abstract
PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes represent an important class of highly &#8220;druggable&#8221; enzymes that perform a wide array of critical reactions to support all organisms. Inhibition of individual members of this family of enzymes has been validated as a therapeutic target for pathologies ranging from infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis to epilepsy. Given the broad nature of the activities within this family of enzymes, we envisioned a universally acting probe to characterize existing and putative members of the family that also includes the necessary chemical moieties to enable activity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments. Hence, we developed a probe that contains an N&#8208;hydroxyalanine warhead that acts as a covalent inhibitor of PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, a linear diazirine for UV crosslinking, and an alkyne moiety to enable enrichment of crosslinked proteins. Our molecule was used to study PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes in&#8197;vitro as well as look at whole&#8208;cell lysates of M. tuberculosis and assess inhibitory activity. The probe was able to enrich and identify LysA, a PLP&#8208;dependent enzyme crucial for lysine biosynthesis, through mass spectrometry. Overall, our study shows the utility of this trifunctional first&#8208;generation probe. We anticipate further optimization of probes for PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes will enable the characterization of rationally designed covalent inhibitors of PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, which will expedite the preclinical characterization of these important therapeutic targets.

         <title>Type II Polyketide Synthases: A Bioinformatics&#8208;Driven Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinformatics has become an indispensable tool for natural products research in the genomic era. One of the key challenges is to accurately convert sequence data of a biosynthetic gene cluster into chemical information such as the enzymatic function or the biosynthetic product structure. Type II polyketide synthase is the most bioinformatically well&#8208;studied class of non&#8208;modular biosynthetic machinery and represents a model system to showcase bioinformatic applications in natural products research. This review takes a bioinformatics&#8208;centered perspective and summarizes the past advances and future opportunities of bioinformatics&#8208;guided research on type II polyketide synthases. How bioinformatics has contributed to deepen the chemical understanding of type II PKSs will be discussed with the focus on enzymology, evolution, structural prediction of the biosynthetic products, genome mining, and the global analyses of their polyketide products.</dc:description>

Unfortunately, direct assessment of nPTMs in native environment is extremely challenging due to the heterogeneity of adducts and the lack of tagging tools. Given these challenges,bioorthogonal probes (BPs) have been developed for the analysis of nPTMs. The rationality is that BPs could selectively install azides or alkynes into nPTMs as a biorthogonal handle for the following enrichment or tracking. Herein, we review the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of BPs used for nPTMs studies, clarify their working principles, and highlight how they advance our understanding of the biological functions of nPTMs.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of chemical modifications on the nucleic acid scaffold has allowed for the progress of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the clinic for the treatment of a variety of disorders. In contribution to the repertoire of gene&#8208;silencing nucleic acid modifications, herein we report the synthesis and incorporation of C5&#8208;propynyl arabinouridine (araUP) and arabinocytidine (araCP) into mixed&#8208;base ASOs containing a pyrimidine core. Substitution of the core with araUP and araCP resulted in stabilization of the duplex formed with RNA but not with DNA. Similar results were obtained with ASOs bearing phosphorothioate linkages or methoxyethyl (MOE) wings in a gapmer design. All modified ASOs were compatible with E. coli RNase H mediated degradation of target RNA. Substitution of DNA for araUP and araCP in the central portion of a gapmer with MOE wings demonstrated improved nuclease resistance. These results suggest C5&#8208;modified arabinonucleic acids may serve as a potential chemical modification for therapeutic ASOs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organic&#160;p&#8208;systems with strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are promising candidates for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT).&#160;&#160;However, the synthesis of NIR&#160;p&#8208;systems involves several steps and many of them display poor photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE). Here we present the synthesis of a tetraimide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor NIR&#160;p&#8208;system,&#160;2EHex&#8208;B&#160;having absorbance in the range of 350&#8208;900 nm. Importantly,&#160;2EHex&#8208;B&#160;is synthesized in two steps with a 70% high yield. Moreover,&#160;2EHex&#8208;B&#160;shows excellent PTCE up to 50% and good biocompatibility when encapsulated in liposomes. The liposome coated&#160;2EHex&#8208;B, (L&#8208;2EHex&#8208;B)&#160;showed good thermal stability and efficiently kills cancer cells via PTT. Additionally,&#160;L&#8208;2EHex&#8208;B&#160;shows good reactive singlet oxygen generation ability when irradiated with a 750 nm laser. 3D cell culture model &#8208; multicellular spheroids test was performed to evaluate the efficiency of PTT. The spheroids treated with&#160;L&#8208;2EHex&#8208;B&#160;after NIR light irradiation showed increased cell death from the core of the tumor toward the periphery. The easy access to&#160;2EHex&#8208;B&#160;makes it a potential candidate for minimally invasive cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying Reversible Protein Post&#8208;translational Modification through Co&#8208;translational Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical biology tools have transformed the field of epigenetics. In this Concept, genetically modified organisms for epigenetic studies are discussed along with how genetic code expansion technology is used to introduce particular co&#8208;translationally modified amino acids to genetically modified organisms. This strategy provides promising alternative avenues for deciphering the regulation and mechanism of PTMs in a native chromatin environment.







Abstract
Understanding the post&#8208;translational modifications of targeted proteins is of great significance for manipulating the physiological processes of eukaryotes. Chemical biology tools have been used to investigate the biological roles of those post&#8208;translational modifications at particular sites, especially genetic code expansion technology, which can also be combined with the concept of synthetic biology to generate a genetically modified organism with a synthetic auxotroph for co&#8208;translational modification components. In this concept, we will introduce applications, limitations, and perspectives of genetic code expansion technology for studying post&#8208;translational modification based on recent progresses. Future perspectives of genetically modified organisms also will be discussed in regard to the application of post&#8208;translational modification research.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled DNA Nanocages Promote Cell Migration and Differentiation of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping up: DNA nanocages get taken up into endothelial cells where they stimulate endothelial cell differentiation and migration. This could have potential application in angiogenesis. Moreover, changing the topology of the nanocage can have an influence on this take up, differentiation and migration.







Abstract
DNA nanocages have been explored for abilities to influence cellular behavior and functions. Recent times have seen the development of new emergent functionalities of DNA nanodevices as a class of biomaterials with an immense capacity to interface with biological systems and with vast potential in disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Being chemically robust and biocompatible in nature, DNA nanocages have been surface modified and structurally fine&#8208;tuned to find emerging applications in the field of stem&#8208;cell therapy and tissue regeneration. DNA nanocages can be used for therapeutic angiogenesis that involves the induction of blood vessel formation and can be used to treat ischemic diseases like stroke or heart failure. This work addresses the effect of DNA nanocages&#8217; structural topology on their capacity to stimulate endothelial cell angiogenesis. We tested a panel of four DNA nanocage geometries and checked their potential on the differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). While different DNA nanocage geometries showed successful induction of angiogenesis and cell migration in HUVECs, tetrahedral DNA cages showed the maximum uptake and angiogenesis potential, thus indicating that not only the composition of materials, but also the 3D arrangement of ligands might play role in stimulating angiogenesis.

         <title>Genetic Encoding of a Photocaged Histidine for Light&#8208;Control of Protein Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling histidine&#8208;containing proteins: The addition of photocaged histidine to the genetic code enables light&#8208;based control of protein function in bacteria and mammalian cells.







Abstract
The use of light to control protein function is a critical tool in chemical biology. Here we describe the addition of a photocaged histidine to the genetic code. This unnatural amino acid becomes histidine upon exposure to light and allows for the optical control of enzymes that utilize active&#8208;site histidine residues. We demonstrate light&#8208;induced activation of a blue fluorescent protein and a chloramphenicol transferase. Further, we genetically encoded photocaged histidine in mammalian cells. We then used this approach in live cells for optical control of firefly luciferase and, Renilla luciferase. This tool should have utility in manipulating and controlling a wide range of biological processes.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical imaging techniques are widely used to detect, locate, and track the growth or shrinkage of cancerous tumors. Although these techniques have shown impressive results, they often come with health risks due to the use of toxic contrast agents or ionizing radiation. To address these limitations, research efforts have been focused on the development of new imaging techniques. Among the emerging medicinal methods, photoacoustic imaging is receiving much attention.

         <title>Isotope&#8208;guided metabolomics reveals divergent incorporation of valine into different flavor precursor classes in chives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plants of the genus Allium such as chives, onions or garlic produce S&#8208;alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides as flavor precursors. Two major representatives are S&#8208;propenyl cysteine sulfoxide (isoalliin) and S&#8208;propyl cysteine sulfoxide (propiin), which only differ by a double bond in the C3 side chain. The propenyl group of isoalliin is derived from the amino acid valine, but the source of the propyl group of propiin remains unclear. Here, we present an untargeted metabolomics approach in seedlings of chives (Allium schoenoprasum) to track mass features containing sulfur and/or 13C from labeling experiments with valine&#8208;13C5 guided by their isotope signatures. Our data show that propiin and related propyl&#8208;bearing metabolites incorporate carbon derived from valine&#8208;13C5, but to a much lower extent than isoalliin and related propenyl compounds. Our findings provide new insights into the biosynthetic pathways of flavor precursors in Allium species and open new avenues for future untargeted labeling experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for synthesizing and enhancing&#160; the immune response of cancer vaccines based on MUC1 glycopeptide antigens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer vaccines are based on a vaccinology strategy whereby the patient&#8217;s immune system is harnessed to induce a specific immune response to kill cancer cells and comprises two categories: prophylactic and therapeutic. Glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1), which is overexpressed and poorly glycosylated on cancer cells, is one of the most promising candidates for the development of new cancer vaccines. However, it should be noted that mucin&#8208;like glycopeptides are poorly immunogenic and unable to elicit effective and long&#8208;lasting immune responses. Therefore, MUC1&#8208;derived tumor antigens need to be conjugated with immune activators. This review focuses on the synthesis of MUC1 glycopeptides, provides an overview of recently advanced designs of vaccines based on MUC1, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the various strategies devised to date.</dc:description>

         <title>HaloTag&#8208;based reporters for fluorescence imaging and biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing the structure and dynamics of biomolecules is critical to understand biological function, and requires methods to fluorescently label targets of interest in their cellular context. Self&#8208;labelling proteins, which combine a genetically encoded tag with a small&#8208;molecule fluorophore, have attracted considerable attention for this purpose, as they can overcome limitations of fluorescent proteins. Among them, the HaloTag protein is the most broadly used, showing fast specific labelling with a small, easy to functionalize and cell&#8208;permeant ligand. Synthetic chemistry and protein engineering have provided a portfolio of powerful imaging tools exploiting HaloTag, along with general methods to optimize and adapt them to specific applications. Here, we provide an overview of fluorescent reporters based on the HaloTag protein for imaging and biosensing, highlighting engineering strategies and general applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Biocatalytic Synthesis of Aromatic Acid CoA Thioesters utilizing Microbial Aromatic Acid CoA Ligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically labile ester linkages can be introduced into lignin by incorporation of monolignol conjugates, which are synthesized in planta by acyltransferases that use a coenzyme A (CoA) thioester donor and a nucleophilic monolignol alcohol acceptor. The presence of these esters facilitates processing and aids in the valorization of renewable biomass feedstocks. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is potentially limited by the low steady&#8208;state levels of aromatic&#8208;acid thioester donors in plants. As part of an effort to overcome this, aromatic&#8208;acid CoA ligases involved in microbial aromatic degradation were identified and screened against a broad panel of substituted&#8208;cinnamic and benzoic acids involved in plant lignification. Functional fingerprinting of this ligase library identified four robust highly active enzymes capable of facile, rapid, and high&#8208;yield synthesis of aromatic&#8208;acid CoA thioesters under mild aqueous reaction conditions mimicking in planta activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysosomes targeting pH activable imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemistry&#8208;based medical treatment combining light at a specific wavelength and a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of oxygen. Application of PDT as a conventional treatment is limited and clearly the approval in clinics of new PS is challenging. The selective accumulation of the PS in the targeted malignant cells is of paramount importance to reduce the side effects that are typical of the current worldwide approved PS. Here we report a new series of aniline&#8208; and iodine&#8208;substituted BODIPY derivatives (1&#8208;3) as promising lysosome&#8208;targeting and pH&#8208;responsive theranostic PS, which displayed a significant in vitro light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity, efficient imaging properties and low dark toxicity (for 2 and 3). These compounds were obtained in few reproducible synthetic steps and good yields. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations confirmed the quenching of the emissive properties of the PS, while both fluorescence and 1O2 emission were obtained only under acidic conditions inducing amine protonation. The pKa values and pH&#8208;dependent emissive properties of 1&#8208;3 being established, their cellular uptake and activation in the lysosomal vesicles (pH &#8776; 4&#8208;5) were confirmed by their co&#8208;localization with the commercial LysoTracker deep red and light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity (IC50 between 0.16 and 0.06 &#181;M) against HeLa cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>A Detailed View on Geosmin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bacterial geosmin synthase is a fascinating bifunctional enzyme that has been discovered almost two decades ago. Several aspects of the cyclisation mechanism from FPP to geosmin are known, but a detailed picture of the stereochemical course of this reaction is unknown. This article reports on a deep investigation of the mechanism of geosmin synthase through isotopic labelling experiments. Furthermore, the effects of divalent cations on geosmin synthase catalysis were investigated. The addition of cyclodextrin to enzymatic reactions, a molecule that can capture terpenes, suggests that the biosynthetic intermediate (1(10)E,5E)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;11&#8208;ol produced by the N&#8208;terminal domain is passed to the C&#8208;terminal domain not through a tunnel, but rather through release into the medium and uptake by the C&#8208;terminal domain.</dc:description>

The addition of cyclodextrin to enzymatic reactions, a molecule that can capture terpenes, suggests that the biosynthetic intermediate (1(10)E,5E)-germacradien-11-ol produced by the N-terminal domain is passed to the C-terminal domain not through a tunnel, but rather through release into the medium and uptake by the C-terminal domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional chemotherapy (CT) is associated with severe side effects and inducible resistance, making it difficult to meet clinical requirements, forcing the development of new multifunctional prodrugs for precision medicine. In recent decades, researchers and clinicians have focused on developing of multifunctional chemotherapeutic prodrugs with tumor&#8208;targeting capability, activatable and traceable chemotherapeutic activity, as a powerful tool to improve theranostic&#160;outcomes in cancer treatment. The conjugates of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic fluorophores and chemotherapy reagents create an exciting avenue for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery and distribution, as well as the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy&#160;(PDT). Therefore, there are great opportunities for researchers to conceive and exploit multifunctional prodrugs that can visualize chemo&#8208;drugs release and tumor treatment in vivo. In this review, the design strategy and the recent progress of multifunctional organic chemotherapeutic prodrugs for activating NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided therapy are described and discussed in detail. Finally, the prospects and challenges of multifunctional chemotherapeutic prodrugs for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided therapy are provided.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Enzyme fusion, the fusion of enzymes with different domains to a single protein, has been widely recognized as a promising strategy in the development of biocatalysts. Nature has evolved gene fusion to combine different catalytic enzymes to function as a fusion enzyme, and this strategy is utilized in many natural product biosynthetic pathways.&#160;Owing to rapid advances in genome sequencing and biosynthetic pathway characterization, there is increasing interest in fusion enzymes from fungal biosynthetic pathways, particularly those involved in tailoring steps.

         <title>Rational Design of a Highly Specific Prolyl Endopeptidase To Activate the Antihypertensive Effect of Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eat and relax: By using an energy&#8208;optimized rational design strategy, the antihypertensive properties of food&#8208;derived proteins have been activated through hydrolysis with highly specific proline endopeptidases.







Abstract
Enzymatic hydrolysis of food&#8208;derived proteins to produce bioactive peptides could activate food functions such as antihypertension. However, the diversity of enzymatic hydrolysis products can reduce bioactive peptides&#8217; efficacy. Highly specific proteases can homogenize the hydrolysis products to reduce the production of impotent peptides. In this study, we successfully obtained M.&#8197;xanthus prolyl endopeptidase mutant Y451M by constraint/free molecular dynamics simulations and binding energy calculations. The specificity of Y451M for proline was increased by 286&#8201;% compared to WT, while its activity was almost unchanged. Milk&#8208;derived substrates processed with Y451M showed an antihypertensive effect that was 567&#8201;% higher than without enzymes. The ability to activate food antihypertension increased 152&#8201;% and the use of enzyme by 192&#8201;% compared with WT. Specific proteases are thus valuable tools in the processing of complex substrates to obtain bioactive peptides.

         <title>Cannabidiol&#8208;loaded poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles with improved bioavailability as a potential for osteoarthritis therapeutic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non&#8208;intoxicating cannabinoid from cannabis sativa that has demonstrated efficacious against inflammation, which can be considered as a potential drug for arthritis treatment. However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability limit its clinical application. Here, we report an effective strategy to fabricate CBD&#8208;loaded poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles (CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs), with a spherical morphology and an average diameter of 238 nm. CBD was sustained release from CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs, which improved the bioavailability of CBD. The CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs effectively protect the damage of LPS to cell viability. We observed that CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs significantly suppressed LPS&#8208;induced primary rat chondrocyte expression of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1&#946; (IL&#8208;1&#946;), interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6), tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP&#8208;13). Remarkably, CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs also showed better therapeutic effects of inhibiting the degradation of the extracellular matrix of chondrocytes than equivalent CBD solution. In general, the fabrication CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs showed good protection of primary chondrocytes in vitro and is a promising system for osteoarthritis treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Sequence&#8208;Penetration Relationships of Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major limitation for the development of more effective oligonucleotide therapeutics has been a lack of understanding of their penetration into the cytosol. While prior work has shown how backbone modifications affect cytosolic penetration, it is unclear how cytosolic penetration is affected by other features including base composition, base sequence, length, and degree of secondary structure. We have applied the chloroalkane penetration assay, which exclusively reports on material that reaches the cytosol, to investigate the effects of these characteristics on the cytosolic uptake of druglike oligonucleotides. We found that base composition and base sequence had moderate effects, while length did not correlate directly with degree of cytosolic penetration. Investigating further, we found that degree of secondary structure had the largest and most predictable correlations with cytosolic penetration. These methods and observations add an additional layer of design for maximizing the efficacy of new oligonucleotide therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the effects of mutagenesis on FusionRed using excited state QM/MM dynamics and classical force field simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are a powerful tool for examining tissues, cells, and subcellular components in vivo and in vitro. FusionRed is a particular FP variant mutated from mKate2 that, in addition to lower cytotoxicity and aggregation rates, has shown potential for acting as a tunable photoswitch. This was posited to stem partially from the presence of a bulky side chain at position 158 and a further stabilizing residue at position 157. In this work, we apply computational techniques including classical molecular dynamics (MD) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations (QM/MM) to explore the effect of mutagenesis at these locations in FusionRed on the excited state surface and relative stability of the chromophore in the protein pocket. We find connections between the statistical sampling of the underlying protein structure and the nonradiative decay mechanisms from excited state dynamics. A single mutation (C158I) which restricts the motion of the chromophore via a favorable hydrophobic interaction corresponds to an increase in FQY, while a second rescue mutation (C158I&#8208;A157N) partially restores the flexibility of the chromophore and photoswitchability with favorable water interactions on the surface of the protein that counteracts the original interaction. We suggest that applying this understanding of structural features that inhibit or favor rotation on the excited state can be applied for rational design of new, tunable and red photoswitches.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are a powerful tool for examining tissues, cells, and subcellular components in vivo and in vitro. FusionRed is a particular FP variant mutated from mKate2 that, in addition to lower cytotoxicity and aggregation rates, has shown potential for acting as a tunable photoswitch. This was posited to stem partially from the presence of a bulky side chain at position 158 and a further stabilizing residue at position 157. In this work, we apply computational techniques including classical molecular dynamics (MD) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations (QM/MM) to explore the effect of mutagenesis at these locations in FusionRed on the excited state surface and relative stability of the chromophore in the protein pocket. We find connections between the statistical sampling of the underlying protein structure and the nonradiative decay mechanisms from excited state dynamics. A single mutation (C158I) which restricts the motion of the chromophore via a favorable hydrophobic interaction corresponds to an increase in FQY, while a second rescue mutation (C158I-A157N) partially restores the flexibility of the chromophore and photoswitchability with favorable water interactions on the surface of the protein that counteracts the original interaction. We suggest that applying this understanding of structural features that inhibit or favor rotation on the excited state can be applied for rational design of new, tunable and red photoswitches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quality Data from Messy Spectra: How Isometric Points Increase Information Content in Highly Overlapping Spectra</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic reaction monitoring often yields complex and highly overlapping data, which can easily be untangled with the help of isometric points. This allows one to quantitatively follow the progress of chemical transformations from messy spectroscopic data.







Abstract
Spectroscopic techniques are immensely useful for obtaining information about chemical transformations while they are happening. However, such data are often messy, and it is challenging to extract reliable information from them without careful calibrations or internal standards. This short introductory review discusses how isometric points (points in a spectrum where the signal intensity remains constant throughout the progress of a chemical transformation) can be used to derive high&#8208;quality data from messy spectra. Such analyses are helpful in a variety of (bio&#8208;)chemical settings, as selected case studies demonstrate.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for the treatment of liver fibrosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liver fibrosis is a process of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix caused by liver injury. Liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis or even liver cancer if not intervened properly. Till now, no effective therapeutic drugs have been clinically approved for treating liver fibrosis. Hence, the development of safe and effective antifibrotic drugs is particularly important. As a representative biomaterial, peptides have been investigated as the key components for constructing antifibrotic nanomaterials with the advantages of biological origination, synthetic availability, and good biocompatibility. Peptides serve as multiple functional motifs in the antifibrotic nanomaterials, such as liver&#8208;targeting molecules, antifibrotic molecules, as well as self&#8208;assembling building blocks for the formation of the nanomaterials. In this review, we focus on peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for treating liver fibrosis, including the nanomaterials modified with liver&#8208;targeting peptides, nanomaterials for efficient delivery of antifibrotic peptides, and self&#8208;assembled peptide nanomaterials for the delivery of antifibrotic drugs. The design rules of these peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials are described. The antifibrotic mechanisms and effects of these peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in treating liver fibrosis and related diseases are highlighted. The challenges and future perspectives of using peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for the treatment of liver fibrosis are discussed. These results are expected to accelerate the rational design and clinical translation of antifibrotic nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of mRNA for Cell&#8208;Selective CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing using Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Messenger RNA (mRNA) is being used as part of an emerging class of biotherapeutics with great promise for preventing and treating a wide range of diseases, as well as encoding programmable nucleases for genome editing. However, the low stability, immunogenicity, and impermeability of mRNA to the cell membrane greatly limit their potential for therapeutic use. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently one of the most extensively studied nanocarriers for mRNA delivery and have recently been clinically approved for developing mRNA&#8208;based vaccines to prevent COVID&#8208;19. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in designing ionizable lipids and formulating LNPs for intracellular and tissue&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. Furthermore, we discuss the progress of intracellular mRNA delivery for spatiotemporally controlled CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing using LNPs. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of LNP&#8208;based mRNA delivery for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and treatment of genetic disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Deacetylation of arabinosylated xylosyl residues related to plant xylan: significant differences between xylan deacetylases classified into various carbohydrate esterase families</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemical synthesis of two novel phenyl glycosides of trisaccharides related to acetylarabinoxylan is described. The trisaccharides bear acetyl and arabinofuranosyl moieties at the non&#8208;reducing&#8208;end xylopyranosyl residue, which is substituted at positions 2 and 3. Both compounds were treated with various xylan deacetylases classified in different carbohydrate esterase (CE) families and significant differences between the families were found. While the arabinosylation hampers deacetylation by CE2&#8208;CE5 and CE12 family members, both epitopes are deesterified by CE1 and in particular CE6 enzymes. The 3&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 2&#8208;O&#8208;arabinosylated compound is also processed by CE7 and majority of CE16 esterases, but not by a hitherto non&#8208;classified Flavobacterium johnsoniae acetylxylan esterase. The data suggests that a slow deesterification of the 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 3&#8208;O&#8208;arabinosylated compound may be due to the acetyl group migration to position 4 followed by deacetylation of this position.</dc:description>

         <title>New Biocompatible &#946;&#8208;Phosphorylated Linear Nitrones Targeting Mitochondria: Protective Effect in Apoptotic Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria, an essential organelle involved in cellular respiration, energy production, and cell death, is the main cellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide. Mitochondrial diseases resulting from uncontrolled/excess ROS generation are an emerging public health concern and there is current interest for specific mitochondriotropic probes to get information on in situ ROS production. As such, nitrones vectorized by the triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation have recently drawn attention despite reported cytotoxicity. Herein, we describe the synthesis of 13 low&#8208;toxic derivatives of N&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;1&#8208;diethoxyphosphoryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylethylamine N&#8208;oxide (PPN) alkyl chain&#8208;grafted to a pyridinium, triethylammonium or berberinium lipophilic cation. These nitrones showed in vitro superoxide quenching activity and EPR/spin&#8208;trapping efficiency towards biologically relevant free radicals, including superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Their mitochondrial penetration was confirmed by 31P NMR and anti&#8208;apoptotic properties assessed in hydrogen peroxide treated Schwann cells. Two pyridinium substituted PPNs were identified as potentially better alternatives to TPP nitrones conjugates for studies of mitochondrial oxidative damage.</dc:description>

         <title>Polypyridyl Co(II)&#8208;Curcumin Complexes as Photo&#8208;activated Anticancer and Antibacterial Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new Co(II) complexes viz., [Co(bpy)2(acac)]Cl (1), [Co(phen)2(acac)]Cl (2),&#160;[Co(bpy)2(cur)]Cl (3), [Co(phen)2(cur)]Cl (4), where bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (1&#160;and&#160;3), phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (2&#160;and&#160;4),&#160;acac&#160;=&#160;acetylacetonate (1&#160;and&#160;2), cur = curcumin monoanion&#160;(3 and 4) were designed, synthesized and fully characterized. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;indicated that CoN4O2&#160;core has a distorted octahedral geometry. The photoactivity of these complexes was tuned by varying the &#960; conjugation in the ligands.&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;depicted an intense absorption band near 435 nm, which made them useful as visible&#8208;light PDT agents. Curcumin complexes&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;showed fluorescence with &#955;emi&#160;= ca. 565 nm. This fluorescence was useful to study their intracellular uptake and localization in MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells. The acetylacetonate complexes (1&#160;and&#160;2) are used as control complexes to understand the role of curcumin. The white light&#8208;triggered anticancer profiles of the cytosol targeting complexes&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;were investigated in detail. These&#160;non&#8208;dark toxic&#160;complexes displayed significant apoptotic photo&#8208;cytotoxicity (under visible light) against MCF&#8208;7 cells via ROS generation. The control complexes&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;did not induce significant cell death in light and dark. Interestingly,&#160;1&#8208;4&#160;produced a remarkable antibacterial response on light exposure. Overall, the reported results here can increase the boundary of the Co(II)&#8208;based anticancer and antibacterial drug development.</dc:description>

The photoactivity of these complexes was tuned by varying the &#960; conjugation in the ligands.&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;depicted an intense absorption band near 435 nm, which made them useful as visible-light PDT agents. Curcumin complexes&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;showed fluorescence with &#955;emi&#160;= ca. 565 nm. This fluorescence was useful to study their intracellular uptake and localization in MCF-7 cancer cells. The acetylacetonate complexes (1&#160;and&#160;2) are used as control complexes to understand the role of curcumin. The white light-triggered anticancer profiles of the cytosol targeting complexes&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;were investigated in detail. These&#160;non-dark toxic&#160;complexes displayed significant apoptotic photo-cytotoxicity (under visible light) against MCF-7 cells via ROS generation. The control complexes&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;did not induce significant cell death in light and dark. Interestingly,&#160;1-4&#160;produced a remarkable antibacterial response on light exposure. Overall, the reported results here can increase the boundary of the Co(II)-based anticancer and antibacterial drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic proximity labeling for profiling the subcellular organization of biomolecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the subcellular organization of biomolecules is important for understanding their biological functions. Over the past decade, proximity&#8208;dependent labeling methods have emerged as powerful tools for mapping biomolecules in their native context. These methods often capitalize on the in situ generation of highly reactive intermediates for covalently tagging biomolecules located within nanometers to sub&#8208;micrometers from the source of labeling. Among these, photocatalytic proximity labeling methods achieve precise spatial and temporal control of labeling with visible light illumination. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms and applications of existing photocatalytic proximity labeling methods and discuss future opportunities for method improvement.</dc:description>

         <title>ROS&#8208;Triggered Gel&#8211;Sol Transition and Kinetics&#8208;Controlled Cargo Release by Methionine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gel&#8211;sol transition of self&#8208;assembling peptides is a useful switch for environment&#8208;dependent drug release. For their applications, kinetics control of the responses is important for matching the releasing velocity to the target biological events. Here we demonstrate a chemical control of redox&#8208;triggered gel&#8211;sol transition kinetics of self&#8208;assembling peptides by the amino acid sequence. Amphiphilic peptides with different methionine positions were developed, where the methionine residue locates at the center of JigSAP&#8208;IMI, whereas JigSAP&#8208;MII possesses the methionine residue near the N&#8208;terminus. Both peptides formed hydrogels in a physiological condition by forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;based supramolecular nanofibers. In contrast, the oxidized forms retained solution states under identical conditions by adopting &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich secondary structures. Upon oxidation with H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, JigSAP&#8208;MII showed faster gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition and cargo&#8208;releasing than JigSAP&#8208;IMI, indicating that the phase&#8208;transition and releasing kinetics of self&#8208;assembling peptides can be rationally controlled by the position of the reactive amino acid residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Epitranscriptomic RNA Modifications on the Catalytic Activity of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Replication Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 causes individualized symptoms. Many reasons have been given. We propose that an individual&#8217;s epitranscriptomic system could be responsible as well. The viral RNA genome can be subject to epitranscriptomic modifications, the modifications can be different for different individuals, and thus epitranscriptomics can affect many events including RNA replication differently. In this context, we studied the effects of modifications including pseudouridine (&#936;), 5methylcytosine (m5C), N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A), N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) and N3methylcytosine (m3C) on the activity of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication complex (SC2RC). We found that &#936;, m5C, m6A and m3C had little effects, while m1A inhibited the enzyme. Both m1A and m3C disrupt canonical base&#8208;pairing, but they had different effects. The fact that m1A inhibits SC2RC implies that the modification can be difficult to detect. The fact also implies that individuals with upregulated m1A including cancer, obesity and diabetes patients may have milder symptoms. However, this contradicts clinical observations. Relevant discussions are provided.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Nanozymes mimic enzyme functions for use in periodontology and implantology, as illustrated on the cover. Periodontal and peri&#8208;implant diseases are important diseases worldwide. As multifunctional nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, nanozymes have made great contributions to maintaining periodontal health and improving the success rate of implantation. Herein, this review describes how nanozymes demonstrate antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, regenerative, and synergistic effects by mimicking properties similar to natural enzymes and exploiting the advantages of nanomaterials. More information can be found in the Review by J. Wu et al.

Abstract
The prevalence of periodontal and peri&#8208;implant diseases has been increasing worldwide and has gained a lot of attention. As multifunctional nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activity, nanozymes have earned a place in the biomedical field. In periodontics and implantology, nanozymes have contributed greatly to research on maintaining periodontal health and improving implant success rates. To highlight this progress, we review nanozymes for antimicrobial therapy, anti&#8208;inflammatory therapy, tissue regeneration promotion, and synergistic effects in periodontal and peri&#8208;implant diseases. The future prospects of nanozymes in periodontology and implantology are also discussed along with challenges.

         <title>A Chimeric Peptide Inhibits Red Blood Cell Invasion by Plasmodium falciparum with Hundredfold Increased Efficacy
</title>

A rationally designed peptide chimera, prepared by combining the best features of two known peptide inhibitors, displayed malaria parasite growth inhibition with a potency two orders of magnitude greater than that of any of its parent peptides.







Abstract
Inhibiting the formation of a tight junction between two malaria parasite proteins, apical membrane antigen 1 and rhoptry neck protein 2, crucial for red blood cell invasion, prevents progression of the disease. In this work, we have used a unique approach to design a chimeric peptide, prepared by fusion of the best features of two peptide inhibitors, that has displayed parasite growth inhibition ex vivo with nanomolar IC50, which is 100 times better than any of its parent peptides. Furthermore, to gain structural insights, we computationally modelled the hybrid peptide on its receptor.
