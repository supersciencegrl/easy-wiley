         <title>Modulation of cellular fate of vinyl triarylamines through structural fine tuning: to stay or not to stay in the mitochondria?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria is involved in many cellular pathways and dysfunctional mitochondria are linked to various diseases. Hence efforts have been driven to design mitochondria&#8208;targeted fluorophores for monitoring the mitochondria status. However, the factors that govern the mitochondria&#8208;targeted potential of dyes are not well&#8208;understood. In this context, we synthesized analogues of the TP&#8208;2Bzim probe belonging to the vinyltriphenylamine (TPA) class and already described for its capacity to bind nuclear DNA in fixed cells and mitochondria in live cells. These analogues ( TP&#8208;1Bzim, TP  n  &#8208;2Bzim, TP  1+  &#8208;2Bzim, TN&#8208;2Bzim ) differ by the cationic charge, the number of vinylbenzimidazolium branches and the nature of the triaryl core. Using microscopy, we demonstrated that the cationic derivatives accumulate in mitochondria but do not reach mtDNA. Under depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane, TP&#8208;2Bzim and TP  1+  &#8208;2Bzim translocate to the nucleus in direct correlation with their strong DNA affinity. This reversible phenomenon emphasizes that these probes can be used to monitor &#916;&#936;  m  variations.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of TePhe into expressed proteins is minimally perturbing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tellurium is a versatile heavy chalcogen with numerous applications in chemical biology, providing valuable probes in mass cytometry, fluorescence imaging and structural biology. L&#8208;tellurienylalanine (TePhe) is an analogue of the proteinogenic amino acid L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe) in which the phenyl side chain has been replaced by a 5&#8208;membered tellurophene moiety. High incorporation level of TePhe in expressed proteins at defined sites is expected to facilitate studies in proteomics, protein NMR spectroscopy, and structure elucidation. As a model we chose immunoglobulin&#8208;binding Protein G, B1 domain (GB1) to validate TePhe as a suitable structural analogue for Phe. We demonstrate that approximately 1 in 2 of all Phe sites within GB1 can be substituted with TePhe through expression in standard non&#8208;Phe&#8208;auxotrophic  E. coli  in Phe&#8208;deficient media containing glyphosate, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The TePhe content of the GB1 sample can be further increased to 85% through HPLC. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we confirm that the Phe&#8208;to&#8208;TePhe substitution has negligible impact on the global structure and stability of GB1.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilisation of the fatty acid decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis by caprylic acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) catalyses the light&#8208;dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids. Photoinactivation of CvFAP still represents one of the major limitations of this interesting enzyme en route to practical application. In this study we demonstrate that the photostability of CvFAP can easily be improved by the administration of medium&#8208;chain length carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid indicating that the best way of maintaining CvFAP stability is &#8216;to keep the enzyme busy&#8217;.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes as Antiviral Agents for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The severe acute respiratory syndrome &#8208; coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), that is the causal agent of COVID&#8208;19, has caused more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide and triggered a global pandemic. Even with successful vaccines being delivered, there is an urgent need for novel treatments to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and other emerging viral diseases. While various organic small molecule drug candidates are in development, some effort has also been devoted towards the application of metal complexes as potential antiviral agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Herein, the metal complexes that have been reported to show antiviral activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 or one of its target proteins are described and their proposed mechanisms of action are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoproteomics for Plasmodium parasite drug target discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging  Plasmodium  parasite drug resistance is threatening progress towards malaria control and elimination. While recent efforts in cell&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput drug screening have produced first&#8208;in&#8208;class drugs with promising activities against different  Plasmodium  life cycle stages, most of these antimalarial agents have elusive mechanisms of action. Though challenging to address, target identification can provide valuable information to facilitate lead optimization and preclinical drug prioritization. Recently, proteome&#8208;wide methods for direct assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions have emerged as powerful tools in a number of systems, including  Plasmodium  . In this review, we will discuss current chemoproteomic strategies that have been adapted to antimalarial drug target discovery, including affinity&#8208; and activity&#8208;based protein profiling and the energetics&#8208;based techniques thermal proteome profiling and stability of proteins from rates of oxidation. The successful application of chemoproteomics to the  Plasmodium  blood stage highlights the potential of these methods to link inhibitors to their molecular targets in more elusive  Plasmodium  life stages and intracellular pathogens in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Hybridization Properties of Acyclic Xeno Nucleic Acid Oligomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) are analogues of DNA and RNA that have a non&#8208;ribose artificial scaffold. XNAs are possible prebiotic genetic carriers as well as alternative genetic system in artificial life. In addition, XNA oligomers can be used as biological tools. Acyclic XNAs, which do not have cyclic scaffolds, are attractive due to facile synthesis and remarkably high nuclease resistance. To maximize the performance of XNAs, a negatively charged backbone is preferable to provide sufficient water solubility; however, acyclic XNAs containing polyanionic backbones suffered from high entropy cost upon duplex formation, because of high flexibility of acyclic nature. Herein, we review the relationships between the structure and duplex hybridization properties of various acyclic XNA oligomers with polyanion backbones.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Nucleic Acids Under Unusual Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual conditions, such as low solution pH, high and low temperatures, and organic solvents, were speculated to be the circumstances that ribozymes and riboswitches may have faced on the early Earth. Moreover, some artificial functional nucleic acids have been discovered to work under such unusual conditions and these molecules offer the potential for some interesting applications. Herein, we review recent progress of research on these functional nucleic acids.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including naturally occurring ribozymes and riboswitches as well as artificially created DNAzymes and aptamers, have been popular molecular toolboxes for diverse applications. Given the high chemical stability of nucleic acids and their ability to fold into diverse sequence&#8208;dependent structures, FNAs are suggested to be highly functional under unusual reaction conditions. This review will examine the progress of research on FNAs under conditions of low pH, high temperature, freezing conditions, and the inclusion of organic solvents and denaturants that are known to disrupt nucleic acid structures. The FNA species to be discussed include ribozymes, riboswitches, G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;based peroxidase mimicking DNAzymes, RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes, and aptamers. Research within this space has not only revealed the hidden talents of FNAs but has also laid important groundwork for pursuing these intriguing functional macromolecules for unique applications.

Given the high chemical stability of nucleic acids and their ability to fold into diverse sequence-dependent structures, FNAs are suggested to be highly functional under unusual reaction conditions. This review will examine the progress of research on FNAs under conditions of low pH, high temperature, freezing conditions, and the inclusion of organic solvents and denaturants that are known to disrupt nucleic acid structures. The FNA species to be discussed include ribozymes, riboswitches, G-quadruplex-based peroxidase mimicking DNAzymes, RNA-cleaving DNAzymes, and aptamers. Research within this space has not only revealed the hidden talents of FNAs but has also laid important groundwork for pursuing these intriguing functional macromolecules for unique applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Per&#8208;glycosylation of the surface&#8208;accessible lysines: one&#8208;pot aqueous route to stabilized proteins with native activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical glycosylation of proteins is a powerful tool applied widely in biomedicine and biotechnology. However, it is a challenging undertaking and typically relies on recombinant proteins and site&#8208;specific conjugations. The scope and utility of this nature&#8208;inspired methodology would be broadened tremendously by the advent of facile, scalable techniques in glycosylation, which are currently missing. In this work, we investigated a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol to achieve indiscriminate, surface&#8208;wide glycosylation of the surface accessible amines (lysines and/or N&#8208;terminus). We reveal that this approach afforded minimal if any change in the protein activity and recognition events in biochemical and cell culture assays, but at the same time provided a significant benefit of stabilizing proteins against aggregation and fibrillation &#8208; as demonstrated on serum proteins (albumins and immunoglobulin G, IgG), an enzyme (uricase), and proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease (&#945;&#8208;synuclein) and diabetes (insulin). Most importantly, this highly advantageous result was achieved via a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol performed on native proteins, bypassing the use of complex chemical methodologies and recombinant proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of a thermostable biocatalyst for the synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by various bacteria and plants in response to environmental stress. It is widely applied as a bioactive moisturising ingredient in skin care products, for which it is manufactured via enzymatic glucosylation of glycerol by the sucrose phosphorylase from  Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This industrial process is operated at room temperature due to the mediocre stability of the biocatalyst, often leading to microbial contamination. The highly thermostable sucrose phosphorylase from  Bifidobacterium adolescentis  could be a better alternative in that regard, but this enzyme is not fit for production of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol due to its low regioselectivity and poor affinity for glycerol. In this work, the thermostable phosphorylase was engineered to alleviate these problems. Several engineering approaches were explored, ranging from site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to conventional, binary, iterative or combinatorial randomisation of the active site, resulting in the screening of ~3,900 variants. Variant P134Q displayed a 21&#8208;fold increase in catalytic efficiency for glycerol, as well as a threefold improvement in regioselectivity towards the 2&#8208;position of the substrate, while retaining its activity for several days at elevated temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Marine Polysaccharides: Occurrence, Enzymatic Degradation and Utilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Algae biomass is a source for many valuable compounds for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. Especially marine polysaccharides contain rare sugars of interest, but a major bottleneck is access to these sugars. In this mini&#8208;review the common knowledge of marine CAZyme&#8208;based deconstruction of these polysaccharides and the biotechnological potential of the thus accessible oligo&#8208; and monosugars are described.







Abstract
Macroalgae species are fast growing and their polysaccharides are already used as food ingredient due to their properties as hydrocolloids or they have potential high value bioactivity. The degradation of these valuable polysaccharides to access the sugar components has remained mostly unexplored so far. One reason is the high structural complexity of algal polysaccharides, but also the need for suitable enzyme cocktails to obtain oligo&#8208; and monosaccharides. Among them, there are several rare sugars with high value. Recently, considerable progress was made in the discovery of highly specific carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes able to decompose complex marine carbohydrates such as carrageenan, laminarin, agar, porphyran and ulvan. This minireview summarizes these achievements and highlights potential applications of the now accessible abundant renewable resource of marine polysaccharides.

         <title>Development of NanoBRET&#8208;Binding Assays for FKBP&#8208;Ligand Profiling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular inhibition insights: NanoBRET assays were developed to measure target engagement of cytosolic FK506&#8208;binding proteins, confirming selectivities and revealing permeation issues of FKBP ligands.







Abstract
FK506&#8208;binding proteins (FKBPs) are promising targets for a variety of disorders and infectious diseases. High FKBP occupancy is thought to be necessary for ligands to effectively compete with the endogenous intracellular functions of FKBPs. Here, we report the development of NanoBRET assays for the most prominent cytosolic FKBPs, FKBP12, 12.6, 51 and 52. These assays allowed rapid profiling of FKBP ligands for target engagement and selectivity in living cells. These assays confirmed the selectivity of SAFit&#8208;type ligands for FKBP51 over FKBP52 but revealed a substantial offset for the intracellular activity of these ligands compared to bicyclic ligands or natural products. Our results stress the importance to control for intracellular FKBP occupancy and provide the assays to guide further FKBP ligand optimization.

         <title>Ratiometric Detection of Glutathione Based on Disulfide Linkage Rupture between a FRET Coumarin Donor and a Rhodamine Acceptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probe based on a coumarin donor and a near&#8208;infrared rhodamine acceptor linked via a disulfide&#8208;tethered bond has been developed for ratiometric visualization of glutathione in live cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae through modulation of efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor.







Abstract
Abnormal levels of glutathione, a cellular antioxidant, can lead to a variety of diseases. We have constructed a near&#8208;infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect glutathione concentrations in biological samples. The probe consists of a coumarin donor, which is connected through a disulfide&#8208;tethered linker to a rhodamine acceptor. Under the excitation of the coumarin donor at 405&#8197;nm, the probe shows weak visible fluorescence of the coumarin donor at 470&#8197;nm and strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence of the rhodamine acceptor at 652&#8197;nm due to efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor. Glutathione breaks the disulfide bond through reduction, which results in a dramatic increase in coumarin fluorescence and a corresponding decrease in rhodamine fluorescence. The probe possesses excellent cell permeability, biocompatibility, and good ratiometric fluorescence responses to glutathione and cysteine with a self&#8208;calibration capability. The probe was utilized to ratiometrically visualize glutathione concentration alterations in HeLa cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae.

         <title>High Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Multi&#8208;enzymatic Synthesis of All Phenylpropanolamine Stereoisomers from &#946;&#8208;Methylstyrene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the simultaneous combination of stereocomplementary alcohol dehydrogenases and &#969;&#8208;transaminases, we have developed a cascade for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of nor(pseudo)ephedrines with excellent optical purities and high yields. The cascade requires 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols as key intermediates, which are obtained from &#946;&#8208;methylstyrenes by combining a styrene monooxygenase with stereocomplementary epoxide hydrolases.







Abstract
We present a one&#8208;pot cascade for the synthesis of phenylpropanolamines (PPAs) in high optical purities (er and dr up to &gt;99.5&#8201;%) and analytical yields (up to 95&#8201;%) by using 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols as key intermediates. This bioamination entails the combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;TA) and an alanine dehydrogenase to create a redox&#8208;neutral network, which harnesses the exquisite and complementary regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities of the selected ADHs and &#969;TAs.

     alt="High Regio- and Stereoselective Multi-enzymatic Synthesis of All Phenylpropanolamine Stereoisomers from &#946;-Methylstyrene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Through the simultaneous&lt;/b&gt; combination of stereocomplementary alcohol dehydrogenases and &#969;-transaminases, we have developed a cascade for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of nor(pseudo)ephedrines with excellent optical purities and high yields. The cascade requires 1-phenylpropane-1,2-diols as key intermediates, which are obtained from &#946;-methylstyrenes by combining a styrene monooxygenase with stereocomplementary epoxide hydrolases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a one-pot cascade for the synthesis of phenylpropanolamines (PPAs) in high optical purities (&lt;i&gt;er&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt; up to &amp;gt;99.5&#8201;%) and analytical yields (up to 95&#8201;%) by using 1-phenylpropane-1,2-diols as key intermediates. This bioamination entails the combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an &#969;-transaminase (&#969;TA) and an alanine dehydrogenase to create a redox-neutral network, which harnesses the exquisite and complementary regio- and stereo-selectivities of the selected ADHs and &#969;TAs. The requisite 1-phenylpropane-1,2-diol intermediates were obtained from trans- or &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&#946;-methylstyrene by combining a styrene monooxygenase with epoxide hydrolases. Furthermore, in selected cases, the envisioned cascade enabled to obtain the structural isomer (1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-1-amino-1-phenylpropan-2-ol in high optical purity (&lt;i&gt;er&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;99.5&#8201;%). This is the first report on an enzymatic method that enables to obtain all of the four possible PPA stereoisomers in great enantio- and diastereo-selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&#946;&#8208;Amyloid (A&#946;) interactions with the novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as therapeutic options for avoiding &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation have been investigated.

Abstract
Cytotoxic aggregation of misfolded &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) proteins is the main culprit suspected to be behind the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, A&#946; interactions with the novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as therapeutic options for avoiding &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation have been investigated. The results from multi&#8208;scale atomistic simulations suggest that amine&#8208;functionalized COFs with a large surface area (more than 1000&#8197;m2/gr) have the potential to prevent A&#946; aggregation. Gibb's free energy analysis confirmed that COFs could prevent protofibril self&#8208;assembly in addition to inhibiting &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation. Additionally, it was observed that the amine functional group and high contact area could improve the inhibitory effect of COFs on A&#946; aggregation and enhance the diffusivity of COFs through the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). In addition, microsecond coarse&#8208;grained (CG) simulations with three hundred amyloids reveal that the presence of COFs creates instability in the structure of amyloids and consequently prevents the fibrillation. These results suggest promising applications of engineered COFs in the treatment of AD and provide a new perspective on future experimental research.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids for biological imaging: This work comprehensively reviews the use of ionic liquids for preparing hard&#8208;to&#8208;image, non&#8208;conductive, soft, and/or wet, biological materials for electron microscopy. Commonly used ionic liquids and their application to biomaterials for imaging are summarized to illicit sample&#8208;specific best practices. While the technique has risen in popularity and holds promise for several biological fields, key challenges must be solved to allow for its widespread adoption in microscopy.







Abstract
For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapor pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of in&#8197;situ physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL, in&#8197;situ microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.

         <title>A H2S&#8208;Specific Ultrasensitive Fluorogenic Probe Reveals TMV&#8208;Induced H2S Production to Limit Virus Replication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S biogenesis promoted by TMV invasion is visualized by a highly sensitive and selective fluorogenic probe, highlighting H2S as an endogenous defense against RNA viruses.







Abstract
Understanding the role of H2S in host defense mechanisms against RNA viruses may provide opportunities for the development of antivirals to combat viral infections. Here, we have developed a green&#8208;emitting fluorogenic probe, which exhibits a large fluorescence response at 520&#8197;nm (&gt;560&#8208;fold) when treated with 100&#8197;&#956;M H2S for 1&#8197;h. It is highly selective for H2S over biothiols (&gt;400&#8208;fold F/F0) and has a detection limit of 12.9&#8197;nM. We demonstrate the application of the probe for endogenous H2S detection in&#8197;vivo for the understanding of its roles in antiviral host defense. Such virus&#8208;induced H2S inhibits viral replication by reducing gene expression of RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP). Additionally, a H2S donor GYY4137 showed significantly antiviral activity as ribavirin, a broad&#8208;spectrum drug against RNA viruses. Furtherly, we propose a possible molecular mechanism for the TMV&#8208;induced H2S biogenesis. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in support of further studies identifying endogenous H2S and its donors as potential antivirals toward RNA viruses.

         <title>Labeling and Characterization of Phenol&#8208;Containing Glycopeptides Using Chemoselective Probes with Isotope Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS analysis. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery.







Abstract
Secondary metabolites are structurally diverse natural products (NPs) and have been widely used for medical applications. Developing new tools to enrich NPs can be a promising solution to isolate novel NPs from the native and complex samples. Here, we developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides by the ene&#8208;type labeling used in proteomic research. The clickable azido&#8208;linker was included for further biotin functionalization to facilitate the enrichment of labeled substrates. Afterward, our chemoselective method, in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS and MSn analysis, was demonstrated in bacterial cultures. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was labeled and characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery in complex environments.

         <title>Biosynthesis of [14C]&#8208;11&#8208;De&#8208;O&#8208;Methyltomaymycin, a precursor of radiolabelled Antibody Drug Conjugates.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are one of the most promising technologies to treat cancer as they combine the specificity of an antibody with the high potency of a cytotoxic molecule such as  Tomaymycin derivatives, which are DNA&#8208;interactive antitumor antibiotics previously isolated from bacterial broth. The multistep chemical synthesis of some Tomaymycin derivatives is complicated because  their structures contain a reactive  imine bond. Therefore, we turned to biosynthesis to obtain 14  C radiolabelled tomaymycin derivative to support ADME studies. Following Hurley&#8217;s work 4a&#8208;  c  , the 14  C radiolabel was incorporated efficiently in one step from radiolabelled tyrosine using the strain Streptomyces sp FH6421  . This process has been further optimized by using anthranilic acid as radiolabelled precursor, leading to one of the highest incorporation level of radiochemical precursors, published up to now 10&#8208;13  . This biosynthetic strategy is the fastest way to access such radiolabelled precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding Mode Characterization of Osteopontin on Hydroxyapatite by Solution NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsically disordered protein osteopontin is associated with modulating the formation, growth and proliferation of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite. Employing different solution NMR spectroscopy methods, we characterize the binding modes to hydroxyapatite and provide evidence for the influence of phosphorylation of the protein on the binding character and the differing roles in biomineralization.







Abstract
Extracellular matrix glycoproteins play a major role in bone mineralization and modulation of osteogenesis. Among these, the intrinsically disordered protein osteopontin (OPN) is associated with the inhibition of formation, growth and proliferation of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite (HAP). Furthermore, post&#8208;translational modifications like phosphorylation can alter conformations and interaction properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Therefore, the actual interaction of OPN with a HAP surface on an atomic level and how this interaction is affected by phosphorylation is of great interest. Here, we study the interaction of full&#8208;length OPN on the surface of suspended HAP nanoparticles by solution NMR spectroscopy. We report the binding modes of this IDP and provide evidence for the influence of hyperphosphorylation on the binding character and an explanation for the differing roles in biomineralization. Our study moreover presents an easy and suitable option to measure interaction of nanoparticles in a stable suspension with full&#8208;length proteins.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring and engineered promiscuous halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues to be enzymatically synthesised and recycled, using simple and readily available alkyl iodides as alkyl donors. In combination with promiscuous methyltransferases (MTs), they dramatically expand the bioalkylation toolbox.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) and methyl iodide. Characterisation of a range of naturally occurring HMTs and subsequent protein engineering led to HMT variants capable of synthesising ethyl, propyl, and allyl analogues of SAM. Notably, HMTs do not depend on chemical synthesis of methionine analogues, as required by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). However, at the moment MATs have a much broader substrate scope than the HMTs. Herein we provide an overview of the discovery and engineering of promiscuous HMTs and how these strategies will pave the way towards a toolbox of HMT variants for versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

         <title>Switching ON of Transcription&#8208;Translation System Using GUV Fusion by Co&#8208;supplementation of Calcium with Long&#8208;Chain Polyethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) fusion method using Ca2+ and PEG20k was established in this study. Because of its low leakage of molecules during GUV fusion, the method enabled the switch&#8208;ON of transcription&#8208;translation within GUVs by complementation of elements in different GUVs after fusion.







Abstract
Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) have been used as a material for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. However, due to the semi&#8208;permeability of the membrane, the need for methods to fuse GUVs has increased. To this aim, methods that are simple and show low leakage during fusion are important. In this study, we report a method of GUV fusion by a divalent cation (Ca2+) enhanced with a long chain polyethylene glycol (PEG20k). The methods showed significant GUV fusion without leakage of internal components of GUVs and maintained cell&#8208;free transcription&#8208;translation ability inside the GUVs without external supplementation of macromolecules. We demonstrate that the Ca&#8208;PEG method can be applied for switching ON of transcription&#8208;translation in GUVs in a fusion&#8208;dependent manner. The method developed here can be applied to extend bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and molecular robotics that use GUVs as a chassis.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of Nitrating Cytochrome P450 TxtE by Active Site Engineering of a Reductase Fusion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of aromatic nitration biocatalysts: Screening variants of a self&#8208;sufficient reductase fusion of the indole&#8208;nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE led to the discovery of an active site mutant that nitrates tryptamine and a range of tryptamine analogues with alterations to the aminoethyl group and/or indole.







Abstract
Aromatic nitration reactions are a cornerstone of organic chemistry, but are challenging to scale due to corrosive reagents and elevated temperatures. The cytochrome P450 TxtE nitrates the indole 4&#8208;position of l&#8208;tryptophan at room temperature using NO, O2 and NADPH, and has potential to be developed into a useful aromatic nitration biocatalyst. However, its narrow substrate scope (requiring both the &#945;&#8208;amino acid and indole functionalities) have hindered this. Screening of an R59 mutant library of a TxtE&#8208;reductase fusion protein identified a variant (R59C) that nitrates tryptamine, which is not accepted by native TxtE. This variant exhibits a broader substrate scope than the wild type enzyme and is able to nitrate a range of tryptamine analogues, with significant alterations to the aromatic and aminoethyl moieties.

         <title>A Novel D&#8208;A&#8208;D Photosensitizer for Efficient NIR Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel D&#8208;A&#8208;D photosensitizer, 2Cz&#8208;BTZ, was designed and synthesized. After encapsulation by amphiphilic polymers F127, the 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 NPs display strong intracellular 1O2 generation capabilities as well as in&#8197;vivo long&#8208;term NIR imaging.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted great interest in cancer theranostics owing to its minimal invasiveness and low side effect. In PDT, photosensitizers are indispensable components that generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to optimizing the photosensitizer with enhanced ROS efficiency. However, to improve the precision and controllability for PDT, developing NIR imaging&#8208;guided photosensitizers are still urgent and challenging. Here, we have designed a novel photosensitizer 2Cz&#8208;BTZ which integrated with intense NIR emission and photoinduced singlet oxygen 1O2 generation capabilities. Moreover, after loading the photosensitizers 2Cz&#8208;BTZ into biocompatible amphiphilic polymers F127, the formed 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited good photoinduced therapy as well as long&#8208;term in&#8197;vivo imaging capabilities. Under these merits, the 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 NPs showed NIR imaging&#8208;guided PDT, which paves a promising way for spatiotemporally precise tumor theranostics.

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellobiose was synthesized and evaluated for its effects on E. coli biofilms . The impact of the synthetic disaccharide on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays revealing an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate. Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo red binding to bacterial cells. Lastly, single electron microscopy reveals the disaccharide increased the production of curli fibers.







Abstract
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria growing in complex, multicellular enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Recently, a zwitterionic cellulose derivative produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined to play an important role in the formation and assembly of biofilms. In order to produce a minimal, yet structurally defined tool compound to probe the biology of the naturally occurring polymer, we have synthesized a zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose (pEtN cellobiose) and evaluated its biofilm activity in the gram&#8208;negative bacterium E. coli, a pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of UTIs. The impact of synthetic pEtN cellobiose on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays which revealed an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate compared to untreated samples. Additionally, Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo Red binding to bacterial cells. These results reveal new opportunities to study the impact glycopolymers have on cellular adhesion in gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

         <title>Development of a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Based Luciferase Turn&#8208;On System as Nonhomologous End Joining Pathway Reporter</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHEJ turn&#8208;on bioluminescence: A bioluminescent signal mute luciferase vector was constructed by introducing a C205ATC mutation. CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting the mutation site generates DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), then triggers error&#8208;prone non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway to restore the reading frame. The turn&#8208;on bioluminescence signal reflects NHEJ efficiency.







Abstract
There is a need of a non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway reporter system that facilitates screening and discovery of NHEJ chemical inhibitors. In this study, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 based luciferase turn&#8208;on system as a NHEJ pathway reporter. By substituting nucleotide 205C with ATC, we introduced a reading&#8208;frame shift and a pre&#8208;stop codon into the luciferase coding region and thereby generated a bioluminescent signal mute HEK293T reporter cell line. Then, a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 plasmid expressing a guide RNA targeting luciferase coding region was introduced into the reporter cell line to generate NHEJ&#8208;associated indel to restore the reading frame and subsequently turn on the bioluminescent signal. We observed over three&#8208;thousand fold increase in signal after CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 vector transfection. Different known chemical inhibitors of the NHEJ pathway, such as NU7441, KU0060648, and KU55933, could significantly inhibit the bioluminescent signal generated by CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting. In addition, we validated our system by high throughput sequencing.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Selection Methods of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries (DEL) have become a major technology platform in drug discovery. Besides encoding method, DEL&#8208;compatible chemistry, and analysis of large datasets, another important but less&#8208;covered technological component of DELs is selection method. Although presently DEL selection is predominantly conducted with immobilized proteins on a matrix, the recent development of novel DEL selection methods has expanded the target scope and led to novel utilities of DELs. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of DEL selection methods with a particular focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DEL) have come of age and become a major technology platform for ligand discovery in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Technological maturation in the past two decades and the recent explosive developments of DEL&#8208;compatible chemistries have greatly improved the chemical diversity of DELs and fueled its applications in drug discovery. A relatively less&#8208;covered aspect of DELs is the selection method. Typically, DEL selection is considered as a binding assay and the selection is conducted with purified protein targets immobilized on a matrix, and the binders are separated from the non&#8208;binding background via physical washes. However, the recent innovations in DEL selection methods have not only expanded the target scope of DELs, but also revealed the potential of the DEL technology as a powerful tool in exploring fundamental biology. In this Review, we first cover the &#8220;classic&#8221; DEL selection methods with purified proteins on solid phase, and then we discuss the strategies to realize DEL selections in solution phase. Finally, we focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.

         <title>Flexible Assembly of Engineered Tetrahymena Ribozymes Forming Polygonal RNA Nanostructures with Catalytic Ability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular engineering of the Tetrahymena ribozyme enabled us to design unit RNAs (L&#8208;RNAs), assembly of which formed ribozyme&#8208;based polygonal nanostructures. Catalytic activity of L&#8208;RNAs was dependent on oligomer formation. The structural variety of L&#8208;RNA oligomers was extended by tuning their structural elements, yielding closed trimers, tetramers, pentamers and closed hexamers.







Abstract
Ribozymes with modular architecture constitute an attractive class of structural platforms for design and construction of nucleic acid nanostructures with biological functions. Through modular engineering of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, we have designed unit RNAs (L&#8208;RNAs), assembly of which formed ribozyme&#8208;based closed trimers and closed tetramers. Their catalytic activity was dependent on oligomer formation. In this study, the structural variety of L&#8208;RNA oligomers was extended by tuning their structural elements, yielding closed pentamers and closed hexamers. Their assembly properties were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone mark recognized by the N&#8208;terminal chromodomain (ChD) of the CBX subunit of canonical PRC1. There are five PcG CBX paralogs in humans. CBX2, in particular, is upregulated in a variety of cancers, particularly in advanced prostate cancers. Using CBX2 inhibitors to understand and target CBX2 in prostate cancer is highly desirable; however, high structural similarity among the CBX ChDs has been challenging for developing selective CBX ChD inhibitors. Here, we utilize selections of focused DNA encoded libraries (DELs) for the discovery of a selective CBX2 chromodomain probe, SW2_152F. SW2_152F binds to CBX2 ChD with a  K  d  of 80 nM and displays 24&#8208;1000&#8208;fold selectivity for CBX2 ChD over other CBX paralogs  in vitro  . SW2_152F is cell permeable, selectively inhibits CBX2 chromatin binding in cells, and blocks neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cell lines in response to androgen deprivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;specific selenocysteine incorporation into proteins by genetic engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation  in vivo  is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe these progresses in selenoprotein production methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>

The silent treatment: Glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. We report the largest subset of glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors, which are produced and identified after the silent biosynthetic gene cluster plu1881&#8211;1877 is activated in the native host P. laumondii.







Abstract
The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin&#8197;A and cepafungin&#8197;I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) plu1881&#8211;1877 is present in entomopathogenic Photorhabdus laumondii but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in Escherichia coli. Their chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.

         <title>Comparative Biochemistry of Four Polyester (PET) Hydrolases**

Mass&#8208;action kinetics for enzymatic PET hydrolysis: Four PET hydrolases have been tested within a kinetic framework for comparing enzymes hydrolysing the insoluble polymer PET. Analysis provided kinetic parameters in units of M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, as well as values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface. This makes Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics possible for plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes.







Abstract
The potential of bioprocessing in a circular plastic economy has strongly stimulated research into the enzymatic degradation of different synthetic polymers. Particular interest has been devoted to the commonly used polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and a number of PET hydrolases have been described. However, a kinetic framework for comparisons of PET hydrolases (or other plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes) acting on the insoluble substrate has not been established. Herein, we propose such a framework, which we have tested against kinetic measurements for four PET hydrolases. The analysis provided values of kcat and KM, as well as an apparent specificity constant in the conventional units of M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. These parameters, together with experimental values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface, enabled comparative analyses. A variant of the PET hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis was the most efficient enzyme at ambient conditions; it relied on a high kcat rather than a low KM. Moreover, both soluble and insoluble PET fragments were consistently hydrolyzed much faster than intact PET. This suggests that interactions between polymer strands slow down PET degradation, whereas the chemical steps of catalysis and the low accessibility associated with solid substrate were less important for the overall rate. Finally, the investigated enzymes showed a remarkable substrate affinity, and reached half the saturation rate on PET when the concentration of attack sites in the suspension was only about 50&#8197;nM. We propose that this is linked to nonspecific adsorption, which promotes the nearness of enzyme and attack sites.

Altered expression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in G&#8197;protein signaling, eventually altering the transcription of cancer&#8208;promoting proteins. Therefore, inhibiting RGS17 has potential as an anticancer therapy. We used an NMR FBLD approach to identify fragments capable of binding RGS17. Chemical&#8208;shift mapping of the 15N/1H HSQC spectra of 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH identified a previously unknown putative fragment binding site on RGS17.







Abstract
Regulator of G&#8197;protein signaling (RGS) proteins have attracted attention as a result of their primary role in directing the specificity as well as the temporal and spatial aspects of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor signaling. In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. In this area, RGS17 is of particular interest. It has been demonstrated that, while RGS17 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it has been found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G&#8197;protein signaling and an overproduction of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types. Suppressing RGS17 expression with RNA interference (RNAi) has been found to decrease tumorigenesis and sufficiently prevents cancer cell migration, leading to the hypothesis that pharmacological blocking of RGS17 function could be useful in anticancer therapies. We have identified small&#8208;molecule fragments capable of binding the RGS homology (RH) domain of RGS17 by using a nuclear magnetic resonance fragment&#8208;based screening approach. By chemical shift mapping of the two&#8208;dimensional 15N,1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the backbone&#8208;assigned 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH, we determined the fragment binding sites to be distant from the G&#945; interface. Thus, our study identifies a putative fragment binding site on RGS17 that was previously unknown.

An open and shut case: A new system of DNA supramolecular polymerization driven by DNA base stacking together with a sequence symmetry design strategy is demonstrated. In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self&#8208;healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Action and Peptide&#8208;Membrane Interactions of Aib&#8208;Rich Peptides: Multitechnique Experimental and Theoretical Analysis</title>

Sit up or lie down: Linear dichroism, circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore how mimics of peptaibol antibiotics (Aib foldamers) interact with membranes. These studies revealed all peptides partitioned well into the bilayers, with orientation dependent upon peptide length, as well as chiral interactions between peptides and the phospholipids.







Abstract
The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered by their mechanism of action not being clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, linear dichroism, Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, the Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All the peptides studied quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes, and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.

         <title>Peptide Vectors Carry Pyrene to Cell Organelles Allowing Real&#8208;Time Quantification of Free Radicals in Mitochondria by Time&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Microscopy</title>

On and off ROS formation detected. Two pyrene butyric acid isomers, and their respective derivatives produced by grafting them onto a peptide vector, demonstrated outstanding real&#8208;time quantification of intracellular and mitochondrial free radicals and oxygen. The four fluorescent probes work well inside living cells for detection by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time quantification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (ROS) in cells is of paramount importance as they are essential for cellular functions. Their excessive formation contributes to the dysfunction of cells and organisms, ultimately leading to cell death. As ROS are mostly produced in the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time&#8208;resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non&#8208;radical species such as H2O2.

         <title>Discovery of an Allosteric Ligand Binding Site in SMYD3 Lysine Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 9, Page 1597-1608, May 4, 2021. </description>

From a distance: SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase is an epigenetic enzyme with multiple cellular functions and the ability to recognize broad range of substrates from histones to cytosolic proteins. An SPR biosensors&#8208;based biophysical strategy for screening SMYD3 ligands was developed and revealed an allosteric binding site. Subsequent crystallographic studies provided a structural description of the novel binding site of SMYD3.







Abstract
SMYD3 is a multifunctional epigenetic enzyme with lysine methyltransferase activity and various interaction partners. It is implicated in the pathophysiology of cancers but with an unclear mechanism. To discover tool compounds for clarifying its biochemistry and potential as a therapeutic target, a set of drug&#8208;like compounds was screened in a biosensor&#8208;based competition assay. Diperodon was identified as an allosteric ligand; its R and S enantiomers were isolated, and their affinities to SMYD3 were determined (KD=42 and 84&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that both enantiomers bind to a previously unidentified allosteric site in the C&#8208;terminal protein binding domain, consistent with its weak inhibitory effect. No competition between diperodon and HSP90 (a known SMYD3 interaction partner) was observed although SMYD3&#8211;HSP90 binding was confirmed (KD=13&#8197;&#956;M). Diperodon clearly represents a novel starting point for the design of tool compounds interacting with a druggable allosteric site, suitable for the exploration of noncatalytic SMYD3 functions and therapeutics with new mechanisms of action.

         <title>Stable Hairpin Structures Formed by Xylose&#8208;Based Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 9, Page 1638-1645, May 4, 2021. </description>

A stable ladder: Thermal and spectroscopic analyses of xylose (XyNA) and deoxyxylose nucleic acids (dXyNA) indicate the formation of stable hairpin structures. The solution structure of a fully modified dXyNA hairpin indicates the structural preference for a ladder&#8208;like stem with a noncanonical loop.







Abstract
Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo&#8208; and deoxyxylo&#8208;nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3&#8217; epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered to be potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analyses show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem into a stable ladder&#8208;like duplex with marginal right&#8208;handed helicity. The reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures described so far.

Immunotherapy and insights: De novo cancer&#8208;targeting immunostimulatory peptides bind to surface GRP78 on tumors and the NKp30 receptor on NK cells for anti&#8208;tumor immunostimulatory activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This study underscores the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept discovery of a synthetic peptide that can mimic the targeting and activating functions of antibodies while facilitating NK&#8208;dependent cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
De novo cancer&#8208;targeting immunostimulatory peptides have been designed and developed as synthetic antibody mimics. A series of bifunctional peptides incorporating NKp30&#8208;binding and NK&#8208;cell&#8208;activating domains were synthesized as linear dimers and then extended into branching trimeric peptides by the incorporation of GRP78&#8208;targeting and tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;binding sequences. A selected trimeric peptide from this small set of peptides displayed binding capabilities on GRP78+ HepG2 and A549 target cells. Cell binding diminished in the presence of an anti&#8208;GRP78 peptide blocker, thus suggesting GRP78&#8208;binding dependence. Similarly, the selected trimeric peptide was also found to exhibit NK cell binding in an NKp30&#8208;dependent manner, which translated into NK cell activation as indicated by cytokine secretion. In co&#8208;culture, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the target GFP&#8208;expressing A549 cells were visibly associated with the effector NK cells when pre&#8208;activated with lead trimeric peptide. Accordingly, A549 cells were found to be compromised, as evidenced by the loss of GFP signal and notable detection of early&#8208;/late&#8208;stage apoptosis. Investigation of the immunological markers related to toxicity revealed detectable secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IFN&#8208;&#947;, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IL&#8208;8. Furthermore, administration of peptide&#8208;activated NK cells into A549&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice resulted in a consistent decrease in tumor growth when compared to the untreated control group. Taken together, the identification of a lead trimeric peptide capable of targeting and activating NK cells&#8217; immunotoxicity directly towards GRP78+/B7H6&#8208; tumors provides a novel proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the development of cancer&#8208;targeting immunostimulatory peptide ligands that mimic antibody&#8208;targeting and &#8208;activating functions related to cancer immunotherapy applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De novo cancer-targeting immunostimulatory peptides have been designed and developed as synthetic antibody mimics. A series of bifunctional peptides incorporating NKp30-binding and NK-cell-activating domains were synthesized as linear dimers and then extended into branching trimeric peptides by the incorporation of GRP78-targeting and tumor-cell-binding sequences. A selected trimeric peptide from this small set of peptides displayed binding capabilities on GRP78&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; HepG2 and A549 target cells. Cell binding diminished in the presence of an anti-GRP78 peptide blocker, thus suggesting GRP78-binding dependence. Similarly, the selected trimeric peptide was also found to exhibit NK cell binding in an NKp30-dependent manner, which translated into NK cell activation as indicated by cytokine secretion. In co-culture, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the target GFP-expressing A549 cells were visibly associated with the effector NK cells when pre-activated with lead trimeric peptide. Accordingly, A549 cells were found to be compromised, as evidenced by the loss of GFP signal and notable detection of early-/late-stage apoptosis. Investigation of the immunological markers related to toxicity revealed detectable secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;, and IL-8. Furthermore, administration of peptide-activated NK cells into A549-tumor-bearing mice resulted in a consistent decrease in tumor growth when compared to the untreated control group. Taken together, the identification of a lead trimeric peptide capable of targeting and activating NK cells&#8217; immunotoxicity directly towards GRP78&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/B7H6&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; tumors provides a novel proof-of-concept for the development of cancer-targeting immunostimulatory peptide ligands that mimic antibody-targeting and -activating functions related to cancer immunotherapy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Step by step: A dehydrogenase KanQ oxidizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;OH of kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxykanaymycin C or paromamine before introduction of C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2, thus suggesting that the kanosamine moiety with C&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;NH2 is strictly recognized by KanQ. Furthermore, oxygenase KanJ recognizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2 of the pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide for deamination of C&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;NH2; this suggests that these modifications mainly occur in a stepwise manner.







Abstract
Kanamycin&#8197;A is the major 2&#8208;deoxystreptamine (2DOS)&#8208;containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose (6ADG) at O&#8208;4 and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose at O&#8208;6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C&#8208;2 and introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase, KanQ, and an aminotransferase, KanB, are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than the 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino derivative. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of an oxygenase, KanJ, that is responsible for deamination at C&#8208;2 of the GlcN moiety was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 is important for substrate recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C&#8208;2 by KanJ.

         <title>The Antimicrobial Peptide Gad&#8208;1 Clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms under Cystic Fibrosis Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 9, Page 1646-1655, May 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a metal&#8208;mediated mode of action, the metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gad&#8208;1 can effectively clear P. aeruginosa biofilms. In the presence of Cu2+ ions, Gad&#8208;1 rapidly cleaves the exogenous DNA that allows biofilms to thrive. Anti&#8208;biofilm activity was observed at a range of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of exogenous DNA, conditions relevant to cystic fibrosis.







Abstract
Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are an emerging health issue and lead to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates a thick mucus in the lungs that is prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin&#8208;1 (Gad&#8208;1) eradicates established P. aeruginosa biofilms through a combination of modes of action that includes nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad&#8208;1 exhibits synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, thus making Gad&#8208;1 a new lead compound for the potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.

Making a difference: Inorganic enzyme mimics, mainly consisting of inorganic complexes and nanozymes, have attracted much interest and found widespread applications in healthcare, energy, and environmental fields. Because of their splendid properties, such as high stability, tailorable activity and low cost, these enzyme mimics are making and will continue to make a big difference in future science and technology.







Abstract
Enzyme mimics (or artificial enzymes) have emerged as valuable alternatives to natural enzymes since the pioneering work of Ronald Breslow. They have numerous advantages over natural enzymes, such as high stability, low cost, and tailorable activity. Among varieties of materials explored to mimic enzymes, the inorganic ones, including inorganic complexes and nanomaterials, have attracted increasing interest over the last decade and have the potential to address the current challenges in energy, environment, health, etc.

         <title>Cover Feature: N3&#8208;Kethoxal&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Intracellular RNA Labeling (ChemBioChem 9/2021)</title>

The make&#8208;up of RNA: This cover feature describes a new strategy to modify RNA combined with N3&#8208;kethoxal labeling and an intracellular biorthogonal reaction. N3&#8208;kethoxal with the advantages of small size, low toxicity, excellent membrane&#8208;permeable, and high reactivity, serves to bring an azido group to the RNA molecules. Next the cell&#8208;permeable dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) reagent reacts with azido group to link covalently to the RNA strand, which can be extended to &#8220;make&#8208;up&#8221; RNA inside the cell for imaging or other functionalization.

Glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. We report the largest subset of glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors, which were produced and identified after the silent biosynthetic gene cluster plu1881&#8211;1877 had been activated in the native host Photorhabdus laumondii. Crystal&#8208;structure analysis of the new glidobactin derivatives in complex with yeast proteasome core particle (yCP) suggests that the inhibition occurs primarily by covalent and irreversible binding of the inhibitors to the &#946;5 subunit of the yCP. More information can be found in the full paper by H.&#8197;B. Bode et&#8197;al.

A cool look at hot spots: A review of different intracellular thermometry techniques reveals the multidisciplinary approaches within the field. Recent developments have made these promising tools for biological studies, including the potential to investigate the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) aggregation, a prevailing characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract
Temperature is a fundamental physical parameter that influences biological processes in living cells. Hence, intracellular temperature mapping can be used to derive useful information reflective of thermodynamic properties and cellular behaviour. Herein, existing publications on different thermometry systems, focusing on those that employ fluorescence&#8208;based techniques, are reviewed. From developments based on fluorescent proteins and inorganic molecules to metal nanoclusters and fluorescent polymers, the general findings of intracellular measurements from different research groups are discussed. Furthermore, the contradiction of mitochondrial thermogenesis and nuclear&#8208;cytoplasmic temperature differences to current thermodynamic understanding are highlighted. Lastly, intracellular thermometry is proposed as a tool to quantify the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid&#8208;&#946;42 (A&#946;42) aggregation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

The review provides the requisites and implications of mutually exclusive or simultaneous formation of G&#8208;Quadruplex and i&#8208;motif structures in human genome. The comprehensive discussion on the spatiotemporal formation of G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif structures gives the insight on their integrated effect in gene&#8208;regulatory functions and cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
G&#8208;Quadruplex (GQ) and i&#8208;motif structures are the paradigmatic examples of nonclassical tetrastranded nucleic acids having multifarious biological functions and widespread applications in therapeutics and material science. Recently, tetraplexes emerged as promising anticancer targets due to their structural robustness, gene&#8208;regulatory roles, and predominant distribution at specific loci of oncogenes. However, it is arguable whether the i&#8208;motif evolves in the complementary single&#8208;stranded region after GQ formation in its opposite strand and vice versa. In this review, we address the prerequisites and significance of the simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive formation of GQ and i&#8208;motif structures at complementary and sequential positions in duplexes in the cellular milieu. We discussed how their dynamic interplay Sets up cellular homeostasis and exacerbates carcinogenesis. The review gives insights into the spatiotemporal formation of GQ and i&#8208;motifs that could be harnessed to design different types of reporter systems and diagnostic platforms for potential bioanalytical and therapeutic intervention.

         <title>The Perturbed Free&#8208;Energy Landscape: Linking Ligand Binding to Biomolecular Folding</title>

         <dc:description>
New approaches to drug design and systems biology: The link between ligand binding and biomolecular folding can be understood as arising from perturbation of the free energy landscapes (FEL). Traditional visual descriptions of ligand binding mechanisms are reinterpreted in terms of the perturbed FEL. Recent experimental and computational studies characterizing the pFEL for various biomolecular interactions are reviewed.







Abstract
The effects of ligand binding on biomolecular conformation are crucial in drug design, enzyme mechanisms, the regulation of gene expression, and other biological processes. Descriptive models such as &#8220;lock and key&#8221;, &#8220;induced fit&#8221;, and &#8220;conformation selection&#8221; are common ways to interpret such interactions. Another historical model, linked equilibria, proposes that the free&#8208;energy landscape (FEL) is perturbed by the addition of ligand binding energy for the bound population of biomolecules. This principle leads to a unified, quantitative theory of ligand&#8208;induced conformation change, building upon the FEL concept. We call the map of binding free energy over biomolecular conformational space the &#8220;binding affinity landscape&#8221; (BAL). The perturbed FEL predicts/explains ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes conforming to all common descriptive models. We review recent experimental and computational studies that exemplify the perturbed FEL, with emphasis on RNA. This way of understanding ligand&#8208;induced conformation dynamics motivates new experimental and theoretical approaches to ligand design, structural biology and systems biology.

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Alkylating Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamides for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 9, Page 1538-1545, May 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be specific! We review the recent research on DNA&#8208;alkylating pyrrole&#8208;imidazole (PI) polyamides that show sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activity. Their application to targeting cancer&#8208;related sequences, such as human telomere repeat sequences, KRAS mutated sequences and RUNX binding sequences, are described to show the possibility of these conjugates as chemotherapeutic drugs.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole (PI) polyamides, which target specific DNA sequences, have been studied as a class of DNA minor&#8208;groove&#8208;binding molecules. To investigate the potential of compounds for cancer treatment, PI polyamides were conjugated with DNA&#8208;alkylating agents, such as seco&#8208;CBI and chlorambucil. DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides have attracted attention because of their sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activities, which contribute to reducing the severe side effects of current DNA&#8208;damaging drugs. Many of these types of conjugates have been developed as new candidates for anticancer drugs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be specific&lt;/b&gt;! We review the recent research on DNA-alkylating pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides that show sequence-specific alkylating activity. Their application to targeting cancer-related sequences, such as human telomere repeat sequences, KRAS mutated sequences and RUNX binding sequences, are described to show the possibility of these conjugates as chemotherapeutic drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides, which target specific DNA sequences, have been studied as a class of DNA minor-groove-binding molecules. To investigate the potential of compounds for cancer treatment, PI polyamides were conjugated with DNA-alkylating agents, such as &lt;i&gt;seco&lt;/i&gt;-CBI and chlorambucil. DNA-alkylating PI polyamides have attracted attention because of their sequence-specific alkylating activities, which contribute to reducing the severe side effects of current DNA-damaging drugs. Many of these types of conjugates have been developed as new candidates for anticancer drugs. Herein, we review recent progress into research on DNA-alkylating PI polyamides and their sequence-specific action on targets associated with cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Artificial Cofactor Catalyzing the Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction with Designed Streptavidin as Protein Host**
</title>

A story in pictures: An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst was embedded in streptavidin to catalyze the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction. The following protein design process was described by solved crystal structures for every design step, and the outcome of the chemical reaction was represented by using DFT calculations and MD simulations.







Abstract
An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst embedded in a protein has been used to conduct the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction in a buffered system. As protein host, we chose streptavidin, as it can be easily crystallized and thereby supports the design process. The protein host around the cofactor was rationally designed on the basis of high&#8208;resolution crystal structures obtained after each variation of the amino acid sequence. Additionally, DFT&#8208;calculated intermediates and transition states were used to rationalize the observed activity. Finally, repeated cycles of structure determination and redesign led to a system with an up to one order of magnitude increase in activity over the bare cofactor and to the most active proteinogenic catalyst for the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction known today.

         <title>N3&#8208;Kethoxal&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Intracellular RNA Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 9, Page 1559-1562, May 4, 2021. </description>

The small, membrane&#8208;permeable probe N3&#8208;kethoxal has low toxicity and highly selectivity for reaction with guanine allowing it to introduce azido groups into RNA within a cellular environment. This N3K&#8208;assisted bioorthogonal intracellular RNA strategy provides a great prospect for in&#8197;vivo RNA labeling to develop various RNA tools for RNA functional research.







Abstract
There is growing interest in developing intracellular RNA tools. Herein, we describe a strategy for N3&#8208;kethoxal (N3K)&#8208;based bioorthogonal intracellular RNA functionalization. With N3K labeling followed by an in&#8197;vivo click reaction with DBCO derivatives, RNA can be modified with fluorescent or phenol groups. This strategy provides a new way of labeling RNA inside cells.

         <title>Luminescent Amphiphilic Aminoglycoside Probes to Study Transfection</title>

Transfection tracker: Conjugates of luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties linked to the aminoglycoside tobramycin are reported. These compounds reveal an emission &#8220;on&#8221; behavior upon plasmid&#8208;DNA binding and are able to transfect different mammalian cell lines. The cellular uptake was investigated using the emission properties of the formed plasmid DNA&#8208;vector assemblies.







Abstract
We report the characterization of amphiphilic aminoglycoside conjugates containing luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties as transfection reagents. These inherently luminescent transfection vectors are capable of binding plasmid DNA through electrostatic interactions; this binding results in an emission &#8220;on&#8221; signal due to restriction of intramolecular motion of the luminophore core. The luminescent cationic amphiphiles effectively transferred plasmid DNA into mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293T), as proven by expression of a red fluorescent protein marker. The morphologies of the aggregates were investigated by microscopy as well as &#950;&#8208;potential and dynamic light&#8208;scattering measurements. The transfection efficiencies using luminescent cationic amphiphiles were similar to that of the gold&#8208;standard transfection reagent Lipofectamine&#174; 2000.

         <title>Subcellular Localisation of a Quinoline&#8208;Containing Fluorescent Cyclometallated IrIII Complex in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 9, Page 1568-1572, May 4, 2021. </description>

Lighting the way: We have explored the subcellular localisation of an antimalarial hybrid quinoline&#8208;triazole cyclometallated iridium(III) complex containing an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore, with a view to gaining insight into a possible mechanism of action of antimalarials exemplified by this structure.







Abstract
A fluorescent analogue of a previously synthesised N,N&#8208;chelated IrIII complex was prepared by coordination of the organic ligand to an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore. This cyclometallated IrIII complex in itself displays good, micromolar activity against the chloroquine&#8208;sensitive NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy found negligible localisation of the fluorescent complex within the digestive vacuole of the parasite. This eliminated the haem detoxification pathway as a potential mechanism of action. Similarly, no localisation of the complex within the parasitic nucleus was found, thus suggesting that this complex probably does not interfere with the DNA replication process. A substantial saturation of fluorescence from the complex was found near phospholipid structures such as the plasma and nuclear membranes but not in neutral lipid bodies. This indicates that an association with these membranes, or organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or branched mitochondrion, could be essential to the efficacies of these types of antimalarial compounds.

         <title>Tagged Benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones as Novel Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 9, Page 1578-1581, May 4, 2021. </description>

1&#8208;step synthesis, 2&#8208;step labeling: Alkyne&#8208;conjugated benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones are easily accessible in a 1&#8208;step synthesis from substituted anthranilic acid derivatives. They make novel activity&#8208;based probes that covalently react with serine proteases and allow read&#8208;out by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne&#8208;substituted benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne&#8208;tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be used in two&#8208;step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre&#8208;functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity-based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne-substituted benzoxazin-4-ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne-tagged benzoxazin-4-ones can be used in two-step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre-functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin-4-ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Targeted Degradation of PARP14 Using a Heterobifunctional Small Molecule</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tool to dissect PARP14: A heterobifunctional small molecule that selectively degrades PARP14 is described. It can be used in studies to unravel the biological function of this large protein's mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyltransferase catalytic domain and its macrodomains, WWE domain and RNA recognition motifs in immunity and inflammation.







Abstract
PARP14 is an interferon&#8208;stimulated gene that is overexpressed in multiple tumor types, influencing pro&#8208;tumor macrophage polarization as well as suppressing the antitumor inflammation response by modulating IFN&#8208;&#947; and IL&#8208;4 signaling. PARP14 is a 203&#8197;kDa protein that possesses a catalytic domain responsible for the transfer of mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose to its substrates. PARP14 also contains three macrodomains and a WWE domain which are binding modules for mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose and poly&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose, respectively, in addition to two RNA recognition motifs. Catalytic inhibitors of PARP14 have been shown to reverse IL&#8208;4 driven pro&#8208;tumor gene expression in macrophages, however it is not clear what roles the non&#8208;enzymatic biomolecular recognition motifs play in PARP14&#8208;driven immunology and inflammation. To further understand this, we have discovered a heterobifunctional small molecule designed based on a catalytic inhibitor of PARP14 that binds in the enzyme's NAD+&#8208;binding site and recruits cereblon to ubiquitinate it and selectively target it for degradation.

         <title>Recent Advances in Late&#8208;Stage Construction of Stapled Peptides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation stapling strategies of peptides catalyzed by transition metals, such as palladium, rhodium, and manganese, are discussed. These strategies which rely on directing groups (DGs) in the reaction can be classified into three categories: (1)&#8197;directly constructing stapled peptides without DGs; (2)&#8197;those using peptide backbones as DGs; (3)&#8197;those that install additional DGs to generate stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides have been widely applied in many fields, including pharmaceutical chemistry, diagnostic reagents, and materials science. However, most traditional stapled peptide preparation methods rely on prefunctionalizations, which limit the diversity of stapled peptides. Recently, the emergence of late&#8208;stage transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation in amino acids and peptides has attracted wide interest due to its robustness and applicability for peptide stapling. In this review, we summarize the methods for late&#8208;stage construction of stapled peptides via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;kinetics Reveal Dynamic Effects on the Chemistry of Human Dihydrofolate Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR) catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis are reported. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures.







Abstract
Effects of isotopic substitution on the rate constants of human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR), an important target for anti&#8208;cancer drugs, have not previously been characterized due to its complex fast kinetics. Here, we report the results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the HsDHFR catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures. The presented cryogenic approach provides an opportunity to probe the kinetics of mammalian DHFRs, thereby laying the foundation for characterizing their transition state structure.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Sinapigladioside, an Antifungal Isothiocyanate from Burkholderia Symbionts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternative pathways: Genetic analyses and labeling studies provide the first insights into the biosynthesis of the rare isothiocyanate natural product sinapigladioside from beetle&#8208;associated bacteria that might protect the beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. Contrary to known isothiocyanate biosynthetic pathways, sinapigladioside assembly involves an isonitrile synthase.







Abstract
Sinapigladioside is a rare isothiocyanate&#8208;bearing natural product from beetle&#8208;associated bacteria (Burkholderia gladioli) that might protect beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. The biosynthetic origin of sinapigladioside has been elusive, and little is known about bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis in general. On the basis of stable&#8208;isotope labeling, bioinformatics, and mutagenesis, we identified the sinapigladioside biosynthesis gene cluster in the symbiont and found that an isonitrile synthase plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining and network analyses indicate that related gene clusters are distributed across various bacterial phyla including producers of both nitriles and isothiocyanates. Our findings support a model for bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis by sulfur transfer into isonitrile precursors.

         <title>Investigation of Vitamin D2 and Vitamin D3 Hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microbial transformation of vitamin D to the active forms by a two&#8208;step hydroxylation represents a promising alternative to complex chemical syntheses. The ascomycete K. albida was shown to catalyze vitamin D hydroxylation by forming diverse single&#8208; and double&#8208;hydroxylation products. The efficiency of the reaction could be drastically increased by the addition of cyclodextrin derivatives to the biotransformation.







Abstract
The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D2 (VD2) and vitamin D3 (VD3) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain, Kutzneria albida, with the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D2 and 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D3 was identified. To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D3 and tenfold higher concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D2 after addition of 5&#8201;% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single&#8208;hydroxylation products, the human double&#8208;hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D2 and 1,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D3 and various other potential single&#8208; and double&#8208;hydroxylation products were detected. Thus, K. albida represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD2 and VD3 metabolites.

The microbial synthesis of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (VD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (VD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain, &lt;i&gt;Kutzneria albida&lt;/i&gt;, with the ability to form 25-OH&#8722;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 25-OH&#8722;D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was identified. To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100-fold higher product concentrations of 25-OH&#8722;D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and tenfold higher concentrations of 25-OH&#8722;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after addition of 5&#8201;% (&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) 2-hydroxypropyl &#946;-cyclodextrin (2-HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single-hydroxylation products, the human double-hydroxylation products 1,25-(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1,25-(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and various other potential single- and double-hydroxylation products were detected. Thus, &lt;i&gt;K. albida&lt;/i&gt; represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and VD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorescence Properties of a Novel Isoquinoline Derivative Tested in an Invertebrate Chordate, Ciona intestinalis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a fluorescent 3&#8208;hydroxyisoquinoline derivative (ISO&#8208;1) has been revised, increasing the amount to gram scale. Its properties were tested in an invertebrate model, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. ISO&#8208;1 marks the nuclei in a reversible way and immobilizes larvae, suggesting neuroactive properties.







Abstract
3&#8208;Hydroxyisoquinolines (ISOs) and their tautomeric isoquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are heterocycles with attractive biological properties. Here we reported the revisited synthesis of a highly functionalized ISO that showed blue fluorescence and the characterization of its biological properties in an invertebrate animal model, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Larvae exposed to ISO at concentrations higher than 1&#8197;&#956;M showed an intense fluorescence localized in the cell nuclei of all tissues. Moreover, exposure to ISO interfered with larval ability to swim; this neuromuscular effect was reversible. Overall, these results suggested that ISOs can have promising applications as novel fluorescent dyes of the cell nuclei.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncovering the structure and function of biomolecules is a fundamental goal in structural biology. Membrane&#8208;embedded transport proteins are ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. Despite structural flexibility, their mechanisms are typically studied by ensemble biochemical methods or by static high&#8208;resolution structures, which complicate a detailed understanding of their dynamics. Here, we review the recent progress of single molecule F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) in determining mechanisms and timescales of substrate transport across membranes. These studies do not only demonstrate the versatility and suitability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smFRET tools for studying membrane transport proteins but they also highlight the importance of membrane mimicking environments in preserving the function of these proteins. The current achievements advance our understanding of transport mechanisms and have the potential to facilitate future progress in drug design.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of the Self&#8208;Aggregation of R3R4 Bi&#8208;repeat of Tau Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;aggregation of R3R4 bi&#8208;repeat of tau is distinct from the heparin induced aggregation of the protein. Solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy confirm the significant role of R4 residues in the self&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
Abstract: Different cryo&#8208;EM derived atomic models of in&#8197;vivo tau filaments from patients with tauopathies consisted of R3 and R4 repeats of the microtubule&#8208;binding domain. In comparison, only the R3 repeat forms the core of the heparin&#8208;induced fibrils of the three repeat tau isoforms. For developing therapeutics, it is desirable to have an in&#8197;vitro tau aggregation system producing fibrils corresponding to the disease morphology. Here we report the self&#8208;aggregation of truncated tau segment R3R4 peptide without requiring heparin for aggregation induction. We used NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical methods to monitor the self&#8208;aggregation of R3R4. We identified the hexapeptide region in R3 and &#946;&#8208;turn region in R4 as the aggregation initiating region of the protein. The solid&#8208;state NMR of self&#8208;aggregated R3R4 fibrils demonstrated that in addition to R3 residues, residues of R4 were also part of the fibril filaments. The presence of both R3 and R4 residues in the aggregation process and the core of fibril filaments suggest that the aggregation of R3R4 might resemble the in&#8197;vivo aggregation process.

         <title>Inhibitors of CA IX Enzyme Based on Polyhedral Boron Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review describes recent progress in the design and development of inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) based on space&#8208;filling carborane and cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters. CA IX enzyme is known to play crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and formation of metastases. The new class of potent and selective CA IX inhibitors combines structural motif of bulky inorganic cluster with an alkylsulfamido or alkylsulfonamido anchor group for Zn2+ ion in the enzyme active site. Detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study of a large series containing 50 compounds uncovered structural features of the cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors that are important for efficient and selective inhibition of CA IX activity. Preclinical evaluation of selected compounds revealed low toxicity, favourable pharmacokinetics and ability to reduce tumour growth. Cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors of CA IX can thus be considered as promising candidates for drug development and/ or for combination therapy in BNCT.</dc:description>

         <title>Isopentenol utilization pathway for the production of linalool in Escherichia coli using an improved bacterial linalool/nerolidol synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linalool is a monoterpenoid used as a fragrance ingredient, and is a promising source for alternative fuels. Synthetic biology offers attractive alternative production methods compared to extraction from natural sources and chemical synthesis. Linalool/nerolidol synthase (bLinS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus is a bifunctional enzyme, producing linalool as well as the sesquiterpenoid nerolidol when expressed in engineered Escherichia coli harbouring a precursor terpenoid pathway such as the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Here we identified two residues important for substrate selection by bLinS, L72 and V214, where the introduction of bulkier residues results in variants with reduced nerolidol formation. Terpenoid production using canonical precursor pathways is usually limited by numerous and highly regulated enzymatic steps. Here we compared the canonical MVA pathway to the non&#8208;canonical isoprenol utilization (IU) pathway to produce linalool using the optimised bLinS variant. The IU pathway uses isoprenol and prenol to produce linalool in only five steps. Adjusting substrate, plasmid system, inducer concentration, and cell strain directs the flux towards monoterpenoids. Our integrated approach, combining enzyme engineering with flux control using the artificial IU pathway, resulted in high purity production of the commercially attractive monoterpenoid linalool, and will guide future efforts towards efficient optimisation of terpenoid production in engineered microbes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Pathway towards Optically Pure FAHFAs**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full enzymatic synthesis of FAHFAs: Various hydroxy fatty acids with different &#8722;OH positions can be synthesized from renewable fatty acids by wild&#8208;type and engineered fatty acid hydratases, which can be cascaded with lipase to prepare value&#8208;added FAHFAs with potential medical value.







Abstract
Recently discovered endogenous mammalian lipids, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), have been proved to have anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;diabetic effects. Due to their extremely low abundancies in&#8197;vivo, forging a feasible scenario for FAHFA synthesis is critical for their use in uncovering biological mechanisms or in clinical trials. Here, we showcase a fully enzymatic approach, a novel in&#8197;vitro bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade system, enabling an effective conversion of nature&#8208;abundant fatty acids into FAHFAs. Two hydratases from Lactobacillus acidophilus were used for converting unsaturated fatty acids to various enantiomeric hydroxy fatty acids, followed by esterification with another fatty acid catalyzed by Candida antarctica lipase A (CALA). Various FAHFAs were synthesized in a semi&#8208;preparative scale using this bi&#8208;enzymatic approach in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step operation mode. In all, we demonstrate that the hydratase&#8208;CALA system offers a promising route for the synthesis of optically pure structure&#8208;diverse FAHFAs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently discovered endogenous mammalian lipids, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), have been proved to have anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic effects. Due to their extremely low abundancies &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt;, forging a feasible scenario for FAHFA synthesis is critical for their use in uncovering biological mechanisms or in clinical trials. Here, we showcase a fully enzymatic approach, a novel &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; bi-enzymatic cascade system, enabling an effective conversion of nature-abundant fatty acids into FAHFAs. Two hydratases from &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; were used for converting unsaturated fatty acids to various enantiomeric hydroxy fatty acids, followed by esterification with another fatty acid catalyzed by &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt; lipase A (CALA). Various FAHFAs were synthesized in a semi-preparative scale using this bi-enzymatic approach in a one-pot two-step operation mode. In all, we demonstrate that the hydratase-CALA system offers a promising route for the synthesis of optically pure structure-diverse FAHFAs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supramolecular Interaction of Molecular Cage and &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase: Application in Enzymatic Inhibition, Drug Delivery and Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of a water&#8208;soluble PdII8 molecular cage towards &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme activity was studied. The cage disintegrates in the presence of the enzyme and inhibits the enzyme by mixed mode of inhibition. This inhibition strategy and encapsulated hydrophobic curcumin inside the cage were used to control the growth of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.







Abstract
Enzyme inhibitors play a crucial role in diagnosis of a wide spectrum of diseases related to bacterial infections. We report here the effect of a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled PdII8 molecular cage towards &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme activity. The molecular cage is composed of a tetrapyridyl donor (L) and cis&#8208;[(en)Pd(NO3)2] (en=ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) acceptor and it has a hydrophobic internal cavity. We have observed that the acceptor moiety mainly possesses the ability to inactivate the &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme activity. Kinetic investigation revealed the mixed mode of inhibition. This inhibition strategy was extended to control the growth of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The internalization of the Pd(II) cage inside the bacteria was confirmed when bacterial solutions were incubated with curcumin loaded cage. The intrinsic green fluorescence of curcumin made the bacteria glow when put under an optical microscope. Furthermore, this curcumin loaded molecular cage shows an enhanced antibacterial activity. Thus, PdII8 molecular cage is quite attractive due to its dual role as enzyme inhibitor and drug carrier.

         <title>Thermodynamic Stability of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Impact of Sequence and Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological functions of G&#8208;quadruplexes and their properties as exploited in various technological applications depend on their major fold adopted under specific conditions. The present minireview guides through structural and environmental factors that have been identified to play a major role in the formation and stability of G&#8208;quadruplexes.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes have attracted growing interest in recent years due to their occurrence in&#8197;vivo and their possible biological functions. In addition to being promising targets for drug design, these four&#8208;stranded nucleic acid structures have also been recognized as versatile tools for various technological applications. Whereas a large number of studies have yielded insight into their remarkable structural diversity, our current knowledge on G&#8208;quadruplex stabilities as a function of sequence and environmental factors only gradually emerges with an expanding collection of thermodynamic data. This minireview provides an overview of general rules that may be used to better evaluate quadruplex thermodynamic stabilities but also discusses present challenges in predicting most stable folds for a given sequence and environment.

         <title>Comparison of Two DNA Aptamers for Dopamine Using Homogeneous Binding Assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two very different DNA aptamers have been reported for dopamine, one derived from an RNA aptamer (named Apt1) and other obtained via direct aptamer selection (named Apt2). In this study, we used four homogeneous binding assays to compare these two DNA dopamine aptamers. Apt1 does not appear to be able to bind dopamine specifically, while Apt2 showed specific binding and could be used for developing related biosensors.







Abstract
Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter and its detection is important for bioanalytical chemistry. Two very different DNA aptamers have been reported for dopamine, one derived from an RNA aptamer (named Apt1) and other obtained via direct aptamer selection (named Apt2). In this study, we used four homogeneous binding assays to compare these two DNA dopamine aptamers. Thiazole orange (TO) fluorescence assay indicated that the Apt2 specifically bound with dopamine with a Kd of 2.37&#8197;&#956;M, which was consistent with that from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. However, Apt1 had much less TO fluorescence change and also no signal from ITC. By labeling the two ends of the two aptamers by a fluorophore and a quencher, the aptamer beacons showed binding of dopamine only for Apt2. Finally, the label&#8208;free AuNP&#8208;based colorimetric assay showed no difference between these two aptamer sequences, and even non&#8208;binding random DNA showed the same response, indicating that AuNPs were not a good probe for detecting dopamine. According to the data, Apt1 does not appear to be able to bind dopamine specifically, while Apt2 showed specific binding and could be used for developing related biosensors.

         <title>Discovery of a Cell&#8208;Active SuTEx Ligand of Prostaglandin Reductase 2</title>

A tyrosine&#8208;reactive PTGR2 inhibitor: A cell&#8208;active sulfonyl&#8208;triazole compound (HHS&#8208;0701) that ligands Y100 on prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) was discovered by quantitative chemical proteomics. Biochemical assays support HHS&#8208;0701 blockade of PTGR2 metabolism of the lipid substrate 15&#8208;Keto&#8208;PGE2. These findings bolster the potential for developing SuTEx compounds as pharmacological modulators of proteins in live cells.







Abstract
Sulfonyl&#8208;triazoles have emerged as a new reactive group for covalent modification of tyrosine sites on proteins through sulfur&#8208;triazole exchange (SuTEx) chemistry. The extent to which this sulfur electrophile can be tuned for developing ligands with cellular activity remains largely underexplored. Here, we performed fragment&#8208;based ligand discovery in live cells to identify SuTEx compounds capable of liganding tyrosine sites on diverse protein targets. We verified our quantitative chemical proteomic findings by demonstrating concentration&#8208;dependent activity of SuTEx ligands, but not inactive counterparts, against recombinant protein targets directly in live cells. Our structure&#8208;activity relationship studies identified the SuTEx ligand HHS&#8208;0701 as a cell&#8208;active inhibitor capable of blocking prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) biochemical activity.

         <title>Increased Valency Improves Inhibitory Activity of Peptides Targeting Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent scaffolds functionalized with PCSK9 inhibitors showed improved inhibitory activity, with the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers achieving up to &#8764;100&#8208;fold improved activity compared to monomeric P9&#8208;38. Overall, the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers are a highly efficacious class of peptide&#8208;based therapeutics for targeting PCSK9 inhibition.







Abstract
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a clinically validated target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 inhibitors have attracted pharmaceutical interest, but the effect of multivalency on bioactivity is poorly understood. Here we designed bivalent and tetravalent dendrimers, decorated with the PCSK9 inhibitory peptides Pep2&#8208;8[RRG] or P9&#8208;38, to study relationships between peptide binding affinity, peptide valency, and PCSK9 inhibition. Increased valency resulted in improved PCSK9 inhibition for both peptides, with activity improvements of up to 100&#8208;fold achieved for the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers compared to monomeric P9&#8208;38 in in&#8197;vitro competition binding assays. Furthermore, the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers showed improved potency at restoring functional low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels and internalizing LDL in the presence of PCSK9, demonstrating significant cell&#8208;based activity at picomolar concentrations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multivalent scaffolds functionalized&lt;/b&gt; with PCSK9 inhibitors showed improved inhibitory activity, with the P9-38-decorated dendrimers achieving up to &#8764;100-fold improved activity compared to monomeric P9-38. Overall, the P9-38-decorated dendrimers are a highly efficacious class of peptide-based therapeutics for targeting PCSK9 inhibition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a clinically validated target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Peptide-based PCSK9 inhibitors have attracted pharmaceutical interest, but the effect of multivalency on bioactivity is poorly understood. Here we designed bivalent and tetravalent dendrimers, decorated with the PCSK9 inhibitory peptides Pep2-8[RRG] or P9-38, to study relationships between peptide binding affinity, peptide valency, and PCSK9 inhibition. Increased valency resulted in improved PCSK9 inhibition for both peptides, with activity improvements of up to 100-fold achieved for the P9-38-decorated dendrimers compared to monomeric P9-38 in &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; competition binding assays. Furthermore, the P9-38-decorated dendrimers showed improved potency at restoring functional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels and internalizing LDL in the presence of PCSK9, demonstrating significant cell-based activity at picomolar concentrations. This study demonstrates the potential of increasing valency as a strategy for increasing the efficacy of peptide-based PCSK9 therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Variety of Nucleotide Polymerase Mutants Aiming to Synthesize Modified RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces several nucleotide polymerase mutants that can incorporate chemically modified nucleotides. Altering amino acid residues around the active sites effectively renders both DNA and RNA polymerases tolerant to ribose 2&#8217; modified ribonucleotide substrates. Introduction of these modifications makes RNA stable and beneficial for therapeutics.







Abstract
Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic RNA aptamers that exploit synthetic RNA to capture target molecules. However, ensuring RNA aptamers are resistant against intrinsic nucleases remains an issue and restricts their use as therapeutics. Introduction of chemical modifications to the 2&#8242; sugar moiety of RNA improves their stability effectively and can be achieved by chemical synthesis using modified phosphoramidites; however, this approach is not suitable for preparing long RNA molecules. Although recombinant nucleotide polymerases can transcribe RNA, these polymerases cannot synthesize modified RNA because they do not recognize 2&#8242; modified nucleoside triphosphates. In this review, we focus on several polymerase mutants that tolerate substrates containing modifications of the 2&#8242; sugar moiety to synthesize RNA, and the problems that must be overcome to prepare chemically modified RNA with high efficacy by in&#8197;vitro transcription.

         <title>Enzymatic RNA Production from NTPs Synthesized from Nucleosides and Trimetaphosphate**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of the reaction of nucleosides with cyclic trimetaphosphate under mild aqueous conditions produces nucleoside triphosphates at concentrations sufficient to sustain RNA synthesis by ribozyme and protein RNA polymerases.







Abstract
A mechanism of nucleoside triphosphorylation would have been critical in an evolving &#8220;RNA world&#8221; to provide high&#8208;energy substrates for reactions such as RNA polymerization. However, synthetic approaches to produce ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) have suffered from conditions such as high temperatures or high pH that lead to increased RNA degradation, as well as substrate production that cannot sustain replication. Previous reports have demonstrated that cyclic trimetaphosphate (cTmp) can react with nucleosides to form rNTPs under prebiotically&#8208;relevant conditions, but their reaction rates were unknown and the influence of reaction conditions not well&#8208;characterized. Here we established a sensitive assay that allowed for the determination of second&#8208;order rate constants for all four rNTPs, ranging from 1.7&#215;10&#8722;6 to 6.5&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The ATP reaction shows a linear dependence on pH and Mg2+, and an enthalpy of activation of 88&#177;4&#8197;kJ/mol. At millimolar nucleoside and cTmp concentrations, the rNTP production rate is sufficient to facilitate RNA synthesis by both T7 RNA polymerase and a polymerase ribozyme. We suggest that the optimized reaction of cTmp with nucleosides may provide a viable connection between prebiotic nucleotide synthesis and RNA replication.

         <title>Chemoproteomic Profiling of Covalent XPO1 Inhibitors to Assess Target Engagement and Selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Target engaged? We report clickable probes based on the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor and eltanexor for the labeling of XPO1 in live cells to assess target engagement and selectivity. We used mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic workflows to profile the proteome&#8208;wide selectivity of selinexor and eltanexor and show that they are highly selective for XPO1.







Abstract
Selinexor, a covalent XPO1 inhibitor, is approved in the USA in combination with dexamethasone for penta&#8208;refractory multiple myeloma. Additional XPO1 covalent inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for multiple diseases including hematologic malignancies, solid tumor malignancies, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is important to measure the target engagement and selectivity of covalent inhibitors to understand the degree of engagement needed for efficacy, while avoiding both mechanism&#8208;based and off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we report clickable probes based on the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor and eltanexor for the labeling of XPO1 in live cells to assess target engagement and selectivity. We used mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic workflows to profile the proteome&#8208;wide selectivity of selinexor and eltanexor and show that they are highly selective for XPO1. Thermal profiling analysis of selinexor further offers an orthogonal approach to measure XPO1 engagement in live cells. We believe these probes and assays will serve as useful tools to further interrogate the biology of XPO1 and its inhibition in cellular and in&#8197;vivo systems.

         <title>A Mutation&#8208;Based Method for Pinpointing a DNA N6&#8208;Methyladenine Methyltransferase Modification Site at Single Base Resolution</title>

An enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) substrate modification site at single&#8208;base resolution is described.







Abstract
DNA N6&#8208;methyladenine (6mA) has recently received notable attention due to an increased finding of its functional roles in higher eukaryotes. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) substrate modification site at single base resolution. A designed allyl&#8208;substituted MTase cofactor was applied in the catalytic transfer reaction, and the allyl group was installed to the N6&#8208;position of adenine within a specific DNA sequence to form N6&#8208;allyladenine (6aA). The iodination of 6aA allyl group induced the formation of 1, N6&#8208;cyclized adenine which caused mutations during DNA replication by a polymerase. Thus the modification site could be precisely detected by a mutation signal. We synthesized 6aA deoxynucleoside and deoxynucleotide model compounds and a 6aA&#8208;containing DNA probe, and screened nine DNA polymerases to define an optimal system capable of detecting the substrate modification site of a DNA 6mA MTase at single&#8208;base resolution.

         <title>Construction of a CRISPR&#8208;Biolayer Interferometry Platform for Real&#8208;Time, Sensitive, and Specific DNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threefold detection: A CRISPR biosensor is immobilized on a biolayer to construct a CRISPR&#8208;BLI platform for DNA detection. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI chip is rapid, label&#8208;free, and real&#8208;time, and has high sequence affinity and specificity due to the properties of BLI and the CRISPR probe. Coupling with PCR improves the sensitivity to 1.34&#8197;pg, revealing promising applications in dsDNA detection.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been widely applied for nucleic acid detection because of its high specificity. By using the highly specific and irreversible bond between HaloTag and its alkane chlorine ligand, we modified dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR/Cas9) with biotin as a biosensor to detect nucleic acids. The CRISPR biosensor was facilely prepared to adequately maintain its DNA&#8208;recognition capability. Furthermore, by coupling biolayer interferometry (BLI) with the CRISPR biosensor, a real&#8208;time, sensitive, and rapid digital system called CRISPR&#8208;BLI was established for the detection of double&#8208;stranded DNA. The CRISPR biosensor immobilised on the biolayer could recruit the target DNA onto the biosensor surface and change its optical thickness, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern and responding signal of the BLI. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system was further applied to detect the ALP gene of Escherichia coli DH5&#945; combined with a polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated a linear range from 20 to 20&#8201;000&#8197;pg and a low detection limit (1.34&#8197;pg). The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system is a promising approach for rapid and sensitive detection of target DNA analytes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Threefold detection&lt;/b&gt;: A CRISPR biosensor is immobilized on a biolayer to construct a CRISPR-BLI platform for DNA detection. The CRISPR-BLI chip is rapid, label-free, and real-time, and has high sequence affinity and specificity due to the properties of BLI and the CRISPR probe. Coupling with PCR improves the sensitivity to 1.34&#8197;pg, revealing promising applications in dsDNA detection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been widely applied for nucleic acid detection because of its high specificity. By using the highly specific and irreversible bond between HaloTag and its alkane chlorine ligand, we modified dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR/Cas9) with biotin as a biosensor to detect nucleic acids. The CRISPR biosensor was facilely prepared to adequately maintain its DNA-recognition capability. Furthermore, by coupling biolayer interferometry (BLI) with the CRISPR biosensor, a real-time, sensitive, and rapid digital system called CRISPR-BLI was established for the detection of double-stranded DNA. The CRISPR biosensor immobilised on the biolayer could recruit the target DNA onto the biosensor surface and change its optical thickness, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern and responding signal of the BLI. The CRISPR-BLI system was further applied to detect the &lt;i&gt;ALP&lt;/i&gt; gene of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; DH5&#945; combined with a polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated a linear range from 20 to 20&#8201;000&#8197;pg and a low detection limit (1.34&#8197;pg). The CRISPR-BLI system is a promising approach for rapid and sensitive detection of target DNA analytes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Developing metal&#8208;based drugs that can be activated by red light is the &#8220;holy grail&#8220; of photodynamic therapy (PDT) research. This highlight summarizes current research on RuII&#8208;polypyridyl complexes with red&#8208;shifted absorption to achieve in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo photo&#8208;cytotoxicity with 540&#8211;600&#8197;nm light. The huge potential of judicial ligand modification and in&#8208;silico optimization to achieve red&#8208;light, metal&#8208;based PDT drugs are indicated.







Abstract
In the field of cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) research, development of metal&#8208;based PDT drugs that can be used under red light exposure is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; to achieve. This highlight highlighted few current literatures on polypyridyl&#8208;based Ru(II) complexes with significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption to achieve in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo PDT effect in 540&#8211;600 nm light. The enormous potential of judicial ligand choice and in&#8208;silico optimization to achieve the red light, metal&#8208;based PDT drugs are discussed.

         <title>Asparaginyl Ligases: New Enzymes for the Protein Engineer's Toolbox</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intents and (re)purposes: Asparaginyl ligases are highly efficient transpeptidases. These enzymes naturally catalyse the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation of small plant peptides, but recently have been repurposed for the modification of diverse proteins. This minireview describes the current state of protein engineering with asparaginyl ligases.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalysed site&#8208;specific protein modifications enable the precision manufacture of conjugates for the study of protein function and/or for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Asparaginyl ligases are a class of highly efficient transpeptidases with the capacity to modify proteins bearing only a tripeptide recognition motif. Herein, we review the types of protein modification that are accessible using these enzymes, including N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal protein labelling, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation, and protein&#8208;protein conjugation. We describe the progress that has been made to engineer highly efficient ligases as well as efforts to chemically manipulate the enzyme reaction to favour product formation. These enzymes are powerful additions to the protein engineer&#8216;s toolbox.

         <title>Sirtuin 2 Regulates Protein LactoylLys Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) alter the structure and function of enzymes and are often regulated by enzymatic removal by &#8220;erasers&#8221;. The nonenzymatically derived PTM lactoylLys was recently identified in states of elevated glycolytic flux. Herein, we report the deacylase sirtuin 2 as the first known &#8220;eraser&#8221; for lactoylLys, expanding the knowledge of enzymatic regulation of nonenzymatically derived protein PTMs.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play roles in both physiological and pathophysiological processes through the regulation of enzyme structure and function. We recently identified a novel PTM, lactoylLys, derived through a nonenzymatic mechanism from the glycolytic by&#8208;product, lactoylglutathione. Under physiologic scenarios, glyoxalase 2 prevents the accumulation of lactoylglutathione and thus lactoylLys modifications. What dictates the site&#8208;specificity and abundance of lactoylLys PTMs, however, remains unknown. Here, we report sirtuin 2 as a lactoylLys eraser. Using chemical biology and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, we show that SIRT2 controls the abundance of this PTM both globally and on chromatin. These results address a major gap in our understanding of how nonenzymatic PTMs are regulated and controlled.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Metallodrugs: An Untapped Source of Artificial Gene Editing Technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinking the duplex and other alterations: This review describes the rational design of metal complexes with nucleic acid recognition properties and how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions is opening up new avenues in the fields of gene engineering and targeted therapies.







Abstract
DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or noncovalent binding modes. Several recognition modes &#8211; including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation &#8211; are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes, which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This Review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.

         <title>Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenases from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter brockii as Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scope and selectivity: Recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of secondary ADHs from T. pseudoethanolicus and T. brockii by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution are reviewed. Moreover, the thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion in other interesting reactions to produce optically active alcohols and amines.







Abstract
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are an important type of enzyme that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus (TeSADH) and Thermoanaerobacter brockii (TbSADH) are well&#8208;known as robust catalysts. However, like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.&#8201;e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This minireview discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of TeSADH and TbSADH by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, TeSADH has been used in quantitative non&#8208;stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to deracemize alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in the racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.

For instance, &lt;i&gt;Te&lt;/i&gt;SADH has been used in quantitative non-stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to deracemize alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in the racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Harnessing Multiple, Nonproteogenic Substitutions to Optimize CSP:ComD Hydrophobic Interactions in Group&#8197;1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>

Unnaturally optimized: The use of unnatural amino acids allowed the optimization of hydrophobic interactions between CSP1 and the cognate ComD1 receptor by assessing how multiple, coordinated substitutions in the CSP1 amino acid sequence can affect CSP1 binding.







Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence&#8208;stimulating peptide (CSP)&#8208;mediated quorum&#8208;sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in S. pneumoniae can therefore be used to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility to resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and nonproteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure&#8211;activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP&#8208;based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.

         <title>Can Precision Electrophile Signaling Make a Meaningful and Lasting Impression in Drug Design?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medicinal chemists have uncovered that the incorporation of an electrophilic appendage into a non&#8208; covalent pharmacophore can confer important benefits, such as improved selectivity. Studies on electrophile signaling have shown that when a matched electrophile engages with its protein target, unexpected phenotypic responses can ensue. Such responses are above and beyond what has been typically reported for covalent pharmacophore&#8208;protein target interactions. So, can we blend these concepts together to make better drugs?







Abstract
For several years, drugs with reactive electrophilic appendages have been developed. These units typically confer prolonged residence time of the drugs on their protein targets, and may assist targeting shallow binding sites and/or improving the drug&#8211;protein target spectrum. Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.

         <title>Two Triterpene Synthases from Imperata cylindrica Catalyzing the Formation of a Pair of Diastereoisomers through Boat or Chair Cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling conformation during cyclization: I. cylindrica produces the diastereomeric triterpenes isoarborinol and fernenol depending on whether the B&#8208;ring of oxidosqualene was in a boat or chair conformation during cyclization. Mutational studies on the two enzymes resulted in partial conversion of the products. Placing a histidine residue at a critical site resulted in the production of a rare triterpene.







Abstract
Imperata cylindrica is known to produce a pair of triterpenes, isoarborinol and fernenol, that exhibit identical planar structures but possess opposite stereochemistry at six of the nine chiral centers. These differences arise from a boat or a chair cyclization of the B&#8208;ring of the substrate. Herein, we report the characterization of three OSC genes from I. cylindrica. IcOSC1 and IcOSC5 were identified as isoarborinol and fernenol synthases, respectively, while IcOSC3 was characterized as a multifunctional enzyme that produces glutinol and friedelin as its major products. Mutational studies of isoarborinol and fernenol synthases revealed that the residues surrounding the DCTAE motif partially affected the conformation of the B&#8208;ring during cyclization. Additionally, the IcOSC1&#8208;W255H mutant produced the rare triterpene boehmerol. The introduced histidine residue presumably abstracted a proton from the intermediary carbocation at C18 during the 1,2&#8208;rearrangement. Expression analysis indicated that all OSC genes were highly expressed in stems.

         <title>Probing the Interaction of Huntingtin Exon&#8208;1 Polypeptides with the Chaperonin Nanomachine GroEL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyglutamine expansion within the region of huntingtin encoded by exon&#8208;1 of the htt gene results in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We show that the chaperonin GroEL, the bacterial homolog of human mitochondrial Hsp60, inhibits fibril formation of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 peptides and probe the interaction using NMR relaxation&#8208;based experiments designed to explore short&#8208;lived sparsely populated states.







Abstract
Huntington's disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon&#8208;1 region of huntingtin (httex1), resulting in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various httex1 constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy, we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of httex1 constructs with intact GroEL and a mini&#8208;chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation&#8208;based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100 to 400&#8197;&#956;s with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of &#8764;1&#8211;2&#8197;mM. The binding interface is formed by the N&#8208;terminal amphiphilic region of httex1 (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric httex1 by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right spot for white spot: A G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence identified within the DNA genome of white spot syndrome virus folds into a major and a thermodynamically less stable minor loop isomer. The parallel quadruplex scaffold might constitute a potential target for viral drug development against white spot disease.







Abstract
White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G&#8594;T substitutions in the third G4 tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild&#8208;type sequence into a three&#8208;tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and a minor 1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.

         <title>A Reconstructed Common Ancestor of the Fatty Acid Photo&#8208;decarboxylase Clade Shows Photo&#8208;decarboxylation Activity and Increased Thermostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme resurrection strikes again: Ancestral sequence reconstruction was applied to a putative photo&#8208;decarboxylases clade. One common ancestor showed up to 12&#8208;fold production yield, a 15&#8201;&#176;C increase in thermostability and up to 20&#8208;fold improvement in residual activity when incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C. Ancestral sequence reconstruction proved to be a valuable tool to introduce valid mutations to a little understood fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase.







Abstract
Light&#8208;dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520&#8197;nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose&#8208;methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photo&#8208;decarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15&#8201;&#176;C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12&#8208;fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of the Interaction of pICln, RioK1 and COPR5 with the PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determination of a PPI interface: The adaptor protein binding site of PRMT5 has been identified and studied by using synthetic peptides. A cocrystal structure of the PRMT5 TIM&#8208;barrel domain and a RioK1&#8208;derived peptide highlights the site of interaction.







Abstract
The PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein&#8211;protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins that recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for the methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5, we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report the characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identify the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.

         <dc:description>
Ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, bioinspired catalysts possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these systems have high activity, enantioselectivity, and aqueous solubility. Recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.







Abstract
Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency. This review outlines important developments and future prospects for the design and application of bioinspired and biohybrid systems at multiple length scales for important, biologically relevant, clean energy transformations.

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools To Investigate Malaria Parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ghost hunting: Malaria tropica has been haunting mankind for centuries, but investigating the biology of the causative agent, the protozoan parasite P. falciparum, remains challenging. Herein, we describe ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, non&#8208;genetic, small molecular probes from the field of chemical biology that have been, or may be, used to interrogate the complex infection cycle, with an emphasis on infected red blood cells.







Abstract
Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite's biology is pivotal to deciphering unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensure the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small&#8208;molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance research into this parasite in the future. We anticipate that the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of P. falciparum and we hope that researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge &#8211; with the aim of ending this devastating disease.

         <title>Manufacture of Multilayered Artificial Cell Membranes through Sequential Bilayer Deposition on Emulsion Templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Running rings around vesicles: We describe a droplet&#8208;based technology to manufacture cell&#8208;sized multilamellar lipid vesicles. Individual membranes are assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, giving control over the number of induvial layers and their molecular content. We investigated how the biomechanical properties of the structures change with each added layer.







Abstract
Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes, are multilamellar. Due to a lack of technologies available for their controlled construction, multilayered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell&#8208;mimetic motifs used in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. To address this, we developed emulsion&#8208;based technologies that allow cell&#8208;sized multilayered vesicles to be produced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, with compositional control over each layer, thus enabling studies that would otherwise remain inaccessible. We discovered that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter&#8208;bilayer registration between coexisting liquid&#8211;liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multilayered membrane structures, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple bilayers.

Optimization of the reaction conditions improved the solubility and stability of the sensitive starting materials as well as previously observed low conversions. This approach offers a concise alternative to traditionally employed multistep routes to these compounds.







Abstract
Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The widespread application of 2&#8208;selenopyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Herein, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80&#8201;&#176;C and at pH&#8197;9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10, and therefore differ by an order of magnitude from the equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, and this complicates their synthesis significantly. A tenfold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48&#8201;% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40&#8201;% isolated yield, which compares favorably to established chemical routes.

         <title>Probes for Photoaffinity Labelling of Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light up the kinome. Probes for photoaffinity labelling of kinases are powerful research tools for detecting (off&#8208;)targets of kinase inhibitors, imaging kinases within the cell or identifying binding partners. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available kinase photoaffinity probes and discuss how such probes are designed. We illustrate the applicability with various examples.







Abstract
Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for the photoaffinity labelling of kinases are important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several areas of application of these probes, including the identification of targets and off&#8208;targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, the development of inhibitor screening assays, the imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.

         <title>Intrinsic Fluorescence of the Active and the Inactive Functional Forms of Human Thymidylate Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of form: The active and the inactive functional forms of human thymidylate synthase, a long&#8208;known anticancer target, exhibit different intrinsic fluorescence spectra, quantum yields, lifetime profiles and anisotropies. These differences are connected to the conformational changes occurring in the active &#8211; inactive interconversion and provide tools for real&#8208;time identification and quantitation of the two protein forms in solution.







Abstract
The observables associated with protein intrinsic fluorescence &#8211; spectra, time decays, anisotropies &#8211; offer opportunities to monitor in real time and non&#8208;invasively a protein&#8216;s functional form and its interchange with other forms with different functions. We employed these observables to sketch the fluorometric profiles of two functional forms of human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a homodimeric enzyme crucial for cell proliferation and thus targeted by anticancer drugs. The protein takes an active and an inactive form. Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.

         <title>Approaches to Evaluate the Impact of a Small&#8208;Molecule Binder to a Noncatalytic Site of the Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the impact of small molecules: There are a number of essential protein&#8211;protein interactions between the 19S regulatory particle and 20S core particle to form the full 26S proteasome. We investigated whether a small&#8208;molecule binder to Rpn&#8208;6, a 19S subunit, could disrupt 26S proteasome activity.







Abstract
Proteasome activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. In recent years, small molecules have been discovered that can affect the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Rather than targeting the active sites of the proteasome, it might be possible to affect ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of proteins by limiting the association of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) with the 20S core particle (20S CP) of the proteasome. We recently described the discovery of TXS&#8208;8, a peptoid that binds to Rpn&#8208;6. Rpn&#8208;6 is a proteasome&#8208;associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Herein, we present a general workflow to evaluate the impact of a small&#8208;molecule binder on proteasome activity by using TXS&#8208;8 as an example. This workflow contains three steps in which specific probes or overexpressed proteins in cells are used to determine whether the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome is affected. Although, in our case, TXS&#8208;8 did not affect proteasome activity, our workflow is highly amenable to studying a variety of small&#8208;molecule&#8211;proteasome subunit interactions.

         <title>Application of Neuron&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe, NeuA, To Identify Mouse Retinal Degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As far as the eye can be seen: Developed fluorescent probe, NeuA (NeuO with an acrylamide group), stained healthy mouse retinal neuron cells and discriminated between healthy retina and retina with degenerating photoreceptors by confocal and fluorescent fundus microscopy. These imaging probes can be used as diagnostic and prognostic tools for retinitis pigmentosa in a clinical domain.







Abstract
The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe&#8208;NeuA&#8208;for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined in&#8197;vitro, ex vivo and in&#8197;vivo using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.

         <title>Isopenicillin&#8197;N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thousand words: Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase drives the central step in penicillin biosynthesis, oxidative cyclisation of a linear tripeptide to form the bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactam core. Crystal structures of the protein with its substrate, product, trapped reaction intermediates, and diverse substrate analogues paint a rich mechanistic picture of the enzyme in action and deepen our understanding of non&#8208;heme iron enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase (IPNS) is a non&#8208;heme iron oxidase (NHIO) that catalyses the cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;l&#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;d&#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin&#8197;N (IPN). Over the last 25&#8197;years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of Fe at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family.

Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction by using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover in crystallo.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thousand words&lt;/b&gt;: Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase drives the central step in penicillin biosynthesis, oxidative cyclisation of a linear tripeptide to form the bicyclic &#946;-lactam core. Crystal structures of the protein with its substrate, product, trapped reaction intermediates, and diverse substrate analogues paint a rich mechanistic picture of the enzyme in action and deepen our understanding of non-heme iron enzyme catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase (IPNS) is a non-heme iron oxidase (NHIO) that catalyses the cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;-(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-&#945;-aminoadipoyl)-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-cysteinyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin&#8197;N (IPN). Over the last 25&#8197;years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo-IPNS with Mn bound in place of Fe at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme-substrate complex IPNS&#8722;Fe&#8722;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co-substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction by using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co-substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover &lt;i&gt;in crystallo&lt;/i&gt;. In this way, X-ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, thereby answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution-phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have, in turn, informed computational experiments that have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exchange of Proteins in Liposomes through Streptolysin O Pores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a pore view of bioreactors: Streptolysin O creates pores in liposome membranes allowing proteins to permeate them. Enzymes including RNA polymerase can be supplied through these pores, allowing RNA to be synthesized in liposomes. The method could broaden the application of liposomes as biochemical reactors.







Abstract
Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. However, one of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. We used the toxic protein streptolysin O (SLO); this forms pores in membranes made of phospholipids containing cholesterol that can be closed by the addition of calcium ions. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9&#8201;% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98&#8208;kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in &#8764;8&#8201;% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.

         <title>Antibacterial and Anti&#8208;biofilm Activity of the Human Breast Milk Glycoprotein Lactoferrin against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maternal antimicrobial: Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial glycoprotein that is abundant in human breast milk. Lactoferrin has potent antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against Group B Streptococcus, a bacterial pathogen that causes severe perinatal infections. Additionally, lactoferrin can inhibit streptococcal adherence to human gestational tissues, underscoring its potential utility as an antimicrobial intervention during pregnancy.







Abstract
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an encapsulated Gram&#8208;positive human pathogen that causes invasive infections in pregnant hosts and neonates, as well as immunocompromised individuals. Colonization of the human host requires the ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces and circumnavigate the nutritional challenges and antimicrobial defenses associated with the innate immune response. Biofilm formation is a critical process to facilitate GBS survival and establishment of a replicative niche in the vertebrate host. Previous work has shown that the host responds to GBS infection by producing the innate antimicrobial glycoprotein lactoferrin, which has been implicated in repressing bacterial growth and biofilm formation. Additionally, lactoferrin is highly abundant in human breast milk and could serve a protective role against invasive microbial pathogens. This study demonstrates that human breast milk lactoferrin has antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and inhibits its adherence to human gestational membranes. Together, these results indicate that human milk lactoferrin could be used as a prebiotic chemotherapeutic strategy to limit the impact of bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on GBS&#8208;associated disease outcomes.

         <title>Novel Pet&#8208;Degrading Enzymes: Structure&#8208;Function from a Computational Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Life and death cycle of plastics: In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of the PETase&#8208;MHETase system for PET depolymerization to make it more suitable for industrial applications are described emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments.







Abstract
The bacterium strain Ideonella sakaiensis 201&#8208;F6 is able to hydrolyze low&#8208;crystallinity PET films at 30&#8201;&#176;C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to elucidating the structure and features of those two enzymes, and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts so as to make them more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups to investigate the structure and functionality of both PETase and MHETase in depth are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by I. sakaiensis enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging a prioritization of efforts in this prolific research field.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
