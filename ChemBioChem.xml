      <title>The charged linker modulates conformations and molecular interactions of Hsp90</title>
      <dc:description>The molecular chaperone Hsp90 supports the functional activity of specific substrate proteins (clients). For client processing, the Hsp90 dimer undergoes a series of ATP&#8208;driven conformational rearrangements. Flexible linkers connecting the three domains of Hsp90 are crucial to enable dynamic arrangements. The long, charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal (NTD) and middle (MD) domains exhibits additional functions  in vitro  and  in vivo  . The structural basis for these functions remains unclear. Here, we characterize the conformation and dynamics of the linker and NTD&#8208;MD domain interactions by NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal two regions in the linker that are dynamic and exhibit secondary structure conformations. We show that these regions mediate transient interactions with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this strand detaches and exposes a hydrophobic stretch, which enables binding to clients, as we show for the p53. We propose that the charged linker plays an important regulatory role by coupling the Hsp90 NTD&#8208;MD arrangement with the accessibility of a client binding site on the NTD.</dc:description>

The long, charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal (NTD) and middle (MD) domains exhibits additional functions  in vitro  and  in vivo  . The structural basis for these functions remains unclear. Here, we characterize the conformation and dynamics of the linker and NTD&#8208;MD domain interactions by NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal two regions in the linker that are dynamic and exhibit secondary structure conformations. We show that these regions mediate transient interactions with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this strand detaches and exposes a hydrophobic stretch, which enables binding to clients, as we show for the p53. We propose that the charged linker plays an important regulatory role by coupling the Hsp90 NTD&#8208;MD arrangement with the accessibility of a client binding site on the NTD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A High&#8208;throughput Screening Method for the Directed Evolution of Hydroxynitrile Lyase towards Cyanohydrin Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) represent a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. Currently available methods for demonstration of hydrocyanation reaction still stalled at precise but low throughput GC or HPLC analyses.

Abstract
In this viewpoint, the concepts that chemistry transcends the laboratory into the clinic and beyond is explored from the perspective of a single individual who began strictly within synthetic chemistry.

Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP levels.

      <title>Millisecond Allosteric Dynamics of Activated Ras Reproduced with a Slowly Hydrolyzable GTP Analogue</title>
      <dc:description>The millisecond timescale dynamics of activated Ras transiently sample a low&#8208;populated conformational state that has distinct surface property from the major state and represents a promising target for binding of small&#8208;molecule compounds. To avoid complications of hydrolysis, dynamics and other properties of active Ras have so far been routinely investigated using non&#8208;hydrolyzable GTP analogues, which, however, were previously reported to alter both the kinetics and distribution of the conformational exchange. In this study, we quantitatively measure and validate the internal dynamics of Ras complexed with a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP&#947;S, which increases the lifetime of active Ras by 23 times relative to that of native GTP. It is found that GTP&#947;S, in addition to its better mimicking of the exchange kinetics than the commonly used non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogues GppNHp and GppCH  2  p, can rigorously reproduce the natural dynamics network in active Ras, indicating its fitness for use in the development of allosteric inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The development of small molecules, which can selectively target G4 DNAs has drawn considerable attention due to their unique physiological and pathological functions. However, only a few molecules were found to selective binding of a particular G4 DNA structure. Herein, we have developed a fluorescence ligand  Q1  , a molecular scaffold of carbazole&#8208;pyridine core bridged with a phenylboronic acid side chain, exhibited as a selective ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 ligand with about 18 nm blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced fluorescence intensity. Photophysical properties revealed that  Q1  was sensitive to the microenvironment and gave the best selectivity to ASC20 with equilibrium binding constant (  K  a  = 6.04 &#180; 10  5  M  &#8208;1  ). The time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies also demonstrated that  Q1  showed a longer fluorescence lifetime in the presence of ASC20. The binding characteristics of  Q1  with ASC20 were described in detail by &#64258;uorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay, 2&#8208;Ap titration experiment and molecular docking. Ligand  Q1  could adopt an appropriate pose at terminal G&#8208;quartets of ASC20 via the multiple interactions including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between aromatic rings, thus led to a strong fluorescence enhancement. In addition, co&#8208;staining image showed  Q1  mainly distributed in the cytoplasm area. According, this work provides insights for the development of ligands that selectively targeting a specific G4 DNA structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Evolutionary History of Bioessential Elements Can Guide the Search for Life in the Universe</title>
      <dc:description>
Astrobiology, origins of life and metals: The environmental availabilities of biologically useful elements such as transition metals might influence natural selection. Understanding the evolution of life's essential chemical elements is also critical for detecting and interpreting potential biological signatures elsewhere in the universe.







Abstract
Our understanding of life in the universe comes from one sample, life on Earth. Current and next&#8208;generation space missions will target exoplanets as well as planets and moons in our own solar system with the primary goal of detecting, interpreting and characterizing indications of possible biological activity. Thus, understanding life's fundamental characteristics is increasingly critical for detecting and interpreting potential biological signatures elsewhere in the universe. Astrobiologists have outlined the essential roles of carbon and water for life, but we have yet to decipher the rules governing the evolution of how living organisms use bioessential elements. Does the suite of life's essential chemical elements on Earth constitute only one possible evolutionary outcome? Are some elements so essential for biological functions that evolution will select for them despite low availability? How would this play out on other worlds that have different relative element abundances? When we look for life in the universe, or the conditions that could give rise to life, we must learn how to recognize it in extremely different chemical and environmental conditions from those on Earth. We argue that by exposing self&#8208;organizing biotic chemistries to different combinations of abiotic materials, and by mapping the evolutionary history of metalloenzyme biochemistry onto geological availabilities of metals, alternative element choices that are very different from life's present&#8208;day molecular structure might result. A greater understanding of the paleomolecular evolutionary history of life on Earth will create a predictive capacity for detecting and assessing life's existence on worlds where alternate evolutionary paths might have been taken.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Astrobiology, origins of life and metals&lt;/b&gt;: The environmental availabilities of biologically useful elements such as transition metals might influence natural selection. Understanding the evolution of life's essential chemical elements is also critical for detecting and interpreting potential biological signatures elsewhere in the universe.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of life in the universe comes from one sample, life on Earth. Current and next&#8208;generation space missions will target exoplanets as well as planets and moons in our own solar system with the primary goal of detecting, interpreting and characterizing indications of possible biological activity. Thus, understanding life's fundamental characteristics is increasingly critical for detecting and interpreting potential biological signatures elsewhere in the universe. Astrobiologists have outlined the essential roles of carbon and water for life, but we have yet to decipher the rules governing the evolution of how living organisms use bioessential elements. Does the suite of life's essential chemical elements on Earth constitute only one possible evolutionary outcome? Are some elements so essential for biological functions that evolution will select for them despite low availability? How would this play out on other worlds that have different relative element abundances? When we look for life in the universe, or the conditions that could give rise to life, we must learn how to recognize it in extremely different chemical and environmental conditions from those on Earth. We argue that by exposing self&#8208;organizing biotic chemistries to different combinations of abiotic materials, and by mapping the evolutionary history of metalloenzyme biochemistry onto geological availabilities of metals, alternative element choices that are very different from life's present&#8208;day molecular structure might result. A greater understanding of the paleomolecular evolutionary history of life on Earth will create a predictive capacity for detecting and assessing life's existence on worlds where alternate evolutionary paths might have been taken.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An animal able to tolerate D2O</title>
      <dc:description>It is possible to gain a deeper insight on the role of water on biology by using physicochemical variant molecules, as deuterium oxide (D2O); however, D2O is toxic to multicellular organisms in high concentrations. By using a unique desiccation&#8208;rehydration process, we demonstrate that the anhydrobiotic nematode  Panagrolaimus superbus  is able to tolerate and proliferate in 99% D2O. Moreover, we analysed  P. superbus&#8217; water channel protein (aquaporin &#8208; AQP), associated with dehydration/rehydration, by comparing its primary structure and modelling its tertiary structure  in silico  . Our data evidence that  P. superbus&#8217; AQP is an aquaglyceroporin, a class of water channels known to display a wider pore, which help to explain the rapid and successful organismal influx of D2O in this species. This is the first demonstration of an animal able to withstand high D2O levels, thus paving a way for the investigation of the effects D2O on higher levels of biological organization.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise strategy for one&#8208;pot synthesis of single&#8208;stranded DNA rings from multiple short fragments</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Cyclic rings of single&#8208;stranded DNA have various unique properties, but still wider applications have been hampered by their poor availability. This paper reports a convenient one&#8208;pot method in which these rings are efficiently synthesized by using T4 DNA ligase through convergent cyclization of easily&#8208;available short DNA fragments. The key of the present method is to separate all the splint oligonucleotides into several sets, and add each set sequentially with appropriate interval to the solutions containing all the short DNA fragments. Compared with simple one&#8208;pot strategy involving simultaneous addition of all the splints at the beginning of reaction, both the selectivity and the yields of target single&#8208;stranded DNA rings are greatly improved. This convergent method is especially useful to prepare large&#8208;sized rings which are otherwise hardly obtainable. By starting from six short DNA fragments (71&#8208;82 nt), prepared by a DNA synthesizer, a single&#8208;stranded DNA ring of 452&#8208;nt size was synthesized in 35 mol% yield and in high selectivity.

      <title>Optical Biosensors for Virus Detection: Prospects for COVID&#8208;19</title>
      <dc:description>The recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) caused massive worldwide disruptions due to the lack of available testing locations and equipment. The use of optical techniques for viral detection has flourished in the past 15 years, providing more reliable, inexpensive, and accurate detection methods. In the current minireview, optical phenomena including fluorescence, surface plasmons, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and colorimetry are discussed in the context of detecting virus pathogens. The sensitivity of a viral detection method can be dramatically improved by utilizing materials that exhibit surface plasmons or SERS, but often it requires advanced instrumentation for detection. Although fluorescence and colorimetry lack high sensitivities, they show promise as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics because of their relatively less complicated instrumentation, ease of use, lower costs, and they do not require nucleic acid amplification.

      <title>Human Cellular Retinol Binding Protein II Forms a Domain&#8208;Swapped Trimer Representing a Novel Fold and a New Template for Protein Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
The folding pathway of human cellular retinol binding protein&#8197;II was manipulated to favor formation of the shown domain&#8208;swapped trimer, by rational protein engineering of a cross&#8208;subunit disulfide bond. The inset shows the zinc binding site, engineered into the trimer with a single mutation, by exploiting the threefold axis of symmetry in the center of the trimer. The &#8220;purple flag&#8221; iris shows how the overall threefold symmetry positions the small, white inner petals, reflective of the three coordinating histidines in the trimer.

The cover feature picture shows our work on a gapmer oligonucleotide with a zwitterionic backbone structure in the central gap and two anionic outer segments. One key question was if and how such a gapmer would bind to RNA, that is, if it displays sufficient binding affinity and base&#8208;pairing fidelity.

      <title>Novel dioxane and morpholine nucleotide analogs: Syntheses and RNA&#8208;hybridization properties</title>
      <dc:description>A novel class of nucleotide analogs with a dioxane ring as central scaffold was developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized and the final thymidine analogs synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide syntheses. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to the analogous morpholine derivatives, which opens the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double stranded RNA&#8208;sequences and their hybridization properties investigated by melting temperature analysis. Both scaffolds, dioxanes and morpholines, showed equal impact on double strand stability, but T m &#8208;values differed significantly depending on the chirality in the six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorescent peptide biosensor for probing CDK6 activity in lung cancer cell extracts</title>
      <dc:description>CDK6 kinase regulates cell cycle progression in G1, together with CDK4, but has cell&#8208;, tissue&#8208; and developmentally&#8208;distinct functions associated with transcription, angiogenesis and metabolism. Although CDK6 constitutes an attractive cancer biomarker and target there are no means of assessing its activity in a complex environment. In this study we describe design, engineering and characterization of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase that reports on CDK6 kinase activity through sensitive changes in fluorescence intensity. This biosensor can report on CDK6 activity in a dose&#8208;dependent fashion, thereby enabling quantification of differences in kinase activity in complex and physiologically&#8208;relevant environments. Further implementation of this biosensor in different lung and melanoma cell lines, as well as in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients together with a CDK4 biosensor highlighted differences in kinase activity between CDK6 and CDK4 kinase. This work demonstrates the utility of these selective tools for monitoring two closely related kinases comparatively and simultaneously in the same samples, thereby offering attractive perspectives for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</dc:description>

      <title>Similar but still different &#8211; which amino acid residues are responsible for varying activities in type&#8208;III copper enzymes?</title>
      <dc:description>Type&#8208;III copper enzymes like polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are omnipresent among organisms and play a significant role in the formation of pigments. PPOs comprise different enzyme groups, including tyrosinases (TYRs) and catechol oxidases (COs). TYRs catalyze the  o  &#8208;hydroxylation of monophenols and the oxidation of  o  &#8208;diphenols to the corresponding  o  &#8208;quinones (EC 1.14.18.1). In contrast, COs only catalyze the oxidation of  o  &#8208;diphenols to the corresponding  o  &#8208;quinones (EC 1.10.3.1). To date (August 2020), 102 PDB entries enclosing 18 different proteins from 16 organisms and several mutants have been reported, identifying key residues in tyrosinase activity. The structural similarity between TYRs and COs, especially within and around the active center, complicates the elucidation of their modes of action on a structural basis. However, mutagenesis studies illuminate residues which influence the two activities and prove that crystallography on its own cannot  solve  elucidate the enzymatic activity mode. Several amino acid residues around the dicopper active center have been proposed to play an essential role in the two different activities. Herein, we critically review the role of all residues identified so far that putatively affect the two activities of PPOs.</dc:description>

      <title>Quinone methide based organophosphate hydrolases inhibitors: Trans proximity labelers versus Cis labeling activity&#8208;based probes</title>
      <dc:description>Quinone methide (QM) chemistry is widely applied including in enzyme inhibitors. Typically, enzyme&#8208;mediated bond&#8208;breaking releases a phenol product that rearranges into an electrophilic QM that in turn covalently modifies protein side&#8208;chains. However, the factors that govern the reactivity of QM&#8208;based inhibitors, and their mode of inhibition, have not been systematically explored. Foremost, enzyme inactivation may occur in  cis  , whereby one of the QM molecules inactivates the very same enzyme molecule that released it, or by  trans  , if the released QMs diffuse away and inactivate other enzyme molecules. We examined QM&#8208;based inhibitors for enzymes exhibiting phosphoester hydrolase activity. We tested different phenolic substituents and benzylic leaving groups, thereby modulating the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis, phenolate&#8208;to&#8208;QM rearrangement, and the electrophilicity of the resulting QM. By developing assays that distinguish between  cis  versus trans inhibition, we have identified certain combinations of leaving groups and phenyl substituents that lead to inhibition in the  cis  mode, while other combinations led to  trans  inhibition. Our results suggest that  cis  acting QM&#8208;based substrates may be used as activity&#8208;based probes for identifying various phospho&#8208; and phosphono&#8208;ester hydrolases, and potentially other hydrolases.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural insights into the interaction of heme with protein tyrosine kinase JAK2</title>
      <dc:description>Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is the most important signal transducing tyrosine kinase in erythropoietic precursor cells. Its malfunction drives several myeloproliferative disorders. Heme is a small metal ion&#8208;carrying molecule, which is incorporated into hemoglobin in erythroid precursor cells to transport oxygen.

Abstract
Research at the biological&#8208;material interface often has translation in mind, with applications in medical implants, drug delivery, and regenerative medicine.

      <title>Charting a New Path Towards Degrading Every Protein</title>
      <dc:description>
Degrade all: Targeted protein degradation is a versatile chemical modality with exciting therapeutic potential. Herein, I discuss how open&#8208;source investigation has been instrumental in the advancement of the degradation tag (dTAG) system towards a universal approach for target discovery and investigation.







Abstract
Strategies to directly alter protein abundance such as small&#8208;molecule&#8208;induced targeted protein degradation (TPD) are innovative pharmacological modalities with promising clinical potential. Herein, I describe my experience with the development of the degradation tag (dTAG) system, which is a chemical biology strategy to induce rapid and precise degradation of any target protein. Open&#8208;source collaborative discovery has been critical for advancing the versatility and accessibility of the dTAG system and will be necessary to understand the benefits and limits of TPD&#8208;based strategies in the clinic.

      <title>A FRET&#8208;based fluorescent probe to screen anti&#8208;cancer drugs, inhibiting p73 binding to MDM2.</title>
      <dc:description>The protein p73 acts as a transcription factor, resulting in tumor suppression. MDM2, an oncogenic protein, can negatively influence p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis by binding to p73 transactivation domains (TAD). The inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interaction between p73 and oncogenic proteins is an attractive strategy for promoting p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Herein, we describe the use of a modified p73&#8208;TAD peptide for the FRET&#8208;based assay of the binding of p73&#8208;TAD to MDM2. The FRET probe equipped with 1&#8208;naphthylamine (&#955;  ex  = 330 nm, &#955;  em  = 445 nm) serves as a FRET acceptor, and the tryptophan (Trp) of the protein acts as FRET donor (Trp, &#955;  ex  = 280 nm, &#955;  em  = 340 nm). Sensitized emission of the FRET probe was observed upon excitation of the protein&#8208;FRET&#8208;probe complex at the excitation wavelength of Trp. Furthermore, addition of the MDM2 inhibitor Nutiln&#8208;3 drastically reduced the FRET signal, indicating that the FRET probe competes with Nutiln&#8208;3 for MDM2 binding. The developed FRET binding assay may be applicable in high&#8208;throughput screening of novel drugs that inhibit interactions between p73 and MDM2.</dc:description>

      <title>Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides: hyperstable scaffolds for protein engineering</title>
      <dc:description>Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides (CRPs) are small proteins of less than 100 amino acids in length characterized by the presence of disulfide bridges and common end&#8208;to&#8208;end macrocyclization.

      <title>RAPTA Decorated Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles: Exploring their Synthesis, Physical Properties and Effect on Cell Viability</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we report for the first time the successful immobilization of a known cytoactive [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(C2O4)PTA] (RAPTA) complex to a biologically inert polyacrylamide nanoparticle support. The nanoparticles have been characterised by zetasizer analysis, UV&#8208;Vis, ATR&#8208;FT&#8208;IR, TGA, and ICP&#8208;MS to qualitatively and quantitatively confirm the presence of the metallodrug on the surface of the carrier. The native RAPTA complex required a concentration of 50 &#181;M to produce a cell viability of 47.1 &#177; 2.1% when incubated with human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma cells for 72 hr. Under similar conditions a cell viability of 45.1 &#177; 1.9% was obtained with 0.5 &#181;M of RAPTA complex in its immobilized form. Therefore, conjugation of the RAPTA metallodrug to our nanoparticle carriers resulted in a significant 100&#8208;fold decrease in effective concentration of ruthenium required for a near identical biological effect on cell viability.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of new DNA Aptamers for anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 Reverse Transcriptase</title>
      <dc:description>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV&#8208;1 RT) is a necessary enzyme for retroviral replication which is the main target for antiviral therapy against AIDs. The effective anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT drugs are classified into two groups; nucleoside inhibitors (NRTI) and non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI) which inhibit the DNA polymerase function. In this study, new DNA aptamers were isolated as anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT inhibitors. The selected DNA aptamer (WT62) presented with high affinity and inhibition against wild type (WT) HIV&#8208;1 RT and gave  a K  D  value of 75.10 &#177; 0.29 nM and an IC  50  value of 84.81 &#177; 8.54 nM. Moreover, WT62 decreased the DNA polymerase function of K103N/Y181C double mutant (KY) HIV&#8208;1 RT by around 80%. Furthermore, the ITC results showed that this aptamer has slightly small binding enthalpies with both WT and KY HIV&#8208;1 RTs through which the complex may form a hydrophobic interaction or non&#8208;covalent bonding. The NMR result also suggested that the WT62 aptamer could bind with both WT and KY mutant HIV&#8208;1 RT at the connection domain.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemically Diverse Multifunctional Peptide Platforms with Antimicrobial and Cell Adhesive Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial infections and incomplete biomaterial integration represent major problems that can lead to failure of medical implants. However, simultaneously addressing these two issues remains a challenge. Here, we present a chemical peptide library based on a multifunctional platform containing the antimicrobial peptide LF1&#8208;11 and the cell adhesive motif RGD. The scaffolds were customized with catechol groups to ensure the straightforward functionalization of the implant surface, and linkers of different length to assess the effect of peptide accessibility on the biological response. The peptidic platforms significantly improved the adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells and showed antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus. Of note, the peptides bearing too long spacers displayed the lowest efficiency. Subsequently, we designed a platform replacing linear by cyclic RGD, which further enhanced eukaryotic cell adhesion while retaining excellent antimicrobial properties, thus being a suitable candidate for tissue engineering applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The aim of this study was to develop a transcription activator&#8208;like effector (TALE)&#8208;based technology to regulate protein synthesis in cell&#8208;free systems. We attempted to regulate the T7 promoter system, which has no natural mechanism of expression control, and sought to arbitrarily induce protein expression through the formation and dissociation of TALE and target DNA complexes. Protein synthesis was performed in a cell&#8208;free system in the presence of TALE, which recognized and bound to a sequence upstream of the T7 promoter, and protein expression was suppressed by approximately 80% compared to the absence of TALE. This suggests that the masking of part of the promoter region strongly suppresses protein synthesis. Additionally, competitive inhibition of TALE binding to the target DNA template led to protein synthesis levels that were equivalent to the levels in the absence of TALE. Our results demonstrate that DNA recognition by TALE can regulate the expression of the T7 promoter system.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterologous expression of an unusual ketosynthase, SxtA, leads to production of saxitoxin intermediates in Escherichia coli</title>
      <dc:description>Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are neurotoxic alkaloids produced by freshwater cyanobacteria and marine dinoflagellates. Due to their antagonism of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in excitable cells, certain analogues are of significant pharmacological interest. The biosynthesis of the parent compound, saxitoxin, is initiated with the formation of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;guanidinoheptane (ethyl ketone) by an unusual polyketide synthase&#8208;like enzyme, SxtA. Here, we heterologously expressed SxtA from  Raphidiopsis raciborskii  T3 in  E. coli  and analyzed its activity  in vivo  . Ethyl ketone and a truncated analogue, methyl ketone, were detected by HPLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;HRMS analysis, suggesting that SxtA has relaxed substrate specificity  in vivo  . The chemical structures of these products were further verified by tandem mass spectrometry and labelled&#8208;precursor feeding with [guanidino&#8208;  15  N  2  ] arginine and [1,2&#8208;  13  C  2  ] acetate. These results indicate that the reactions catalyzed by SxtA could give rise to multiple PST variants, including analogues of ecological and pharmacological significance.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are neurotoxic alkaloids produced by freshwater cyanobacteria and marine dinoflagellates. Due to their antagonism of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in excitable cells, certain analogues are of significant pharmacological interest. The biosynthesis of the parent compound, saxitoxin, is initiated with the formation of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;guanidinoheptane (ethyl ketone) by an unusual polyketide synthase&#8208;like enzyme, SxtA. Here, we heterologously expressed SxtA from  Raphidiopsis raciborskii  T3 in  E. coli  and analyzed its activity  in vivo  . Ethyl ketone and a truncated analogue, methyl ketone, were detected by HPLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;HRMS analysis, suggesting that SxtA has relaxed substrate specificity  in vivo  . The chemical structures of these products were further verified by tandem mass spectrometry and labelled&#8208;precursor feeding with [guanidino&#8208;  15  N  2  ] arginine and [1,2&#8208;  13  C  2  ] acetate. These results indicate that the reactions catalyzed by SxtA could give rise to multiple PST variants, including analogues of ecological and pharmacological significance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Why does the novel Coronavirus Spike Protein interact so strongly with the human ACE2? A thermodynamic answer.</title>
      <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic is the biggest health concern today, but until now there are no treatments. One possible drug target is the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from the Coronavirus&#8217; Spike Protein, which recognizes the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Our in silico study discusses crucial structural and thermodynamic aspects of the interactions involving RBDs from the SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with the hACE2. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations explained why the chemical affinity of the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 for hACE2 is much higher than in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV, revealing an intricate pattern of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and estimating a free energy of binding, consistently much more negative in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This work presents a chemical reason for the difficulty in treating the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus using drugs targeting its Spike Protein and helps to explain its infectiousness.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogen Sulfide Oxidation by Sulfide Quinone Oxidoreductase</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) is an environmental toxin and a heritage of ancient microbial metabolism, which has stimulated new interest following its discovery as a neuromodulator. While many physiological responses have been attributed to low H  2  S levels, higher levels inhibit complex IV in the electron transport chain. To prevent respiratory poisoning, a dedicated set of enzymes comprising the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway exists to clear H  2  S. The committed step in this pathway is catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), which couples sulfide oxidation to coenzyme Q  10  reduction in the electron transport chain. The SQOR reaction prevents H  2  S accumulation and generates highly reactive persulfide species as products, which can be further oxidized or can modify cysteine residues in proteins via persulfidation. Here, we review the kinetic and structural characteristics of human SQOR, and how its unconventional redox cofactor configuration and substrate promiscuity lead to sulfide clearance and potentially expand the signaling potential of H  2  S. This dual role of SQOR makes it a promising target for H  2  S&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmed and Sequential Disassembly of Multi&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Protein Nanoassemblies: A Detailed Mechanistic Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>We report a novel chemical method for the construction of multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoassemblies using custom&#8208;designed facially amphiphilic monodisperse protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The macromolecular synthons contain a globular hydrophilic protein domain site&#8208;specifically conjugated to photo&#8208;responsive hydrophobic benzyl&#8208;ether dendron of different generations using oligoethylene glycol linkers of defined length. The size of the protein nanoassemblies can be systematically tuned by choosing an appropriate dendron or linker of defined length. Exposure of protein nanoassemblies to light results in partial disassembly of complex rather than complete disassembly. The newly formed protein nanoparticle no longer responds to light but could be disassembled into constitutive monomers at the acidic condition or further treatment with a small molecule. More interestingly, the distribution ratio of assembled versus disassembled states of protein nanoassemblies after photochemical reaction does not depend on the dendron generation or nature of linker functionality or the identity of the protein, but heavily influenced by choice of linker length. Altogether, this work discloses a new chemical method for the rational design of a monodisperse multi&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based supramolecular system with exquisite control over the disassembly process.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange of Selective PyFALGEA Oligopeptide Ligands Towards Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>The biorelevant selective PyFALGEA oligopeptide ligand towards epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is successfully employed as substrate in magnetic resonance signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) experiments. It is demonstrated that PyFALGEA and the iridium catalyst &#8208; IMes form a PyFALGEA:IMes molecular complex. The interaction between PyFALGEA:IMes and H  2  results in a ternary SABRE complex. Selective 1D EXSY experiments reveal that this complex is labile, which is an essential condition for successful hyperpolarization via SABRE. Polarization transfer from parahydrogen to PyFALGEA is observed leading to significant enhancement of the  1  H NMR signals of PyFALGEA. Different iridium catalysts and peptides are inspected to discuss the influence of their molecular structures on the efficiency of hyperpolarization. It is observed that the PyFALGEA oligopeptide hyperpolarization is more efficient when an iridium catalyst with a sterically less demanding NHC&#8208;ligand system such as IMesBn is employed. Experiments with shorter analogues of PyFALGEA i.e. PyLGEA and PyEA, show that the bulky phenylalanine from the PyFALGEA oligopeptide causes sterical hindrance in the SABRE complex, which hampers hyperpolarization with IMes. Finally, the single&#8208;scan  1  H NMR SABRE experiment of PyFALGEA with IMesBn revealed a unique pattern of NMR lines in the hydride region, which can be treated as a fingerprint of this important oligopeptide.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzymatic modification of cellulose to unlock its exploitation in advanced materials</title>
      <dc:description>Nowadays natural biopolymers have a wide variety of uses in various industrial applications, such as food, adhesives and composite materials. Among them, cellulose has attracted the interest of researchers due to its properties: high strength and flexibility, biocompatibility and non&#8208;toxicity. Despite that, in many cases its practical use is limited because of poor solubility and/or unsuitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In this context, enzymatic modification appears as a powerful strategy to overcome these problems through selective, green and environmentally friendly processes. This mini review discusses the different methods developed for the enzymatic modification of cellulose, emphasizing the type of reaction, the enzymes used (laccases, esterases, lipases, hexokinases, etc.), the properties and the applications of cellulose derivatives obtained. Considering that cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on the Earth and can be derived from residual lignocellulosic biomass, the impact of its use in biobased process following the logic of circular economy is relevant.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Microbial catabolism of chitin, a highly abundant component of polymeric organic matter worldwide, is a fundamental cog in the carbon and nitrogen cycles that govern CO  2  emissions, nutrient dynamics in aquatic systems, and soil vitality. Despite this critical biogeochemical function, we have a poor understanding of the synergy between various microbial chitinases and key accessory enzymes involved in chitin catabolism. We designed and synthesized activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) for profiling active chitinolytic enzymes by modifying the chitin derivatives  N  &#8208;acetyl glucosamine and chitotriose. The ABPs were used to determine the active complement of chitinolytic enzymes produced over time by the soil bacterium  Cellvibrio japonicus  treated with various C substrates. This approach allowed us to demonstrate the utility of these ABPs in determining the intricate synergy between chitinases and other glycoside hydrolases that microbes employ to catabolize chitin. The strategy can be used to gain molecular level insights that can be used to better understand microbial roles in soil C and N cycling in the face of a changing climate.</dc:description>

      <title>The effects of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU stereochemistry on its stability and MAIT&#8208;MR1 axis</title>
      <dc:description>Mucosal&#8208;associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant subset of innate&#8208;like T lymphocytes. MAIT cells are activated by microbial riboflavin&#8208;derived antigens, such as 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;6&#8208;D&#8208;ribitylaminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I&#8208;related protein (MR1). Herein we have synthesized all stereoisomers of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU to investigate the effects of its stereochemistry on the MR1&#8208;dependent MAIT cell activation and MR1 upregulation. The analysis of MAIT cell activation by these 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU isomers revealed that the stereocenters at the 2&#8217;&#8208; and 3&#8217;&#8208;OH groups in the ribityl tail are crucial for the recognition of MAIT&#8208;TCR, while that of 4&#8217;&#8208;OH group does not significantly affect the regulation of MAIT cell activity. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of complex formation between the ligands and MR1 suggested that 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU forms a covalent bond to MR1 in cells within 1 hour. These findings provide guidelines for designing ligands that regulate MAIT cell functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes: From Solution Chemistry to Analytical, Materials and Therapeutic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Since 1994, deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes were in vitro selected to catalyze various types of reactions. Metal ions play a critical role in DNAzyme catalysis, and among them Zn2+ is a very important one. Zn2+ has good biocompatibility and can be used for intracellular applications. Chemically, Zn2+ is a strong Lewis acid and it can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. Zn2+ undergoes hydrolysis even at neutral pH and the partially hydrolyzed polynuclear complexes can affect the interactions with DNA. These features have made Zn2+ a unique cofactor for DNAzyme reactions. This review summarizes Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes with an emphasis on RNA/DNA&#8208;cleaving reactions. A key feature is the sharp Zn2+ concentration and pH&#8208;dependent activity for many of the DNAzymes. The applications of these DNAzymes as biosensors for Zn2+, as therapeutic agents to cleave intracellular RNA and as chemical biology tools to manipulate DNA are discussed. Future studies can focus on the selection of new DNAzymes with improved performance and detailed biochemical characterizations to understand the role of Zn2+, which can facilitate practical applications of Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Binding of SARS&#8211;CoV&#8211;2 to cell receptors: a tale of molecular evolution</title>
      <dc:description>The magnified infectious power of the SARS&#8211;CoV&#8211;2 virus compared to its precursor SARS&#8211;CoV is intimately linked to an enhanced ability in the mutated virus to find available hydrogen bond sites in the host cells. This characteristic is acquired during virus evolution because of the selective pressure exerted at the molecular level. We pinpoint the specific residue (in the virus) to residue (in the cell) contacts during the initial recognition and binding and show that the virus&#183; &#183; &#183; cell interaction is mainly due to an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and to a large surface of non&#8211;covalent interactions. In addition to the formal quantum characterization of bonding interactions, computation of absorption spectra for the specific virus&#183; &#183; &#183; cell interacting residues yields significant shifts of &#8710;&#955; max = 47 and 66 nm in the wavelength for maximum absorption in the complex with respect to the isolated host and virus, respectively.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The magnified infectious power of the SARS&#8211;CoV&#8211;2 virus compared to its precursor SARS&#8211;CoV is intimately linked to an enhanced ability in the mutated virus to find available hydrogen bond sites in the host cells. This characteristic is acquired during virus evolution because of the selective pressure exerted at the molecular level. We pinpoint the specific residue (in the virus) to residue (in the cell) contacts during the initial recognition and binding and show that the virus&#183; &#183; &#183; cell interaction is mainly due to an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and to a large surface of non&#8211;covalent interactions. In addition to the formal quantum characterization of bonding interactions, computation of absorption spectra for the specific virus&#183; &#183; &#183; cell interacting residues yields significant shifts of &#8710;&#955; max = 47 and 66 nm in the wavelength for maximum absorption in the complex with respect to the isolated host and virus, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Characterization of apo&#8208;form selective inhibition of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase.</title>
      <dc:description>Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. As an inflammation&#8208;induced immunoregulatory enzyme, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 activity is currently being pursued as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer and other disease states. As such, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of established and novel IDO1 inhibitors remains of great interest. Comparison of a newly&#8208;developed IDO1 inhibitor (GSK5628) to the existing best&#8208;in&#8208;class compound, epacadostat (Incyte), allows us to report on a unique inhibition mechanism for IDO1. Here, we demonstrate that GSK5628 inhibits IDO1 by competing with heme for binding to a heme&#8208;free conformation of the enzyme (apo&#8208;IDO1) while epacadostat coordinates its binding with the iron atom of the IDO1 heme cofactor. Comparison of these two compounds in cellular systems reveals a long&#8208;lasting inhibitory effect of GSK5628, undescribed for other known IDO1 inhibitors. Detailed characterization of this apo&#8208;binding mechanism for IDO1 inhibition may help design superior inhibitors or may confer a unique competitive advantage over other IDO1 inhibitors vis&#8208;&#225;&#8208;vis specificity and pharmacokinetic parameters.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The utilities of an &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (MeLac) moiety as a warhead composed of multiple electrophilic sites are reported. We demonstrate that a MeLac&#8208;alkyne not only reacts with diverse proteins as a broadly reactive measurement probe but also recruits endogenous reduced glutathione (GSH) to assemble a selective chemical probe of GSH&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (GSH&#8208;Lac)&#8208;alkyne in live cells. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals that MeLac reacts with nucleophilic cysteine, serine, lysine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, through either Michael addition or acyl addition. A peptide&#8208;centric proteomics platform demonstrates that the proteomic selectivity profiles of orlistat and parthenolide, which have distinct reactivities, are measurable by MeLac&#8208;alkyne as a high&#8208;coverage&#160;probe. The GSH&#8208;Lac&#8208;alkyne selectively probes the glutathione S&#8208;transferase P responsible for multidrug resistance.

      <title>Comparison of Bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;Lactone Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Selective Labeling of Penicillin&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Penicillin&#8208;binding proteins (PBPs) are a family of bacterial enzymes that are key components of cell wall biosynthesis and the target of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. Most microbial pathogens contain multiple structurally homologous PBP isoforms, making it difficult to target individual PBPs. To study the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a panel of bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;lactone probes was synthesized and compared. Fluorescent labeling confirmed selectivity, and PBPs were selectively enriched from  Streptococcus pneumoniae  lysates. Comparisons between fluorescent labeling of probes revealed that the accessibility of bioorthogonal reporter molecules to the bound probe in the native protein environment exerts a more significant effect on labeling intensity than the bioorthogonal reaction used, observations which are likely applicable beyond this class of probes or proteins. Selective, bioorthogonal activity&#8208;based probes for PBPs will facilitate the activity&#8208;based determination of the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a key gap in knowledge which has yet to be filled.</dc:description>

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism.

      <title>Chemical Approaches to Analyzing RNA Structure Transcriptome&#8208;Wide</title>
      <dc:description>RNA molecules can fold into complex two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are critical for their function. Chemical probes have long been utilized to interrogate RNA structure and are now considered invaluable resources in the goal of relating structure to function. Recently, the power of deep sequencing and careful chemical probe design have merged, permitting researchers to obtain a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be utilized to control RNA biology transcriptome&#8208;wide.
