      <title>A bimane&#8208;based peptide staple for combined helical induction and fluorescent imaging</title>
      <dc:description>The thiol&#8208;selective fluorescent imaging agent, dibromobimane, is repurposed to cross&#8208;link cysteine and homocysteine containing peptides, with the resulting bimane&#8208;linker acting as both a structural constraint and a fluorescent tag. Macrocyclisation was conducted on nine short peptides containing two cysteines and/or homocysteines, both on&#8208;resin and in buffered aqueous solution, to give macrocycles ranging in size from 16 ( i &#8208; i +2)&#160;to 31 ( i &#8208; i +7)&#160;atoms. The structures were defined by CD, NMR structure calculations using Xplor&#8208;NIH, NMR secondary shift and&#160;J H&#945;NH &#160;analyses, to reveal helical structure in the&#160; i &#8208; i +4 ( 1 ,&#160; 2 ), and&#160; i &#8208; i +3 ( 5 ) constrained peptides. Cellular uptake studies were conducted with three of the macrocycles. Subsequent confocal imaging revealed bright punctate fluorescence within the cytosol indicative of peptides trapped in endocytic vesicles. These studies demonstrate that dibromobimane is an effective tool to define secondary structure within short peptides, whilst simultaneously introducing a fluorescent tag suitable for common cell&#8208;based experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>PR10/Bet v 1&#8208;like proteins as novel contributors to plant biochemical diversity</title>
      <dc:description>Pathogenesis&#8208;related (PR) proteins constitute a broad class of plant proteins with analogues found throughout nature from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. PR proteins were first noted in plants as part of the hypersensitive response but have since been assigned an array of biological roles.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pathogenesis&#8208;related (PR) proteins constitute a broad class of plant proteins with analogues found throughout nature from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. PR proteins were first noted in plants as part of the hypersensitive response but have since been assigned an array of biological roles.

      <title>Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids with Extended Backbones</title>
      <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) forms a triple helix with double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) stabilized by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding zipper formed by PNA&#8217;s backbone amides (N&#8208;H) interacting with RNA phosphate oxygens. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern is enabled by the matching ~5.7 &#197; spacing (typical for A&#8208;form dsRNA) between PNA&#8217;s backbone amides and RNA phosphate oxygens. We hypothesized that extending the PNA&#8217;s backbone by one &#8208;CH2&#8208; group may bring the distance between PNA amide N&#8208;H closer to 7 &#197;, favourable for hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the B&#8208;form dsDNA phosphate oxygens. Extension of PNA backbone was expected to selectively stabilize PNA&#8208;DNA triplexes compared to PNA&#8208;RNA. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized triplex&#8208;forming PNAs that had the pseudopeptide backbones extended by an additional &#8208;CH2&#8208; group in three different positions. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of the binding affinity of these extended PNA analogues for the matched dsDNA and dsRNA showed that, contrary to our structural reasoning, extending the PNA backbone at any position had a strong negative effect on triplex stability. Our results suggest that PNA may have an inherent preference for A&#8208;form&#8208;like conformations when binding double&#8208;stranded nucleic acids. It appears that the original six atoms long PNA backbone is an almost perfect fit for binding to A&#8208;form nucleic acids.</dc:description>

UV light induces various photochemical reactions in DNA and is a known harm to our genetic material. One important reaction is the formation of charge&#8208;transfer states between stacked nucleobases. In particular, guanine (dG) plays a major role as an electron donor, whose photophysical dynamics in short oligonucleotides have been investigated in detail in this study.

      <title>Distinct mechanisms for processing autophagy protein LC3&#8208;PE by RavZ and ATG4B</title>
      <dc:description>Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process involved in the elimination of proteins, organelles and pathogens. Lipidated LC3 proteins that are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) play a key role in autophagosome biogenesis. Endogenous ATG4&#8208;mediated deconjugation of LC3&#8208;PE is required for LC3 recycling. However, the  Legionella  effector RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3&#8208;PE to inhibit autophagy. It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3&#8208;PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semi&#8208;synthetic LC3&#8208;PE proteins containing C&#8208;terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C&#8208;terminal structure of LC3&#8208;PE with ATG4/RavZ&#8208;mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln  116  , Phe  119  and Gly  120  of LC3&#8208;PE are required for the cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, while Glu  117  (LC3) is specific for the cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B but not in RavZ. Met  63  and Gln  64  at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif (116&#8208;120) with ATG4 and RavZ may determine the specificity of cleavage site.</dc:description>

It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3&#8208;PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semi&#8208;synthetic LC3&#8208;PE proteins containing C&#8208;terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C&#8208;terminal structure of LC3&#8208;PE with ATG4/RavZ&#8208;mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln  116  , Phe  119  and Gly  120  of LC3&#8208;PE are required for the cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, while Glu  117  (LC3) is specific for the cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B but not in RavZ. Met  63  and Gln  64  at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif (116&#8208;120) with ATG4 and RavZ may determine the specificity of cleavage site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Everninomicins are orthoester oligosaccharide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. Everninomicins act via disruption of ribosomal assembly in a distinct region in comparison to clinically prescribed drugs.

      <title>A Hydroxyquinoline&#8208;Based Unnatural Amino Acid for the Design of Novel Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Expanding biotransformations: Several metal&#8208;binding noncanonical amino acids have been incorporated into protein scaffolds to create artificial metalloenzymes. We introduced 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)propanoic acid (HQAla) into lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) and complexed it with several transition metal ions such as CuII, ZnII and RhIII to showcase its catalytic potential in a variety of different reactions.







Abstract
We have examined the potential of the noncanonical amino acid (8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)alanine (HQAla) for the design of artificial metalloenzymes. HQAla, a versatile chelator of late transition metals, was introduced into the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) by stop codon suppression methodology. LmrR_HQAla was shown to complex efficiently with three different metal ions, CuII, ZnII and RhIII to form unique artificial metalloenzymes. The catalytic potential of the CuII&#8208;bound LmrR_HQAla enzyme was shown through its ability to catalyse asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Craft alkylation and water addition, whereas the ZnII&#8208;coupled enzyme was shown to mimic natural Zn hydrolase activity.

      <title>Probing the Compatibility of an Enzyme&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay toward the Reprogramming of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Adenylation Domains</title>
      <dc:description>
A reprogramming platform: An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of aryl acid adenylation (A) domains. Combined with a directed&#8208;evolution approach, the ELISA technology can be used to isolate aryl acid A&#8208;domains with the desired activity.







Abstract
An important challenge in natural product biosynthesis is the biosynthetic design and production of artificial peptides. One of the most promising strategies is reprogramming adenylation (A) domains to expand the substrate repertoire of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, the precise detection of subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of A domains might accelerate their reprogramming. Here we show that an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect the effects of substrate binding pocket residue substitutions in A&#8208;domains. When coupled with a set of aryl acid A&#8208;domain variants (total of nine variants), the ELISA can analyze the subtle differences in their active&#8208;site architectures. Furthermore, the ELISA&#8208;based screening was able to identify the variants with substrate binding pockets that accepted a non&#8208;cognate substrate from an original pool of 45. These studies demonstrate that ELISA is a reliable platform for providing insights into the active&#8208;site properties of A&#8208;domains and can be applied for the reprogramming of NRPS A&#8208;domains.

      <title>Trimethylation of the R5 Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptide Increases Silica Particle Size by Redirecting Orthosilicate Binding</title>
      <dc:description>
Unexpected direction: The silaffin R5 peptide precipitates silica from solutions of orthosilicic acid. Post&#8208;translational modifications in R5 modulate silica morphology. We studied the effect of lysine trimethylation, which installs a positive charge, on silica particle formation. Surprisingly, trimethylation led to larger particle sizes by reducing the maximum activity of R5 and redirecting orthosilicate binding to the R5N terminus.







Abstract
The unmodified R5 peptide from silaffin in the diatom Cylindrotheca fusiformis rapidly precipitates silica particles from neutral aqueous solutions of orthosilicic acid. A range of post&#8208;translational modifications found in R5 contribute toward tailoring silica morphologies in a species&#8208;specific manner. We investigated the specific effect of R5 lysine side&#8208;chain trimethylation, which adds permanent positive charges, on silica particle formation. Our studies revealed that a doubly trimethylated R5K3,4me3 peptide has reduced maximum activity yet, surprisingly, generates larger silica particles. Molecular dynamics simulations of R5K3,4me3 binding by the precursor orthosilicate anion revealed that orthosilicate preferentially associates with unmodified lysine side&#8208;chain amines and the peptide N terminus. Thus, larger silica particles arise from reduced orthosilicate association with trimethylated lysine side chains and their redirection to the N terminus of the R5 peptide.

      <title>Effect of metal shielding on the enzymatic construction of artificial base pairs</title>
      <dc:description>Formation of metal base pairs is a versatile method for the introduction of metal cations into nucleic acids that has been applied in numerous applications including the construction of metal nanowires, development of energy, charge transfer devices and expansion of the genetic alphabet. As an alternative, enzymatic construction of metal base pairs represents an alluring strategy that grants access to longer sequences and offers the possibility of using such unnatural base pairs (UBPs) in SELEX experiments for the identification of functional nucleic acids. This method remains rather underexplored and a better understanding of the key parameters in the design of efficient nucleotides is required. Herein, we have investigated the effect of methylation of the imidazole nucleoside (dImnMe&#160;  TP) on the efficiency of the enzymatic construction of metal base pairs. The presence of methyl substituents on&#160;dImTP&#160;facilitates the polymerase&#8208;driven formation of  dIm4Me  &#8208;Ag  I  &#8208;dIm  and  dIm2Me  TP&#8208;  Cr  III  &#8208;  dIm  base pairs. Steric factors rather than basicity of the imidazole nucleobase appear to govern the enzymatic formation of such metal base pairs. We also demonstrate the compatibility of other metal cations rarely considered in the construction of artificial metal base pairs with enzymatic DNA synthesis under both primer extension reaction and PCR conditions. These findings open up new directions for the design of nucleotide analogs for the development of metal base pairs.</dc:description>

We also demonstrate the compatibility of other metal cations rarely considered in the construction of artificial metal base pairs with enzymatic DNA synthesis under both primer extension reaction and PCR conditions. These findings open up new directions for the design of nucleotide analogs for the development of metal base pairs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>HaloTag&#8208;targeted Sirtuin rearranging ligand (SirReal) for the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) against the lysine deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2)</title>
      <dc:description>We have discovered the sirtuin rearranging ligands (SirReals) as a novel class of highly potent and selective inhibitors of the NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacetylase sirtuin 2 (Sirt2). In previous studies, conjugation of a SirReal with a ligand for the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon to form a so&#8208;called proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), enabled small molecule&#8208;induced degradation of Sirt2. Here, we report the structure&#8208;based development of a chloroalkylated SirReal that induces the degradation of Sirt2 mediated by Halo&#8208;tagged E3 ubiquitin ligases. Using this orthogonal approach for Sirt2 degradation, we show that also other E3 ligases than cereblon, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, can be harnessed for small molecule&#8208;induced Sirt2 degradation, thereby emphasizing the great potential of parkin to be utilized as an E3 ligase for new PROTACs approaches. Thus, our study provides new insights into targeted protein degradation in general and Sirt2 degradation in particular.</dc:description>

      <title>Responsive Fluorophore Aggregation Provides Spectral Contrast for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorophores are greatly influenced by their environment. In their full paper, L. Cui et&#8197;al. show that triggering the aggregation of a self&#8208;condensing scaffold labeled with a fluorophore induces changes in the emission spectrum, polarization, and lifetime. The aggregates exhibited a shorter lifetime detectable in cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, thus suggesting that triggered aggregation strategies can be used in the probes for various biological events through lifetime imaging.

      <title>A Minimized Chemoenzymatic Cascade for Bacterial Luciferase in Bioreporter Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The nicotinamide biomimetic BNAH has been demonstrated to serve as an effective reductant for generating reduced flavin in the chemoenzymatic cascade reaction of bacterial luciferase. This cascade reaction is less complex, has greater ease of use, and is more cost effective. The technology developed is useful as a tool for future applications of bacterial luciferase in high&#8208;throughput detection assays for drug and natural compound screening.







Abstract
Bacterial luciferase (Lux) catalyzes a bioluminescence reaction by using long&#8208;chain aldehyde, reduced flavin and molecular oxygen as substrates. The reaction can be applied in reporter gene systems for biomolecular detection in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Because reduced flavin is unstable under aerobic conditions, another enzyme, flavin reductase, is needed to supply reduced flavin to the Lux&#8208;catalyzed reaction. To create a minimized cascade for Lux that would have greater ease of use, a chemoenzymatic reaction with a biomimetic nicotinamide (BNAH) was used in place of the flavin reductase reaction in the Lux system. The results showed that the minimized cascade reaction can be applied to monitor bioluminescence of the Lux reporter in eukaryotic cells effectively, and that it can achieve higher efficiencies than the system with flavin reductase. This development is useful for future applications as high&#8208;throughput detection tools for drug screening applications.

      <title>A Selective Fluorogenic Peptide Substrate for the Human Mitochondrial ATP&#8208;Dependent Protease Complex ClpXP</title>
      <dc:description>
Lon and ClpXP are ATP&#8208;dependent proteases that help maintain human mitochondrial integrity. The two have overlapping substrate specificity, making it difficult to distinguish their activities. In this study, a fluorogenic peptide substrate was designed and shown to be selective in monitoring ClpXP peptidase activity in isolated HeLa cell lysate.







Abstract
The goal of this work is to identify differences in the substrate determinants of two human mitochondrial matrix ATP&#8208;dependent proteases, human ClpXP (hClpXP) and human Lon (hLon). This information allows the generation of protease&#8208;specific peptide substrates that can be used as chemical biology tools to investigate the physiological functions of hClpXP. These enzymes play a role in protein quality control, but currently the physiological functions of human ClpXP are not well defined. In this study, the degradation profile of casein, an alanine positional scanning decapeptide library, and a specific peptide sequence found in an endogenous substrate of bacterial ClpXP by hClpXP as well as hLon were examined. Based on our findings, we generated a specific fluorogenic peptide substrate, FR&#8208;Cleptide, for hClpXP with a kcat of 2.44&#177;0.15&#8197;s&#8722;1 and Km=262&#177;43&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The FR&#8208;Cleptide substrate was successfully used to identify a leucine methyl ketone as a potent lead inhibitor, and to detect endogenous hClpXP activity in HeLa cell lysate. We propose that the fluorogenic peptide substrate is a valuable tool for quantitatively monitoring the activity of hClpXP in cell lysate, as well as mechanistic characterization of hClpXP. The peptide&#8208;based chemical tools developed in this study will complement the substrates developed for human Lon in aiding the investigation of the physiological functions of the respective protease.

      <title>A Proteolytic Site&#8208;Directed Affinity Label to Inhibit the Human ATP&#8208;Dependent Protease Caseinolytic Complex XP</title>
      <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;specific inhibitors of the ATP&#8208;dependent Lon and ClpXP proteases are necessary to distinguish the activity of these two similar enzymes in a protein mixture. We present here the design, synthesis, and characterization of a ClpXP&#8208;specific inhibitor that allows mitochondrial Lon to be monitored in HeLa cell lysate.







Abstract
Human caseinolytic protease component X and P (hClpXP) is a heterooligomeric ATP&#8208;dependent protease. The hClpX subunit catalyzes ATP hydrolysis whereas the hClpP subunit catalyzes peptide bond cleavage. In this study, we generated a peptidyl chloromethyl ketone (dansyl&#8208;FAPAL&#8208;CMK) that inhibited the hClpP subunit through alkylation of the catalytic His122, which was detected by LC&#8208;MS. This inhibitor is composed of a peptide sequence derived from a hydrolyzed peptide product of a substrate cleaved by hClpXP. Binding of FAPAL positions the electrophilic chloromethyl ketone moiety near His122 where alkylation occurs. Dansyl FAPAL&#8208;CMK exhibits selectivity for hClpXP over other ATP&#8208;dependent proteases such as hLon and the 26S proteasome and abolishes hClpXP activity in HeLa cell lysate. Using the fluorogenic peptide substrate FR&#8208;Cleptide as reporter, we detected biphasic inhibition time courses; this supports a slow&#8208;binding, time&#8208;dependent, covalent inhibition mechanism that is often found in active&#8208;site directed affinity labels. Because this inhibitor reacts only with hClpXP but not hLon or the proteasome, it has the potential to serve as a chemical tool to help validate endogenous protein substrates of hClpXP in cell lysate, thereby benefiting investigation of the physiological functions of hClpXP in different cell types or tissue samples.

      <title>DPP&#8208;4 Cleaves &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Peptide Bonds: Substrate Specificity and Half&#8208;Lives</title>
      <dc:description>
With proline at the side: There is increasing interest in using &#945;/&#946;&#8208;peptides as active substances in&#8197;vivo, hence the investigation of their degradation patterns against enzymes with broad substrate specificity would shed light on potential metabolic routes. An important human enzyme, DPP&#8208;4 cleaves proline&#8208;containing &#945;/&#946;&#8208;peptides with cleavage rates strongly depending on the side&#8208;chain chemistry at the cleavage site.







Abstract

      <title>In Vitro Selection of New DNA Aptamers for Human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 165</title>
      <dc:description>
Through concentration&#8208;varying selection and bioinformatic analyses, we have identified four classes of DNA aptamers. One of the two new classes is unique in that it can form a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the homodimeric protein VEGF&#8208;165. This work has thus expanded the repertoire of anti&#8208;VEGF&#8208;165 DNA aptamers and created the possibility to engineer a higher&#8208;affinity homodimeric aptamer for VEGF&#8208;165.







Abstract
Two DNA aptamers that bind the heparin&#8208;binding domain (HBD) of the human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF&#8208;165) have been previously reported. Although VEGF&#8208;165 is a homodimeric protein and the two aptamers have different sequences and secondary structures, the aptamers appear to occupy the same binding site and cannot form a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 aptamer/protein complex, thus making them unsuitable for creating a higher&#8208;affinity dimeric DNA aptamer. This has motivated us to conduct a new in&#8197;vitro selection experiment to search for new VEGF&#8208;165&#8208;binding DNA aptamers with different properties. We undertook a multistream selection strategy in which the concentration of VEGF&#8208;165 was varied significantly. We carried out 11&#8197;rounds of selection, and next&#8208;generation sequencing was conducted for every round in each stream. From comprehensive sequence analysis, we identified four classes of DNA aptamers, of which two were reported before, but two are new DNA aptamers. One of the new aptamers exhibits a unique property that has never been observed before: it is capable of forming the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 aptamer/protein complex with VEGF&#8208;165. This work has expanded the repertoire of VEGF&#8208;165&#8208;binding DNA aptamers and creates a possibility to engineer a higher affinity homodimeric aptamer for VEGF&#8208;165.

      <title>Understanding Substrate Selectivity of Phoslactomycin Polyketide Synthase by Using Reconstituted in Vitro Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Going to any length: Polyketide synthases produce compounds of high structural and functional diversity. We have created phoslactomycin polyketide synthase&#8208;derived in&#8197;vitro systems and studied their substrate selectivity. We were able to produce various phoslactomycin derivatives with altered side&#8208;chain lengths and characterized the transacylation and hydrolysis activity of the involved acyltransferases for all substrates tested.







Abstract
Polyketide synthases (PKSs) use simple extender units to synthesize complex natural products. A fundamental question is how different extender units are site&#8208;specifically incorporated into the growing polyketide. Here we established phoslactomycin (Pn) PKS, which incorporates malonyl&#8208; and ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, as an in&#8197;vitro model to study substrate specificity. We combined up to six Pn PKS modules with different termination sites for the controlled release of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexaketides, and challenged these systems with up to seven different extender units in competitive assays to test for the specificity of Pn modules. While malonyl&#8208;CoA modules of Pn PKS exclusively accept their natural substrate, the ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA module PnC tolerates different &#945;&#8208;substituted derivatives, but discriminates against malonyl&#8208;CoA. We show that the ratio of extender transacylation to hydrolysis controls incorporation in PnC, thus explaining site&#8208;specific selectivity and promiscuity in the natural context of Pn PKS.

      <title>Evaluating Terminator Strength Based on Differentiating Effects on Transcription and Translation</title>
      <dc:description>
Transcription terminators not only regulate gene transcription but also affect mRNA stability. We characterized terminators in terms of degree of transcription shut&#8208;down and capacity for upstream mRNA protection by using different terminator probe plasmids to determine the contribution of both characteristics to the overall termination effect, and to investigate the sequence characteristics associated with transcription shut&#8208;down degree.







Abstract
Transcription terminators play a role in terminating the progress of gene transcription, and are thus essential elements in the gene circuit. Terminators have two main functions: terminating gene transcription and improving the stability of gene transcripts during translation. We therefore considered the detailed characteristics of terminators in relation to their different roles in gene transcription and translation, including transcription shut&#8208;down degree (&#945;) and upstream mRNA protection capacity (&#946;), and apparent termination efficiency (&#951;) reflecting the overall regulatory effect of the terminator. Based on a dual&#8208;reporter gene system, we constructed three terminator&#8208;probe plasmids to investigate each characteristic in Escherichia coli. According to multiple regression analysis, the transcription shut&#8208;down degree and the upstream mRNA protection capacity contributed almost equally to the apparent termination efficiency. Sequence analysis of 12 terminators demonstrated that the terminator sequence was dominated by GC bases, and that a high ratio of GC bases in the stem structure of terminators might be associated with a high degree of transcription shut&#8208;down. This comprehensive characterization of terminators furthers our understanding of the role of terminators in gene expression and provides a guide for synthetic terminator design.

      <title>2&#8242;/3&#8242; Regioselectivity of Enzyme&#8208;Free Copying of RNA Detected by NMR</title>
      <dc:description>
Prebiotic chemistry: Extension of an RNA primer can produce 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; and 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiesters. In situ monitoring by NMR spectroscopy provides an unbiased view of the regioselectivity of this reaction and demonstrates how strongly template and leaving group favor the natural isomer.







Abstract
The RNA&#8208;templated extension of oligoribonucleotides by nucleotides produces either a 3&#8242;,5&#8242; or a 2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;phosphodiester. Nature controls the regioselectivity during RNA chain growth with polymerases, but enzyme&#8208;free versions of genetic copying have modest specificity. Thus far, enzymatic degradation of products, combined with chromatography or electrophoresis, has been the preferred mode of detecting 2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;diesters produced in enzyme&#8208;free reactions. This approach hinges on the substrate specificity of nucleases, and is not suitable for in&#8197;situ monitoring. Here we report how 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy can be used to detect the extension of self&#8208;templating RNA hairpins and that this reveals the regioisomeric nature of the newly formed phosphodiesters. We studied several modes of activating nucleotides, including imidazolides, a pyridinium phosphate, an active ester, and in&#8197;situ activation with carbodiimide and organocatalyst. Conversion into the desired extension product ranged from 20 to 90&#8201;%, depending on the leaving group. Integration of the resonances of H1&#8242; protons of riboses and H5 protons of pyrimidines gave regioselectivities ranging from 40:60 to 85:15 (3&#8242;,5&#8242; to 2&#8242;,5&#8242; diester), but no simple correlation between 3&#8242;,5&#8242; selectivity and yield. Our results show how monitoring with a high&#8208;resolution technique sheds a new light on a process that may have played an important role during the emergence of life.

Thus far, enzymatic degradation of products, combined with chromatography or electrophoresis, has been the preferred mode of detecting 2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;diesters produced in enzyme&#8208;free reactions. This approach hinges on the substrate specificity of nucleases, and is not suitable for in&#8197;situ monitoring. Here we report how &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy can be used to detect the extension of self&#8208;templating RNA hairpins and that this reveals the regioisomeric nature of the newly formed phosphodiesters. We studied several modes of activating nucleotides, including imidazolides, a pyridinium phosphate, an active ester, and in&#8197;situ activation with carbodiimide and organocatalyst. Conversion into the desired extension product ranged from 20 to 90&#8201;%, depending on the leaving group. Integration of the resonances of H1&#8242; protons of riboses and H5 protons of pyrimidines gave regioselectivities ranging from 40:60 to 85:15 (3&#8242;,5&#8242; to 2&#8242;,5&#8242; diester), but no simple correlation between 3&#8242;,5&#8242; selectivity and yield. Our results show how monitoring with a high&#8208;resolution technique sheds a new light on a process that may have played an important role during the emergence of life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Substrate Recognition and Catalytic Mechanism of the Phosphate Acyltransferase PlsX from Bacillus subtilis</title>
      <dc:description>
Doing different: The peripheral phosphate acyltransferase PlsX is shown to have an active&#8208;site architecture different from that of phosphotransacetylases and to catalyse a similar acyl transfer reaction through a different mechanism. The catalysis probably involves substrate activation and transition&#8208;state stabilization by two conserved residues, a lysine and an asparagine.







Abstract
Phosphate: acyl&#8208;acyl carrier protein (ACP) acyltransferase PlsX is a peripheral enzyme catalysing acyl transfer to orthophosphate in phospholipid synthesis. Little is known about how it recognises substrates and catalyses the acyl transfer. Here we show that its active site includes many residues lining a long, narrow gorge at the dimeric interface, two positive residues forming a positive ACP docking pad next to the interfacial gorge, and a number of strictly conserved residues significantly contributing to the catalytic activity. These findings suggest a substrate recognition mode and a catalytic mechanism that are different from those of phosphotransacetylases catalysing a similar acyl transfer reaction. The catalytic mechanism involves substrate activation and transition&#8208;state stabilization by two strictly conserved residues, Lys184 and Asn229. Another noticeable feature of the catalysis is the release of the acyl phosphate product near the membrane, which might facilitate its membrane insertion.

      <title>Functional Characterisation of ClpP Mutations Conferring Resistance to Acyldepsipeptide Antibiotics in Firmicutes</title>
      <dc:description>
ClpP mutant analysis: ADEP antibiotics select ClpP out&#8208;of&#8208;function mutations in Firmicutes in vitro. Studying these ClpP defects provides a map of amino acids relevant for the function of ClpP. Several mutated ClpP proteins were purified, and their diverse impairments were characterised. A new S. aureus ClpP:ADEP co&#8208;crystal structure shows an electrostatic network stabilising the N&#8208;terminal gate.







Abstract
Acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) is an exploratory antibiotic with a novel mechanism of action. ClpP, the proteolytic core of the caseinolytic protease, is deregulated towards unrestrained proteolysis. Here, we report on the mechanism of ADEP resistance in Firmicutes. This bacterial phylum contains important pathogens that are relevant for potential ADEP therapy. For Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, enterococci and streptococci, spontaneous ADEP&#8208;resistant mutants were selected in vitro at a rate of 10&#8722;6. All isolates carried mutations in clpP. All mutated S. aureus ClpP proteins characterised in this study were functionally impaired; this increased our understanding of the mode of operation of ClpP. For molecular insights, crystal structures of S. aureus ClpP bound to ADEP4 were determined. Well&#8208;resolved N&#8208;terminal domains in the apo structure allow the pore&#8208;gating mechanism to be followed. The compilation of mutations presented here indicates residues relevant for ClpP function and suggests that ADEP resistance will occur at a lower rate during the infection process.

      <title>Iron Acquisition by Bacterial Pathogens: Beyond Tris&#8208;Catecholate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Bacterial pathogens employ myriad strategies to acquire the essential nutrient iron, best exemplified by FeIII&#8208;siderophore complexes. Here we highlight newly emerging features of bacterial Fe acquisition beyond classical FeIII&#8208;siderophores, including the use of coordinatively unsaturated FeIII&#8208;catechol complexes and FeII uptake. We also discuss the bacterial adaptive response to host efforts to restrict Fe availability.







Abstract
Sequestration of the essential nutrient iron from bacterial invaders that colonize the vertebrate host is a central feature of nutritional immunity and the &#8220;fight over transition metals&#8221; at the host&#8208;pathogen interface. The iron quota for many bacterial pathogens is large, as iron enzymes often make up a significant share of the metalloproteome. Iron enzymes play critical roles in respiration, energy metabolism, and other cellular processes by catalyzing a wide range of oxidation&#8208;reduction, electron transfer, and oxygen activation reactions. In this Concept article, we discuss recent insights into the diverse ways that bacterial pathogens acquire this essential nutrient, beyond the well&#8208;characterized tris&#8208;catecholate FeIII complexes, in competition and cooperation with significant host efforts to cripple these processes. We also discuss pathogen strategies to adapt their metabolism to less&#8208;than&#8208;optimal iron concentrations, and briefly speculate on what might be an integrated adaptive response to the concurrent limitation of both iron and zinc in the infected host.

      <title>Learning about Enzyme Stability against Organic Cosolvents from Structural Insights by Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>
In enzyme catalysis, there often comes the time when you ask yourself if the amount of organic solvent is affecting your enzyme. When this happened to us, we were able to use ion mobility spectrometry and mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) to get a closer insight when our enzyme starts to unfold and loose activity. More information can be found in the communication by J. Spro&#223;, Y. Yamashita and H. Gr&#246;ger. (The protein structure is a part of the structure PDB ID: 6MYW.)

      <title>Visualizing and Manipulating Biological Processes by Using HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;Tag Technologies</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;service: We review recent developments in chemical probes for self&#8208;labeling protein tags, focusing on the HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag systems. Content includes the recently developed small&#8208;molecule probes for fluorescence microscopy and several methodologies that perturb or manipulate biological processes in live cells. Future developments in self&#8208;labeling protein tags should enable methods to address previously inaccessible biological questions.







Abstract
Visualizing and manipulating the behavior of proteins is crucial to understanding the physiology of the cell. Methods of biorthogonal protein labeling are important tools to attain this goal. In this review, we discuss advances in probe technology specific for self&#8208;labeling protein tags, focusing mainly on the application of HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag systems. We describe the latest developments in small&#8208;molecule probes that enable fluorogenic (no wash) imaging and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. In addition, we cover several methodologies that enable the perturbation or manipulation of protein behavior and function towards the control of biological pathways. Thus, current technical advances in the HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag systems means that they are becoming powerful tools to enable the visualization and manipulation of biological processes, providing invaluable scientific insights that are difficult to obtain by traditional methodologies. As the multiplex of self&#8208;labeling protein tag systems continues to be developed and expanded, the utility of these protein tags will allow researchers to address previously inaccessible questions at the forefront of biology.

      <title>Breaking a Couple: Disulfide Reducing Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Breaking bridges: The efficient reduction of disulfide bridges between two cysteine residues or a cysteine and a protecting group is a requirement for many applications of cysteine&#8208;containing molecules in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry.







Abstract
Cysteine is present in a large number of natural and synthetic (bio)molecules. Although the thiol side chain of Cys can be in a free form, in most cases it forms a disulfide bond either with a second Cys (bridge) or with another thiol, as in the case of protecting groups. Efficient reduction of these disulfide bridges is a requirement for many applications of Cys&#8208;containing molecules in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. Here we review reducing methods for disulfide bonds, taking into consideration the solubility of the substrates when selecting the appropriate reducing reagent.

      <title>Engineering d&#8208;Lactate Dehydrogenase to Favor an Non&#8208;natural Cofactor Nicotinamide Cytosine Dinucleotide</title>
      <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal metabolism? Synthetic NAD analogue NCD has already been used to create bioorthogonal redox systems. We have engineered L. helveticus&#8208;derived NAD&#8208;dependent d&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LhDLDH) to favor NCD by semirational design. Libraries were constructed from LhDLDH&#8208;V152R led to mutants with up to 940&#8208;fold increased preference for NCD.







Abstract
Synthetic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) analogues are of great scientific and biotechnological interest. One such analogue, nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD), has been successfully applied to creating bioorthogonal redox systems. Yet, only a few redox enzymes have been devised to favor NCD. We have engineered Lactobacillus helveticus&#8208;derived NAD&#8208;dependent d&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LhDLDH) to favor NCD by semirational design. Sequence alignment and structural analysis revealed that amino acid residues I177 and N213 form a &#8220;gate&#8221; guarding the NAD adenine moiety binding cavity. Saturated mutagenesis libraries were constructed by using the mutant LhDLDH&#8208;V152R as the parental sequence. Mutants were obtained with good catalytic efficiency, and NCD preference increased by up to 940&#8208;fold. Experiments showed that Escherichia coli cells expressing mutants with higher NCD preference afforded much less d&#8208;lactate, thus suggesting the potential to construct NCD&#8208;mediated orthogonal metabolism.

      <title>Learning about Enzyme Stability against Organic Cosolvents from Structural Insights by Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>
Aqueous origami: Structural information about the folding of a protein, depending on the amount of acetonitrile as organic cosolvent in the aqueous medium, is obtained through ion mobility mass spectrometry for an ene reductase from G.&#8197;oxydans. These results are in agreement with findings from spectrophotometric enzyme activity tests under analogous conditions.







Abstract
Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) enables the investigation of protein folding in solution. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for obtaining structural information about the folding of a protein in dependency of the amount of an organic cosolvent in the aqueous medium by means of this IMS&#8208;MS method is presented. By analyzing the protein with native nano&#8208;electrospray ionization IMS&#8208;MS, the impact of acetonitrile as a representative organic cosolvent and/or pH values on the folding of an enzyme was successfully evaluated in a fast and straightforward fashion, as exemplified for an ene reductase from Gluconobacter oxydans. The IMS&#8208;MS results are in agreement with findings from the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)&#8208;based spectrophotometric enzyme activity tests under analogous conditions, and thus, also rationalizing these &#8220;wet&#8221; analytical data. For this ene reductase, a higher tolerance against CH3CN in the presence of a buffer was observed by both analytical methods. The results suggest that this IMS&#8208;MS methodology could be a useful complementary tool to existing methods in process optimization and fine&#8208;tuning of solvent conditions for biotransformations.

      <title>Expanding the Diversity of Plant Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids Employing Human Cytochrome P450 3A4</title>
      <dc:description>
Alternative oxidation: We used CYP3A4 for the targeted diversification of plant monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. In vitro and in planta studies proved that the cytochrome mainly converted vinorine into vinorine (19R,20R)&#8208;epoxide, a new metabolite containing a rare for indole alkaloid epoxide group. A minor route led to the formation of the natural constituent vomilenine.







Abstract
Human drug&#8208;metabolizing cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) have enormous substrate promiscuity; this makes them promising tools for the expansion of natural product diversity. Here, we used CYP3A4 for the targeted diversification of a plant biosynthetic route leading to monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. In silico, in vitro and in planta studies proved that CYP3A4 was able to convert the indole alkaloid vinorine into vomilenine, the former being one of the central intermediates in the ajmaline pathway in the medicinal plant Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz. However, to a much larger extent, the investigated conversion yielded vinorine (19R,20R)&#8208;epoxide, a new metabolite with an epoxide functional group that is rare for indole alkaloids. The described work represents a successful example of combinatorial biosynthesis towards an increase in biodiversity of natural metabolites. Moreover, characterisation of the products of the in vitro and in planta transformation of potential pharmaceuticals with human CYPs might be indicative of the route of their conversion in the human organism.

&lt;p&gt;Human drug&#8208;metabolizing cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) have enormous substrate promiscuity; this makes them promising tools for the expansion of natural product diversity. Here, we used CYP3A4 for the targeted diversification of a plant biosynthetic route leading to monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. In silico, in vitro and in planta studies proved that CYP3A4 was able to convert the indole alkaloid vinorine into vomilenine, the former being one of the central intermediates in the ajmaline pathway in the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Rauvolfia serpentina &lt;/i&gt; (L.) Benth. ex Kurz. However, to a much larger extent, the investigated conversion yielded vinorine (19&lt;i&gt;R &lt;/i&gt;,20R)&#8208;epoxide, a new metabolite with an epoxide functional group that is rare for indole alkaloids. The described work represents a successful example of combinatorial biosynthesis towards an increase in biodiversity of natural metabolites. Moreover, characterisation of the products of the in vitro and in planta transformation of potential pharmaceuticals with human CYPs might be indicative of the route of their conversion in the human organism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#946;&#8208;Diketonate versus &#946;&#8208;Ketoiminate: The Importance of a Ferrocenyl Moiety in Improving the Anticancer Potency</title>
      <dc:description>
The cell seekers: We report the synthesis of new &#946;&#8208;diketonate and &#946;&#8208;ketoiminate ligands that have been functionalized with a ferrocenyl moiety. The ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate compounds have high IC50 values and are more selectivity towards cancerous cells, in particular human breast carcinomas. Some compounds are up to 9 times more cytotoxic and selective when compared to carboplatin.







Abstract
Herein we present a library of fully characterized &#946;&#8208;diketonate and &#946;&#8208;ketoiminate compounds that are functionalized with a ferrocenyl moiety. Their cytotoxic potential has been determined by screening against human breast adenocarcinomas (MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), human colorectal carcinoma p53 wild type (HCT116 p53+/+) and normal human prostate (PNT2) cell lines. The ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate compounds are more than 18 times more cytotoxic than the ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;ketoiminate analogues. Against MCF&#8208;7, compounds functionalized at the meta position are up to nine times more cytotoxic than when functionalized at the para position. The ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate compounds have increased selectivity towards MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, with several complexes having selectivity index (SI) values that are more than nine times (MCF&#8208;7) and more than six times (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) that of carboplatin. The stability of these compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF) has been assessed by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry studies, and the compounds show no oxidation of the iron center from FeII to FeIII. Cytotoxicity screening was performed in both DMSO and DMF, with no significant differences observedin their potency.

C&#8722;H Amination via Nitrene Transfer Catalyzed by Mononuclear Non&#8208;Heme Iron&#8208;Dependent Enzymes







Abstract
Expanding the reaction scope of natural metalloenzymes can provide new opportunities for biocatalysis. Mononuclear non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzymes represent a large class of biological catalysts involved in the biosynthesis of natural products and catabolism of xenobiotics, among other processes. Here, we report that several members of this enzyme family, including Rieske dioxygenases as well as &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases and halogenases, are able to catalyze the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of a sulfonyl azide substrate, thereby exhibiting a promiscuous nitrene transfer reactivity. One of these enzymes, naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO), was further engineered resulting in several active site variants that function as C&#8722;H aminases. Furthermore, this enzyme could be applied to execute this non&#8208;native transformation on a gram scale in a bioreactor, thus demonstrating its potential for synthetic applications. These studies highlight the functional versatility of non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzymes and pave the way to their further investigation and development as promising biocatalysts for non&#8208;native metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations.

      <title>Self&#8208;Emergent Protocells Generated in an Aqueous Solution with Binary Macromolecules through Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, regarding plausible mechanisms for the generation of microstructures inside cells, liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has attracted considerable attention among researchers in the life sciences. LLPS occurs through multiple nonspecific interactions and does not always require a key&#8208;lock interaction with a binary macromolecular solution. The remarkable features of LLPS include the non&#8208;uniform localization and concentration of solutes, resulting in the ability to isolate certain chemical systems and thereby parallelize multiple chemical reactions within the limited space of a living cell. We report that in the presence of phospholipids, cell&#8208;sized liposomes are spontaneously formed in an aqueous solution, which exhibit the properties of LLPS, by using the macromolecules polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran. In this system, LLPS is generated through the depletion effect of macromolecules. The results showed that cell&#8208;like micro&#8208;droplets entrapping DNA wrapped by a phospholipid layer emerge in a self&#8208;organized manner.</dc:description>

      <title>Bioimaging and Biodistribution of the Metal Ion Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of PYY3&#8208;36 Studied by SPECT/CT</title>
      <dc:description>Controlled self&#8208;assembly of peptide&#8208; and protein&#8208;based pharmaceuticals is of central importance for their mode of action and tuning of their properties. Peptide YY  3&#8208;36  (PYY  3&#8208;36  ) is a 36 amino acid peptide hormone that reduces food intake when peripherally administered. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a PYY  3&#8208;36  analogue functionalized with a metal ion binding 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine ligand which enables self&#8208;assembly through metal complexation. Upon addition of Cu(II), the bipyridine&#8208;modified PYY  3&#8208;36  peptide binds stoichiometric quantities of metal ions in solution and contributes to the organization of higher&#8208;order assemblies. In the current study, we aimed to explore the size effect of the self&#8208;assembly  in vivo  using non&#8208;invasive quantitative Single&#8208;Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging. For this purpose, bipyridine&#8208;modified PYY  3&#8208;36  was radiolabeled with a chelator holding  111  In(III), followed by the addition of Cu(II) to the bipyridine ligand. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies showed fast renal clearance and accumulation in the kidney cortex. The radiolabeled bipyridyl&#8208;PYY  3&#8208;36  conjugates with and without Cu(II) presented a slightly slower excretion 1 h post injection compared to the unmodified&#8208;PYY  3&#8208;36  demonstrating that higher self&#8208;assemblies of the peptide may have an effect on the pharmacokinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the Interaction between HIV&#8208;1 Protease and the Homodimeric p66/p66&#8217; Reverse Transcriptase Precursor by Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance EPR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Opening up p66: Q&#8208;band pulsed double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy shows that binding of HIV&#8208;1 protease to the asymmetric p66/p66&#8242; homodimer precursor of HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase favours an open conformation of the p66&#8242; subunit allowing the linker connecting the RNaseH and connection domains to bind to the active site of protease in an extended conformation.







Abstract
Following excision from the Gag&#8208;Pol polyprotein, HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase is released as an asymmetric homodimer comprising two p66 subunits that are structurally dissimilar but identical in amino acid sequence. Subsequent cleavage of the RNase H domain from only one of the subunits, denoted p66&#8242;, results in the formation of the mature p66/p51 enzyme in which catalytic activity resides in the p66 subunit, and the p51 subunit (derived from p66&#8242;) provides a supporting structural scaffold. Here, we probe the interaction of the p66/p66&#8242; asymmetric reverse transcriptase precursor with HIV&#8208;1 protease by pulsed Q&#8208;band double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy to measure distances between nitroxide labels introduced at surface&#8208;engineered cysteine residues. The data suggest that the flexible, exposed linker between the RNaseH and connection domains in the open state of the p66&#8242; subunit binds to the active site of protease in a configuration that is similar to that of extended peptide substrates.

The data suggest that the flexible, exposed linker between the RNaseH and connection domains in the open state of the p66&#8242; subunit binds to the active site of protease in a configuration that is similar to that of extended peptide substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Convergent Evolution of Fungal Cysteine Dioxygenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Synchronicity: Numerous agaricomycetes contain an unusual cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) that emerged by gene duplication and adaptation from an ergothioneine biosynthetic sulfoxide synthase. It is unrelated to the thiol dioxygenases that occur in animals, plants, and bacteria. The activity of type II CDOs depends on the presence of TMH, thus synchronizing cellular cysteine oxidation with ergothioneine production. OK!







Abstract
Cupin&#8208;type cysteine dioxygenases (CDOs) are non&#8208;heme iron enzymes that occur in animals, plants, bacteria and in filamentous fungi. In this report, we show that agaricomycetes contain an entirely unrelated type of CDO that emerged by convergent evolution from enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine. The activity of this CDO type is dependent on the ergothioneine precursor N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine. The metabolic link between ergothioneine production and cysteine oxidation suggests that the two processes might be part of the same chemical response in fungi, for example against oxidative stress.

      <title>Analysis of Modified Nucleotide Aptamer Library Generated by Thermophilic DNA Polymerases</title>
      <dc:description>
To select aptamers with modified nucleotides, the appropriate DNA polymerase must be designated. We studied eight polymerases and demonstrated that incorporating a tryptophan&#8208;like nucleotide into aptamer libraries by emulsion PCR and KOD XL had an insignificant effect on the PCR bias and did not distort the sequence space, thus making this approach the method of choice.







Abstract
One of the pivotal steps in aptamer selection is the amplification of target&#8208;specific oligonucleotides by thermophilic DNA polymerases; it can be a challenging task if nucleic acids possessing modified nucleotides are to be amplified. Hence, the identification of compatible DNA polymerase and modified nucleotide pairs is necessary for effective selection of aptamers with unnatural nucleotides. We present an in&#8208;depth study of using 5&#8208;indolyl&#8208;AA&#8208;dUTP (TAdUTP) to generate oligonucleotide libraries for aptamer selection. We found that, among the eight studied DNA polymerases, only Vent(exo&#8208;) and KOD XL are capable of adapting TAdUTP, and that replacing dTTP did not have a significant effect on the productivity of KOD XL. We demonstrated that water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion PCR is suitable for the generation of aptamer libraries of modified nucleotides. Finally, high&#8208;throughput sequence analysis showed that neither the error rate nor the PCR bias was significantly affected by using TAdUTP. In summary, we propose that KOD XL and TAdUTP could be effectively used for aptamer selection without distorting the sequence space of random oligonucleotide libraries.

      <title>The Rieske Oxygenase SnoT Catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxylation of l&#8208;Rhodosamine in Nogalamycin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Order! The binding of nogalamycin to DNA is facilitated by its carbohydrate units. The 2&#8220;&#8208; and 4&#8221;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine are particularly important for the bioactivity due to hydrogen bonding interactions. We have elucidated the biosynthetic steps for l&#8208;nogalamine formation and show that SnoT installs the 2&#8220;&#8208;hydroxy group, followed by 2&#8211;5&#8221;&#8208;carbocyclization and 4&#8220;&#8208;epimerization by SnoK and SnoN, respectively.







Abstract
Nogalamycin is an anthracycline anti&#8208;cancer agent that intercalates into the DNA double helix. The binding is facilitated by two carbohydrate units, l&#8208;nogalose and l&#8208;nogalamine, that interact with the minor and major grooves of DNA, respectively. However, recent investigations have shown that nogalamycin biosynthesis proceeds through the attachment of l&#8208;rhodosamine (2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;l&#8208;nogalamine) to the aglycone. Herein, we demonstrate that the Rieske enzyme SnoT catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation of l&#8208;rhodosamine as an initial post&#8208;glycosylation step. Furthermore, we establish that the reaction order continues with 2&#8211;5&#8242;&#8242; carbocyclization and 4&#8242;&#8242; epimerization by the non&#8208;heme iron and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent enzymes SnoK and SnoN, respectively. These late&#8208;stage tailoring steps are important for the bioactivity of nogalamycin due to involvement of the 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine in hydrogen bonding interactions with DNA.

      <title>Insight into Isoprenoid Biosynthesis by Functional Analysis of Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthases from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
      <dc:description>
Analysis of E&#8208;IDSs from Mycobacterium species has clarified their functions: Mv0992 and Mv1577 would be E&#8208;C45 and E&#8208;C20 synthases, respectively; Mv3536 (an E&#8208;C10&#8211;20 synthase) released an E&#8208;C10 intermediate during continuous condensation; Rv0562 and Rv2173 had similar functions to Mv0992 and Mv3536, respectively; and reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as a substrate for Z&#8208;IDS (Mv3822).







Abstract
Comprehensive functional analyses of E&#8208;isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (E&#8208;IDSs) from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium vanbaalenii have been performed. Mv0992 and Mv1577 represent a nonaprenyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C45) synthase and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C20) synthase, respectively. Although Mv3536 was identified as an E&#8208;C20 synthase using a single enzyme, co&#8208;incubation of Mv3536 and Z&#8208;IDSs (Mv4662 and Mv3822) strongly suggested it releases an intermediate geranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C10) during a continuous condensation reaction. Mv0992 and Mv3536 functions differed from those of the previously reported pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis homologues Rv0562 and Rv2173, respectively. Re&#8208;analysis of Rv0562 and Rv2173 demonstrated that their functions were similar to those of Mv0992 and Mv3536 (Rv0562: E&#8208;C45 synthase; Rv2173: E&#8208;C10&#8211;15 synthase). The newly proposed functions of Rv0562 and Rv2173 would be in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and glycosyl carrier lipids essential for growth. Furthermore, a reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as the Z&#8208;IDS of the Mv3822 substrate, thereby introducing a potentially novel pathway of cyclic sesquarterpene biosynthesis.

      <title>Quantitative elemental analysis of a single cell using inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry in fast time&#8208;resolved analysis mode</title>
      <dc:description>The elemental composition of a single cell such as yeast, green alga, and red blood cells (RBC) was precisely determined using inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) operating in fast time&#8208;resolved analysis (TRA) mode. The technique is known as single cell ICP&#8208;MS (SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS). Phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) were detected in the three types of cell. The elemental composition of yeast and green alga obtained by SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS was consistent with results obtained by conventional ICP&#8208;MS measurements following acid digestion of the cells. Slight differences were found in the measured values between SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS and the conventional ICP&#8208;MS results for RBC. However, the SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS results for S and Fe in RBC were closer to the estimated values for these elements that were calculated from the level of hemoglobin in RBC. The data suggests that SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS is suitable for the analysis of various cell types, namely, fungus, plant, and animal cells.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The elemental composition of a single cell such as yeast, green alga, and red blood cells (RBC) was precisely determined using inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) operating in fast time&#8208;resolved analysis (TRA) mode. The technique is known as single cell ICP&#8208;MS (SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS). Phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) were detected in the three types of cell. The elemental composition of yeast and green alga obtained by SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS was consistent with results obtained by conventional ICP&#8208;MS measurements following acid digestion of the cells. Slight differences were found in the measured values between SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS and the conventional ICP&#8208;MS results for RBC. However, the SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS results for S and Fe in RBC were closer to the estimated values for these elements that were calculated from the level of hemoglobin in RBC. The data suggests that SC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS is suitable for the analysis of various cell types, namely, fungus, plant, and animal cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Bifunctional DNA Duplexes Permit Efficient Incorporation of pH Probes into Liposomes</title>
      <dc:description>
Proton translocation across biological membranes is an essential mechanism for important cellular tasks such as ATP production or nutrient uptake. Proteoliposomes containing pH&#8208;sensitive fluorescent dyes are an important tool to investigate these processes. The cover illustrates a lipid vesicle with an embedded proton translocating F1FO ATP synthase. The pH&#8208;sensitive dye is anchored to the membrane by bifunctional DNA duplexes to ensure efficient incorporation. The DNA backbone on the outside can be cut enzymatically to yield proteoliposomes with the pH sensor selectively on the inside.

      <title>Photochemical RNA Editing of C to U by Using Ultrafast Reversible RNA Photo&#8208;crosslinking in DNA/RNA Duplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Pinpoint C to U conversion: We evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The most hydrophilic photo&#8208;crosslinker induced the fastest deamination of cytosine. Inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing.







Abstract
RNA editing, which is used to edit nucleobases in RNA strands; is more feasible for use in medical applications than DNA editing. We previously reported the photochemical conversion of cytosine to uracil, which required photo&#8208;crosslinking, deamination, and photo&#8208;splitting. Here, we evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The photo&#8208;crosslinker 3&#8208;carboxyvinylcarbazole(OHVK), which is more hydrophilic than 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole(CNVK), 3&#8208;carboxyamidevinylcarbazole(NH2VK), and 3&#8208;methoxy carbonylvinylcarbazole(OMeVK), induced faster deamination of cytosine. Furthermore, inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing. Upon evaluation of the conversion from cytosine to uracil in RNA, the use of oligodeoxynucleotides containing OHVK and inosine and the polarity of the bases surrounding the target cytosine were found to be crucial.

      <title>Cofactors as Molecular Fossils To Trace the Origin and Evolution of Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Mutual support: Cofactors play important roles in the origin and evolution of proteins. Nucleotide&#8208;containing cofactors might have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from random amino acid sequences. Metallic cofactors also link protein evolution with geochemical variations; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry.







Abstract
Due to their early origin and extreme conservation, cofactors are valuable molecular fossils for tracing the origin and evolution of proteins. First, as the order of protein folds binding with cofactors roughly coincides with protein&#8208;fold chronology, cofactors are considered to have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from pools of random amino acid sequences. Second, in the subsequent evolution of proteins, cofactors still played an important role. More interestingly, as metallic cofactors evolved with geochemical variations, some geochemical events left imprints in the chronology of protein architecture; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry. In this paper, we attempt to review the molecular fossils used in tracing the origin and evolution of proteins, with a special focus on cofactors.

      <title>Responsive Fluorophore Aggregation Provides Spectral Contrast for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorophores are greatly influenced by their environment. In their full paper, L. Cui et&#8197;al. show that triggering the aggregation of a self&#8208;condensing scaffold labeled with a fluorophore induces changes in the emission spectrum, polarization, and lifetime. The aggregates exhibited a shorter lifetime detectable in cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, thus suggesting that triggered aggregation strategies can be used in the probes for various biological events through lifetime imaging.

      <title>Towards Zwitterionic Oligonucleotides with Improved Properties: the NAA/LNA&#8208;Gapmer Approach</title>
      <dc:description>Oligonucleotides (ON) are promising therapeutic candidates, for instance by blocking endogenous mRNA (antisense mechanism). However, ON usually require structural modifications of the native nucleic acid backbone to ensure satisfying pharmacokinetic properties. One such strategy to design novel antisense oligonucleotides is the replacement of native phosphate diester units by positively charged artificial linkages, thus leading to (partially) zwitterionic backbone structures. Herein, we report a gapmer architecture comprised of one zwitterionic central segment ('gap') containing nucleosyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;modifications and two outer segments of locked nucleic acid (LNA). This NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach furnished a partially zwitterionic ON with optimised properties: (i) the formation of stable ON&#8208;RNA duplexes with base&#8208;pairing fidelity and superior target selectivity at 37 &#176;C; and (ii) excellent stability in complex biological media. Overall, the NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach is thus established as a strategy to design partially zwitterionic ON for the future development of novel antisense agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclotide structures revealed by NMR, with a little help from X&#8208;ray crystallography</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  This article highlights the predominant role that NMR has had in determining the structures of cyclotides, a fascinating class of macrocyclic peptides found in plants. Cyclotides contain a cystine knot, a compact structural motif that is constrained by three disulfide bonds and able to resist chemical and biological degradation. Their resistance to proteolytic degradation has made cyclotides appealing as drug leads. Here we examine the developments that led to the identification and conclusive determination of the disulfide connectivity of cyclotides and describe in detail the structural features of exemplar cyclotides. We also review the role that X&#8208;ray crystallography has played in resolving cyclotide structures and describe how racemic crystallography opened up the possibility of obtaining previously inaccessible X&#8208;ray structures of cyclotides.</dc:description>

      <title>Production of Propene from n&#8208;Butanol: A Three&#8208;Step Cascade Utilizing the Cytochrome P450 Fatty Acid Decarboxylase OleTJE</title>
      <dc:description>Propene is one of the most important starting materials in the chemical industry. Herein, we report an enzymatic cascade reaction for the biocatalytic production of propene starting from  n&#8208;butanol, thus offering a biobased production from glucose. In order to create an efficient system, we faced the issue of an optimal cofactor supply for the fatty acid decarboxylase OleTJE, which is said to be driven by either NAD(P)H or H2O2. In the first system, we used an alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase coupled to OleTJE  via the electron transfer complex putidaredoxin reductase/putidaredoxin, allowing regeneration of the NAD+  cofactor. With the second system, we intended full oxidation of  n&#8208;butanol to butyric acid, generating one equivalent of H2O2  that can be used for the oxidative decarboxylation. Since the optimal substrate is a long&#8208;chain fatty acid, we also tried to create an improved variant for the decarboxylation of butyric acid using rational protein design. Within a mutational study with 57 designed mutants, we generated the mutant OleTV292I  , which showed a 2.4&#8208;fold improvement in propene production in our H2O2  driven cascade system and reached total turnover numbers &gt;1000.</dc:description>

      <title>Macrocyclization of a ligand targeting a toxic RNA dramatically improves potency</title>
      <dc:description>RNA molecules both contribute to and are causative of many human diseases. One method to perturb RNA function is to target its structure with small molecules. However, discovering bioactive ligands for RNA targets is challenging. Here, we show that the bioactivity of a linear dimeric ligand that inactivates the RNA trinucleotide repeat expansion that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 [DM1; r(CUG)exp] can be improved by macrocyclization. Indeed, the macrocyclic compound is 10&#8208;fold more potent than the linear compound for improving DM1&#8208;associated defects in cells, including in patient&#8208;derived myotubes (muscle cells). This enhancement in potency is due to the macrocycle&#8217;s increased affinity and selectivity for the target, thereby inhibiting r(CUG)exp&#8217;s toxic interaction with muscleblind&#8208;like 1 (MBNL1), and its superior cell permeability. Macrocyclization may prove an effective way to enhance the bioactivity of modularly assembled ligands targeting RNA.</dc:description>

      <title>Multivalent Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Macromolecules: Linking Increased Binding Affinity with Enhanced Innate Immune Killing</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the line of fire: Macromolecular antibody recruiting molecules can bind though multivalent interaction with endogenous antibodies and draw these to the surface of target cells or pathogen, thereby marking the latter for innate immune destruction.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) are a novel class of immunotherapeutics. They are capable of introducing antibodies onto disease&#8208;relevant targets such as cancer cells, bacterial cells or viruses. This can induce antibody&#8208;mediated immune responses such as antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody&#8208;dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), which can kill the pathogen. In contrast to the classic ARMs, multivalent ARMs could offer the advantage of increasing the efficiency of antibody recruitment and subsequent innate immune killing. Such compounds consist of multiple target&#8208;binding termini (TBT) and/or antibody&#8208;binding termini (ABT). Those multivalent interactions are able to convert low binding affinities into increased binding avidities. This minireview summarizes the current status of multivalent ARMs and gives insight into possible benefits, hurdles still to be overcome and future perspectives.

      <title>Predicting the substrate scope of the flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase BrvH</title>
      <dc:description>The recently described flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase BrvH is able to catalyze both bromination and chlorination of indole, but shows significantly higher bromination activity. BrvH was annotated as a tryptophan halogenase, but does not accept tryptophan as a substrate. Its native substrate remains unknown. A predictive model with the data available for BrvH was analysed. A training set of compounds tested  in vitro  was docked into the active site of a complete protein model based on the X&#8208;ray structure of BrvH. The atoms not resolved experimentally have been modelled using molecular mechanics force fields to obtain this protein model. Furthermore, docking poses for the substrates and known non&#8208;substrates have been calculated. Parameters like distance, partial charge, and hybridization state have been analysed to derive rules for prediction of activity. With this model for activity of the BrvH, a virtual screening suggested several structures for potential substrates. Some of the thus preselected compounds were tested  in vitro  and several could be verified as convertible substrates. Based on information on halogenated natural products, a new dataset was created to specifically search for natural products as substrates/products, and virtual screening in this database yielded further hits.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploring the Chemoselectivity towards Cysteine Arylation by Cyclometallated AuIII Compounds: New Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting your gold right: Cyclometallated AuIII complexes with bidentate C^N&#8208;donor ligands enable chemoselective cysteine modification of peptides by C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination. By using combined high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and QM/MM studies, further understanding of the mechanisms of AuIII&#8208;templated cross&#8208;coupling leading to cysteine arylation was achieved; this is essential to design selective gold compounds for bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions.







Abstract
To gain more insight into the factors controlling efficient cysteine arylation by cyclometallated AuIII complexes, the reaction between selected gold compounds and different peptides was investigated by high&#8208;resolution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR&#8208;LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS). The deduced mechanisms of C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling, also supported by density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, evidenced the key role of secondary peptidic gold binding sites in favouring the process of reductive elimination.

      <title>Increased Lipophilicity of Halogenated Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Leads to Decreased Phototoxicity in&#8197;vitro when Used as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
One up, one down: RuII polypyridyl complexes are prime candidates for the development of new photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. Increasing their lipophilicity could result in improved pharmacological properties. The relationship between lipophilicity and in&#8197;vitro phototoxicity of halogenated RuII complexes was investigated.







Abstract
In the fight against cancer, photodynamic therapy is generating great interest thanks to its ability to selectively kill cancer cells without harming healthy tissues. In this field, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, and more specifically, complexes with dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz) as a ligand are of particular interest due to their DNA&#8208;binding and photocleaving properties. However, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes can sometimes suffer from low lipophilicity, which hampers cellular internalisation through passive diffusion. In this study, four new [Ru(dppz&#8208;X2)3]2+ complexes (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I) were synthesized and their lipophilicity (logP), cytotoxicity and phototoxicity on cancerous and noncancerous cell lines were assessed. This study shows that, counterintuitively, the phototoxicity of these complexes decreases as their lipophilicity increases; this could be due solely to the atomic radius of the halogen substituents.

      <title>Chemical Knockdown of MicroRNA with Small&#8208;Molecule Chimeras</title>
      <dc:description>
Targeting &#8220;undruggable&#8221; RNA: In this concept article, we introduce the development and application of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) to the targeted degradation of microRNAs. Due to their high specificity and potency, SMCs present an unprecedented chemical approach to knock down endogenous miRNAs, and thus should contribute to both biological discovery and therapeutic development.







Abstract
This concept article introduces the emerging area of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) for knocking down microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous gene silencers involved in diverse pathological processes. Compared with agents for genetic knockdown, small&#8208;molecules hold significant promise in this field due to their ideal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The SMCs introduced here are hetero&#8208;bifunctional molecules comprising small&#8208;molecule binders (SMBs) of miRNAs and chemical functionalities that either directly cleave RNAs or recruit ribonucleases to destroy RNAs. Binding of SMBs to miRNAs brings SMCs&#8217; chemical functionalities close to the miRNA, eventually causing miRNA degradation. Compared with parent SMBs, SMCs exhibit remarkably enhanced potency and specificity in miRNA inhibition. The development and application of SMCs for miRNAs will be discussed.

      <title>Catalytic promiscuity of cGAS: A facile enzymatic synthesis of 2&#8217;&#8208;3&#8217; linked cyclic dinucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP dinucleotide 2'3'&#8208;cGAMP. 2'3'&#8208;cGAMP functions as inducer for the production of type I interferons. Derivatives of this important second messenger are highly valuable for pharmaceutical applications. However, the production of these analogs requires complex, multistep synthesis. Herein, human cGAS is shown to react with a series of non&#8208;natural nucleotides, thus leading to novel cyclic dinucleotides. Most substrate derivatives were accepted with modifications at the nucleobase, ribose, as well as the &#945;&#8208;thio phosphate. The presented results demonstrate the catalytic promiscuity of human cGAS and its utility for the biocatalytic synthesis of cyclic dinucleotide derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Nonhydrolyzable Heptose Bis&#8208; and Monophosphate Analogues Modulate Pro&#8208;inflammatory TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Small change, big difference: A series of nonhydrolyzable analogues of bacterial heptosides has been synthesized and assayed on whole cells. Interestingly, depending on the functional groups at the 7&#8208;position of the heptose scaffold and in the vicinity of the anomeric position, some molecules could trigger an inflammatory response whereas others were antagonists of heptose&#8208;1,7&#8208;bisphosphate.







Abstract
d&#8208;Glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;,7&#8208;bisphosphate (HBP) and d&#8208;glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;&#8208;phosphate (H1P) are bacterial metabolites that were recently shown to stimulate inflammatory responses in host cells through the activation of the TIFA&#8208;dependent NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway. To better understand structure&#8208;based activity in relation to this process, a family of nonhydrolyzable phosphonate analogues of HBP and H1P was synthesized. The inflammation modulation by which these molecules induce the TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signal axis was evaluated in&#8197;vivo at a low&#8208;nanomolar concentration (6&#8197;nM) and compared to that of the natural metabolites. Our data showed that three phosphonate analogues had similar stimulatory activity to HBP, whereas two phosphonates antagonized HBP&#8208;induced TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. These results open new horizons for the design of pro&#8208;inflammatory and innate immune modulators that could be used as vaccine adjuvant.

      <title>Crossing the Border: From Keto&#8208; to Imine Reduction in Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases</title>

Willing to learn: In the context of enzymatic asymmetric reduction SDRs are mainly known for their ability to reduce ketones, rather than imines.

Abstract
The family of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent short&#8208;chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) comprises numerous biocatalysts capable of C=O or C=C reduction. The highly homologous noroxomaritidine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus and Zt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae, however, are SDRs with an extended imine substrate scope. Comparison with a similar SDR from Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR) exhibiting keto&#8208;reducing activity, yet negligible imine&#8208;reducing capability, and mining the Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Engineering Database indicated that NR and Zt_SDR possess a unique active&#8208;site composition among SDRs. Adapting the active site of Ao_SDR accordingly improved its imine&#8208;reducing capability. By applying the same strategy, an unrelated SDR from Methylobacterium sp. 77 (M77_SDR) with distinct keto&#8208;reducing activity was engineered into a promiscuous enzyme with imine&#8208;reducing activity, thereby confirming that the ability to reduce imines can be rationally introduced into members of the &#8220;classical&#8221; SDR enzyme family. Thus, members of the SDR family could be a promising starting point for protein approaches to generate new imine&#8208;reducing enzymes.

      <title>First Ring&#8208;Expanded Maytansin Lactone Accessed by a New Mutasynthetic Variant</title>
      <dc:description>
Make it larger! A new variant of the chemo&#8208;biosynthetic concept of mutasynthesis using a multiblocked strain of the ansamitocin producer A. pretiosum yielded new macrolactam proansamitocins as well as the first ring&#8208;expanded maytansin macrolactone.







Abstract
A multiblocked mutant strain (&#916;AHBA and &#916;asm12, asm21) of Actinosynnema pretiosum, the producer of the highly toxic maytansinoid ansamitocin, has been used for the mutasynthetic production of new proansamitocin derivatives. The use of mutant strains that are blocked in the biosynthesis of an early building block as well as in the expression of two tailoring enzymes broadens the scope of chemo&#8208;biosynthetic access to new maytansinoids. Remarkably, a ring&#8208;expanded macrolactone derived from ansamitocin was created for the first time.

      <title>Molecular Recognition in C&#8208;Type Lectins: The Cases of DC&#8208;SIGN, Langerin, MGL, and L&#8208;Sectin</title>
      <dc:description>
Fine specificity: The interaction of glycans with C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs) mediates the dissemination of infections and is strongly related to the immune response. In this review, we emphasize the molecular recognition features of four of the most studied CLRs of group II: DC&#8208;SIGN, Langerin, MGL and LSECtin







Abstract
Carbohydrates play a pivotal role in intercellular communication processes. In particular, glycan antigens are key for sustaining homeostasis, helping leukocytes to distinguish damaged tissues and invading pathogens from healthy tissues. From a structural perspective, this cross&#8208;talk is fairly complex, and multiple membrane proteins guide these recognition processes, including lectins and Toll&#8208;like receptors. Since the beginning of this century, lectins have become potential targets for therapeutics for controlling and/or avoiding the progression of pathologies derived from an incorrect immune outcome, including infectious processes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of these receptors is mandatory for the development of specific treatments. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about four key C&#8208;type lectins whose importance has been steadily growing in recent years, focusing in particular on how glycan recognition takes place at the molecular level, but also looking at recent progresses in the quest for therapeutics.

      <title>Targeted Discovery of Tetrapeptides and Cyclic Polyketide&#8208;Peptide Hybrids from a Fungal Antagonist of Farming Termites</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical treasures of a fungal stowaway: Structural analysis of six new chemical features revealed four linear tetrapeptides and two cyclic NRPS&#8208;polyketide&#8208;derived natural products from the fungal antagonist Pseudoxylaria sp. X187 of fungus&#8208;growing termites.







Abstract
Herein, we report the targeted isolation and characterization of four linear nonribosomally synthesized tetrapeptides (pseudoxylaramide A&#8211;D) and two cyclic nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase&#8208;derived natural products (xylacremolide A and B) from the termite&#8208;associated stowaway fungus Pseudoxylaria sp. X187. The fungal strain was prioritized for further metabolic analysis based on its taxonomical position and morphological and bioassay data. Metabolic data were dereplicated based on high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and global molecular networking analysis. The structure of all six new natural products was elucidated based on a combination of 1D and 2D NMR analysis, Marfey's analysis and X&#8208;ray crystallography.

      <title>2,3&#8208;Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Decarboxylase from Fusarium oxysporum: Crystal Structures and Substrate Recognition Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
It depends on your position: Crystal structure and mutation studies reveal that R233&#916; plays an important role in the substrate recognition of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase (DHBD) from Fusarium oxysporum, as well as the molecular basis for this enzyme being a 2,3&#8208;DHBD with different substrate preference from known 2,6&#8208;DHBDs and salicylic acid decarboxylases.







Abstract
A 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Fusarium oxysporum (2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo) has a relatively high catalytic efficiency for the decarboxylation of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and carboxylation of catechol, thus it has a different substrate spectrum from other benzoic acid decarboxylases. We have determined the structures of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo in its apo form and complexes with catechol or 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid at 1.55, 1.97, and 2.45&#8197;&#197; resolution, respectively. The crystal structures of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo show that the enzyme exists as a homotetramer, and each active center has a Zn2+ ion coordinated by E8, H167, D291 and three water molecules. This is different from 2,6&#8208;DHBD from Rhizobium sporomusa, in which the Zn2+ ion is also coordinated with H10. Surprisingly, mutation of A10 of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo to His resulted in almost complete loss of the enzyme activity. Enzyme&#8208;substrate docking and site&#8208;directed mutation studies indicate that residue R233&#916; interacts with the 3&#8208;hydroxy group of 2,3&#8208;DHBA, and plays an important role in substrate recognition for this enzyme, thus revealing the molecular basis 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase.

      <title>Reexamination of the Ergothioneine Biosynthetic Methyltransferase EgtD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a Protein Kinase Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>
Conformer conundrum: The histidine methyltransferase EgtD produces N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine as the first intermediate of ergothioneine biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis. This enzyme can be regulated by kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. However, in&#8197;vitro characterization of this process suggests that folded EgtD is a poor substrate for protein kinase D (PknD).







Abstract
Ergothioneine has emerged as a crucial cytoprotectant in the pathogenic lifestyle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Production of this antioxidant from primary metabolites may be regulated by phosphorylation of Thr213 in the active site of the methyltransferase EgtD. The structure of mycobacterial EgtD suggests that this post&#8208;translational modification would require a large&#8208;scale change in conformation to make the active&#8208;site residue accessible to a protein kinase. In this report, we show that, under in&#8197;vitro conditions, EgtD is not a substrate of protein kinase PknD.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conformer conundrum &lt;/b&gt;: The histidine methyltransferase EgtD produces &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine as the first intermediate of ergothioneine biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis &lt;/i&gt;. This enzyme can be regulated by kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. However, &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro &lt;/i&gt; characterization of this process suggests that folded EgtD is a poor substrate for protein kinase D (PknD).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergothioneine has emerged as a crucial cytoprotectant in the pathogenic lifestyle of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis &lt;/i&gt;. Production of this antioxidant from primary metabolites may be regulated by phosphorylation of Thr213 in the active site of the methyltransferase EgtD. The structure of mycobacterial EgtD suggests that this post&#8208;translational modification would require a large&#8208;scale change in conformation to make the active&#8208;site residue accessible to a protein kinase. In this report, we show that, under &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro &lt;/i&gt; conditions, EgtD is not a substrate of protein kinase PknD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nitroxide&#8208;Derived N&#8208;Oxide Phenazines for Noncovalent Spin&#8208;Labeling of DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Phenazine radicals: O&#8208;benzoquinone isoindoline derivatives were condensed with aromatic 1,2&#8208;diamines, followed by oxidation to give phenazine&#8208;di&#8208;N&#8208;oxide isoindoline nitroxides. One derivative showed high binding affinity and selectivity towards abasic sites in duplex DNA when the orphan base was cytosine; all of the derivatives showed negligible binding to abasic sites in RNA.







Abstract
Two o&#8208;benzoquinone derivatives of isoindoline were synthesized for use as building blocks to incorporate isoindoline nitroxides into different compounds and materials. These o&#8208;quinones were condensed with a number of o&#8208;phenylenediamines to form isoindoline&#8208;phenazines in high yields. Subsequent oxidation gave phenazine&#8208;di&#8208;N&#8208;oxide isoindoline nitroxides that were evaluated for noncovalent and site&#8208;directed spin&#8208;labeling of duplex DNA and RNA that contained abasic sites. Although only minor binding was observed for RNA, the unsubstituted phenazine&#8208;N,N&#8208;dioxide tetramethyl isoindoline nitroxide showed high binding affinity and selectivity towards abasic sites in duplex DNA that contained cytosine as the orphan base.

      <title>The molecular basis for purine binding selectivity in the bacterial ATP synthase &#949; subunit</title>
      <dc:description>The &#949; subunit of ATP synthases has been proposed to regulate ATP hydrolysis in bacteria. Prevailing evidence supports the notion that when the ATP concentration falls below a certain threshold, the &#949; subunit changes its conformation from a non&#8208;inhibitory down&#8208;state to an extended up&#8208;state which then inhibits enzymatic ATP hydrolysis by binding to the catalytic domain. It has been demonstrated that the &#949; subunit from Bacillus PS3 is selective for ATP over other nucleotides, including GTP. In this study, the purine triphosphate selectivity is rationalized via results from MD simulations and free energy calculations for the R103A/R115A mutant of the &#949; subunit from Bacillus PS3, which binds ATP stronger than the wild&#8208;type (WT) protein. Our results are in good agreement with experimental data, and the elucidated molecular basis for selectivity could help to guide the design of novel GTP sensors.</dc:description>

      <title>Human Cellular Retinol Binding Protein II Forms a Domain&#8208;Swapped Trimer Representing a Novel Fold and a New Template for Protein Engineering.</title>

It is further shown that domain&#8208;swapped trimerization can be favored by strategic installation of a disulfide bond, demonstrating a strategy for fold control. We further show the domain&#8208;swapped trimer to be a useful protein design template by installing a high&#8208;affinity metal binding site with the introduction of a single mutation, taking advantage of its 3&#8208;fold symmetry.

      <title>Reversal of Regioselectivity in Zinc&#8208;Dependent Medium&#8208;Chain Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis toward Octanone Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversal of regioselectivity: A versatile ADH from R. erythropolis (ReADH) accepts only carbonyl substrates with either a methyl or ethyl group adjacent to carbonyl moiety. Modified ReADH converts bulky substrates (ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate) and opens up a new route for the synthesis of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutanoate, which is an important intermediate for anti&#8208;hypertension drugs like enalaprilat and lisinopril.







Abstract
The zinc&#8208;dependent medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis (ReADH) is one of the most versatile biocatalysts for the stereoselective reduction of ketones to chiral alcohols. Despite its known broad substrate scope, ReADH only accepts carbonyl substrates with either a methyl or an ethyl group adjacent to the carbonyl moiety; this limits its use in the synthesis of the chiral alcohols that serve as a building blocks for pharmaceuticals. Protein engineering to expand the substrate scope of ReADH toward bulky substitutions next to carbonyl group (ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate) opens up new routes in the synthesis of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutanoate, an important intermediate for anti&#8208;hypertension drugs like enalaprilat and lisinopril. We have performed computer&#8208;aided engineering of ReADH toward ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate and octanone derivatives. W296, which is located in the small binding pocket of ReADH, sterically restricts the access of ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate, octan&#8208;3&#8208;one or octan&#8208;4&#8208;one toward the catalytic zinc ion and thereby limits ReADH activity. Computational analysis was used to identify position W296 and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis (SSM) yielded an improved variant W296A with a 3.6&#8208;fold improved activity toward ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate when compared to WT ReADH (ReADH W296A: 17.10&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 4.7&#8197;U/mg). In addition, the regioselectivity of ReADH W296A is shifted toward octanone substrates. ReADH W296A has a more than 16&#8208;fold increased activity toward octan&#8208;4&#8208;one (ReADH W296A: 0.97&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 0.06&#8197;U/mg) and a more than 30&#8208;fold decreased activity toward octan&#8208;2&#8208;one (ReADH W296A: 0.23&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 7.69&#8197;U/mg). Computational and experimental results revealed the role of position W296 in controlling the substrate scope and regiopreference of ReADH for a variety of carbonyl substrates.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Ferrocifens that Show Chiral Discrimination in Antiproliferative Activity on Breast Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Inaccessible no longer: Enantiopure ferrocifens and ferrociphenols have been efficiently prepared for biological evaluation via a chiral ketone by palladium&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;H bond activation/cyclisation. IC50 values reveal that S&#8208;configured molecules perform better against an ER+ breast cancer cell line, but the result is less clear in the ER&#8722; case.







Abstract
The design and first enantioselective synthesis of a series of chiral ferrocifens and ferrociphenols was realised by enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;H bond activation followed by McMurry coupling. Biological evaluation revealed moderate anticancer activities on breast cancer cells and evidence of chiral discrimination between enantiomers. Treatment of the novel ferrocifens with Ag2O revealed that these systems are unable to form a neutral quinone methide, yet still demonstrate marked antiproliferative properties against both the hormone&#8208;dependent MCF&#8208;7 and hormone&#8208;independent MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cell lines. This bioactivity arises from two mechanisms: Fenton&#8208;type chemistry and the anti&#8208;estrogenic activity associated with the tamoxifen&#8208;like structure.

      <title>Ribosomal Target&#8208;Binding Sites of Antimicrobial Peptides Api137 and Onc112 Are Conserved among Pathogens Indicating New Lead Structures To Develop Novel Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Resisting resistance: Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides Api137 and especially Onc112 bind strongly to the bacterial (70S) ribosome, even to ribosomes of pathogens that appear to be resistant in standards antibiotic tests. The presented data indicate that Onc112 in particular might represent a valid lead structure to develop broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics relying on a novel bactericidal mechanism.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides expressed in insects are primarily active against Enterobacteriaceae. Mechanistically, they target the bacterial (70S) ribosome after partially transporter&#8208;based cellular uptake, as revealed for Api137 and Onc112 on Escherichia coli. Following molecular modeling indicating that the Onc112 contact site is conserved among the ribosomes of high&#8208;priority pathogens, the ribosome binding of Api137 and Onc112 was studied. The dissociation constants (Kd) of Onc112 were &#8764;75&#8197;nmol/L for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii, 36&#8197;nmol/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 102&#8197;nmol/L for Staphylococcus aureus, thus indicating a very promising lead structure for developing broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. Api137 bound weaker with Kd values ranging from 155&#8197;nmol/L to 13&#8197;&#956;mol/L. For most bacteria, the antibacterial activities were lower than predicted from the Kd values, which was only partially explained by their ability to enter bacterial cells. Other factors limiting the activity expected from the ribosome binding might be off&#8208;target binding.

      <title>Bacterial Cell Display as a Robust and Versatile Platform for Engineering Low&#8208;Affinity Ligands and Enzymes
</title>
      <dc:description>
Displaying enzymes and low&#8208;affinity binding proteins on the surface of the bacterial cell: A SNAP reporter together with the function&#8208;dependent labelling of the cell with cholesterol&#8208;linked DNA, allows systematic optimisation of cell display, making it a robust and flexible platform for the systematic evolution of XNA molecular biology.







Abstract
Directed evolution has been remarkably successful at expanding the chemical and functional boundaries of biology. That progress is heavily dependent on the robustness and flexibility of the available selection platforms, given the significant cost to (re)develop a given platform to target a new desired function. Bacterial cell display has a significant track record as a viable strategy for the engineering of mesophilic enzymes, as enzyme activity can be probed directly and free from interference from the cellular milieu, but its adoption has lagged behind other display&#8208;based methods. Herein, we report the development of SNAP as a quantitative reporter for bacterial cell display, which enables fast troubleshooting and the systematic development of the display&#8208;based selection platform, thus improving its robustness. In addition, we demonstrate that even weak interactions between displayed proteins and nucleic acids can be harnessed for the specific labelling of bacterial cells, allowing functional characterisation of DNA binding proteins and enzymes, thus making it a highly flexible platform for these biochemical functions. Together, this establishes bacterial display as a robust and flexible platform, ideally suited for the systematic engineering of ligands and enzymes needed for XNA molecular biology.

      <dc:description>Proteasomes are established therapeutic targets for hematological cancers and promising targets for autoimmune diseases.

      <title>Efficient Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycans with a&#160;&#946;1,4&#8208;Galactosylated Bisecting&#8208;GlcNAc Motif</title>
      <dc:description>In human serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) a rare modification of biantennary complex N&#8208;glycans leads to a&#160; b 1,4&#8208;galactosylated bisecting&#8208;GlcNAc branch. We found that the bisecting&#8208;GlcNAc on a biantennary core&#8208;fucosylated N&#8208;glycan was enzymatically galactosylated under stringent reaction conditions. Further optimizations led to an efficient enzymatic approach to this particular modification for biantennary substrates. Notably, tri&#8208; and tetraantennary antennary complex N&#8208;glycans were not converted by bovine galactosyltransferase. An N&#8208;glycan with a galactosylated bisecting GlcNAc was linked to a lanthanide binding tag. The pseudo contact shifts (PCS) obtained from the corresponding Dy&#8208;complex were used to calculate the conformational preferences of the rare N&#8208;glycan. Besides two extended conformations only a single folded conformation was found.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In human serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) a rare modification of biantennary complex N&#8208;glycans leads to a&#160; b 1,4&#8208;galactosylated bisecting&#8208;GlcNAc branch. We found that the bisecting&#8208;GlcNAc on a biantennary core&#8208;fucosylated N&#8208;glycan was enzymatically galactosylated under stringent reaction conditions. Further optimizations led to an efficient enzymatic approach to this particular modification for biantennary substrates. Notably, tri&#8208; and tetraantennary antennary complex N&#8208;glycans were not converted by bovine galactosyltransferase. An N&#8208;glycan with a galactosylated bisecting GlcNAc was linked to a lanthanide binding tag. The pseudo contact shifts (PCS) obtained from the corresponding Dy&#8208;complex were used to calculate the conformational preferences of the rare N&#8208;glycan. Besides two extended conformations only a single folded conformation was found.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Complete Photochemical Regulation of 8&#8208;17 DNAzyme Activity using Reversible DNA Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking</title>
      <dc:description>The regulation of DNAzyme activity is an important problem for its  in vivo  applications. We achieved photochemical regulation of DNAzyme activity using reversible DNA photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking of 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole (  CNV  K). The ODN containing  CNV  K photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linked to pyrimidine base in complementary strand with a few seconds of photoirradiation and its photoadduct was photo&#8208;split by photoirradiation with another wavelength. The activity of photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linked DNAzyme having  CNV  K was completely inhibited (OFF state). In contrast, after 312 nm irradiation, the DNAzyme activity was recovered upon addition of substrate strand (ON state). In addition, the photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linked DNAzyme is prone to enzymatic digestion by exonuclease. This photochemical OFF to ON switching using reversible DNA photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking was regulated at desired timing and position; therefore, it may be possible to use it for  in vivo  application.</dc:description>

      <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange Reaction Promoted Highly Efficient Cellular Uptake of Pyridyl Disulfide Appended Nonionic Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
It takes two: Pyridyl&#8208;disulfide (Py&#8722;Ds) conjugated non&#8208;ionic nontoxic polymers exhibit cellular uptake by thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange with exofacial cell&#8208;surface thiols without going through the endocytosis pathway. Control experiments establish essential role of the Py&#8722;Ds group as neither pyridine&#8208; nor an aliphatic disulfide&#8208;appended polymer shows similar cellular uptake.







Abstract
The intracellular transport of molecules, macromolecules or materials is a key step in probing cellular structure and function, as well as regulating a plethora of physical and chemical events for treating disease. This communication reveals direct cellular uptake of pyridyl&#8208;disulfide (Py&#8722;Ds)&#8208;conjugated nonionic and biocompatible macromolecules with the aid of rapid exchange of the highly reactive Py&#8722;Ds groups with exofacial cell&#8208;surface thiols. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis confirmed highly efficient cellular uptake of Py&#8722;Ds&#8208;appended polymers (&gt;50&#8201;% in 15&#8197;min) by avoiding lysosome as a consequence of thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange in the cell surface. In contrast, a control polymer lacking the Py&#8722;Ds group followed caveolae&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Other control polymers containing either the pyridine group (but not disulfide) or the disulfide group (but not pyridine) revealed significantly low cellular uptake, and thus essential role of the highly reactive Py&#8722;Ds group was established beyond doubt.

      <title>Conformational Selection as the Driving Force of Amyloid &#946; Chiral Inactivation</title>
      <dc:description>
Rippled upon reflection: A&#946;&#8208;CI has been proposed to operate by forming rippled cross&#8208;&#946; networks upon mixing of A&#946; enantiomers, but the drastic kinetic effects are yet to be explained. DFT calculations showed that individual peptide strains adopt lower&#8208;strain conformations in rippled than in pleated cross&#8208;&#946; sheets, thus suggesting that conformation selection is responsible for the observed kinetic effects.







Abstract
We recently introduced amyloid &#946; chiral inactivation (A&#946;&#8208;CI) as a molecular approach that uses mirror&#8208;image peptides to chaperone the natural A&#946; stereoisomer into a less toxic state. The oligomer&#8208;to&#8208;fibril conversion mechanism remains the subject of active research. Perhaps the most striking feature of A&#946;&#8208;CI is the virtual obliteration of the incubation/induction phase that is so characteristic of A&#946; fibril formation kinetics. This qualitative change is indicative of the distinct mechanistic pathway A&#946;&#8208;CI operates through. The current working model of A&#946;&#8208;CI invokes the formation of &#8220;rippled&#8221; cross&#8208;&#946; sheets, in which alternating l&#8208; and d&#8208;peptide strands form periodic networks. However, the assumption of rippled cross&#8208;&#946; sheets does not per se explain the dramatic changes in reaction kinetics upon mixing of A&#946; enantiomers. Herein, it is shown by DFT computational methods that the individual peptide strands in rippled cross&#8208;&#946; networks are less conformationally strained than their pleated counterparts. This means that the adoption of fibril&#8208;seeding conformations is more probable for rippled cross&#8208;&#946;. Conformational selection is thus suggested as the mechanistic rationale for the acceleration of fibril formation upon A&#946;&#8208;CI.

      <title>Nonribosomal Peptides Produced by Minimal and Engineered Synthetases with Terminal Reductase Domains</title>
      <dc:description>
Peptide aldehyde production: An aldehyde&#8208;releasing reductase (R) domain has been identified as part of a minimal nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) in X. indica. We also show that the R domain from the tilivalline&#8208;producing NRPS can be used in engineered synthetases to introduce an aldehyde group and subsequently produce natural and unnatural pyrazinones.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) use terminal reductase domains for 2&#8208;electron reduction of the enzyme&#8208;bound thioester releasing the generated peptides as C&#8208;terminal aldehydes. Herein, we reveal the biosynthesis of a pyrazine that originates from an aldehyde&#8208;generating minimal NRPS termed ATRed in entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus indica. Reductase domains were also investigated in terms of NRPS engineering and, although no general applicable approach was deduced, we show that they can indeed be used for the production of similar natural and unnatural pyrazinones.

      <title>Cationic Ru(II) cyclopentadienyl complexes with antifungal activity against several&#160;Candida&#160;species</title>
      <dc:description>Fungal infections, including those caused by antifungal&#8208;resistant&#160;  Candida  , are a very challenging health problem worldwide.&#160;Whereas different ruthenium complexes were previously studied for their anti&#8208;  Candida  &#160;potential, Ru&#8208;cyclopentadienyl&#160;complexes were overlooked. Here, we report an antifungal activity assessment of three Ru&#8208;cyclopentadienyl complexes with some insights into their potential mode of action. Among these complexes, only cationic species [Ru&#8208;ACN]  +  &#160;and [Ru&#8208;ATZ]  +  &#160;displayed a significant antifungal activity against different&#160;  Candida  &#160;strains, notably against the ones that did not respond to one of the most currently used antifungal drugs fluconazole (FCZ). However, no apparent activity was observed for the neutral species, Ru&#8208;Cl, indicating the important role of the cationic backbone of these complexes on their biological activity. We suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation might be involved in the mechanism of action of these complexes as unlike&#160;neutral Ru&#8208;Cl, [Ru&#8208;ACN]  +  &#160;and [Ru&#8208;ATZ]  +  &#160;could generate intracellular concentration&#8208;dependent ROS. We also observed a correlation between the ruthenium cellular uptake, ROS generation and fungal growth inhibitory activity of the compounds. Furthermore, docking simulations showed that the CYP51 enzyme can form more energetically favorable complexes with [Ru&#8208;ATZ]  +  &#160;than fluconazole (FCZ), suggesting that CYP51 inhibition could also be considered as a potential mode of action.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fungal infections, including those caused by antifungal&#8208;resistant&#160;  Candida  , are a very challenging health problem worldwide.&#160;Whereas different ruthenium complexes were previously studied for their anti&#8208;  Candida  &#160;potential, Ru&#8208;cyclopentadienyl&#160;complexes were overlooked. Here, we report an antifungal activity assessment of three Ru&#8208;cyclopentadienyl complexes with some insights into their potential mode of action. Among these complexes, only cationic species [Ru&#8208;ACN]  +  &#160;and [Ru&#8208;ATZ]  +  &#160;displayed a significant antifungal activity against different&#160;  Candida  &#160;strains, notably against the ones that did not respond to one of the most currently used antifungal drugs fluconazole (FCZ). However, no apparent activity was observed for the neutral species, Ru&#8208;Cl, indicating the important role of the cationic backbone of these complexes on their biological activity. We suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation might be involved in the mechanism of action of these complexes as unlike&#160;neutral Ru&#8208;Cl, [Ru&#8208;ACN]  +  &#160;and [Ru&#8208;ATZ]  +  &#160;could generate intracellular concentration&#8208;dependent ROS. We also observed a correlation between the ruthenium cellular uptake, ROS generation and fungal growth inhibitory activity of the compounds. Furthermore, docking simulations showed that the CYP51 enzyme can form more energetically favorable complexes with [Ru&#8208;ATZ]  +  &#160;than fluconazole (FCZ), suggesting that CYP51 inhibition could also be considered as a potential mode of action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase: Structural Characteristics, Catalytic Mechanism and Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of OGT: OGT is the only enzyme to catalyze O&#8208;GlcNAc modification of intracellular protein substrates, thus playing an important role in several fundamental cellular pathways. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of small&#8208;molecular inhibitors of human OGT, complemented by a brief overview of its structural and mechanistic features.







Abstract
Modifications of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins with a single sugar, N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), play roles in a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes, and aberrant O&#8208;GlcNAc profiles are associated with pathological progression of several chronic diseases. O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the only enzyme to catalyze the attachment of GlcNAc to intracellular protein substrates. Considering its biological significance, selective and potent OGT inhibitors are invaluable tools for enhancing our understanding of the precise biological functions of the enzyme, for revealing its unknown functions, and for validating OGT as a therapeutic target. In this minireview, human OGT (hOGT) inhibitors and their catalytic mechanisms will be explored. In addition, a brief overview of recent findings on the 3D structural characteristics of hOGT that have contributed greatly to the development of novel inhibitors of hOGT is provided.

      <title>The Bulk Osteosarcoma and Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Activity of a Necroptosis&#8208;Inducing Nickel(II)&#8211;Phenanthroline Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Nickel necrosis: Osteosarcoma is the most prevalent primary bone cancer amongst adults and children. A nickel(II) coordination complex containing one 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand and two N,N&#8208;diethyldithiocarbamate moieties is shown to kill osteosarcoma cells by necroptosis, an ordered form of necrosis. Encouragingly, the nickel complex kills bulk osteosarcoma cells and hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) comparably at micromolar concentrations.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma and anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a nickel(II) complex, 1. Complex 1 displays similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the micromolar range. Notably, 1 displays similar or better OSC potency than the clinically approved platinum(II) anticancer drugs cisplatin and carboplatin in two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional osteosarcoma cell cultures. Mechanistic studies revealed that 1 induces osteosarcoma cell death by necroptosis, an ordered form of necrosis. The nickel(II) complex, 1 triggers necrosome&#8208;dependent mitrochondrial membrane depolarisation and propidium iodide uptake. Interestingly, 1 does not evoke necroptosis by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) or hyperactivation of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP&#8208;1). ROS elevation and PARP&#8208;1 activity are traits that have been observed for established necroptosis inducers such as shikonin, TRAIL and glutamate. Thus the necroptosis pathway evoked by 1 is distinct. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report into the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma and anti&#8208;OSC properties of a nickel complex.

      <title>Protection and Isolation of Bioorthogonal Metal Catalysts by Using Monolayer&#8208;Coated Nanozymes</title>
      <dc:description>
On the inside: The catalytic activity of bioorthogonal transition metal catalysts is retained by encapsulating them within the hydrophobic monolayer of gold nanoparticles. This strategy stabilizes the catalyst under environmental conditions, insulates it from changes in pH and prevents degradation over time. This allows for the in&#8197;situ generation of imaging and therapeutic agents in biological systems.







Abstract
We demonstrate here the protection of biorthogonal transition metal catalysts (TMCs) in biological environments by using self&#8208;assembled monolayers on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Encapsulation of TMCs in this hydrophobic environment preserves catalytic activity in presence of pH conditions and complex biological media that would deactivate free catalyst. Significantly, the protection affords by these nanozymes extends to isolation of the catalyst active site, as demonstrated by the independence of rate over a wide pH range, in strong contrast to the behavior of the free catalyst.

      <title>Stapled Peptide Inhibitors of Autophagy Adapter LC3B</title>
      <dc:description>
Combined with chemotherapy: Autophagy inhibitors have shown anti&#8208;proliferative activity when co&#8208;administered with standard chemotherapies. Peptides derived from the FYCO1 LC3&#8208;interacting region (LIR) motif were prepared for structure&#8208;activity characterization with the autophagy adapter protein, LC3B. Additionally, artificial amino acids and diversity&#8208;oriented peptide stapling were used to generate LC3B&#8208;selective peptide inhibitors with improved affinity and stability.







Abstract
A growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy inhibition enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy, especially in difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat cancers. Existing autophagy inhibitors are primarily lysosomotropic agents. More specific autophagy inhibitors are highly sought&#8208;after. The microtubule&#8208;associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B protein, LC3B, is an adapter protein that mediates key protein&#8208;protein interactions at several points in autophagy pathways. In this work, we used a known peptide ligand as a starting point to develop improved LC3B inhibitors. We obtained structure&#8208;activity relationships that quantify the binding contributions of peptide termini, individual charged residues, and hydrophobic interactions. Based on these data, we used artificial amino acids and diversity&#8208;oriented stapling to improve affinity and resistance to biological degradation, while maintaining or improving LC3B affinity and selectivity. These peptides represent the highest&#8208;affinity LC3B&#8208;selective ligands reported to date, and they will be useful tools for further elucidation of LC3B's role in autophagy and in cancer.

      <title>Infrared Spectroscopy Reveals the Preferred Motif Size and Local Disorder in Parallel Stranded DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
A spectroscopic ruler for G&#8208;quadruplexes: Using 2D IR spectroscopy, we show that vibrational delocalization of guanine carbonyl modes is the primary origin of shifts in their infrared spectra upon G&#8208;quadruplex assembly. Thus, the sizes of ordered G&#8208;quadruplex motifs and structural transitions or defects that disrupt them can be detected spectroscopically.







Abstract
Infrared spectroscopy detects the formation of G&#8208;quadruplexes in guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acid sequences through shifts in the guanine C=O stretch mode. Here, we use ultrafast 2D infrared (IR) spectroscopy and isotope substitution to show that these shifts arise from vibrational delocalization among stacked G&#8208;quartets. This provides a direct measure of the sizes of locally ordered motifs in heterogeneous samples with substantial disordered regions. We find that parallel&#8208;stranded, potassium&#8208;bound DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes are limited to five consecutive G&#8208;quartets and 3&#8211;4 consecutive layers are preferred for longer polyguanine tracts. The resulting potassium&#8208;dependent G&#8208;quadruplex assembly landscape reflects the polyguanine tract lengths found in genomes, the ionic conditions prevalent in healthy mammalian cells, and the onset of structural disorder in disease states. Our study describes spectral markers that can be used to probe other G&#8208;quadruplex structures and provides insight into the fundamental limits of their formation in biological and artificial systems.

      <dc:description>
The bases of life and their analogues display UV absorption spectra that differ from those of their respective nucleosides under alkaline conditions. This enables robust, versatile and fast analysis of reactions between these species.







Abstract
The increased interest in (enzymatic) transformations between nucleosides and nucleobases has demanded the development of efficient analytical tools. In this report, we present an update and extension of our recently described method for monitoring these reactions by spectral unmixing. The presented method uses differences in the UV absorption spectra of nucleosides and nucleobases after alkaline quenching to derive their ratio based on spectral shape by fitting normalized reference spectra. It is applicable to a broad compound spectrum comprising more than 35 examples, offers HPLC&#8208;like accuracy, ease of handling and significant reductions in both cost and data acquisition time compared to other methods. This contribution details the principle of monitoring reactions by spectral unmixing, gives recommendations regarding solutions to common problems and applications that necessitate special sample treatment. We provide software, workflows and reference spectra that facilitate the straightforward and versatile application of the method.

      <title>Role of Two Exceptional trans Adenylation Domains and MbtH&#8208;like Proteins in the Biosynthesis of the Nonribosomal Peptide WS9324A from Streptomyces calvus ATCC 13382</title>
      <dc:description>
Rule breakers: The trans&#8208;acting adenylation domains Cal22Thr and Cal23Asn are shown through gene disruption experiments and in&#8197;vitro assays with purified enzymes to play essential roles in the biosynthesis of the nonribosomal peptide WS92326A in S. calvus. For soluble heterologous protein production, Cal22Thr and Cal23Asn require coexpression with the MbtH&#8208;like protein Cal4, the latter copurifying with Cal23Asn as a complex.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are organized in a modular arrangement. Usually, the modular order corresponds to the assembly of the amino acids in the respective peptide, following the collinearity rule. The WS9326A biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces calvus shows deviations from this rule. Most interesting is the presence of two trans adenylation domains that are located downstream of the modular NRPS arrangement. Adenylation domains are responsible for the activation of their respective amino acids. In this study, we confirmed the involvement of the trans adenylation domains in WS9326A biosynthesis by performing gene knockout experiments and by observing the selective adenylation of their predicted amino acid substrates in&#8197;vitro. We conclude that the trans adenylation domains are essential for WS9326A biosynthesis. Moreover, both adenylation domains are observed to have MbtH&#8208;like protein dependency. Overall, we conclude that the trans adenylation domains are essential for WS9326A biosynthesis.

      <title>Synthesis and Metabolic Fate of 4&#8208;Methylthiouridine in Bacterial tRNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Through a combination of synthetic and analytical chemistry, the structure of the modified nucleoside 4&#8208;methylthiouridine was confirmed in bacterial tRNA. The modification is of low abundance and forms after bacterial stress induced by methylating agents; this argues for its nature as a natural tRNA lesion. By pulse chase analysis, we show its repair through a dethiomethylation mechanism in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is central to many life processes and, to fulfill its function, it has a substantial chemical variety in its building blocks. Enzymatic thiolation of uridine introduces 4&#8208;thiouridine (s4U) into many bacterial transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which is used as a sensor for UV radiation. A similar modified nucleoside, 2&#8208;thiocytidine, was recently found to be sulfur&#8208;methylated especially in bacteria exposed to antibiotics and simple methylating reagents. Herein, we report the synthesis of 4&#8208;methylthiouridine (ms4U) and confirm its presence and additional formation under stress in Escherichia coli. We used the synthetic ms4U for isotope dilution mass spectrometry and compared its abundance to other reported tRNA damage products. In addition, we applied sophisticated stable&#8208;isotope pulse chase studies (NAIL&#8208;MS) and showed its AlkB&#8208;independent removal in&#8197;vivo. Our findings reveal the complex nature of bacterial RNA damage repair.

      <title>Membrane&#8208;Associated Nucleobase&#8208;Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Peptides (&#946;&#8208;PNAs) Affecting Membrane Support and Lipid Composition</title>
      <dc:description>
A model system for membrane&#8208;spanning protein networks &#8211; important for the stability of the membrane, its structure and transmembrane signal transmission &#8211; has been developed. The synthetically available system is based on &#946;&#8208;peptide nucleic acid (&#946;&#8208;PNA) helices functionalized with lipid membrane anchors and nucleobase recognition sequences. &#946;&#8208;PNA membrane interaction and aggregation are indicated by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy assays.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;membrane interactions are essential to maintain membrane integrity and control membrane morphology and composition. Cytoskeletal proteins in particular are known to interact to a high degree with lipid bilayers and to line the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane with an extensive network structure. In order to gain a better mechanistical understanding of the protein&#8211;membrane interplay and possible membrane signaling, we started to develop a model system based on &#946;&#8208;peptide nucleic acids (&#946;&#8208;PNAs). These &#946;&#8208;peptides are known to form stable hydrogen&#8208;bonded aggregates due to their helical secondary structure, which serve to pre&#8208;organize the attached nucleobases. After optimization of the &#946;&#8208;PNA solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and validation of helix formation, the ability of the novel &#946;&#8208;PNAs to dimerize and interact with lipid bilayers was investigated by both fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. It was shown that duplex formation occurs rapidly and with high specificity and could also be detected on the surfaces of the lipid bilayers. Hereby, the potential of a &#946;&#8208;PNA&#8208;based peptide system to mimic membrane&#8208;associated protein networks could be demonstrated.

      <title>Histone Deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) Inhibitors Containing Boron</title>
      <dc:description>
Breaking the silence: We report the first boron&#8208;based histone deacetylase inhibitors of HDAC2, which is known to silence tumour&#8208;suppressor genes. With IC50 values in the nanomolar range, our compounds showcase boron's untapped potential in the design of new classes of epigenetic enzyme inhibitors.







Abstract
Histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) are responsible for the global silencing of tumour&#8208;suppressor genes. Treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) can reverse this process and restore normal cell function. Herein, we report a small series of boron&#8208;based (boronic acid, boronate ester and closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;carborane) HDAC2 inhibitors with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. The boronate ester 4&#8201;b was the most potent compound assessed in this study (IC50=40.6&#177;1.5&#8197;nM), followed closely by the 1,2&#8208;closo&#8208;carborane (IC50=42.9&#177;1.5&#8197;nM). Compound 4&#8201;b exceeds the potency of the related gold&#8208;standard HDAC pan&#8208;inhibitor vorinostat (1) toward this particular HDAC isoform.

      <title>Helices on Interdomain Interface Couple Catalysis in the ATPPase Domain with Allostery in Plasmodium falciparum GMP Synthetase</title>
      <dc:description>
It takes two to tango: In GMP synthetases, bidirectional domain crosstalk results in allosteric activation of GATase domain and synchronization of active sites. Based on analysis of crystal structures, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and enzyme assays, we have mapped the residues that are essential for various catalytic steps in the ATPPase domain and deciphered the molecular basis of domain crosstalk.







Abstract
GMP synthetase catalyses the conversion of XMP to GMP through a series of reactions that include hydrolysis of Gln to generate ammonia in the glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) domain, activation of XMP to adenyl&#8208;XMP intermediate in the ATP pyrophosphatase (ATPPase) domain and reaction of ammonia with the intermediate to generate GMP. The functioning of GMP synthetases entails bidirectional domain crosstalk, which leads to allosteric activation of the GATase domain, synchronization of catalytic events and tunnelling of ammonia. Herein, we have taken recourse to the analysis of structures of GMP synthetases, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and steady&#8208;state and transient kinetics on the Plasmodium falciparum enzyme to decipher the molecular basis of catalysis in the ATPPase domain and domain crosstalk. Our results suggest an arrangement at the interdomain interface, of helices with residues that play roles in ATPPase catalysis as well as domain crosstalk enabling the coupling of ATPPase catalysis with GATase activation. Overall, the study enhances our understanding of GMP synthetases, which are drug targets in many infectious pathogens.

      <title>Coumarin&#8208;Tagged Dinuclear Trithiolato&#8208;Bridged Ruthenium(II)&#8901;Arene Complexes: Photophysical Properties and Antiparasitic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
The (para)site for treatment: Thirteen coumarin&#8208;diruthenium(II)&#8901;arene conjugates were evaluated against a transgenic T. gondii strain grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). The IC50 values ranged from 105 to 735&#8197;nM, with nine compounds displaying a lower IC50 than the standard drug pyrimethamine. TEM of T. gondii&#8208;infected HFF showed that treatment predominantly affected the parasites&#8217; mitochondrion.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization, photophysical and biological properties of 13 new conjugate coumarin&#8208;diruthenium(II)&#8901;arene complexes against Toxoplasma gondii are presented. For all conjugate organometallic unit/coumarins, an almost complete loss of fluorescence efficacy was observed. However, the nature of the fluorophore, the type of bonding, the presence and length of a linker between the coumarin dye and the ruthenium(II) moiety, and the number of dye units influenced their biological properties. The in&#8197;vitro activity against a transgenic T. gondii strain grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) leads to IC50 values for T. gondii &#946;&#8208;gal from 105 to 735&#8197;nM. Of note is that nine compounds displayed lower IC50 than the standard drug pyrimethamine. One compound applied at its IC50 did not affect B&#8208;cell proliferation but had an impact on T&#8208;cell proliferation in murine splenocyte cultures. Transmission electron microscopy of T. gondii &#946;&#8208;gal&#8208;infected HFF showed that treatment predominantly affected the parasites&#8217; mitochondrion.

      <title>Anthrax Protective Antigen Retargeted with Single&#8208;Chain Variable Fragments Delivers Enzymes to Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;specific cytosolic delivery of proteins is highly challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that mutants of anthrax&#8208;derived protective antigen (mPA) can be expressed as fusions to scFvs for targeted delivery of potent protein therapeutics to the cellular cytosol. Targeting of EGFR or carcinoembryonic antigen with this strategy led to selective delivery to and death of pancreatic cancer cells.







Abstract
The nontoxic, anthrax protective antigen/lethal factor N&#8208;terminal domain (PA/LFN) complex is an effective platform for translocating proteins into the cytosol of cells. Mutant PA (mPA) was recently fused to epidermal growth factor (EGF) to retarget delivery of LFN to cells bearing EGF receptors (EGFR), but the requirement for a known cognate ligand limits the applicability of this approach. Here, we render practical protective antigen retargeting to a variety of receptors with mPA single&#8208;chain variable fragment (scFv) fusion constructs. Our design enables the targeting of two pancreatic cancer&#8208;relevant receptors, EGFR and carcinoembryonic antigen. We demonstrate that fusion to scFvs does not disturb the basic functions of mPA. Moreover, mPA&#8722;scFv fusions enable cell&#8208;specific delivery of diphtheria toxin catalytic domain and Ras/Rap1&#8208;specific endopeptidase to pancreatic cancer cells. Importantly, mPA&#8722;scFv fusion&#8208;based treatments display potent cell&#8208;specific toxicity in&#8197;vitro, opening fundamentally new routes toward engineered immunotoxins and providing a potential solution to the challenge of targeted protein delivery to the cytosol of cancer cells.

      <title>Synthesis of Stable NAD+ Mimics as Inhibitors for the Legionella pneumophila Phosphoribosyl Ubiquitylating Enzyme SdeC</title>
      <dc:description>
Modestly modified: Three stable NAD+ analogues namely, c&#8208;NAD+, S&#8208;NAD+ and BAD were prepared by using an optimized chemoenzymatic procedure and were compared side&#8208;by&#8208;side for enzyme inhibition of Legionella effector enzyme SdeC, which is important in bacterial virulence. Minimal structural variation in the furanose ring or nicotinamide part of NAD+ leads to efficient inhibitors.







Abstract
Stable NAD+ analogues carrying single atom substitutions in either the furanose ring or the nicotinamide part have proven their value as inhibitors for NAD+&#8208;consuming enzymes. To investigate the potential of such compounds to inhibit the adenosine diphosphate ribosyl (ADPr) transferase activity of the Legionella SdeC enzyme, we prepared three NAD+ analogues, namely carbanicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (c&#8208;NAD+), thionicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (S&#8208;NAD+) and benzamide adenosine dinucleotide (BAD). We optimized the chemical synthesis of thionicotinamide riboside and for the first time used an enzymatic approach to convert all three ribosides into the corresponding NAD+ mimics. We thus expanded the known scope of substrates for the NRK1/NMNAT1 enzyme combination by turning all three modified ribosides into NAD+ analogues in a scalable manner. We then compared the three NAD+ mimics side&#8208;by&#8208;side in a single assay for enzyme inhibition on Legionella effector enzyme SdeC. The class of SidE enzymes to which SdeC belongs was recently identified to be important in bacterial virulence, and we found SdeC to be inhibited by S&#8208;NAD+ and BAD with IC50 values of 28 and 39&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

      <title>Bimetallic CuCo2S4 Nanozymes with Enhanced Peroxidase Activity at Neutral pH for Combating Burn Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Cleaning wounds: A bimetallic CuCo2S4 nanozyme exhibits enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like activity at neutral pH, and can convert H2O2 into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals for killing bacteria. The CuCo2S4 nanozyme effectively facilitates the healing of burn wounds infected with drug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
Peroxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes that can generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) hold great promise as antibacterial alternatives. However, most of them display optimal performance under strongly acidic conditions (pH&#8197;3&#8211;4), and are thus not feasible for many medical uses, including burn infections with a wound pH close to neutral. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;based nanozyme (CuCo2S4) that exhibits intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like activity and can convert H2O2 into .OH at neutral pH. In particular, bimetallic CuCo2S4 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like activity and antibacterial capacity, superior to that of the corresponding monometallic CuS and CoS NPs. The CuCo2S4 nanozymes possessed excellent ability to kill various bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Furthermore, this CuCo2S4 nanozymes could effectively disrupt MRSA biofilms in&#8197;vitro and accelerate MRSA&#8208;infected burn healing in&#8197;vivo. This work provides a new peroxidase mimic to combat bacteria in neutral pH milieu and this CuCo2S4 nanozyme could be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of burn infections.

Herein, we report a copper&#8208;based nanozyme (CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that exhibits intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like activity and can convert H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH at neutral pH. In particular, bimetallic CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like activity and antibacterial capacity, superior to that of the corresponding monometallic CuS and CoS NPs. The CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanozymes possessed excellent ability to kill various bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus &lt;/i&gt; (MRSA). Furthermore, this CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanozymes could effectively disrupt MRSA biofilms in&#8197;vitro and accelerate MRSA&#8208;infected burn healing in&#8197;vivo. This work provides a new peroxidase mimic to combat bacteria in neutral pH milieu and this CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme could be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of burn infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterization of Membrane Protein&#8208;Lipid Interactions in Unfolded OmpX with Enhanced Time Resolution by Hyperpolarized NMR</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting hyper: Hyperpolarization of lipids by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization results in large signals that are transferred to an unfolded membrane protein in micelles. Measured cross&#8208;relaxation rates indicate the interactions between the different functional groups in the lipid and the protein under refolding conditions, accessible at a short timescale.







Abstract
Proton nuclear spins of dodecyl phosphocholine molecules below the critical micelle concentration are hyperpolarized by using dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (D&#8208;DNP). NMR signal enhancements of 1210&#177;400 and 1610&#177;550 are obtained at 9.4 T, for choline methyls in the head group of the lipid and for the tail&#8208;end methyl group, respectively. This polarization is transferred to the unfolded protein through the nuclear Overhauser effect, after dilution to a final denaturant concentration of 0.8&#8197;M urea. As a result, the amide and aromatic side&#8208;chain signals of the protein are increased up to sixfold. Selective inversion pulses applied either on the head&#8208;group or tail&#8208;group of the lipid are used to identify the source of the transferred polarization. The normalized cross&#8208;relaxation rates of &#963;N,tail=&#8722;1.8&#177;0.1&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;M&#8722;1 and &#963;N,head=&#8722;0.5&#177;0.3&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;M&#8722;1 are obtained, showing a larger polarization transfer from the tail groups. These cross&#8208;relaxation rates are determined at a low urea concentration, which constitutes refolding conditions for the protein. The sensitivity enhancement by D&#8208;DNP permits to access these conditions with a measurement time on the order of seconds, and may further open the possibility to investigate structural changes in membrane proteins during folding.

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Plant&#8208;Endophyte Interactions as a Roadmap to Understanding Small&#8208;Molecule Communication in Marine Microbiomes</title>
      <dc:description>
Talking to your host: Small&#8208;molecule signaling is crucial for the maintenance of host&#8208;microbe symbioses. Although interkingdom signaling has been studied in plants, much less is known about the nature of this communication in higher organisms, including humans. Marine organisms offer an opportunity to bridge the research gap between plants and mammals.







Abstract
Probing the composition of the microbiome and its association with health and disease states is more accessible than ever due to the rise of affordable sequencing technology. Despite advances in our ability to identify members of symbiont communities, untangling the chemical signaling that they use to communicate with host organisms remains challenging. In order to gain a greater mechanistic understanding of how the microbiome impacts health, and how chemical ecology can be leveraged to advance small&#8208;molecule drug discovery from microorganisms, the principals governing communication between host and symbiont must be elucidated. Herein, we review common modes of interkingdom small&#8208;molecule communication in terrestrial and marine environments, describe the differences between these environments, and detail the advantages and disadvantages for studies focused on the marine environment. Finally, we propose the use of plant&#8208;endophyte interactions as a stepping stone to a greater understanding of similar interactions in marine invertebrates, and ultimately in humans.

      <title>Zinc Deficiency Leads to Lipid Changes in Drosophila Brain Similar to Cognitive&#8208;Impairing Drugs: An Imaging Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
      <dc:description>
No zinc, no think: Using mass spectrometric imaging, we examined how dietary zinc chelation can alter lipid composition and lipid abundance in the central brain of Drosophila. The increased PC and PI levels and the decreased PE level induced by zinc deficiency resemble the effects of several cognitive&#8208;impairing drugs, including cocaine and ketamine.







Abstract
Several diseases and disorders have been suggested to be associated with zinc deficiency, especially learning and memory impairment. To have better understanding about the connection between lipid changes and cognitive impairments, we investigated the effects of a zinc&#8208;chelated diet on certain brain lipids of Drosophila melanogaster by using time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). The data revealed that there are increases in the levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol in the central brains of the zinc&#8208;deficient flies compared to the control flies. In contrast, the abundance of phosphatidylethanolamine in the brains of the zinc&#8208;deficient flies is lower. These data are consistent with that of cognitive&#8208;diminishing drugs, thus providing insight into the biological and molecular effects of zinc deficiency on the major brain lipids and opening a new treatment target for cognitive deficit in zinc deficiency.

      <dc:description>Spectral resolution is key to unleash the structural and dynamic information contained in NMR spectra. Fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) has recently revolutionized the spectroscopy of biomolecular solids. We here report a further remarkable resolution improvement in the spectra of four fully protonated proteins and a small drug molecule, by pushing the MAS rotation frequency even higher, to 150 kHz, than the more routinely used 100 kHz.

We conclude that even faster MAS is highly attractive and increases mass sensitivity at a moderate price in overall sensitivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic Stabilization of DNA Assembly Using Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide</title>
      <dc:description>We used N&#8208;methylpyrrole (Py)&#8208;N&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;(Im) polyamide as an exogenous agent to modulate the formation of DNA assemblies at specific double&#8208;stranded sequences. The concept was demonstrated on the hybridization chain reaction which forms linear DNA assembly. Through a series of melting curve analysis, we demonstrated that the binding of Py&#8208;Im polyamide positively influenced both the HCR initiation and elongation steps. In particular, Py&#8208;Im polyamide was found to drastically stabilize DNA duplex such that its thermal stability approached that of an equivalent hairpin structure. Also, it served as an anchor between hairpin pairs in the HCR assembly to improve the originally weak inter&#8208;strand stability. We hope that these proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results can inspire future use of Py&#8208;Im polyamide as a molecular tool to modulate the formation of DNA assemblies.</dc:description>
