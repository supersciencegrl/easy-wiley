         <title>The Multifunctional Preprotein Binding Domain of SecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SecA protein has evolved to perform multiple tasks. Its Preprotein Binding Domain (PBD) is a key module, adopting three conformational states. The PBD's inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;protomeric interactions, along with biophysical data, reveal the influence of these states on the translocation process. Key elements provide stabilization and promote the activation of the ATPase motor, described as the Prl phenotype.







Abstract
Sec&#8208;pathway is the main protein secretion pathway in prokaryotes and is essential for their survival. The motor protein SecA is the main coordinator of the pathway in bacteria as it is has evolved to perform multiple tasks, acting like a &#8220;swiss army knife&#8221;, from binding pre&#8208;proteins to altering its oligomeric and conformational states. This study focuses on the role of its Preprotein Binding Domain (PBD), which is a key protein module that identified in three conformational states (Wide&#8208;Open (WO), Open (O) and Closed (C)). A thorough analysis was conducted to identify PBD's inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;protomeric interactions, highlighting the most significant and conserved ones. Both crystallographic and biophysical data indicate that the WO state is the main during dimerization, while the monomeric structure can adopt all three states. C&#8208;tail, StemPBD and 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD are important elements for the stabilization of different oligomeric and conformational states, as they offer specific interactions. Alterations in the lipophilicity of the StemPBD causes increased proteins dynamics or/and Prl phenotype. In the C state, 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD interacts and opens the ATPase motor. We hypothesize that this partial opening of the motor with the increased dynamics describes the Prl phenotype.

         <title>DNA Hydrogels for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews recent advancements in DNA hydrogels for cancer theranostic applications. We aim to offer insights and inspiration for developing novel and effective methods for cancer diagnosis and therapy using DNA hydrogels.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, because of their precise pairing and simple composition, have emerged as excellent materials for the formation of gels. The application of DNA hydrogels in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer has expanded significantly through research on the properties and functions of nucleic acids. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs) such as aptamers, Small interfering RNA (siRNA), and DNAzymes have been incorporated into DNA hydrogels to enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. This review discusses various methods for forming DNA hydrogels, with a focus on pure DNA hydrogels. We then explore the innovative applications of DNA hydrogels in cancer diagnosis and therapy. DNA hydrogels have become essential biomedical materials, and this review provides an overview of current research findings and the status of DNA hydrogels in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, while also exploring future research directions.

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complex with Substituted Benzimidazole: pH Directed Organelle&#8208;Specific Localization Within Lysosome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four mononuclear iridium(III) complexes with two isomeric pairs of bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands were synthesized along with their detailed electrochemical, photophysical and pH dependent emission spectral study. The emission sensing of acid&#8208;base, ammonia and biogenic amines are reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome with great precision.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and pH dependent emission spectral behaviour of four emissive iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) with two isomeric pairs of bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands. The imidazolyl hydrogen(N&#8722;H) has been replaced by phenyl groups (N&#8722;Ph) in two ligands to understand the impact of hydrogen bonding on the photophysical properties of the complexes and it indeed plays interesting role in the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics. The pH dependent electronic spectral change is observed for two of the complexes. The enhancement of emission intensity is observed at different wavelength for pH&lt;7 and pH&gt;7 for Ir1 and Ir3. The emission sensing of biogenic amines with pka values ranging from 5.80&#8211;9.74 is reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome (pH=4.5&#8211;5) and thus image this organelle with great precision. The detail electronic spectra and electrochemical behaviour were reported here along with TDDFT results.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Noncanonical Substrate Library for Protease Profiling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded noncanonical peptide library is conjugated with a biotin molecule at its N&#8208;terminus for immobilization on a solid support. Upon protease hydrolysis, the substrate peptides are hydrolyzed, and the attached DNA tags are released to identify the sequences of the peptides. This technology is useful for discovering protease substrate preferences.







Abstract
Profiling the substrate sequence preferences of proteases is important for understanding both biological functions as well as for designing protease inhibitors. Several methods are available for profiling the sequence specificity of proteases. However, there is currently no rapid and high&#8208;throughput method to profile specificity of proteases for noncanonical substrates. In this study, we described a strategy to use a DNA&#8208;encoded noncanonical substrate library to identify the protease substrates composed of both canonical and noncanonical amino acids. This approach uses a DNA&#8208;encoded peptide library and introduces a biotin molecule at the N&#8208;terminus to immobilize the library on a solid support. Upon protease hydrolysis, the released DNA tag of the substrate peptides can be sequenced to identify the substrate structures. Using this approach, we profiled trypsin and fibroblast activation protein &#945; and discovered noncanonical substrates that were more efficiently cleaved than the commonly used substrates. The identified substrates of FAP were further used to design corresponding covalent inhibitors containing non&#8208;canonical sequences with high potency for the target protease. Overall, our approach can aid in the development of new protease substrates and inhibitors.

The above article, published online on 5 July 2022 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the journal Editor&#8208;in&#8208;Chief, Ruben Ragg; and Wiley&#8208;VCH GmbH. The retraction has been agreed following a thorough peer review process conducted by the author's institution, Penn State. The editors&#8217; own independent investigation confirmed that density map for the p53 dimer does not align well with the model for Figures&#8197;2B and S3&#8197;A. Furthermore, it was found that the coordinate and map files associated with the article available in the Protein Data Bank [PDB accession codes 8F2I (p53 monomer), 8F2H (p53 dimer)] and Electron Microscopy Data Bank [EMDB accession codes EMD28817 (p53 monomer), EMD28816 (p53 dimer)] exhibit poor alignment throughout. In addition, the authors did not provide original research data, maps and models in question, to justify the findings. The editors&#8217; own independent investigation confirmed that the conclusions of this manuscript are not sufficiently supported. Author D. F. Kelly responded to our notice of retraction, but did not state their agreement nor disagreement. Author G. M. Jonaid agrees with the retraction. All other authors did not respond to our notice regarding the retraction.

         <title>Untangling the Complexity and Impact of Tau Protein Ubiquitination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tau is a neuronal protein that aggregates under pathological conditions. This concept article highlights recent advances in understanding how ubiquitination of tau plays a role in both physiological and pathological conditions. We focus on enzymatic and semi&#8208;synthetic conjugation, aggregation, conformational transitions, and clearance mechanisms.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered protein highly expressed in neuronal axons. In healthy neurons, tau regulates microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth. However, pathological conditions can trigger aberrant tau aggregation into insoluble filaments, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau undergoes diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs), suggesting complex regulation and potentially varied functions. Among PTMs, the role and mechanisms of ubiquitination in physiology and disease have remained enigmatic. The past three decades have witnessed the emergence of key studies on tau protein ubiquitination. In this concept, we discuss how these investigations have begun to shed light on the ubiquitination patterns of physiological and pathological tau, the responsible enzymatic machinery, and the influence of ubiquitination on tau aggregation. We also provide an overview of the semi&#8208;synthetic methods that have enabled in&#8197;vitro investigations of conformational transitions of tau induced by ubiquitin modification. Finally, we discuss future perspectives in the field necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tau ubiquitination and clearance.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;like Aggregation Propensities of Metabolites&#8208; Homogentisic Acid, N&#8208;Acetyl Aspartic Acid and Isovaleric Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of metabolites which gets accumulated in rare inborn errors of metabolisms namely alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia were studied. The results presented strongly suggest their aggregation may follow an amyloidogenic pathway.







Abstract
The transformation of metabolites into amyloidogenic aggregates represent an intriguing dimension in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders, including alkaptonuria, canavan disease, and isovaleric acidemia. Central to this phenomenon are the metabolites homogentisic acid (HA), N&#8208;acetyl aspartic acid (NAA), and isovaleric acid (IVA), which we found, weave an intricate network of self&#8208;assembled structures. Leveraging an array of microscopy techniques, we traced the morphological behavior of these assemblies that exhibit concentration and time&#8208;dependent morphological transitions from isolated globules to clustered aggregates. MD simulation studies suggest significant role of hydrogen bonding interactions in the aggregation process. While displaying strong amyloidogenic propensity in solution, these aged aggregates were significantly cytotoxic to mouse neural N2a cell lines. In vivo effect in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode further validated cytotoxicity of aggregates. Our findings provide fresh insights to amyloidogenic nature of HA, NAA, and IVA aggregates and their possible role in associated metabolic disorders such as alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia.

         <title>The Structural Diversity of Encapsulin Protein Shells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulin nanocompartments are one of the most diverse and widespread classes of prokaryotic protein compartments. This review focuses on the structural diversity of encapsulins with a focus on shell structure, pore properties, and domain insertions and fusions found within the encapsulin shell protein.







Abstract
Subcellular compartmentalization is a universal feature of all cells. Spatially distinct compartments, be they lipid&#8208; or protein&#8208;based, enable cells to optimize local reaction environments, store nutrients, and sequester toxic processes. Prokaryotes generally lack intracellular membrane systems and usually rely on protein&#8208;based compartments and organelles to regulate and optimize their metabolism. Encapsulins are one of the most diverse and widespread classes of prokaryotic protein compartments. They self&#8208;assemble into icosahedral protein shells and are able to specifically internalize dedicated cargo enzymes. This review discusses the structural diversity of encapsulin protein shells, focusing on shell assembly, symmetry, and dynamics. The properties and functions of pores found within encapsulin shells will also be discussed. In addition, fusion and insertion domains embedded within encapsulin shell protomers will be highlighted. Finally, future research directions for basic encapsulin biology, with a focus on the structural understand of encapsulins, are briefly outlined.

         <title>A Thermostable Heme Protein Fold Adapted for Stereoselective C&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation Using Peroxygenase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber as a source of a thermostable protein fold for biocatalyst design. By modifying the I&#8208;helix, we have transformed it into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE) that enantioselectively oxidises &#946;&#8208;ionone into (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ionone with 94&#8201;% e.e. The enzyme exhibited high stability, resisting 20&#8197;mM H2O2 and 20&#8201;% organic solvent, withstanding 60&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;hour and 30&#8201;&#176;C for 365&#8197;days, and supported over 1700 turnovers.







Abstract
Thermostable protein folds of natural and synthetic origin are highly sought&#8208;after templates for biocatalyst generation due to their enhanced stability to elevated temperatures which overcomes one of the major limitations of applying enzymes for synthesis. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are a family of heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases that catalyse the oxidation of their substrates in a highly stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner. The CYP enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber binds the norisoprenoid &#946;&#8208;ionone and was employed as a scaffold for catalyst design. The I&#8208;helix was modified to convert this enzyme from a monooxygenase into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE), enabling the enantioselective oxidation of &#946;&#8208;ionone to (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ionone (94&#8201;% e.e.). The enzyme was resistant to 20&#8197;mM H2O2, 20&#8201;% (v/v) of organic solvent, supported over 1700 turnovers and was fully functional after incubation at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h and 30&#8201;&#176;C for 365&#8197;days. The reaction was scaled&#8208;up to generate multi milligram quantities of the product for characterisation. Overall, we demonstrate that sourcing a CYP protein fold from an extremophile enabled the design of a highly stable enzyme for stereoselective C&#8722;H bond activation only using H2O2 as the oxidant, providing a viable strategy for future biocatalyst design.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzymatic Cascade for Toxicant Degradation and Sugar Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot biocatalytic cascade for sugar acid production not only breaks down hazardous chemicals and generates benzoquinone but also enhances antioxidant activity and water uptake in hydrogels. This is achieved through the coordinated action of multiple enzymes, including organophosphate hydrolase (OPD), HadA monooxygenase (HadA), thermostable flavin reductase (C1&#8208;A58P), Bacillus simplex formate dehydrogenase (BsFDH), and pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH).







Abstract
This study introduces a novel one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade approach for converting toxicants and continuously generating an electron acceptor for production of sugar acids. This method offers a promising solution to concerns about pesticide toxicity and environmental contamination by transforming hazardous substances into a useful electron acceptor. This acceptor is then utilized to produce valuable chemicals with broad industrial applications, particularly in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. The cascade reaction employs organophosphate hydrolase (OPD) to convert pesticides into 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP), which is subsequently transformed into 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone by HadA monooxygenase (HadA). 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone serves as an electron acceptor in the catalysis of sugar acid formation via pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH). The results indicate that this cascade reaction effectively converts lactose to lactobionic acid and xylose to 2&#8208;keto&#8208;xylonic acid. The latter can be further processed into xylonic acid through NaBH4 reduction. Notably, the one&#8208;pot reaction yields up to 10&#8201;% higher compared to the direct addition of 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. The synthesized xylonic acid exhibits exceptional water uptake properties in hydrogels, and the synthesized lactobionic acid shows antioxidant activity comparable to well&#8208;established antioxidants. These findings demonstrate the technological viability of these reaction cascades for various applications.

         <title>Discovery of 18F Labeled AZD5213 Derivatives as Novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Radioligands Targeting Histamine Subtype&#8208;3 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design and radiosynthesis of two H3 radioligands for PET imaging, namely, [18F]1 and [18F]2. Both radioligands exhibited high radio yields and stability in rodents, NHPs, and human serums. ARG and PET studies revealed that [18F]1 and [18F]2 have moderate uptake in rodent brains but no blocking effects by the pretreatment of unlabeled compounds 1 and 2.







Abstract
The histamine subtype 3 (H3) receptor is an important drug target in the central nervous system (CNS), and PET imaging offers a promising technique for the noninvasive evaluation of CNS disease related to the H3 receptor. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated the binding effects of [18F]H3&#8211;2404 and [18F]H3&#8211;2405 by modifying the structure of AZD5213, a selective H3 antagonist. These two radioligands were prepared in high radiochemical yields and displayed stability in serum. The in&#8197;vitro autoradiographic study in rat brain tissue and the following in&#8197;vivo PET studies in mice demonstrated sufficient brain uptake but predominantly non&#8208;specific distribution in rodent brain. Although these data suggest that [18F]H3&#8211;2404 and [18F]H3&#8211;2405 are unsuitable as PET tracers for brain imaging of the H3 receptor, this study provides a valuable attempt for optimizing 18F labeled radiotracers based on AZD5213.

         <title>Hydrophobic Domain Modulation of Chemical Responsiveness in a Bolaamphiphile&#8208;Based Supramolecular Monomer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils modulation of the hydrophobic domain length on the supramolecular polymerization and degradation of self&#8208;immolative squaramide&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles. Spacers less than eight methylenes yield spherical nanostructures, while above polymerize into supramolecular filaments degradable by glutathione through cyclization&#8208;elimination of the self&#8208;immolative spacer with distinct kinetics ranging from hours to days.







Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative chemistries that respond in an irreversible manner to external stimuli are highly attractive to permanently degrade filamentous supramolecular biomaterials. Within the monomer, a balance needs to be struck between its capacity to be supramolecularly polymerized and degraded at an appropriate rate for a given application. Herein, we unravel the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships of a library of squaramide&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles bearing a central disulfide&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative spacer to construct supramolecular polymers responsive to chemical stimuli in aqueous solutions. We examine the impact of changing the alkyl domain length (2 to 12 methylene units) on the formation of supramolecular filaments and their rate of degradation in response to a biological antioxidant, glutathione. A minimum of an octyl spacer is required to robustly form supramolecular polymers that can be irreversibly degraded through a cyclization&#8208;elimination reaction of the self&#8208;immolative spacer triggered by thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. Further increasing the peripheral alkyl chain length to a decyl spacer increases the ordered packing of the amphiphiles, hindering their chemical degradation. This study provides a framework to design chemically responsive filamentous supramolecular polymers based on bolaamphiphiles that can be irreversibly degraded in aqueous solutions for their eventual application as biomedical materials.

         <title>Optogenetic Tools for Regulating RNA Metabolism and Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely review of various current chemical and genetically encodable strategies to photocontrol the transcription, splicing, post&#8208;transcriptional modification, translation, degradation, and phase separation properties and functions of cellular RNA molecules.







Abstract
RNA molecules play a vital role in linking genetic information with various cellular processes. In recent years, a variety of optogenetic tools have been engineered for regulating cellular RNA metabolism and functions. These highly desirable tools can offer non&#8208;intrusive control with spatial precision, remote operation, and biocompatibility. Here, we would like to review these currently available approaches that can regulate RNAs with light: from non&#8208;genetically encodable chemically modified oligonucleotides to genetically encoded RNA aptamers that recognize photosensitive small&#8208;molecule or protein ligands. Some key applications of these optogenetic tools will also be highlighted to illustrate how they have been used for regulating all aspects of the RNA life cycle: from RNA synthesis, maturation, modification, and translation to their degradation, localization, and phase separation control. Some current challenges and potential practical utilizations of these RNA optogenetic tools will also be discussed.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cyclization by Vanadium Chloroperoxidase for Synthesis of 4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones belong to the class of the secondary metabolite 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins. They exhibit a wide range of biological activities. These compounds can be synthesized through halocyclization using hypervalent iodine species or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, followed by hydrolysis. Nonetheless, the reactions required specific conditions and generated toxic byproducts. In this study, Curvularia inaequalis vanadium chloroperoxidase (CiVCPO) catalyzed the chemoenzymatic cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids with different electron&#8208;donating groups (1a&#8208;1e) to produce good yields of 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones (3a&#8208;3e) by adding KBr and H2O2 in citrate buffer (pH 5). The reaction mixture contained 30% DMSO to improve substrate solubility without enzyme activity loss. The condition is more environmentally friendly than chemical methods. Therefore, it offers an alternative approach for synthesizing 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct Effects of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein Segments on Structural Stability, Amyloidogenic Potential, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloidosis is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins, called amyloid fibrils, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. Recent studies on the amyloidogenesis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8209;2 protein segments have raised concerns on their potential link to post&#8208;infection neurodegeneration, however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the structure, stability, and amyloidogenic propensity of a nine&#8208;residue segment (SK9) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein and their impact on neuronal protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) aggregation. Specifically, the amino acid sequence of the SK9 wildtype has been modified from a basic and positively charged peptide (SFYVYSRVK), to a nearly neutral and more hydrophobic peptide (SAAVASAVK, labelled as SK9 var1), and to an acidic and positively charged peptide (SFYVYSRVK, labelled as SK9 var2). Our findings reveal that the SK9 wildtype exhibited a pronounced amyloidogenic propensity due to its disordered and unstable nature, while the SK9 variants possessed more ordered and stable structures preventing the amyloid formation. Significantly, the SK9 wildtype demonstrated distinct effect on &#945;Syn aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology to facilitate the formation of &#945;Syn aggregates with enhanced resistance against enzymatic degradation. This study highlights the potential of modifying short peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune their properties, providing insights into understanding and regulating viral&#8208;induced amyloid aggregations.</dc:description>

         <title>Previously Published Phosphatase Probes have Limited Utility Due to their Unspecific Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study evaluates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) probes targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases, including three direct electrophiles and three quinone methide&#8208;based traps. Despite previously reported success in purified enzyme assays, all probes show unspecific labelling or non&#8208;activity&#8208;based behaviour. Quinone methide&#8208;based traps also cause &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, limiting their potential for ABPP and inhibitor development in phosphatase research.







Abstract
This study explores the use of activity&#8208;based protein profiling to study protein tyrosine phosphatases. With the discovery of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors, this enzyme family has resurfaced as interesting drug targets. Therefore, we envisioned that previously described direct electrophiles and quinone methide&#8208;based traps targeting phosphatases could be applied in competitive activity&#8208;based protein profiling assays. This study evaluates three direct electrophiles, specifically, a vinyl sulfonate, a vinyl sulfone, and an &#945;&#8208;bromobenzylphosphonate as well as three quinone methide&#8208;based traps as activity&#8208;based probes. For all these moieties it was previously shown that they could selectively engage in assays with purified or overexpressed phosphatases in bacterial lysates. However, this study demonstrates that probes based on these moieties all suffer from unspecific labelling. Direct electrophiles were either unspecific or not activity&#8208;based, while quinone methide&#8208;based traps showed dependence on phosphatase activity but also resulted in unspecific labelling due to diffusion after activation. This phenomenon, termed &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, occurred even with catalytically inactive SHP2 mutants. We concluded that alternative strategies or chemistries are needed to apply activity&#8208;based protein profiling in phosphatase research. Moreover, this study shows that quinone methide&#8208;based designs have limited potential in probe and inhibitor development strategies due to their intrinsic reactivity.

         <title>Enhancing Cellular and Enzymatic Properties Through In Vivo Continuous Evolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous evolution, as a powerful tool in evolutionary engineering, is discussed in this article based on non&#8208;targeted, targeted and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation. The aim is to provide researchers with guidance for selecting appropriate evolutionary tools and to offer insights for the development of future continuous evolution.







Abstract
Directed evolution seeks to evolve target genes at a rate far exceeding the natural mutation rate, thereby endowing cellular and enzymatic properties with desired traits. In vivo continuous directed evolution achieves these purposes by generating libraries within living cells, enabling a continuous cycle of mutant generation and selection, enhancing the exploration of gene variants. Continuous evolution has become powerful tools for unraveling evolution mechanism and improving cellular and enzymatic properties. This review categorizes current continuous evolution into three distinct classes: non&#8208;targeted chromosomal, targeted chromosomal, and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation approaches. It also compares various continuous evolution strategies based on different principles, providing a reference for selecting suitable methods for specific evolutionary goals. Furthermore, this review discusses the two primary limitations for further widespread application of in&#8197;vivo continuous evolution, which are lack of general applicability and insufficient mutagenic capability. We envision that developing generally applicable mutagenic components and methods to enhance mutation rates for in&#8197;vivo continuous evolution are promising future directions for wide range applications of continuous evolution.

         <title>Synthesis of Substituted Acyclic and Cyclic N&#8208;Alkylhydrazines by Enzymatic Reductive Hydrazinations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine reductases (IREDs) offer promising synthesis routes for chiral amines. We have demonstrated reductive amination of diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines, catalyzed by Myxococcus stipitatus IRED. Incorporating a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system showcases the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlighting IREDs&#8217; biocatalytic potential.







Abstract
Imine reductases (IREDs) provide promising opportunities for the synthesis of various chiral amines. Initially, asymmetric imine reduction was reported, followed by reductive aminations of aldehydes and ketones via imines. Herein we present the reductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), catalyzed by the IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus. In analogy to IRED&#8208;catalyzed reductive aminations, various carbonyls and dicarbonyls could react with simple hydrazines to produce substituted acyclic and cyclic N&#8208;alkylhydrazines. By incorporating and scaling up a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system, we demonstrated the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of an H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlightling the potential of IREDs in biocatalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of a 13C/2H Labeled Building Block to Probe the Phosphotyrosine Interactome Using Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protected 13C/2H&#8208;labeled phosphotyrosine (pTyr) building block was synthesized from commercially available isotope sources for use in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The resulting isolated &#1013;&#8208;aromatic 13C&#8208;1H correlations provide valuable data for studying interactions with pTyr&#8208;binding proteins at atomic resolution using NMR spectroscopy techniques. As an initial demonstration, intermolecular NOE and chemical shift perturbation data were recorded to visualize the binding of a pTyr&#8208;containing peptide, derived from the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor to the PLC&#947;&#8208;1 SH2 domain.







Abstract
Phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition coordinates the assembly of protein complexes, thus controlling key events of cell cycle, cell development and programmed cell death. Although many aspects of membrane receptor function and intracellular signal transduction have been deciphered in the last decades, the details of how phosphorylation alters protein&#8208;protein interaction and creates regulating switches of protein activity and localization often remains unclear. We developed a synthetic route to a protected phophotyrosine building block with isolated 13C&#8208;1H spins in the aromatic ring. The compound can be used for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and readily applied to study affinity, dynamics and interactions on an atomic level using NMR spectroscopy. As a first example, we prepared an isotopologue of a pTyr containing 12mer peptide (pY1021) as part of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor to analyze the binding to the phospholipase C&#8208;&#947; (PLC&#947;&#8208;1) SH2 domain.

&lt;p&gt;A protected &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-labeled phosphotyrosine (pTyr) building block was synthesized from commercially available isotope sources for use in solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The resulting isolated &#1013;-aromatic &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H correlations provide valuable data for studying interactions with pTyr-binding proteins at atomic resolution using NMR spectroscopy techniques. As an initial demonstration, intermolecular NOE and chemical shift perturbation data were recorded to visualize the binding of a pTyr-containing peptide, derived from the platelet-derived growth factor to the PLC&#947;-1 SH2 domain.

         <dc:description>Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) can be used to suppress specific RNA in cells and thus have been explored for gene therapy. Despite extensive effort, there is no clinically significant OGT for treating cancer. Low efficiency of OGT is one of the problems.

         <title>Targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Proteins: In Silico Investigation with Polypyridyl&#8208;Based Zn(II)&#8208;Curcumin Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents molecular docking studies for insight into the inhibition potential of polypyridyl Zn(II) curcumin complexes against four viral proteins, i.&#8201;e., spike protein (S), Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme II Receptor protein (ACE2), nucleocapsid protein (N), main protease protein (Mpro), and RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase protein (RdRp) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.







Abstract
Herein, we have selected eight Zn(II)&#8208;based complexes viz., [Zn(bpy)(acac)Cl] (1), [Zn(phen)(acac)Cl] (2), [Zn(dppz)(acac)Cl] (3), [Zn(dppn)(acac)Cl] (4), [Zn(bpy)(cur)Cl] (5), [Zn(phen)(cur)Cl] (6), [Zn(dppz)(cur)Cl] (7), [Zn(dppn)(cur)Cl] (8), where bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, dppz=benzo[i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine, dppn=naphtho[2,3&#8208;i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine, acac=acetylacetonate, cur=curcumin and performed in silico molecular docking studies with the viral proteins, i.&#8201;e., spike protein (S), Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme II Receptor protein (ACE2), nucleocapsid protein (N), main protease protein (Mpro), and RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase protein (RdRp) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The binding energy calculations, visualization of the docking orientation, and analysis of the interactions revealed that these complexes could be potential inhibitors of the viral proteins. Among complexes 1&#8211;8, complex 6 showed the strongest binding affinity with S and ACE2 proteins. 4 exerted better binding affinity in the case of the N protein, whereas 8 presented the highest binding affinities with Mpro and RdRp among all the complexes. Overall, the study indicated that Zn(II) complexes have the potential as alternative and viable therapeutic solutions for COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Discovery of Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;Biosidases and a Novel N&#8208;Acetyllactosaminidase Activity in the CAZy Family GH20: Functional Diversity and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report several new lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biosidases (LNBases) and the first report of N&#8208;acetyllactosaminidase (LacNAcase) activity in CAZy family GH20, i.&#8201;e. enzymes that catalyze the release heterodisaccharides from human milk oligosaccharides and related glycans. New crystal structures comparing a specific LNBase to an enzyme with dual LacNAcase/LNBase activity reveal a highly conserved subsite &#8722;1, common to GH20 enzymes, and high variation in subsite &#8722;2.







Abstract
The glycoside hydrolase family 20 (GH20) predominantly features N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52), with only few known lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biosidases (EC 3.2.1.140; LNBases). LNBases catalyze the degradation of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose (LNT), a prominent component of human milk oligosaccharides, thereby supporting a healthy infant gut microbiome development. We investigated GH20 diversity to discover novel enzymes that release disaccharides such as lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose (LNB). Our approach combined peptide clustering, sequence analysis, and 3D structure model evaluation to assess active site topologies, focusing on the presence of a subsite &#8722;2. Five LNBases were active on pNP&#8208;LNB and four showed activity on LNT. One enzyme displayed activity on both pNP&#8208;LacNAc and pNP&#8208;LNB, establishing the first report of N&#8208;acetyllactosaminidase (LacNAcase) activity. Exploration of this enzyme cluster led to the identification of four additional enzymes sharing this dual substrate specificity. Comparing the determined crystal structure of a specific LNBase (TrpyGH20) and the first crystal structure of an enzyme with dual LacNAcase/LNBase activity (TrdeGH20) revealed a highly conserved subsite &#8722;1, common to GH20 enzymes, while the &#8722;2 subsites varied significantly. TrdeGH20 had a wider subsite &#8722;2, accommodating Gal with both &#946;1,4&#8208; and &#946;1,3&#8208;linkages to the GlcNAc in subsite &#8722;1. Biotechnological applications of these enzymes may include structural elucidation of complex carbohydrates and glycoengineering.

         <title>HPPE Activates NRF2 Signaling by Liberating Heavy Metal Stores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported BACH1 inhibitor HPPE is found to drive an antioxidant gene program independently of BACH1. Instead, BACH1 is characterized here to activate NRF2 by acting as an ionophore, liberating heavy metals and inducing non&#8208;lethal levels of reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
The Cap'n'collar transcription factor BACH1 represses the transcription of gene products involved in oxidative stress protection. Accordingly, agents capable of inhibiting the activity of BACH1 would be of keen interest in treating several autoimmune and age&#8208;related diseases. Here, we report that a previously annotated BACH1 inhibitor, HPPE, does not inhibit BACH1 but instead activates a NRF2 driven transcription program that is dependent on the canonical cysteine sensors of NRF2 inhibitory protein KEAP1. Mechanistically, HPPE acts as an ionophore, liberating cellular Zn2+ stores and inducing non&#8208;lethal levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in KEAP1 inactivation. These data provide a surprising mechanism by which HPPE acts in cells and suggest that inducing small amounts of cellular stress may be a viable mechanism for activating NRF2 therapeutically.

         <title>Recombinant Production of The Cyclotide Kalata B1 by Conditional Split Inteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A workflow to generate cyclic peptides from easily obtainable precursor proteins was established. The peptide is embedded in a split intein system that can be expressed in E. coli and purified via IMAC. Simply mixing the two precursor proteins starts conversion at will, yielding cyclic peptides. The intein&#8208;made cyclic peptide kalata B1 is structurally and functionally identical to synthetic/native preparations.







Abstract
This study describes the design, production, and characterization of a novel conditional intein system for the recombinant production of cyclic peptides. The system is based on two key features: (1) a promiscuous extein recognition site allowing cyclization of virtually any peptide, and (2) a secondary split site within the intein itself enabling triggered splicing at will. Two intein precursors were recombinantly expressed, purified, and then self&#8208;assembled in&#8197;vitro to cyclize the model peptide kalata B1 (kB1). Cyclized kB1 was successfully purified, refolded, and characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR, demonstrating correct disulfide bond formation and identical structure to synthetic kB1. Importantly, the intein&#8208;derived kB1 retained full biological activity as evidenced by insect cell toxicity assays. This work establishes a versatile and efficient approach for intein&#8208;mediated protein cyclization with potential applications in bioengineering and peptide discovery.

         <title>A Rapid and Sensitive MicroPlate Assay (MPSA) Using an Alkyne&#8208;Modified CMP&#8208;Sialic Acid Donor to Evaluate Human Sialyltransferase Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human sialyltransferases primarily utilize CMP&#8208;Sias, especially transferring Neu5Ac from CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac to various acceptors. Advances in chemical biology have led to the synthesis of novel CMP&#8208;Sia donors suitable for bioorthogonal reactions in cell&#8208;based assays. However, the compatibility of these donors with all human enzymes remains uncertain. We synthesized a non&#8208;natural CMP&#8208;Sia donor with an alkyne modification on the N&#8208;acyl group of Neu5Ac, which was effectively used by human ST6Gal I and ST3Gal I. A sensitive MicroPlate Sialyltransferase Assay (MPSA) was developed and expanded to a panel of 13 human STs acting on glycoproteins. All assayed enzymes tolerated CMP&#8208;SiaNAl, allowing for the determination of kinetic parameters and turnover numbers. This study enhances the biochemical characterization of human sialyltransferases and opens new avenues for developing sialyltransferase inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Support for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Peptidyl&#8208;tRNA Mimics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrolysis&#8208;resistant RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates that mimic peptidyl&#8208;tRNAs are often required for structural and functional studies of protein synthesis at the ribosome. These conjugates can be synthesized by solid&#8208;phase chemical synthesis, which allows maximum flexibility in both the peptide and RNA sequence. The commonly used strategy is based on (3&#8217;&#8208;N&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine solid supports, which already contain the first C&#8208;terminal amino acid of the target peptidyl chain. This is a limitation in the sense that different individual supports must be synthesized for different C&#8208;terminal amino acids. In this study, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by introducing a novel universal support. The key is a free ribose 3&#8217;&#8208;NH2 group that can be coupled to any amino acid. This is made possible by a photocleavable ether moiety that links the ribose 2&#8217;&#8208;O to the support, thus avoiding the typical O&#8208;to&#8208;N migration that occurs when using 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;acyl linked solid supports. Once assembled, the conjugate is readily cleaved by UV irradiation. The structural integrity of the obtained peptidyl&#8208;RNA conjugates was verified by mass spectrometry analysis. In conclusion, the new photocleavable solid support makes the synthesis of 3&#8217;&#8208;peptidyl tRNA mimics of different peptidyl chains significantly more efficient compared to the commonly used approaches.</dc:description>

This study screened the P450BM3 enzyme library to identify the best mutant, BM3&#8208;139&#8208;3, capable of oxidizing the substrate (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene. Structural analysis of compound 1, obtained through separation and purification, revealed it to be a novel compound named (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane. By semi&#8208;rational design, a mutant BM3&#8208;139&#8208;3&#8208;M2 with higher selectivity and turnover numbers (increasing from 587 to 964) for (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane was obtained.







Abstract
(+)&#8208;Bicyclogermacrene is a sesquiterpene compound found in various plant essential oils and serves as a crucial precursor for multiple biologically active compounds. Many derivatives of (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene have been shown to exhibit valuable bioactivities. Cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium can catalyze a variety of substrates and different types of oxidation reactions, making it become a powerful tool for oxidizing terpenes. In this study, we employed P450 BM3&#8208;139&#8208;3 variant for in&#8197;vitro enzymatic oxidation of (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene, identifying a novel oxidized derivative of (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene, named (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane, and an unknown sesquiterpenoid in a ratio of 70&#8201;:&#8201;30 (by GC peak area). (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;Epoxymaaliane showed demonstrated antibacterial activities toward Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. To obtain a better variant of the monooxygenase with a high selectivity to form (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane, we combined alanine scanning with the &#8220;Focused Rational Iterative Site&#8208;Specific Mutagenesis&#8221; (FRISM) strategy to modify the closest residues within 5&#8197;&#197; radius surrounding the substrate to create a small&#8208;but&#8208;smart library of mutants. Consequently, it gave an optimal variant with 1.6&#8208;fold improvement, in a turnover number (TON) of up to 964 toward (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane production with a higher product selectivity.

         <title>Exploring the Lower Limit of Target Concentration in Capture&#8208;SELEX Using Guanine as a Model Target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a lower target concentration may generate aptamers with higher affinities. This paper aims to answer if there is a lower limit in target concentration and discusses the relationship between aptamer enrichment and target concentration.







Abstract
During an aptamer selection, using a lower target concentration may result in aptamers with a higher binding affinity. Consequently, this begs the question of whether there is a lower limit for target concentration. In this work, we conducted three aptamer selections using 5&#8197;&#956;M, 500&#8197;nM and 50&#8197;nM guanine as the targets, respectively. Successful enrichment of the same guanine aptamers was achieved at both 5&#8197;&#956;M and 500&#8197;nM guanine, but not with 50&#8197;nM. Using 5&#8197;&#956;M guanine, the aptamer was enriched in eight rounds of selection, compared to that for 500&#8197;nM, which was accomplished in 17 rounds. We discuss the relation of optimal target concentration to the observed Kd value of the resulting aptamers, of which the highest affinity aptamer had a measured Kd of 200&#8197;nM. Additionally, we investigated the binding of the aptamers through mutation studies, revealing a critical cytosine. Mutating this cytosine to a thymine switched the selectivity from guanine to adenine, which is reminiscent of the guanine riboswitch. This study revealed a limit in using low target concentration, and the insights described in this article will be useful for guiding the choice of target concentration during capture&#8208;SELEX.

         <title>Channel Engineering of a Glutamate Exporter</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through two design strategy to improve MscCG2 efflux ability: widening the channel entrance for smoother entry of glutamate and reducing the electronegativity at the entrance of the channels to minimize the rejection of negatively charged glutamate entry. The designed variants were found to enhance glutamate excretion by 2 to 3.3&#8208;fold in the early phase and 1.1&#8208;fold to 1.5&#8208;fold in the late phase of fermentation.







Abstract
Mechanosensitive channel MscCG2 is involved in glutamate excretion in most C. glutamicum strains. Improving the excretion efficiency of MscCG2 is beneficial to the production of glutamate. In this study, structure&#8208;based rational design was carried out to obtain an improved efflux ability of exporter MscCG2 and its mechanistic advance via two strategies: widening the channel entrance for smoother entry of glutamate and reducing the electronegativity at the entrance of the channels to minimize the rejection of negatively charged glutamate entry. The designed variants were found to enhance glutamate excretion by 2 to 3.3&#8208;fold in the early phase and 1.1&#8208;fold to 1.5&#8208;fold in the late phase of fermentation. The enhanced glutamate excretion was further confirmed by using glutamate toxic analog 4&#8208;fluoroglutamate (4&#8208;FG) and Glu&#8208;Glu peptide uptake and glutamate export assay. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations revealed that the amino acid substitutions indeed enlarged the channel entrance and reduced the repulsion of glutamate when entering the channel. The finding of this study is important for understanding the underlying structure&#8208;function relationship and the mechanism of glutamate secretion to improve glutamate efflux efficiency of glutamate exporter.

         <title>Rewiring Lysine Catabolism in Cancer Leads to Increased Histone Crotonylation and Immune Escape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crotonyl&#8208;CoA, metabolite derived from lysine catabolism, is elevated in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), correlating with tumor growth. Increased production is due to overexpression of specific lysine transporters and glutaryl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). Depletion of GCDH or lysine&#8208;restriction diet upregulates type I interferon signaling (IFN), suppressing tumor growth. This study reveals cancer cells&#8217; metabolic rewiring to evade the immune system.







Abstract
Crotonyl&#8208;CoA (cr&#8208;CoA) is a metabolite derived directly from the catabolism of lysine (Lys) and tryptophan (Trp) or from the &#946;&#8208;oxidation of fatty acids. In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), histone H4 crotonylation levels are significantly elevated, which appears to positively correlate with tumor growth. This increase in crotonyl&#8208;CoA production is attributed to the overexpression of specific Lys transporters on the cell membrane, leading to higher free lysine levels. Additionally, the overexpression of glutaryl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), the enzyme responsible for crotonyl&#8208;CoA production, further contributes to this increase. When GCDH is depleted or under a lysine&#8208;restricted diet, genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) signaling are upregulated, resulting in tumor growth suppression. Type I interferons are a group of cytokines critical for antiviral responses and immunoregulation. This highlights how cancer cells exploit crotonylation to modulate the immune response. This work opens up new avenues for investigating how cancer cells rewire their metabolism to increase crotonylation and evade the immune system.

         <title>Bioactive Microgels with Tunable Microenvironment as a 3D Platform to Guide the Complex Physiology of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Spheroids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flow&#8208;focusing microfluidic device is used to generate spherical microgels consisting of gelatin and hyaluronic acid (HA) encapsulated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (HepG2 or Hep3B). The spheroid growth and differentiation state of HCC as well as the response to chemotherapeutic screening are remarkably influenced by the mechanical stiffness and the presence of HA of the microgels.







Abstract
Miniaturized three&#8208;dimensional tissue models, such as spheroids, have become a highly useful and efficient platform to investigate tumor physiology and explore the effect of chemotherapeutic efficacy over traditional two&#8208;dimensional monolayer culture, since they can provide more in&#8208;depth analysis, especially in regards to intercellular interactions and diffusion. The development of most tumor spheroids relies on the high proliferative capacity and self&#8208;aggregation behavior of tumor cells. However, it often disregards the effect of microenvironmental factors mediated by extracellular matrix, which are indispensable components of tissue structure. In this study, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are encapsulated in bioactive microgels consisting of gelatin and hyaluronic acid designed to emulate tumor microenvironment in order to induce hepatic tumor spheroid formation. Two different subtypes of HCC's, HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines, are explored. The physicomechanical and biochemical properties of the microgels, controlled by changing the crosslinking density and polymer composition, are clearly shown to have substantial influence over the formation and spheroid formation. Moreover, the spheroids made from different cells and microgel properties display highly variable chemoresistance effects, further highlighting the importance of microenvironmental factors guiding tumor spheroid physiology.

         <title>Adsorption and Distribution of Triplex&#8208;Hybridizing Bioconjugated Gold Nanoclusters Inside Spermatozoa&#8208; A Study Using Confocal Microscopy and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional fluorescently labelled Au NCs&#8208;bioconjugate was developed where the biomolecules such as an oligonucleotide and a positively net charged cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, were coupled to the Au NCs surface using simple thiol&#8208;gold conjugation chemistry. Internalization of bioconjugated Au NCs inside spermatozoa was successfully monitored by employing CLSM, 3D particle distribution and FLIM.







Abstract
The study of the interactions between biofunctionalized gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) and spermatozoa is highly relevant to evaluate the potential of Au NCs as imaging probes and transfection agents in reproductive biology. In this work, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate the distribution of Au NCs bioconjugated with peptide (nuclear localisation sequence, NLS) and oligonucleotide (locked nucleic acid, LNA) ligands in bovine spermatozoa. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) was employed to detect changes in the NC's chemical environment. We observed a pronounced regio&#8208;selective accumulation of the bioconjugates in spermatozoa with high concentration at the equatorial segment. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;CLSM showed successful non&#8208;endosomal cellular uptake of the conjugates by intact sperm cells and the distribution of the bioconjugates was found to be influenced by the ligand types. Interestingly, the FLIM data showed differences in lifetime depending on membrane integrity. Furthermore, ligand&#8208;dependent changes in lifetime between NC bioconjugates carrying peptide and oligonucleotide ligands were found, probably attributed to specific interactions with sperm cell compartments.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent Acylation of Peptide Lysine Residues by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We used in&#8197;vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate Lys of a peptide substrate. The peptide modification reaction is specific to a particular Lys position, depends on the amino acid sequence context, and can be performed on a preparatively useful scale.







Abstract
Methods for modifying intact peptides are useful but can be unselective with regard to amino acid position and sequence context. In this work, we used in&#8197;vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate a Lys residue of a short peptide in sequence&#8208;dependent fashion. The DNAzymes do not acylate Lys when placed at other residues in the peptide, and the acylation activity depends on the Lys sequence context. A high acylation yield is observed on the preparative nanomole scale. These findings are promising for further development of DNAzymes for broader application to top&#8208;down Lys acylation of peptide and protein substrates.

Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a novel post&#8208;translational modification linked to diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease. Kcr enhances gene expression more than lysine acetylation, making it a promising therapeutic target. Despite recent research, key regulatory mechanisms and selective methods for studying Kcr remain underexplored. This review highlights Kcr's potential and identifies gaps needing further investigation.







Abstract
Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a recently discovered post&#8208;translational modification (PTM). Both histone and non&#8208;histone Kcr&#8208;proteins have been associated with numerous diseases including cancer, acute kidney injury, HIV latency, and cardiovascular disease. Histone Kcr enhances gene expression to a larger extend than the extensively studied lysine acetylation (Kac), suggesting Kcr as a novel potential therapeutic target. Although numerous scientific reports on crotonylation were published in the last years, relevant knowledge gaps concerning this PTM and its regulation still remain. To date, only few selective Kcr&#8208;interacting proteins have been identified and selective methods for the enrichment of Kcr&#8208;proteins in chemical proteomics analysis are still lacking. The development of new techniques to study this underexplored PTM could then clarify its function in health and disease and hopefully accelerate the development of new therapeutics for Kcr&#8208;related disease. Herein we briefly review what is known about the regulation mechanisms of Kcr and the current methods used to identify Kcr&#8208;proteins and their interacting partners. This report aims to highlight the significant potential of Kcr as a therapeutic target and to identify the existing scientific gaps that new research must address.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of DNMT3A by an N&#8208;Mustard Analog of S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;L&#8211;Methionine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examination of an N&#8208;mustard analogue of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine with DNA methyltransferase 3A revealed irreversible inhibition through covalent labeling of active site cysteine residues.







Abstract
DNA methylation, an important epigenetic modification, is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases and is essential in the regulation of gene expression. Here, the utility of an N&#8208;mustard analog designed to mimic the native methyl donor, S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM), was explored with the DNA methyltransferase 3A catalytic domain (DNMT3AC). In lieu of the expected analog transfer to DNA, methyltransferase activity was instead inhibited in a concentration dependent manner. Further investigation into the mechanism of analog inhibition did not reveal a typical competitive mechanism. Instead, mass spectrometry analysis provided direct evidence of two cysteine residues in the SAM binding site covalently modified by the SAM analog and confirmed its&#8217; function as an irreversible inhibitor of DNMT3AC.

         <title>Perfect Partners: Biocatalytic Halogenation and Metal Catalysis for Protein Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) have been extensively studied and they represent promising biocatalysts that utilize chloride, bromide, or iodide ions to selectively halogenate electron&#8208;rich aryl moieties under consumption of FADH2. The resulting aryl halides are valuable intermediates for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Recent research expanded this to protein targets, facilitating bioconjugation through late&#8208;stage biocatalytic halogenation combined with biorthogonal Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, ensuring selectivity and stability of the conjugate.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) are the most extensively researched halogenases and show great potential for biotransformation applications. These enzymes use chloride, bromide, or iodide ions as halogen donors to catalyze the oxygen&#8208;dependent halogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl moieties, requiring stochiometric amounts of FADH2 in the process. This makes FDH&#8208;catalyzed aryl halogenation a highly selective and environmentally friendly tool for the synthesis of aryl halides. The latter in turn serve as valuable intermediates for transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions for C&#8722;C bond formation. Previous research made extensive use of this approach to halogenate small molecules as building blocks for late&#8208;stage functionalization by transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Based on these results, several groups have managed to expand this research to protein targets over the past two years. Their work indicates an emerging methodology for bioconjugation using late&#8208;stage biocatalytic halogenation in conjunction with biorthogonal Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This strategy could present an attractive alternative to existing approaches due to the stability of the C&#8722;C bond bridging the generated biaryl moiety and the ease of late&#8208;stage enzymatic modification while maintaining excellent selectivity under mild conditions.

         <title>Modulating Polymerase Activity Through Light&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Voltage Domain Insertion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of light&#8208;switchable allosteric domains is becoming increasingly prevalent in biochemical research, offering a potential solution to control enzymatic activity and cellular processes with spatial and temporal precision, without the use of potentially toxic small molecules. The establishment of guidelines for the insertion and evaluation of these switchable proteins is of great scientific importance.







Abstract
Biochemical reaction networks adapt to environmental conditions by sensing chemical or physical stimuli and using tightly controlled mechanisms. While most signals come from molecules, many cells can also sense and respond to light. Among the biomolecular structures that enable light sensing, we selected a light&#8208;oxygen&#8208;voltage (LOV) domain in a previous study that tested the engineering of novel regulatory mechanisms into a nucleic acid polymerase. In this follow&#8208;up study, we studied the activities of previously selected variants in kinetic detail, and we generated additional LOV&#8208;polymerase fusion variants based on further insertion criteria. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how LOV domain insertion influences polymerase activity in a light&#8208;responsive manner: All active and photoresponsive enzyme variants studied by us to date were partially inhibited (i.&#8201;e., &#8220;turned off&#8221;) after irradiation with blue light at 470&#8197;nm, which can be explained by specific obstructions of the polymerase entry or exit structures (substrate entry channels or product exit channels, or both). Although the effects observed are moderate, we anticipate further engineering strategies that could be used to improve the extent of switchability and possibly to develop a &#8220;turn&#8208;on mode&#8221; insertion.

         <title>99mTc(I)&#8208;Labeled His&#8208;Tagged Proteins: Impact in the Development of Novel Imaging Probes and in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the organometallic core fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ in radiopharmaceutical chemistry by Roger Alberto and co&#8208;workers allowed direct radiolabeling, under smooth conditions, of histidine&#8208;tagged proteins, including antibody fragments, affibodies and other biologically relevant proteins. This review article aims to summarize the impact of tricarbonyl technology in the discovery and development of molecular imaging and/or therapeutic agents towards clinical application.







Abstract
Technetium&#8208;99&#8197;m (99mTc) remains the cornerstone of nuclear medicine for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) due to its widespread availability and chemical and physical features. Its multiple oxidation states allow for the design and production of radiopharmaceuticals with versatile properties, namely in terms of pharmacokinetic profile. 99mTc(V) is the most common oxidation state, but 99mTc(I) gained traction after the pioneering work of Alberto and colleagues, which resulted in the introduction of the organometallic core fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3(H2O)3]+. This core is readily available from [99mTcO4]&#8722; and displays three labile water molecules that can be easily swapped for ligands with different denticity and/or donor atoms in aqueous environment. This makes it possible to radiolabel small molecules as well as high molecular weight molecules, such as antibodies or other proteins, while assuring biological activity. Direct radiolabelling of those proteins with fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ under mild conditions is accomplished through incorporation of a polyhistidine tag (His&#8208;tag), a commonly used tag for purification of recombinant proteins. This review aims to address the direct radiolabelling of His&#8208;tagged macromolecules with fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ for development of molecular imaging agents and the impact of this technology in the discovery and development of imaging and/or therapeutic agents towards clinical application.

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the organometallic core &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in radiopharmaceutical chemistry by Roger Alberto and co-workers allowed direct radiolabeling, under smooth conditions, of histidine-tagged proteins, including antibody fragments, affibodies and other biologically relevant proteins. This review article aims to summarize the impact of tricarbonyl technology in the discovery and development of molecular imaging and/or therapeutic agents towards clinical application.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technetium-99&#8197;m (&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) remains the cornerstone of nuclear medicine for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) due to its widespread availability and chemical and physical features. Its multiple oxidation states allow for the design and production of radiopharmaceuticals with versatile properties, namely in terms of pharmacokinetic profile. &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc(V) is the most common oxidation state, but &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc(I) gained traction after the pioneering work of Alberto and colleagues, which resulted in the introduction of the organometallic core &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This core is readily available from [&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and displays three labile water molecules that can be easily swapped for ligands with different denticity and/or donor atoms in aqueous environment. This makes it possible to radiolabel small molecules as well as high molecular weight molecules, such as antibodies or other proteins, while assuring biological activity. Direct radiolabelling of those proteins with &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; under mild conditions is accomplished through incorporation of a polyhistidine tag (His-tag), a commonly used tag for purification of recombinant proteins. This review aims to address the direct radiolabelling of His-tagged macromolecules with &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for development of molecular imaging agents and the impact of this technology in the discovery and development of imaging and/or therapeutic agents towards clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances of Light/Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Azobenzene in Nanomedicine Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible photoisomerization and susceptibility to reduction&#8208;mediated cleavage of azobenzene (Azo) make them valuable for various biomedical applications. In this Concept paper, recent advances in the design and applications of Azo&#8208;based nanomedicines are updated, and future development opportunities are also summarized.







Abstract
Azobenzene (Azo) and its derivatives are versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules. Their reversible photoisomerization and susceptibility to reduction&#8208;mediated cleavage make them valuable for various biomedical applications. Upon exposure to the UV light, Azo units undergo a thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transition, which can be reversed by heating in the dark or irradiation with visible light. Additionally, the N=N bonds in azobenzenes can be cleaved under hypoxic conditions by azoreductase, making azobenzenes useful as hypoxia&#8208;responsive linkers. The integration of azobenzenes into nanomedicines holds promise for enhancing therapeutic efficacy, particularly in tumor targeting and controllable drug release. In this Concept paper, recent advances in the design and applications of azobenzene&#8208;based nanomedicines are updated, and future development opportunities are also summarized.

         <title>Evaluation of Potency and Specificity of Cryptophycin&#8208;Loaded Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enhanced variant of the antimitotic toxin cryptophycin was conjugated to the anti&#8208;Her2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) Trastuzumab upon Michael addition. Either antibodies with freed hinge&#8208;region cysteines or THIOMAB formats with engineered cysteines in the mAbs light chain were added to a maleimide derivative of cryptophycin. These Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs) showed retained binding to Her2 positive tumor cells and highly efficient cell killing in double&#8208;digit pM range on high Her2&#8208;expressing SK&#8208;BR&#8208;3 cells. Two ADCs (DAR&#160;6, DAR&#160;3) showed superior cell killing of the cell lines JIMT&#8208;1 and RT112 with medium receptor expression level in comparison with a DAR&#160;6 MMAE ADC serving as reference. The observed cell cytotoxicity is target&#8208;dependent since no impact on cell viability was observed for low Her2&#8208;expressing MDA&#8208;MB468 cells. Particularly the DAR&#160;3 ADC in THIOMAB format exhibiting desirable biophysical properties and high potency emerged as a promising candidate for further in vivo investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mysterious World of Non&#8208;Canonical Caps &#8211; What We Know and Why We Need New Sequencing Techniques</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes sophisticated methodologies such as LC&#8211;MS that enabled the identification of 5&#8217; non&#8208;canonical RNA caps and also surveys so far developed sequencing methods, evaluating their advantages and disadvantages. It emphasizes the need for developing new, reliable sequencing techniques to identify RNA types with non&#8208;canonical caps enabling to study their biological roles.







Abstract
It was long believed that viral and eukaryotic mRNA molecules are capped at their 5&#8242; end solely by the N7&#8208;methylguanosine cap, which regulates various aspects of the RNA life cycle, from its biogenesis to its decay. However, the recent discovery of a variety of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps derived from metabolites and cofactors &#8212; such as NAD, FAD, CoA, UDP&#8208;glucose, UDP&#8722;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine, and dinucleoside polyphosphates &#8212; has expanded the known repertoire of RNA modifications. These non&#8208;canonical caps are found across all domains of life and can impact multiple aspects of RNA metabolism, including stability, translation initiation, and cellular stress responses. The study of these modifications has been facilitated by sophisticated methodologies such as liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry, which have unveiled their presence in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The identification of these novel RNA caps highlights the need for advanced sequencing techniques to characterize the specific RNA types bearing these modifications and understand their roles in cellular processes. Unravelling the biological role of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps will provide insights into their contributions to gene expression, cellular adaptation, and evolutionary diversity. This review emphasizes the importance of these technological advancements in uncovering the complete spectrum of RNA modifications and their implications for living systems.

Abstract
Various single&#8208;stranded and hairpin&#8208;forming DNA and 2'&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA oligonucleotides bearing a single (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol residue esterified from either O1 and O2 or O1 and O3 were synthesized. Incubation of these oligonucleotides with equimolar mixtures of formylmethyl derivatives of the canonical nucleobases and 2&#8208;methylbenzimidazole under mildly acidic conditions revealed base&#8208;filling of the modified site to be strongly favored by base stacking of a double&#8208;helix, especially an A&#8208;type one. In 2'&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA hairpin oligonucleotides, base&#8208;filling of the (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol residue with nucleobase aldehydes followed the rules of Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing, thymine being the only exception. In single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides or the Hoogsteen strand of triple helices, both the yield and selectivity of base&#8208;filling were much more modest.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their unique attributes, including reversibility, specificity, directionality, and tunability, supramolecular biomaterials have evolved as an excellent alternative to conventional biomaterials like polymers, ceramics, and metals. Supramolecular hydrogels, in particular, have garnered significant interest because their fibrous architecture, high water content, and interconnected 3D network resemble the extracellular matrix to some extent. Consequently, supramolecular hydrogels have been used to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Owing to their unique attributes, including reversibility, specificity, directionality, and tunability, supramolecular biomaterials have evolved as an excellent alternative to conventional biomaterials like polymers, ceramics, and metals. Supramolecular hydrogels, in particular, have garnered significant interest because their fibrous architecture, high water content, and interconnected 3D network resemble the extracellular matrix to some extent. Consequently, supramolecular hydrogels have been used to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase&#160;catalysis mediated by Type I photosensitizers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of light as abundant, renewable, and clean energy source to boost lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) reactions represents an exciting and yet under&#8208;explored opportunity. Herein we demonstrated that photosensitizers, commonly used in photodynamic therapy, which act through the photocatalytic Type I mechanism can drive the oxidation of PASC by LPMOs, whereas Type II photosensitizers are not capable of promoting the LPMO activity. We analyzed Type I and Type II photosensitizers (methylene blue and tetraiodide salt of meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridyl) porphyrin, respectively) and demonstrated that, even without an addition of external reductant, Type I was capable of boosting Thermothelomyces thermophila MtLPMO9A activity in the presence of light. We also evaluated the photobiosystem in the presence and/or absence of molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and investigated the role of superoxide radical in the methylene blue fueled reactions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3), a chemical scavenger of H2O2, acts by safeguarding the enzyme from oxidative damage caused by accumulation of H2O2 early in photosensitizer&#8208;driven LPMO reactions. Finally, the results of the present work demonstrated that light&#8208;driven LPMO reactions mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) Type I photosensitizers, which also includes molecules such as curcumin and riboflavin, is a general phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Effect of a Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone Complex on Intracellular Cell Signalling Pathways in a Human Osteosarcoma 2D and 3D Models</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work studies the antitumor effects, molecular targets and cellular pathways of Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone on human osteosarcoma in 2D and 3D systems. CuHL decreases cell viability, inhibits proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Its mechanism involves DNA interaction, genotoxicity, ROS generation, and proteasome inhibition. Proteomic analysis reveals differentially expressed proteins with notable effects on stress response, ATP synthesis, DNA replication, and redox homeostasis.







Abstract
New therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma (OS) have demonstrated the potential efficacy of copper compounds as anticancer drugs and as a substitute for the often used platinum compounds. OS is a type of bone cancer, primarily affecting young adults and children.The main objective of this work is to discover the molecular targets and cellular pathways related to the antitumor properties of a Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone toward human OS 2D and 3D systems. Cell viability study using MG&#8208;63 cells was evaluated in OS monolayer and spheroids. CuHL significantly reduced cell viability in OS models (IC50 2D: 2.6&#177;0.3&#8197;&#956;M; IC50 3D: 9.9&#177;1.4&#8197;&#956;M) (p&lt;0.001). Also, CuHL inhibits cell proliferation and it induces cells to apoptosis. The main mechanism of action found for CuHL are the interaction with DNA, genotoxicity, the ROS generation and the proteasome activity inhibition. Besides, 67 differentially expressed proteins were found using proteomic approaches. Of those 67 proteins, 40 were found overexpressed and 27 underexpressed. The response to stress and to unfolded protein, as well as ATP synthesis were the most affected biological process among upregulated proteins, whilst proteins related to DNA replication and redox homeostasis were downregulated.

         <title>Integrating Biocatalysts into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Disentangling the Roles of Affinity, Molecular Weight, and Size</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating biocatalysts within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) shows huge promise for enhancing stability and sustaining activity in organic solvents. Here we report on investigates how biocatalyst size, weight, and affinity affect their incorporation into MOF pores, using NU&#8208;1000 as a model. Techniques like fluorescence tagging and 3D&#8208;STED microscopy helped identify which biocatalysts were internalized or excluded, revealing significant variations in their catalytic functions.







Abstract
The integration of biocatalysts within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is attracting growing interest due to its potential to both enhance biocatalyst stability and sustain biocatalyst activity in organic solvents. However, the factors that facilitate the post&#8208;synthetic infiltration of such large molecules into MOF pores remain unclear. This systematic study enabled the identification of the influence of biocatalyst molecular size, molecular weight and affinity on the uptake by an archetypal MOF, NU&#8208;1000. We analyzed a range of six biocatalysts with molecular weights from 1.9&#8197;kDa to 44.4&#8197;kDa, respectively. By employing a combination of fluorescence tagging and 3D&#8208;STED confocal laser scanning microscopy, we distinguished between biocatalysts that were internalized within the MOF pores and those sterically excluded. The catalytic functions of the biocatalysts hosted within the MOF were investigated and found to show strong variations relative to the solvated case, ranging from a two&#8208;fold increase to a strong decrease.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Functionalization of Bovine Milk Exosomes with an EGFR Nanobody for Target&#8208;specific Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bovine milk exosomes (BmExo) were functionalized with an EGFR&#8208;specific nanobody 7D12 by combining facile chemical modifications of amphiphile molecules and SrtA&#8208;mediated site&#8208;specific ligations. The 7D12&#8208;modified BmExo exhibited specific delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) to EGFR&#8208;positive cancer cells, while reducing non&#8208;specific toxicity to EGFR&#8208;negative cells. The method is versatile and efficient for the generation of protein&#8208;ligand modified BmExo.







Abstract
Bovine milk exosomes (BmExo) have been identified as versatile nanovesicles for anti&#8208;cancer drugs delivery due to their natural availability and biocompatibility. However, tumor&#8208;specific delivery based on BmExo often requires post&#8208;isolation modifications of the membrane surface with active&#8208;targeting ligands. In this study, we report an alternative approach to functionalize BmExo with nanobody combining facile chemical modification and Sortase A&#8208;mediated site&#8208;specific ligation, as demonstrated by the development of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeted drug delivery system. The BmExo membrane was first coated with a diglycine&#8208;containing amphiphile molecule, NH2&#8208;GG&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE, by hydrophobic insertion. The diglycine as nucleophiles displayed on the membrane enabled the subsequent ligation of the EGFR nanobody (7D12) by Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated site&#8208;specific transpeptidation. The successful construction of BmExo&#8208;7D12 was confirmed by Western blotting analysis, electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). As a demonstration model, BmExo&#8208;7D12 loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox) was shown to be able to deliver Dox to cancer cells in response to the expression of EGFR as manifested by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. Finally, the cytotoxicity assay showed that BmExo&#8208;7D12&#8208;Dox was more effective in killing tumor cells with high EGFR expression while significantly reduced the non&#8208;specific toxicity to EGFR negative cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that 7D12&#8208;functionalized BmExo can serve as a target&#8208;specific delivery system for Dox to selectively kill EGFR&#8208;expressing tumor cells. This approach should prove to be versatile and efficient for the generation of protein&#8208;ligands modified BmExo.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Insulin Using Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modification of proteins is important for many new biopharmaceuticals. Continuous&#8208;flow chemistry, where reactants are continuously pumped into a flow reactor, is widely used for small molecules. Here, continuous flow chemistry in a glass microreactor is used to selectively modify a small protein, insulin.







Abstract
Chemical modification of proteins is of growing importance to generate new molecular probes for chemical biology and for the development of new biopharmaceuticals. For example, two approved, long&#8208;acting insulin variants are lipidated at the LysB29 side&#8208;chain. Acylations of proteins have so far been performed in batch&#8208;mode.

     alt="Chemical Modification of Insulin Using Flow Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical modification of proteins is important for many new biopharmaceuticals. Continuous-flow chemistry, where reactants are continuously pumped into a flow reactor, is widely used for small molecules. Here, continuous flow chemistry in a glass microreactor is used to selectively modify a small protein, insulin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical modification of proteins is of growing importance to generate new molecular probes for chemical biology and for the development of new biopharmaceuticals. For example, two approved, long-acting insulin variants are lipidated at the LysB29 side-chain. Acylations of proteins have so far been performed in batch-mode. Here we describe the use of flow chemistry for site-selective acylation of a small protein, insulin. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on flow chemistry for chemical modification of insulin. The first step was to develop reaction conditions for acylation of Lys B29 that gave a soluble mixture and thus was compatible with flow chemistry in a microreactor; this included selection of a soluble base. Secondly, the conditions, such as reagent ratios and flow rate were optimized. Third, the use of these conditions for the acylation with a wide range of acids was demonstrated.

         <title>Mapping Endocytic Vesicular Acidification with a pH&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating a pH&#8208;sensitive i&#8208;motif into a tetrahedral DNA framework, we develop a pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine to track endocytic vesicle acidification during the endosomal maturation process.







Abstract
Mapping the endocytic vesicular acidification process is of prior importance to better understand the health and pathological processes of cells. Herein, by integrating a pH&#8208;sensitive i&#8208;motif and a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF), we develop a pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine, allowing for efficient sensing of pH from 7.0 to 5.5 via the pH&#8208;triggered spatial proximity modulation of FRET. The inheriting endo&#8208;lysosome&#8208;targeting ability of TDF enables spatiotemporal tracking of endocytic vesicle acidification during the endosomal maturation process. Analysis of pH&#8208;dependent FRET response at single fluorescent spot level reveals the significant difference of endocytic vesicular acidification between normal and cancer cells. The performance of pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine underlines its potential for studies on vesicle acidification&#8208;related pathologies as a universal platform.

         <title>Ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Compounds: Extended Ring Systems for Improved Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate compounds with varying degrees of aromatic functionality have been synthesized and fully characterized. This includes cyclic voltammetry and the analysis of four new structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The compounds cytotoxic potential has been determined by MTT screening against pancreatic carcinoma (MIA PaCa&#8208;2), ovarian adenocarcinoma (A2780), breast adenocarcinomas (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7) and normal epithelial retinal (ARPE&#8208;19). The compounds show a general trend, where increasing the number of aromatic rings in the molecule yields an increase in cytotoxicity and follows the trend anthracenyl &gt; naphthyl &gt; phenyl &gt; methyl. The compounds are particularly sensitive to the triple negative cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, and the potential modes of action have been studied by production of reactive oxygen species using fluorescence microscopy and cell morphology using Scanning Electron Microscopy. All assays highlight the ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate with an anthracenyl substituent to be the lead compound in this library. The decomposition was also observed within cells, to give a cytotoxic fluorescent molecule, which has been visualized by confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorylation of the HMGN1 Nucleosome Binding Domain Decreases Helicity and Interactions with the Acidic Patch</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleosome&#8208;binding protein HMGN1 populates an ensemble of conformational states that could be shifted by phosphorylation within the nucleosome binding domain. Herein, we employ predictive modelling and experimental structural biology tools to explore how serine phosphorylation within this key motif decreases helicity and disrupts interaction with the nucleosome acidic patch.







Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins are abundant in the nucleus and are prime sites for posttranslational modifications that modulate transcriptional regulation. Lacking a defined three&#8208;dimensional structure, intrinsically disordered proteins populate an ensemble of several conformational states, which are dynamic and often altered by posttranslational modifications, or by binding to interaction partners. Although there is growing appreciation for the role that intrinsically disordered regions have in regulating protein&#8208;protein interactions, we still have a poor understanding of how to determine conformational population shifts, their causes under various conditions, and how to represent and model conformational ensembles. Here, we study the effects of serine phosphorylation in the nucleosome&#8208;binding domain of an intrinsically disordered protein &#8211; HMGN1 &#8211; using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism and modelling of protein complexes. We show that phosphorylation induces local conformational changes in the peptide backbone and decreases the helical propensity of the nucleosome binding domain. Modelling studies using AlphaFold3 suggest that phosphorylation disrupts the interface between HMGN1 and the nucleosome acidic patch, but that the models over&#8208;predict helicity in comparison to experimental data. These studies help us to build a picture of how posttranslational modifications might shift the conformational populations of disordered regions, alter access to histones, and regulate chromatin compaction.

         <title>Small Molecule Induces Time&#8208;Dependent Inhibition of Stat3 Dimerization and DNA&#8208;Binding Activity and Regresses Human Breast Tumor Xenografts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The picture shows the impact of JKB887 against the DNA&#8208;binding activity of the Stat3:Stat3 dimer. The binding of JKB887 with Stat3 first interferes with the Stat3 phospho&#8208;tyrosine peptide interaction with the SH2 domain, which in turn inhibits Stat3:Stat3 dimerization. The disruption of Stat3:Stat3 dimerization ultimately leads to a decrease in the Stat3 DNA&#8208;binding activity. JKB887 could also directly inhibit Stat3 DNA&#8208;binding activity.







Abstract
Aberrantly&#8208;active signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3 has a causal role in many human cancers and represents a validated anticancer drug target, though it has posed significant challenge to drug development. A new small molecule, JKB887, was identified through library screening and is predicted to interact with Lys591, Arg609 and Pro63 in the phospho&#8208;tyrosine (pTyr)&#8208;binding pocket of the Stat3 SH2 domain. JKB887 inhibited Stat3 DNA&#8208;binding activity in&#8197;vitro in a time&#8208;dependent manner, with IC50 of 2.2&#8211;4.5&#8197;&#956;M at 30&#8211;60&#8208;min incubation. It directly disrupted both the Stat3 binding to the cognate, high&#8208;affinity pTyr (pY) peptide, GpYLPQTV&#8208;NH2 in fluorescent polarization assay with IC50 of 3.5&#8211;5.5&#8197;&#956;M at 60&#8211;90&#8208;min incubation, and to the IL&#8208;6 receptor/gp130 or Src in treated malignant cells. Treatment with JKB887 selectively blocked constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, and Stat3&#8208;regulated gene expression, and decreased viable cell numbers, cell growth, colony formation, migration, and survival in human or mouse tumor cells. By contrast, JKB887 had minimal effects on Stat1, pErk1/2MAPK, pShc, pJAK2, or pSrc induction, or on cells that do not harbor aberrantly&#8208;active Stat3. Additionally, JKB887 inhibited growth of human breast cancer xenografts in mice. JKB887 is a Stat3&#8208;selective inhibitor with demonstrable antitumor effects against Stat3&#8208;dependent human cancers.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Substrates for Enhancing Activatable Cyclopropene Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal ligations have been optimized for speed, but new features, like click&#8208;to&#8208;release and cell&#8208;type reaction control, substantially expand their capabilities in cells and organisms. In this report, we explored a variety of diene reaction partners for modular activatable cyclopropenes, identifying the quinone/catechol as a redox activatable substrate for inverse electron demand Diels Alder reactions with activatable cyclopropenes







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry has become a mainstay in chemical biology and is making inroads in the clinic with recent advances in protein targeting and drug release. Since the field's beginning, a major focus has been on designing bioorthogonal reagents with good selectivity, reactivity, and stability in complex biological environments. More recently, chemists have imbued reagents with new functionalities like click&#8208;and&#8208;release or light/enzyme&#8208;controllable reactivity. We have previously developed a controllable cyclopropene&#8208;based bioorthogonal ligation, which has excellent stability in physiological conditions and can be triggered to react with tetrazines by exposure to enzymes, biologically significant small molecules, or light spanning the visual spectrum. Here, to improve reactivity and gain a better understanding of this system, we screened diene reaction partners for the cyclopropene. We found that a cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair is 26 times faster than reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Additionally, we showed that the reaction of the cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair can be activated by two orthogonal mechanisms: caging group removal on the cyclopropene and oxidation/reduction of the quinone. Finally, we demonstrated that this caged cyclopropene&#8211;quinone can be used as an imaging tool to label the membranes of fixed, cultured cells.

     alt="Redox-Activated Substrates for Enhancing Activatable Cyclopropene Bioorthogonal Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonal ligations have been optimized for speed, but new features, like click-to-release and cell-type reaction control, substantially expand their capabilities in cells and organisms. In this report, we explored a variety of diene reaction partners for modular activatable cyclopropenes, identifying the quinone/catechol as a redox activatable substrate for inverse electron demand Diels Alder reactions with activatable cyclopropenes
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonal chemistry has become a mainstay in chemical biology and is making inroads in the clinic with recent advances in protein targeting and drug release. Since the field's beginning, a major focus has been on designing bioorthogonal reagents with good selectivity, reactivity, and stability in complex biological environments. More recently, chemists have imbued reagents with new functionalities like click-and-release or light/enzyme-controllable reactivity. We have previously developed a controllable cyclopropene-based bioorthogonal ligation, which has excellent stability in physiological conditions and can be triggered to react with tetrazines by exposure to enzymes, biologically significant small molecules, or light spanning the visual spectrum. Here, to improve reactivity and gain a better understanding of this system, we screened diene reaction partners for the cyclopropene. We found that a cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair is 26 times faster than reactions with 1,2,4,5-tetrazines. Additionally, we showed that the reaction of the cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair can be activated by two orthogonal mechanisms: caging group removal on the cyclopropene and oxidation/reduction of the quinone. Finally, we demonstrated that this caged cyclopropene&#8211;quinone can be used as an imaging tool to label the membranes of fixed, cultured cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A 2,6&#8208;dihydroxybenzoyl&#8208;hydrazone fluorophore with benzene sulfonamide moiety for Golgi homing is designed and synthesized and the photophysical properties are explained by theoretical studies. This novel probe illuminates the Golgi apparatus in colon cancer cells selectively.







Abstract
Herein, we have designed and synthesised a 2,6&#8208;dihydroxybenzoyl&#8208;hydrazone (compound 3) fluorophore through a concise strategy. Molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical simulations revealed that long range charge transfer (CT) to be the underlying mechanism for the emissive property of compound 3. Confocal microscopy and cell viability assays confirmed that within 3&#8197;h, compound 3 homed into the Golgi&#8208;apparatus of colon cancer cells (HCT&#8208;116) selectively compared to the breast (MCF7), lung (A549), cervical (HeLa) cancer cells and non&#8208;cancerous retinal epithelial pigment cells (RPE&#8208;1) with negligible toxicity. This novel fluorophore has potential to image Golgi&#8208;apparatus in a cancer cell specific manner for diagnosis.

         <title>Discovery and Heterologous Expression of Trilenodin, an Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide with a Unique Tri&#8208;Isoleucine Motif</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new antimicrobial lasso peptide, trilenodin, was bioinformatically identified, isolated, and characterized from Firmicutes bacterium Paenibacillus taiwanensis DSM18679. We connected production of trilenodin to its biosynthetic gene cluster by establishing a Firmicutes&#8208;based lasso peptide heterologous expression system and report trilenodin as the first known biologically active Firmicutes lasso peptide.







Abstract
Lasso peptides are an increasingly relevant class of peptide natural products with diverse biological activities, intriguing physical properties, and unique chemical structures. Most characterized lasso peptides have been from Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, despite bioinformatic analyses suggesting that other bacterial taxa, particularly those from Firmicutes, are rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding lasso peptides. Herein, we report the bioinformatic identification of a lasso peptide BGC from Paenibacillus taiwanensis DSM18679 which we termed pats. We used a bioinformatics&#8208;guided isolation approach and high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) to isolate and subsequently characterize a new lasso peptide produced from the pats BGC, which we named trilenodin, after the tri&#8208;isoleucine motif present in its primary sequence. This tri&#8208;isoleucine motif is unique among currently characterized lasso peptides. We confirmed the connection between the pats BGC and trilenodin production by establishing the first Bacillus subtilis 168&#8208;based heterologous expression system for expressing Firmicutes lasso peptides. We finally determined that trilenodin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against B. subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, making trilenodin the first characterized biologically active lasso peptide from Firmicutes. Collectively, we demonstrate that bacteria from Firmicutes can serve as high&#8208;potential sources of chemically and biologically diverse lasso peptides.

         <title>Detection Strategies for Sialic Acid and Sialoglycoconjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialic acid is a glycan residue found at the termini of many glycoconjugates. This residue, and the underlying residues it covers, form critical recognition epitopes in glycobiology. In this review we discuss methods to detect sialoglycoconjugates and sialic acids which are either substrates or products of the enzymes that form these conjugates &#8211; sialyltransferases (SiaT) and neuraminidases (NEU).







Abstract
Glycoconjugates are a vast class of biomolecules implicated in biological processes important for human health and disease. The structural complexity of glycoconjugates remains a challenge to deciphering their precise biological roles and for their development as biomarkers and therapeutics. Human glycoconjugates on the outside of the cell are modified with sialic (neuraminic) acid residues at their termini. The enzymes that install sialic acids are sialyltransferases (SiaTs), a family of 20 different isoenzymes. The removal and degradation of sialic acids is mediated by neuraminidase (NEU; sialidase) enzymes, of which there are four isoenzymes. In this review, we discuss chemical and biochemical approaches for the detection and analysis of sialoglycoconjugate (SGC) structures and their enzymatic products. The most common methods include affinity probes and synthetic substrates. Fluorogenic and radiolabelled substrates are also important tools for many applications, including screening for enzyme inhibitors. Strategies that give insight into the native substrate&#8208;specificity of enzymes that regulate SGCs (SiaT &amp; NEU) are necessary to improve our understanding of the role of sialic acid metabolism in health and disease.

         <title>Expanding the Repertoire of ceDAF&#8208;12 Ligands for Modulation of the Steroid Endocrine System in C. Elegans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C. elegans steroid endocrine system serves as a simple model for studying steroid hormone signaling pathways in animals. This work introduces synthetic steroids as new tools for manipulation of the system that, acting as ligands for the ceDAF&#8208;12 nuclear receptor, selectively influence development, reproduction, and ageing.







Abstract
Steroid hormones are essential for the biological processes of eukaryotic organisms. The steroid endocrine system of C. elegans, which includes dafachronic acids (DA) and the nuclear receptor ceDAF&#8208;12, provides a simple model for exploring the role of steroid hormone signaling pathways in animals. In this study, we show for the first time the feasibility of designing synthetic steroids that can modulate different physiological processes, such as development, reproduction and ageing, in relation to ceDAF&#8208;12. Our results not only confirm the conclusions derived from genetic studies linking these processes but also provide new chemical tools to selectively manipulate them, as we found that different compounds produce different phenotypic results. The structures of these compounds are much more diverse than those of endogenous hormones and analogues previously described by other researchers, allowing further development of the chemical modulation of the steroid endocrine system in C. elegans and related nematodes.

         <title>Nuclear&#8208;Targeting Peptides for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the most recent applications of nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides in targeting tumor associated proteins, chemotherapy, photodynamic/photothermal therapy, gene therapy, protein&#8208;based therapeutics, and their synergistic therapy.







Abstract
Nucleus is the central regulator of cells that controls cell proliferation, metabolism, and cell cycle, and is considered the most important organelle in cells. The precision medicine that can achieve nuclear targeting has achieved good therapeutic effects in anti&#8208;tumor therapy. However, the presence of biological barriers such as cell membranes and nuclear membranes in cells limit the delivery of therapeutic agents to the nucleus. Therefore, developing effective nuclear&#8208;targeting drug delivery strategies is particularly important. Nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides are a class of functional peptides that can penetrate cell membranes and target the nucleus. They mainly recognize and bind to the nuclear transport molecules (such as Importin&#8208;&#945;/&#946;) and transport the therapeutic agents to the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPC). This review summarizes the most recent developments of strategies for anti&#8208;tumor therapy utilizing nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides, which will ultimately contribute to the development of more effective nuclear&#8208;targeting strategies to achieve better anti&#8208;tumor outcomes.

The precision medicine that can achieve nuclear targeting has achieved good therapeutic effects in anti-tumor therapy. However, the presence of biological barriers such as cell membranes and nuclear membranes in cells limit the delivery of therapeutic agents to the nucleus. Therefore, developing effective nuclear-targeting drug delivery strategies is particularly important. Nuclear-targeting peptides are a class of functional peptides that can penetrate cell membranes and target the nucleus. They mainly recognize and bind to the nuclear transport molecules (such as Importin-&#945;/&#946;) and transport the therapeutic agents to the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPC). This review summarizes the most recent developments of strategies for anti-tumor therapy utilizing nuclear-targeting peptides, which will ultimately contribute to the development of more effective nuclear-targeting strategies to achieve better anti-tumor outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organ&#8208;On&#8208;A&#8208;Chip Devices: Technology Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chips (OsCs) are bioengineered miniaturized systems lined with cells/tissues grown inside microfluidic chips. This article summarizes the progress and development of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips. Many aspects of each OoCs system are investigated such as the microfluidic design, materials used, models, and applications.







Abstract
Organ&#8208;On&#8208;a&#8208;Chip (OOC) is a multichannel 3D&#8208;microfluidic cell&#8208;culture system incorporated in a chip that simulates the behavior of an organ. This technology relies on a multidisciplinary science that benefits from and contributes in the progress of many fields including microbiology, microfluidics, biomaterials, and bioengineering. This review article summarizes the progress and achievements of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies. It highlights the significant advantages of this technology in terms of reducing animal testing and providing personalized medical responses. In addition, this paper demonstrates how OOC is becoming a promising and powerful tool in pharmaceutical research to combat diseases. It predicts not only the effects of drugs on the target organs but also, using body&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems, it may provide insights into the side effects of the drug delivery on the other organs. Likewise, the models used for the construction of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices are investigated along with the design and materials of microfluidic devices. For each OOC, the integrated monitoring devices within the chips (e.&#8201;g., sensors and biosensors) are discussed. We also discuss the evolution of FDA regulations and the potential in the near future for integrating OOCs into protocols that support and reduce the need for and the failure rates in preclinical and clinical studies.

         <title>Implications of the Lipidic Ecosystem for the Membrane Binding of ApoE Signal Peptide: Importance of Sphingomyelin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipidic ecosystem plays an important role in the binding of signal peptides to the membrane vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the translocation of nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. We have demonstrated how different lipids such as sphingomyelin, cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine modulate the membrane binding of ApoE signal peptide.







Abstract
The unidirectional movement of nascent secretory proteins in the cell is primarily assisted by the signal recognition particles (SRP). However, this does not completely justify the importance of the signal peptide (SP) which gets eliminated after the protein translocation. We have earlier demonstrated that a negatively charged lipid such as POPG plays an important role in the higher binding affinity and cholesterol&#8208;discriminating ability of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) SP. In this present work, we aimed to understand the role of sphingomyelin, an important constituent of ER, on the membrane binding of ApoE SP. Our results demonstrate that sphingomyelin promotes membrane binding but cannot discriminate cholesterol. However, sphingomyelin shows a synergistic effect with POPG toward the membrane binding of the ApoE SP. We have further shown that the membrane domains do not have any impact on the binding of ApoE SP. Based on our results we propose that the lipid composition of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where ApoE translocates, enhances the binding of the ApoE signal peptide to the ER membrane.

         <title>Precursor&#8208;Directed Biosynthesis of Panepoxydone Derivatives with Nitric Oxide Production Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Panepoxydone is a natural NF&#8208;&#1082;B inhibitor isolated from basidiomycetes belonging to the genus Panus and Lentinus. It is biosynthesized from prenylhydroquinone through successive hydroxylation, epoxidation, and reduction reactions. In this study, we establish an efficient precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis strategy for the structural expansion of panepoxydone based on its biosynthetic pathway. Supplementation of the panepoxydone&#8208;producing strain, Panus rudis, with various prenylhydroquinone analogues enabled the production of fourteen previously undescribed panepoxydone derivatives, panepoxyquinoid A&#8208;N (2&#8722;14). The obtained panepoxydone derivatives together with their parental molecules were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on LPS&#8208;induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds 1, 5&#8208;6, 10&#8208;11, and 14&#8208;15 displayed significant suppressive effects on LPS&#8208;induced NO production with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 to 30.1 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Molecular Characterization of the LTA Precursor Molecule Glc2&#8208;DAG, a Potential Target for Antibiotics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glycolipid diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2DAG) is the precursor molecule of Lipoteichoic acid, a vital component of cell envelops of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Here we report the isolation of the 13C&#8208;isotope labelled diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2DAG) from bacterial membranes and the use solid&#8208;state NMR to characterize Glc2DAG in membranes.







Abstract
Bacterial infections present a major global health threat, often displaying resistance to various antibiotics. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a vital component of bacterial cell envelopes of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, crucial for cell integrity, cell division, and host inflammation. Due to its essential role for bacteria, LTA and its biosynthesis are also attractive drug targets, however, there is only scant molecular knowledge on LTA and its precursor molecules in membranes. Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2&#8208;DAG), the glycolipid precursor molecule that anchors LTA in the bacterial plasma&#8208;membrane. Using a tailored growth medium and purification protocols, we isolated 13C&#8208;isotope labelled Glc2&#8208;DAG from bacteria, which can then be used for high&#8208;resolution NMR studies. Using solution&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state NMR, we show an in&#8208;depth molecular characterization of Glc2&#8208;DAG, including in native&#8208;like membranes. Our approach may help to identify antibiotics that directly target LTA precursor molecules, and it offers a tool for future investigations into the role of Glc2&#8208;DAG in bacterial physiology.

         <title>Nanozymes as Antibacterial Agents: New Concerns in Design and Enhancement Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes exhibiting natural enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities as antibacterial agents present several advantages, including high stability, low cost, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity, ease of preparation and storage, and minimal bacterial resistance. Consequently, they have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the rapid expansion of antimicrobial nanozyme research has resulted in pioneering reviews that do not comprehensively address emerging concerns and enhancement strategies within this field. This paper first summarizes the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of nanozymes; subsequently, we outline new research considerations for designing antibacterial nanozymes with enhanced functionality and biosafety features such as degradable, imageable, targeted, and bacterial&#8208;binding nanozymes as well as those capable of selectively targeting pathogenic bacteria while sparing normal cells and probiotics. Furthermore, we review novel enhancement strategies involving external physical stimuli (light or ultrasound), the introduction of extrinsic small molecules, and self&#8208;supplying H2O2 to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes under physiological conditions characterized by low concentrations of H2O2 and O2. Additionally, we present non&#8208;redox nanozymes that operate independently of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) alongside those designed to combat less common pathogenic bacteria. Finally, we discuss current issues, challenges faced in the field, and future prospects for antibacterial nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncanonical Functions of Ketosynthase Domains in Type I Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are remarkable molecular machines that can synthesize structurally complex polyketide natural products with a wide range of biological activities. In these molecular machines, ketosynthase (KS) domains play a central role, typically by catalyzing decarboxylative Claisen condensation for polyketide chain extension. Noncanonical KS domains with catalytic functions rather than Claisen condensation have increasingly been evidenced, further demonstrating the capability of type I PKSs for structural diversity. This review provides an overview of the reactions involving unusual KS activities, including PKS priming, acyl transfer, Dickmann condensation, Michael addition, aldol&#8208;lactonization bicyclization, C&#8208;N bond formation and decarbonylation. Insights into these reactions can deepen the understanding of PKS&#8208;based assembly line chemistry and guide the efforts for rational engineering of polyketide&#8208;related molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel concept for cleavable linkers applicable to conjugation chemistry &#8211; design, synthesis and characterization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linkers with disulfide bonds are the only cleavable linkers that utilize physiological thiol gradients as a trigger to initiate the intracellular drug release cascade. Herein, we present a novel concept exploiting the thiol gradient phenomena to design a new class of cleavable linker with no disulfide bond. To support the concept, an electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamide&#8208;based cleavable linker amenable to conjugation of drug molecules with targeting agents, was developed. Modulating the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl sulfonamide was critical to the balance between the stability and drug release. Favorable stability and payload release in human serum under physiologically relevant thiol concentrations was demonstrated with two potent cytotoxics. Intracellular payload release was further validated in cell&#8208;based assay in context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugate generated from monoclonal antibody and sulfonamide containing linker. To support the proposed release mechanism, possible downstream by&#8208;products formed from the drug&#8208;linker adduct were characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Perspective on Oxygen Activation Chemistry by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze a panoply of chemical transformations essential for living organisms. Through oxygen activation, flavoenzymes could generate diverse flavin&#8208;oxygen species that mediate numerous redox and non&#8208;redox transformations. In this review, we highlight the extensive oxygen activation chemistry at two sites of the flavin cofactor: C4a and N5 sites. Oxygen activation at the C4a site generates flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H) species for various monooxygenation reactions, while activation at the N5 site produces negatively charged flavin&#8208;N5OOH species, which act as highly reactive nucleophiles or bases. The selective oxygen activation at either the C4a or N5 site depends on the nature of substrates and is controlled by the active site architecture. These insights have expanded our understanding of oxygen activation chemistry in flavoenzymes and will serve as a foundation for future efforts in enzyme engineering and redesign.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in a Coumarin&#8208;Caged Peptide Leads to a Surprising Enzyme Hyperactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the photo&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of coumarin&#8208;based caging groups using photoreleasable peptides in the context of protein phosphatase&#8208;1 (PP1) activity. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of linker design in controlling uncaging efficiency, offering insights for the design of such fluorescently labelled peptides for biological applications.







Abstract
Protein phosphatase&#8208;1 (PP1) is a ubiquitous enzyme that counteracts hundreds of kinases in cells. PP1 interacts with regulatory proteins via an RVxF peptide motif that binds to a hydrophobic groove on the enzyme. PP1&#8208;disrupting peptides (PDPs) compete with these regulatory proteins, leading to the release of the active PP1 subunit and promoting substrate dephosphorylation. Building on previous strategies employing the ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl (o&#8208;Nb) group as a photocage to control PDP activity, we introduced coumarin derivatives into a PDP via an ether bond to explore their effects on PP1 activity. Surprisingly, our study revealed that the coumarin&#8208;caged peptides (PDP&#8208;DEACM and PDP&#8208;CM) underwent a photo&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, resulting in an unexpected hyperactivation of PP1. Our findings underscore the importance of linker design in controlling uncaging efficiency of photocages and highlight the need for comprehensive in&#8197;vitro analysis before cellular experiments.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled BODIPY@Au Core&#8208;Shell Structures for Durable Neuroprotective Phototherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With its long&#8208;lasting stability and enhanced biocompatibility, nano&#8208;photosensitizer offers a viable solution for tackling a range of medical issues with incredible precision. It's the perfect combination of cutting&#8208;edge technology and intuitive design, allowing for fast and reliable treatments for many of today's most pressing issues.







Abstract
BODIPY analogs are promising photosensitizers for molecular phototherapy; however, they exhibit high dark cytotoxicity and limited singlet oxygen generation capacity. In this study, we developed self&#8208;assembled core&#8208;shell nanophotosensitizers by linking a bipyridine group to BODIPY (Bpy&#8208;BODIPY) and promoting J&#8208;aggregation on gold nanourchins. This design enhances photostability and reduces the energy gap between the lowest singlet excited state and the lower triplet state, facilitating efficient singlet oxygen production. We characterized these nanophotosensitizers using UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), which confirmed the formation of the desired core&#8208;shell structure and J&#8208;aggregates. Notably, Bpy&#8208;BODIPY@Au significantly suppresses tau protein aggregation and enhances neuroprotective action, even in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor. This work broadens the application of BODIPY chemistry to nanoagents for neuroprotective therapy.

         <title>Binding mode of cyclic chemerin&#8208;9 peptide and chemerinS157 protein at CMKLR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is activated by the adipokine and chemoattractant protein chemerin. Cryo&#8208;EM structures of chemerin&#8208;9&#8208;CMKLR1&#8208;Gi have been published, where chemerin&#8208;9 is the nonapeptide of the C terminus of chemerinS157. Chemerin&#8208;9 is as active as the full&#8208;length protein in Ca2+&#8208;release but shows differences in equilibrium read&#8208;outs. An equally potent cyclic chemerin&#8208;9 variant (cC9) was reported previously. Now, we have built a computational model of CMKLR1 to investigate the binding mode of cC9 and chemerinS157 in comparison to chemerin&#8208;9. Differences were investigated using CMKLR1 variants. Double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis identified CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 as the relevant position for Phe8&#8208;binding of cC9. Energy contribution revealed slight differences in Phe8&#8208;binding to CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 and space for larger residues. This was confirmed as the chemerin&#8208;9 variant with 1&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;L&#8208;alanine at position 8 showed a 4&#8208;fold increased potency of 2 nM&#160; (pEC50=8.6&#177;0.15). While chemerin&#8208;9 and cC9 share their interactions at the CMKLR1, chemerinS157 tolerates most mutations of CMKLR1 in the deep binding site.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is activated by the adipokine and chemoattractant protein chemerin. Cryo-EM structures of chemerin-9-CMKLR1-Gi have been published, where chemerin-9 is the nonapeptide of the C terminus of chemerinS157. Chemerin-9 is as active as the full-length protein in Ca2+-release but shows differences in equilibrium read-outs. An equally potent cyclic chemerin-9 variant (cC9) was reported previously. Now, we have built a computational model of CMKLR1 to investigate the binding mode of cC9 and chemerinS157 in comparison to chemerin-9. Differences were investigated using CMKLR1 variants. Double-mutant cycle analysis identified CMKLR1-F2.53 as the relevant position for Phe8-binding of cC9. Energy contribution revealed slight differences in Phe8-binding to CMKLR1-F2.53 and space for larger residues. This was confirmed as the chemerin-9 variant with 1-naphthyl-L-alanine at position 8 showed a 4-fold increased potency of 2 nM&#160; (pEC50=8.6&#177;0.15). While chemerin-9 and cC9 share their interactions at the CMKLR1, chemerinS157 tolerates most mutations of CMKLR1 in the deep binding site. The computational model of chemerinS157 suggests a &#946;-sheet interaction between the N-terminal CMKLR1-segment I25VVL28 and the &#946;-sheet D108KVLGRLVH116 of ChemS157, which was confirmed experimentally. Our data expand the knowledge by identifying the binding mode of chemerinS157 and cC9 at CMKLR1 facilitating future structure-based drug design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving CsOAC Activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for directed Production of Olivetolic Acid through Rational Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. It is produced through a unique interaction between the two proteins, olivetol synthase (CsOLS) and olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC). When the OA biosynthesis is transferred to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, olivetol (OL) is produced as a side product, even with a high enhancement of copy number of CsOAC. In order to increase the OA titer while decreasing the OL titer in S. cerevisiae, rational design was applied to CsOAC using in silico approaches such as protein&#8208;ligand docking to find potential protein variants. In vivo screening and also testing different approaches for both proteins was applied to identify the best performing variants of CsOAC. Four variants were identified that gave the desired properties. The best CsOAC variant, G82A/L92Y, resulted in a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in OA production and a shift in the ratio between the two products towards OA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Isocyanates are versatile electrophiles that can react with a wide range of nucleophiles to afford important organic structures. Although the reactions between isocyanates and alcohols, amines and organometallic reagents have been well established, the synthesis of amides through the decarboxylative condensation of carboxylic acids and isocyanates is less appreciated. In this review, the synthesis of isocyanates and its application on amide synthesis through the condensation with carboxylic acids are summarized and discussed. It is our hope that this review will attract more attention to this less mentioned transformation and inspire new developments in the fields of organic synthesis, polymer synthesis and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;based Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer has long been a significant threat to human life and health. The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, which possess the same specificity and affinity as antibodies, are advantageous due to their synthetic accessibility and ease of modification, providing novel insights for immune checkpoint research. In this review, we outline the key aptamers currently developed for immune checkpoints such as CTLA&#8208;4, PD&#8208;1, PD&#8208;L1 and Siglec&#8208;15. We explore their potential in therapeutic strategies, including functionalizing or engineering aptamers for covalent binding, valency control, and nanostructure assembly, as well as investigating molecular mechanisms such as glycosylated protein functions and cell&#8208;cell interactions. Finally, the future applications of aptamers in immunotherapy are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and evaluation of peptide inhibitors targeting the dimerization of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) seriously impacted public health. The evolutionarily conserved viral chymotrypsin&#8208;like main protease (Mpro) is an important target for anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 drug development. Previous studies have shown that the eight N&#8208;terminal amino acids (N8) of SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro are essential for its dimerization, and are used to design inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro dimerization. Here, we established a simple readout assay using SDS&#8208;PAGE and Coomassie blue staining to measure inhibitory activity of N8 peptide derived from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. To optimize its inhibitory effect, we then modified the side&#8208;chain length, charge, and hydrophilicity of the N8 peptide, and introduced a mutated Mpro recognition sequence. As a result, we obtained a series of potent peptide inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro, with N8&#8208;A24 being the most efficient with an IC50 value of 1.44 mM. We observed that N8&#8208;A24 reduced Mpro dimerization with an IC50 value of 0.86 mM. Molecular docking revealed that N8&#8208;A24 formed hydrogen bond interactions with critical dimeric interface residues, thus inhibiting its dimerization and activity. In conclusion, our study not only discovers a series of peptide inhibitors targeting the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro dimerization, but also provides a promising strategy for the rational design of new inhibitors against COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the Gap in the Structure&#8211;Function Paradigm of Enzymatic PET Degradation&#8211;Aromatic Residue Driven Balanced Interactions with Catalytic and Anchoring Subsite</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic PET hydrolysis activity is primarily regulated by a delicate equilibrium between binding interactions at the catalytic subsite (S1) and the anchoring subsite (S3), predominantly influenced by the aromatic residues Tyr, Trp, and Phe.







Abstract
Understanding all parameters contributing to enzyme activity is crucial in enzyme catalysis. For enzymatic PET degradation, this involves examining the formation of the enzyme&#8208;PET complex. In IsPETase (WT), a PET&#8208;degrading enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis, mutating two non&#8208;catalytic residues (DM) significantly enhances activity. Such mutations, depending on their position in the tertiary structure, fine&#8208;tune enzyme function. However, detailed molecular insights into these mutations&#8217; structure&#8208;function relationship for PET degradation are lacking. This study characterizes IsPETase's catalytic ability compared to WT TfCut2 using molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical methods. We explore the conformational landscape of the enzyme&#8208;PET complex and quantify residue&#8208;wise interaction energy. Notably, aromatic and hydrophobic residues Tyr, Trp, and Ile in the catalytic subsite S1, and aromatic Phe and polar Asn in the anchoring subsite S3, crucially optimize PET binding. These residues enhance PET specificity over non&#8208;aromatic plastics. Our findings suggest that the balance between binding at subsite S1 and subsite S3, which is influenced by cooperative mutations, underlies catalytic activity. This balance shows a positive correlation with experimentally obtained kcat/Km values: WT TfCut2&lt;WT IsPETase&#8810;DM IsPETase.

         <title>Biotemplated Platinum Nanozymes: Synthesis, Catalytic Regulation and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological templates can guide the formation of Pt nanozymes with specific morphologies and then stabilize them, resulting optimized catalytic performance. This review focuses on biotemplated Pt nanozymes and their biomedical applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for the rational design of Pt nanozymes with robust functionalities for improved practical applications.







Abstract
Platinum (Pt) nanozymes with multiple intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have attracted extensive attention in biomedical fields due to their high catalytic activity, ease of modification, and convenient storage. However, the Pt nanozymes synthesized by the traditional method often suffer from uncontrollable morphology and poor stability under physicochemical conditions, resulting in unsatisfactory catalytic behavior in practical applications. To optimize the catalytic ability, biological templates have been introduced recently, which can guide the deposition of platinum ions on their surface to form specific morphologies and then stabilize the resulting Pt nanozymes. Given the promising potential of biotemplated Pt nanozymes in practical applications, it is essential to conduct a systematic and comprehensive review to summarize their recent research progress. In this review, we first categorize the biological templates and discuss the mechanisms as well as characteristics of each type of biotemplate in directing the growth of Pt nanozyme. Factors that impact the growth of biotemplated Pt nanozymes are then analyzed, followed by summarizing their biomedical applications. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in this field are outlined. This review article aims to provide theoretical guidance for developing Pt nanozymes with robust functionalities in biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum (Pt) nanozymes with multiple intrinsic enzyme-mimicking activities have attracted extensive attention in biomedical fields due to their high catalytic activity, ease of modification, and convenient storage. However, the Pt nanozymes synthesized by the traditional method often suffer from uncontrollable morphology and poor stability under physicochemical conditions, resulting in unsatisfactory catalytic behavior in practical applications. To optimize the catalytic ability, biological templates have been introduced recently, which can guide the deposition of platinum ions on their surface to form specific morphologies and then stabilize the resulting Pt nanozymes. Given the promising potential of biotemplated Pt nanozymes in practical applications, it is essential to conduct a systematic and comprehensive review to summarize their recent research progress. In this review, we first categorize the biological templates and discuss the mechanisms as well as characteristics of each type of biotemplate in directing the growth of Pt nanozyme. Factors that impact the growth of biotemplated Pt nanozymes are then analyzed, followed by summarizing their biomedical applications. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in this field are outlined. This review article aims to provide theoretical guidance for developing Pt nanozymes with robust functionalities in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ubiquitin's Conformational Heterogeneity as Discerned by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Much of our understanding into protein conformational heterogeneity stems from NMR&#8208;based studies of the 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin which is an omni&#8208;present post&#8208;translational modification playing an integral role in ubiquitination, a process regulating nearly all aspects of cellular function. Herein, we discuss 30+ years of NMR research pertaining to ubiquitin's conformational plasticity and suggest new approaches that would allow to better grasp this complex issue, for example by acquiring structural data in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Visualizing a protein's molecular motions has been a long standing topic of research in the biophysics community. Largely this has been done by exploiting nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and arguably no protein's molecular motions have been better characterized by NMR than that of ubiquitin (Ub), a 76 amino acid polypeptide essential in ubiquitination&#8208;a key regulatory system within cells. Herein, we discuss ubiquitin's conformational plasticity as visualized, at atomic resolution, by more than 35&#8197;years of NMR work. In our discussions we point out the differences between data acquired in&#8197;vitro, ex vivo, as well as in&#8197;vivo and stress the need to investigate Ub's conformational plasticity in more biologically representative backgrounds.

         <title>Production of Phenyldiazene Derivatives Using the Biosynthetic Pathway of an Aromatic Diazo Group&#8208;Containing Natural Product from an Actinomycete</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diazo group is an important functional group in organic synthesis because it confers high reactivity to the compounds and has been applied in various chemical reactions, such as the Sandmeyer reaction, Wolff rearrangement, cyclopropanation, and C&#8208;N bond formation with active methylene compounds. Previously, we revealed that 3&#8208;diazoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;DAA), which is potentially produced by several actinomycete species and contains an aromatic diazo group, is a biosynthetic intermediate of avenalumic acid. In this study, we aimed to construct a production system for phenyldiazene derivatives by adding several active methylene compounds to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing recombinant actinomycete. First, acetoacetanilide and its derivatives, which have an active methylene and are raw materials for arylide yellow dyes, were individually added to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing actinomycete. When their metabolites were analyzed, each expected compound with a phenyldiazenyl moiety was detected in the culture extract. Moreover, we established a one&#8208;pot in vitro enzymatic production system for the same phenyldiazene derivatives using a highly reactive diazotase, CmaA6. These results showed that the diazo group of natural products is an attractive tool for expanding the structural diversity of natural products both in vivo and in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Semi&#8208;Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein: Insight into the Chemical Complexity of Synucleinopathies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alpha&#8208;synuclein (aSyn) physiologically is involved in neurotransmitter release, but pathologically aggregates into proteinaceous deposits in the brain, being associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Herein, the various reported synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic routes to obtain wild&#8208;type (WT) and modified aSyn are summarized in order to enlighten their importance for studying the effects of modifications on the structure and aggregation behavior of aSyn.







Abstract
The chemical rules governing protein folding have intrigued generations of researchers for decades. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), prediction of protein structure has improved tremendously. However, there is still a level of analysis that is only possible through wet laboratory experiments, especially in respect to the investigation of the pathological effect of mutations and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on proteins of interest. This requires the availability of pure peptides and proteins in sufficient quantities for biophysical, biochemical, and functional studies. In this context, chemical protein synthesis and semi&#8208;synthesis are powerful tools in protein research, which help to enlighten the role of protein modification in the physiology and pathology of proteins. A protein of high interest in the field of biomedicine is alpha&#8208;synuclein (aSyn), a protein deeply associated with several devastating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple systems atrophy (MSA). Here, we describe several methods and pathways to synthesize native or modified aSyn, and discuss how these approaches enable us to address pathological mechanisms that may open novel perspectives for therapeutic intervention.

         <title>Targeting New Functions and Applications of Bacterial Two&#8208;Component Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are widespread in bacteria, and crucial for their cellular processes. This concept paper focuses on His&#8208;Asp phosphotransfer, the function of ATP synthesis, antimicrobial drug design, cellular biosensors, and protein allostery mechanisms based on recent TCS investigations, aiming to inspire new applications and future research directions.







Abstract
Two&#8208;component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are regulatory systems widely distributed in eubacteria, archaea, and a few eukaryotic organisms, but not in mammalian cells. A typical TCS consists of a histidine kinase and a response regulator protein. Functional and mechanistic studies on different TCSs have greatly advanced the understanding of cellular phosphotransfer signal transduction mechanisms. In this concept paper, we focus on the His&#8208;Asp phosphotransfer mechanism, the ATP synthesis function, antimicrobial drug design, cellular biosensors design, and protein allostery mechanisms based on recent TCS investigations to inspire new applications and future research perspectives.

         <title>Sunflower Pollen&#8208;Derived Microspheres Selectively Absorb DNA for microRNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microsphere (HSEC) with hierarchical structures is developed to selectively absorb polyC and polyA single&#8208;stranded DNA with high efficiency and affinity, particularly in the presence of Ca2+ and under neutral and acidic conditions. The absorption mechanism involves electrostatic and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, highlighting the potential of HSECs for diverse biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.







Abstract
Herein, we report the finding that a naturally sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microspheres (HSECs) with hierarchical structures can selectively absorb polyC and polyA with high efficiency and affinity. HSECs exhibit the capability to selectively absorb polyC and polyA ssDNA under neutral and acidic conditions. It has been observed that the presence of metal cations, specifically Ca2+, enhances the absorption efficiency of HSECs. Mechanically, this absorption phenomenon can be attributed to both electrostatic interactions and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such an appealing property enables the functionalization of HSECs for broad potential biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.

         <title>Broadening The Substrate Scope of Aldolases Through Metagenomic Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence&#8208;based metagenomic approach was used to analyse ten metagenomes and extract putative DERA aldolases with unprecedented activity. We characterized the most promising enzyme by investigating its stability and activity under different conditions including temperature, pH and buffer type. Lastly, these enzymes were tested using furfural and benzaldehyde as acceptors, broadening the substrate scope of this class.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;processes based on enzymatic catalysis play a major role in the development of green, sustainable processes, and the discovery of new enzymes is key to this approach. In this work, we analysed ten metagenomes and retrieved 48 genes coding for deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolases (DERAs, EC 4.1.2.4) using a sequence&#8208;based approach. These sequences were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and screened for activity towards a range of aldol additions. Among these, one enzyme, DERA&#8208;61, proved to be particularly interesting and catalysed the aldol addition of furfural or benzaldehyde with acetone, butanone and cyclobutanone with unprecedented activity. The product of these reactions, aldols, can find applications as building blocks in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Screening was carried out to identify optimized reaction conditions targeting temperature, pH, and salt concentrations. Lastly, the kinetics and the stereochemistry of the products were investigated, revealing that DERA&#8208;61 and other metagenomic DERAs have superior activity and stereoselectivity when they are provided with non&#8208;natural substrates, compared to well&#8208;known DERAs.

         <title>OsO2 as the Contrast&#8208;Generating Chemical Species of Osmium&#8208;Stained Biological Tissues in Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical species that gives rise to the membrane contrast of osmium&#8208;stained biological samples in electron microscopy is identified as OsO2(IV), revealed by characterizing local electronic structure using photoemission electron microscopy. This determination sets the fundamental basis for optimizing staining protocols via intentional synthetic design.







Abstract
Electron imaging of biological samples stained with heavy metals has enabled visualization of subcellular structures critical in chemical&#8208;, structural&#8208;, and neuro&#8208;biology. In particular, osmium tetroxide (OsO4) has been widely adopted for selective lipid imaging. Despite the ubiquity of its use, the osmium speciation in lipid membranes and the process for contrast generation in electron microscopy (EM) have continued to be open questions, limiting efforts to improve staining protocols and therefore high&#8208;resolution nanoscale imaging of biological samples. Following our recent success using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) to image mouse brain tissues with synaptic resolution, we have used PEEM to determine the nanoscale electronic structure of Os&#8208;stained biological samples. Os(IV), in the form of OsO2, generates nanoaggregates in lipid membranes, leading to a strong spatial variation in the electronic structure and electron density of states. OsO2 has a metallic electronic structure that drastically increases the electron density of states near the Fermi level. Depositing metallic OsO2 in lipid membranes allows for strongly enhanced EM signals and conductivity of biological materials. The identification of the chemical species and understanding of the membrane contrast mechanism of Os&#8208;stained biological specimens provides a new opportunity for the development of staining protocols for high&#8208;resolution, high&#8208;contrast EM imaging.

         <title>Continuous Flow Microreactors for the High&#8208;efficiency Enzymatic Synthesis of 10&#8208;Hydroxystearic Acid from Oleic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make oleic acid conversion efficient: This study introduces a continuous flow micro&#8208;reactor (CFMR) that effectively processes oleic acid, enhancing efficiency and overcoming key barriers. The CFMR significantly outperforms traditional reactors, achieving a 91&#8201;% conversionat high concentrations with a yield of 2312&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1, marking a breakthrough in sustainable chemical.







Abstract
Converting fatty acids into specialty chemicals is sustainable but hindered by the low efficiency and thermal instability of current oleic acid hydratases, along with mass transfer limitations in emulsion reactions. This study introduces an optimized continuous flow micro&#8208;reactor (CFMR) that efficiently transforms oleic acid at low (15&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) and high (50&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) concentrations, improving reaction efficiency and overcoming key conversion barriers. The first CFMR model showed reaction speeds surpassing traditional batch stirred tank reactors (BSTR). Optimizations were performed on three key components: liquid storage, mixer, and reaction section of the CFMR, with each round's best conditions carried into the next. This achieved a space&#8208;time yield of 597&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1 at a 15&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 oleic acid load. To further enhance the yield, we optimized the emulsifier system to solve incomplete emulsification and developed a two&#8208;component feed microreactor (TCFMR) that addressed mass transfer limitations caused by the product at high substrate loads, reaching a 91&#8201;% conversion of 50&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 oleic acid in 30&#8197;minutes, with a space&#8208;time yield of 2312&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1. These advancements represent significant progress in utilizing fatty acids and advancing sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Arcyriaflavin F from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the characterisation of the Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712 arcyriaflavin F biosynthetic gene cluster. We express the gene cluster using Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 as a heterologous host, isolate the product and confirm distinct C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217; indole ring hydroxylation catalysed by a regioselective flavoprotein AcfX.







Abstract
Indolocarbazoles are natural products with a broad spectrum of bioactivity. A distinct feature of indolocarbazole biosynthesis is the modification of the indole and maleimide rings by regioselective tailoring enzymes. Here, we study a new indolocarbazole variant, which is encoded by the acfXODCP genes from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712. We characterise the pathway by expressing the acfXODCP genes in Streptomyces coelicolor, which led to the production of a C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;dihydroxylated indolocarbazole, which we assign as arcyriaflavin F. We also show that a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase AcfX catalyses the C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217; dihydroxylation of the unsubstituted arcyriaflavin A into arcyriaflavin F. Interestingly, AcfX shares homology to EspX from erdasporine A biosynthesis, which instead catalyses a single C&#8208;6 indolocarbazole hydroxylation. In summary, we report a new indolocarbazole biosynthetic pathway and a regioselective C&#8208;5 indole ring tailoring enzyme AcfX.

By introducing the biosynthetic pathways for tryptophan halogenation along with the appropriate aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs, cells can be engineered to produce halogenated tryptophans and site&#8208;specifically incorporate them genetically into proteins of interest.







Abstract
Genetic Code Expansion technology offers significant potential in incorporating noncanonical amino acids into proteins at precise locations, allowing for the modulation of protein structures and functions. However, this technology is often limited by the need for costly and challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize external noncanonical amino acid sources. In this study, we address this limitation by developing autonomous cells capable of biosynthesizing halogenated tryptophan derivatives and introducing them into proteins using Genetic Code Expansion technology. By utilizing inexpensive halide salts and different halogenases, we successfully achieve the selective biosynthesis of 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan, and 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan. These derivatives are introduced at specific positions with corresponding bioorthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs in response to the amber codon. Following optimization, we demonstrate the robust expression of proteins containing halogenated tryptophan residues in cells with the ability to biosynthesize these tryptophan derivatives. This study establishes a versatile platform for engineering proteins with various halogenated tryptophans.

         <title>Ursolic Acid Conjugates: A New Frontier in Anticancer Drug Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ursolic acid (UA) conjugates were synthesized through molecular hybridization, targeting C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;28. These conjugates demonstrated improved antiproliferative activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) and bladder cancer cell lines. Notably, compounds 18&#8201;c and 18&#8201;d exhibited significant cytotoxic properties, with 18&#8201;d showing exceptional selectivity for cancer cells over normal epithelial cells. Moreover, 18d demonstrated better pharmacokinetic properties.







Abstract
New Ursolic Acid (UA) conjugates were synthesized using optimized synthetic protocols through the molecular hybridization approach at C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;28. This resulted in the targeted molecules being produced in good yields. Some of the synthesized conjugates showed significantly relevant bioactivity against mammalian cells and in animal models of cancers. Selected UA conjugates were tested against bladder and breast cancer cell lines. The conjugates showed moderate to significantly enhanced antiproliferative activities against Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC; MDA&#8208;MB 231), which is an aggressive tumor making up about 10&#8211;15&#8201;% of all breast cancers and bladder (T24 and 5637) cancer cell lines. These properties were superior to the parent UA. Among all the synthesized compounds, 18&#8201;c and 18&#8201;d have exhibited promising antiproliferative and cytotoxic properties against all tested cancer cell lines. However, 18&#8201;d has proved to be exceptionally selective for cancer cell lines, showing more cytotoxicity towards them than normal epithelial cells (MCF&#8208;12A). Compound 18&#8201;d has demonstrated cytotoxicity against tumor cells, including those intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy drugs such as 2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;deoxy cytidine (Gemcitabine). The activity of the UA conjugates on tumor cells was mediated by multiple cytotoxic mechanisms, including drug&#8208;induced cytotoxic autophagy and programmed cell death, indicating a novel possibility of combination therapy.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Sulfur Peptides Mimicking Ferredoxin for an Efficient Electron Transfer to Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenase enzyme of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii uses photosynthetic electrons received from ferredoxin to produce H2. Ferredoxin maquettes could ehnance the electron transfer. The interface between two canonical iron&#8208;sulfur peptides and hydrogenase is elucidated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Shielding the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster from water lowers the redox potential of the peptide.







Abstract
In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, hydrogenase HydA1 converts protons and electrons to H2 at the H&#8208;cluster, which includes a [4Fe&#8722;4S] cluster linked to a [2Fe] cluster. The yield of H2 is limited by the electron transfer to HydA1, mediated by the iron&#8208;sulfur unit of a photosynthetic electron transfer ferredoxin (PetF). In this study, I have investigated by molecular dynamics and the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method two canonical iron&#8208;sulfur peptides (PM1 and FBM) that hold potential as PetF replacements. Using a docking approach, I predict that the distance between the two iron&#8208;sulfur clusters in FBM/HydA1 is shorter than in PM1/HydA1, ensuring a greater electron transfer rate. This finding is in line with the reported higher H2 production rates for FBM/HydA1. I also show that the redox potential of these peptides, and therefore their electron transfer properties, can be changed by single&#8208;residue mutations in the secondary coordination sphere of their cluster. In particular, I have designed a PM1 variant that disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network between water and the cluster, shifting the redox potential negatively compared to PM1. These results will guide experiments aimed at replacing PetF with peptides that can unlock the biotechnological potential of the alga.

We developed a novel &#8220;acid&#8208;washable&#8221; acyl donor, namely vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate, dedicated to a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. The employed vinyl ester is easy to obtain from commercially available starting materials, allows the synthesis of both enantiomers of a range of structurally diverse benzylic alcohols with high conversions and excellent enantioselectivity, and, most importantly, significantly simplifies enzymatic KR, leading to a more sustainable and ecologically friendly bioprocess. The developed procedure can be applied when classical purification methods fail to separate KR products.







Abstract
The reported chemoenzymatic strategy involves the employment of vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate as an irreversible acyl donor in a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. This biotransformation is achieved in a sequential manner using CAL&#8208;B to affect the kinetic resolution, followed by a simple acidic extractive work&#8208;up furnishing both KR products with excellent enantioselectivity (E&gt;200; up to 98&#8201;% ee). The elaborated method eliminates a single&#8208;use silica gel chromatographic separation and significantly reduces organic solvent consumption to foster a more environmentally friendly chemical industry.

         <title>Chemical Diversity of Aspergillus alliaceus Phenotypes: Discovery of Brominated Bianthrones with Activity against Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Cell Lines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three developmental forms of the marine&#8208;derived fungus Aspergillus alliaceus grown in different media resulted in the isolation and characterization of 14 fungal metabolites, including new brominated polyketides. The allianthrones exhibit selective in&#8197;vitro activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the genome of A.&#8197;alliaceus was sequenced and the bianthrone&#8208;producing biosynthetic gene cluster identified.







Abstract
Marine&#8208;derived fungi have emerged as a source for novel metabolites with a broad range of bioactivities. However, accessing the full potential of fungi under standard laboratory conditions remains challenging. LC&#8211;MS&#8208;based metabolomics in combination with varied culture conditions is a fast and powerful tool to detect new metabolites. Here, three developmental forms of the marine&#8208;derived fungus Aspergillus alliaceus were analyzed and 14 fungal metabolites, including new brominated polyketides (11&#8208;14) were isolated. Structure elucidation relied mainly on 1D and 2D NMR techniques and was supported by low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and DFT&#8208;based computations. We sequenced the A.&#8197;alliaceus genome, identified the bianthrone&#8208;producing biosynthetic gene cluster, and conducted expression analysis on genes involved in sexual development and biosynthesis. The NCI&#8208;60&#8197;cell line panel revealed selective in&#8197;vitro activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) for the halogenated allianthrones and their full antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects were evaluated in five TNBC cell lines.

The allianthrones exhibit selective &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the genome of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;alliaceus&lt;/i&gt; was sequenced and the bianthrone-producing biosynthetic gene cluster identified.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine-derived fungi have emerged as a source for novel metabolites with a broad range of bioactivities. However, accessing the full potential of fungi under standard laboratory conditions remains challenging. LC&#8211;MS-based metabolomics in combination with varied culture conditions is a fast and powerful tool to detect new metabolites. Here, three developmental forms of the marine-derived fungus &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus alliaceus&lt;/i&gt; were analyzed and 14 fungal metabolites, including new brominated polyketides (&lt;b&gt;11-14&lt;/b&gt;) were isolated. Structure elucidation relied mainly on 1D and 2D NMR techniques and was supported by low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry and DFT-based computations. We sequenced the &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;alliaceus&lt;/i&gt; genome, identified the bianthrone-producing biosynthetic gene cluster, and conducted expression analysis on genes involved in sexual development and biosynthesis. The NCI-60&#8197;cell line panel revealed selective &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) for the halogenated allianthrones and their full antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects were evaluated in five TNBC cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Short Oligourea Foldamers as N&#8208; or C&#8208;Caps for Promoting &#945;&#8208;Helix Formation in Water</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locked at either end: The high helix propensity of short oligourea sequences allows efficient capping at both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminus of water&#8208;soluble peptide sequences. This extra&#8208;helical stabilization is a versatile tool for modulating the conformation of bioactive peptides.







Abstract
While foldamers have been extensively studied as protein mimics and especially as &#945;&#8208;helix mimics, their use as capping motif to enhance &#945;&#8208;helix propensity remains comparatively much limited. In this study, we leverage the structural similarities between urea&#8208;based helical foldamers and &#945;&#8208;helix to investigate the efficacy of oligoureas as N&#8208; or C&#8208;caps for reinforcing &#945;&#8208;helical structures in water. Short oligoureas, comprising 3 to 4 residues, were strategically introduced at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus of two peptide sequences (S&#8208;peptide and an Ala&#8208;rich model sequence). The impact of these foldamer insertions on peptide conformation was examined using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and solution NMR. This research identifies specific foldamer sequences capable of promoting &#945;&#8208;helicity when incorporated at either terminus of the peptides. Not only does this work broaden the application scope of foldamers, but it also provides valuable insights into novel strategies for modulating peptide conformation in aqueous environments. The findings presented in this study may have implications for peptide design and the development of bioactive foldamer&#8208;based peptide mimics.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Origami&#8208;Armored DNA Condensates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pickering&#8208;emulsion&#8208;type coating of DNA condensates with 3D DNA origami nanoparticles is reported. By connecting the DNA origami on the DNA condensate surface, named the &#8216;armoring&#8217; process, DNA condensates became sufficiently stable to prevent fusion. Moreover, the armored DNA condensates achieved the selective semipermeability of molecules and multicellular structures of DNA condensates.







Abstract
DNA condensates, formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), emerge as promising soft matter assemblies for creating artificial cells. The advantages of DNA condensates are their molecular permeability through the surface due to their membrane&#8208;less structure and their fluidic property. However, they face challenges in the design of their surface, e.&#8201;g., unintended fusion and less regulation of permeable molecules. Addressing them, we report surface modification of DNA condensates with DNA origami nanoparticles, employing a Pickering&#8208;emulsion strategy. We successfully constructed core&#8208;shell structures with DNA origami coatings on DNA condensates and further enhanced the condensate stability toward fusion via connecting DNA origamis by responding to DNA input strands. The &#8216;armoring&#8217; prevented the fusion of DNA condensates, enabling the formation of multicellular&#8208;like structures of DNA condensates. Moreover, the permeability was altered through the state change from coating to armoring the DNA condensates. The armored DNA condensates have significant potential for constructing artificial cells, offering increased surface stability and selective permeability for small molecules while maintaining compartmentalized space and multicellular organization.

         <title>Complex Formation and Hydrolytic Processes of Protected Peptides Containing the &#8722;SXH&#8722; Motif in the Presence of Nickel(II) Ion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have shown that nickel(II)&#8208;induced hydrolysis of peptides containing &#8722;(S/T)XH&#8722; can take place at room temperatures in equimolar solutions. The hydrolysis can be monitored by CD spectroscopy and HPLC technique, and the measurement conditions that can be used for the further analysis of native protein fragments containing the &#8722;(S/T)XH&#8722; sequence have been determined.







Abstract
Interactions between metal ions and proteins are considered reversible, such as the coordination of a metal ion to a protein or enzyme, but irreversible processes like the oxidative reactions, aggregation or hydrolytic processes may occur. In the presence of Ni(II)&#8208;ions selective hydrolysis of the peptides containing the &#8722;SXH&#8722; or &#8722;TXH&#8722; motif was observed. Since the side chain of histidine serves as the metal ion binding site for many native proteins, and very often histidine is present in a &#8722;SXH&#8722; or &#8722;TXH&#8722; sequence, to study the complex formation and hydrolytic processes in presence of nickel(II) ion four peptides were synthesised: Ac&#8208;SKHM&#8208;NH2, A3SSH&#8208;NH2, A4SSH&#8208;NH2, AAA&#1013;KSH&#8208;NH2. The Ni(II)&#8208;induced hydrolysis of Ac&#8208;SKHM&#8208;NH2 peptide occurs rapidly in alkaline medium already at room temperature. In two peptides containing &#8722;SSH&#8722; sequence on the C&#8208;termini, the N&#8208;terminal part is the major binding site for the nickel(II) ion, but the formation of dinuclear complexes was also observed. In the [Ni2LH&#8722;6]2&#8722; complex of hexapeptide, the coordination sphere of the metal ions is saturated with deprotonated Ser&#8208;O&#8722;, which does not result in hydrolysis of the peptide. For A4SSH&#8208;NH2, both Ni(II) ions fulfill the conditions for hydrolysis, which was confirmed by HPLC analyses at pH&#8197;&#8776;8.2 and 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Photoactivated Anticancer Activity of Cobalt(III) Complexes with Naturally Occurring Flavonoids Chrysin and Silibinin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;ligand dipyridophenazine cobalt(III) complexes, Co5 and Co6, which incorporate the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin and silibinin, respectively, demonstrate significant visible light&#8208;triggered cytotoxicity against HeLa cervical and A549 lung cancer cells. Importantly, these complexes exhibit only minimal toxicity to HPL1D normal lung epithelial cells, suggesting their potential utility in cancer photodynamic therapy applications.







Abstract
Photoactive metal complexes of bioessential transition metal ions with natural chelators are gaining interest as photocytotoxic agents for cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). We report six new cobalt(III) complexes with a mixed&#8208;ligand formulation [Co(B)2(L)](ClO4)2 (Co1&#8211;Co6), where B represents a N,N&#8208;donor &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand, namely, phenanthroline (phen; Co1, Co2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq; Co3, Co4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz; Co5, Co6), and L is the monoanionic form of the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin (chry; Co1, Co3, Co5) and silibinin (sili; Co2, Co4, Co6). Complexes displayed a d&#8208;d absorption band within 500&#8211;700&#8197;nm and exhibited excellent dark and photostability in solution. Cytotoxicity studies indicated significant activity of Co5 and Co6 against cervical (HeLa) and lung (A549) cancer cells under visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) irradiation giving low micromolar IC50 values (2.3&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#956;M, phototoxicity index~15&#8211;30). The complexes demonstrated notably low toxicity against normal HPL1D lung epithelial cells. Flow cytometry assay revealed an apoptotic mode of cell damage triggered by the complexes when irradiated. ROS generation assay indicated the involvement of singlet oxygen species in the cell death mechanism when irradiated with light. Overall, complexes Co5 and Co6 with coordinated dipyridophenazine and flavonoid ligands are potential candidates for cancer PDT applications.

We report six new cobalt(III) complexes with a mixed-ligand formulation [Co(B)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L)](ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Co1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;Co6&lt;/b&gt;), where B represents a N,N-donor &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-diimine ligand, namely, phenanthroline (phen; &lt;b&gt;Co1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Co2&lt;/b&gt;), dipyrido[3,2-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;:2&#8217;,3&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;]quinoxaline (dpq; &lt;b&gt;Co3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Co4&lt;/b&gt;), and dipyrido[3,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;:2&#8217;,3&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]phenazine (dppz; &lt;b&gt;Co5&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Co6&lt;/b&gt;), and L is the monoanionic form of the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin (chry; &lt;b&gt;Co1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Co3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Co5&lt;/b&gt;) and silibinin (sili; &lt;b&gt;Co2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Co4&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Co6&lt;/b&gt;). Complexes displayed a &lt;i&gt;d-d&lt;/i&gt; absorption band within 500&#8211;700&#8197;nm and exhibited excellent dark and photostability in solution. Cytotoxicity studies indicated significant activity of &lt;b&gt;Co5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Co6&lt;/b&gt; against cervical (HeLa) and lung (A549) cancer cells under visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) irradiation giving low micromolar IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values (2.3&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#956;M, phototoxicity index~15&#8211;30). The complexes demonstrated notably low toxicity against normal HPL1D lung epithelial cells. Flow cytometry assay revealed an apoptotic mode of cell damage triggered by the complexes when irradiated. ROS generation assay indicated the involvement of singlet oxygen species in the cell death mechanism when irradiated with light. Overall, complexes &lt;b&gt;Co5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Co6&lt;/b&gt; with coordinated dipyridophenazine and flavonoid ligands are potential candidates for cancer PDT applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The cover image depicts a novel &#8220;acid&#8208;washable&#8221; acyl donor, namely vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate, dedicated to a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. The employed vinyl ester allows the synthesis of both enantiomers of a range of structurally diverse benzylic alcohols with high conversions and excellent enantioselectivity, and, most importantly, significantly simplifies enzymatic KR by eliminating a silica gel chromatographic separation, leading to a more sustainable and ecologically friendly bioprocess.

The article 10.1002/cbic.202400484 by Samya Banerjee, Tukki Sarkar, Akhtar Hussain, and co&#8208;workers highlights the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of six new mixed&#8208;ligand cobalt(III) complexes for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in cancer treatment. Notably, complexes Co5 and Co6, featuring dipyridophenazine and the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin and silibinin, exhibit significant toxicity against cervical and lung cancer cells under visible light with low micromolar IC50 values, while showing minimal toxicity in the absence of light. These complexes induce apoptosis via singlet oxygen generation following a type&#8208;II PDT pathway, displaying remarkable selectivity and biocompatibility for potential cancer PDT applications.

Reviewing computational methods for Enzyme Engineering in the era of Machine Learning: A concise overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods, ranging from property engineering to the de novo design of enzymes, with an emphasis on user&#8208;friendly tools that are freely accessible as web&#8208;interfaces.







Abstract
Enzyme engineering, though pivotal across various biotechnological domains, is often plagued by its time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive nature. This review aims to offer an overview of supportive in silico methodologies for this demanding endeavor. Starting from methods to predict protein structures, to classification of their activity and even the discovery of new enzymes we continue with describing tools used to increase thermostability and production yields of selected targets. Subsequently, we discuss computational methods to modulate both, the activity as well as selectivity of enzymes. Last, we present recent approaches based on cutting&#8208;edge machine learning methods to redesign enzymes. With exception of the last chapter, there is a strong focus on methods easily accessible via web&#8208;interfaces or simple Python&#8208;scripts, therefore readily useable for a diverse and broad community.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Antibiotic Delivery to In Vivo Biofilm Infections: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms pose a significant clinical challenge because they are highly resistant to host immune responses and antibiotic treatments. This review delves into the reasons behind the difficulty in treating biofilms and investigates the potential of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery as a method to address various in vivo biofilm infections.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are a significant concern in various medical contexts due to their resilience to our immune system as well as antibiotic therapy. Biofilms often require surgical removal and frequently lead to recurrent or chronic infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved strategies to treat biofilm infections. Ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery is a technique that combines ultrasound application, often with the administration of acoustically&#8208;active agents, to enhance drug delivery to specific target tissues or cells within the body. This method involves using ultrasound waves to assist in the transportation or activation of medications, improving their penetration, distribution, and efficacy at the desired site. The advantages of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery include targeted and localized delivery, reduced systemic side effects, and improved efficacy of the drug at lower doses. This review scrutinizes recent advances in the application of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery for treating biofilm infections, focusing on in vivo studies. We examine the strengths and limitations of this technology in the context of wound infections, device&#8208;associated infections, lung infections and abscesses, and discuss current gaps in knowledge and clinical translation considerations.

         <title>Unraveling Clinical Glycoproteome by Integrating Affinity Enrichment with Nanopore Sequencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 20, October 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective enlightens the use of enrichment techniques like lectin affinity, boronate affinity, hydrazide chemistry, and molecularly imprinted polymers before nanopore detection to advance clinical glycoproteomics. These methods selectively isolate glycoproteins, removing abundant background proteins. Nanopore technology provides label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time analysis, ensuring optimal sensor function. This combined strategy promises advances in glycosylation research, biomarker discovery, and personalized therapy.







Abstract
This prospect explores the integration of enrichment strategies with nanopore detection to advance clinical glycoproteomics. Glycoproteins, crucial for understanding biological processes, pose challenges due to their low abundance and structural diversity. Enrichment techniques using lectin affinity, boronate affinity, and hydrazide chemistry and especially molecular imprinted polymers may selectively and specifically isolate glycoproteins from complex samples, while nanopore technology enables label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time, and single&#8208;molecule analysis. This approach holds promise for disease&#8208;related glycosylation studies, biomarker discovery, personalized medicine, and streamlined clinical analysis. Standardization, optimization, and data analysis remain challenges, requiring interdisciplinary collaborations and technological advancements. Overall, this integration may offer transformative potential for clinical glycoproteomics and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

         <title>In vivo and in vitro reconstitution of biosynthesis of N&#8208;prenylated phenazines revealing diverse phenazine&#8208;modifying enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenazine natural products play various roles such as signal molecules, antibiotics, or electron carriers in their producer strains. Among these products, phenazinomycin and lavanducyanin, which are produced by Streptomyces species, are characterized by an N&#8208;alkyl modification. Herein, we established the biosynthetic pathways for these two phenazine natural products. Gene&#8208;disruption experiments and in vitro reconstitution of the phenazine&#8208;tailoring pathway revealed the late steps of the biosynthetic pathway of the phenazines. The class II terpene cyclase homolog Pzm1 catalyzes the cyclization reaction of farnesyl diphosphate to form monocyclic farnesyl diphosphate. Additionally, the prenyltransferase homolog PzmP functions as the N&#8208;prenyltransferase of 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid. The flavin monooxygenase homolog PzmS catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of prenylated 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid to yield phenazinomycin. This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for phenazine natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>The Second Methylation in Psilocybin Biosynthesis Is Enabled by a Hydrogen Bonding Network Extending into the Secondary Sphere Surrounding the Methyltransferase Active Site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Psilocybe cubensis SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferase, PsiM, catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of psilocybin. Likely evolved from monomethylating RNA methyltransferases, PsiM acquired a key amino acid exchange in the secondary sphere of the active site, M247N, which is responsible for its capacity to dimethylate. Two variants, PsiMN247M and PsiMN247A, were generated to further examine the role of Asn247 for mono&#8208; and dimethylation in PsiM. Herein, we present the kinetic profiles of both variants and crystal structures at resolutions between 0.9 and 1.0 &#197;. Each variant was crystallized as a ternary complex with the non&#8208;methylated acceptor substrate, norbaeocystin and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine, and in a second complex with the cofactor analog, sinefungin, and the monomethylated substrate, baeocystin. Consistent with the inability of the variants to catalyze a second methyl transfer, these structures reveal catalytically non&#8208;productive conformations and a high level of disorder of the methylamine group of baeocystin. Additionally, both variants exhibit destabilization in the &#946;5&#8208;&#946;7 sheets and a conserved &#946;&#8208;turn of the core Rossmann fold, causing 20&#8208;fold reduced substrate binding and 2&#8208;fold lower catalytic efficiency even with norbaeocystin.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we have successfully synthesized bis (cholesterol&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether)&#8208;pillar[5]arene compound 1 through a click reaction, which could spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers to form ion channel due to the membrane anchor cholesterol group and show significant transport activity of K+ superior to Na+, with a permeability ratio of K+/Na+ equal to 4.58. Compound 1 two crown ether modules act as selective filters similar to natural K+ channel, which are determined to 1:2 binding stoichiometry to K+ by Job&#8217;s plot and NMR titration. This structurally unambiguously unimolecule artificial channel provides ideas for constructing highly K+/Na+ selective molecular filters.</dc:description>

         <title>Multipartite Fluorogenic Sensors for Monitoring Tyrosine Phosphatase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic substrates are essential tools for studying the activity of many enzymes including the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Here, we have taken the first step toward the development of genetically encodable sensors for PTP activity using fluorescent and fluorogen&#8208;activating proteins. The Fluorescence&#8208;Activating and absorption Shifting Tag (FAST) is a small protein that becomes fluorescent upon binding to a small molecule dye. We demonstrate that FAST protein can be used as a sensor for PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of phosphorylated dye molecules. Phosphorylated 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (pHBR) is not able to bind to the FAST protein and induce fluorescence, but provides a sensitive assay for PTP activity, readily detecting 100 pM concentrations of PTP1B in the presence of FAST with a kcat value of 19 &#177; 1 s&#8208;1 and a KM value of 93 &#177; 3 &#181;M. In addition, while phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of split GFP does not result in appreciable change in fluorescence of the reconstituted protein, phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of the split FAST protein abrogates fluorescence. Upon PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide, the ability of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal components to form a fluorescent complex with the small molecule dye is restored, leading to fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>The Anti&#8208;Cancer Stem Cell Properties of Copper(II)&#8208;Terpyridine Complexes with Attached Salicylaldehyde Moieties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis, characterisation, and anti&#8208;breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of two copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes with bidentate salicylaldehyde moieties (2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde for 1 and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde for 2). The copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 are stable in biologically relevant aqueous solutions and display micromolar potency towards breast CSCs. The most effective complex 1 is 5&#8208;fold and 6.6&#8208;fold more potent towards breast CSCs than salinomycin and cisplatin, respectively. The copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 also decrease the formation and viability of three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres within the micromolar range. Notably complex 1 is up to 7&#8208;fold more potent towards mammospheres than salinomycin or cisplatin. Mechanistic studies suggest that the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 are able to readily enter breast CSCs, elevate intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, induce DNA damage (presumably by oxidative DNA cleavage), and evoke apoptosis that is independent of caspases. This study shows that the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine motif is a useful building block for the design of anti&#8208;breast CSC agents and reinforces the therapeutic potential of copper coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Determinants of Product Outcome in Two Sesquiterpene Synthases from the Thermotolerant Bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rubrobacter radiotolerans nerolidol synthase (NerS) and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene synthase (BerS) are among the first terpene synthases (TSs) discovered from thermotolerant bacteria, and, despite sharing the same substrate, make terpenoid products with different carbon scaffolds. Here, the potential thermostability of NerS and BerS was investigated, and NerS was found to retain activity up to 55 &#176;C. A library of 22 NerS and BerS variants was designed to probe the differing reaction mechanisms of NerS and BerS, including residues putatively involved in substrate sequestration, cation&#8208;&#960; stabilisation of reactive intermediates, and shaping of the active site contour. Two BerS variants showed improved in vivo titres vs the WT enzyme, and also yielded different ratios of the related sesquiterpenoids (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;farnesene and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene. BerS&#8208;L86F was proposed to encourage substrate isomerisation by cation&#8208;&#960; stabilisation of the first cationic intermediate, resulting in a greater proportion of trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene. By contrast, BerS&#8208;S82L significantly preferred (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;farnesene formation, attributed to steric blocking of the isomerisation step, consistent with what has been observed in several plant TSs. Our work highlights the importance of isomerisation as a key determinant of product outcome in TSs, and shows how a combined computational and experimental approach can characterise TSs and variants with improved and altered functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expanded Substrate Spectrum of Sulfide:Quinone Oxidoreductase Found in Pollutant&#8208;Degrading Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (Sqr) catalyzes the initial procedure on sulfide transformation, alongside sulfide (H2S, S2&#8208;) oxidization coupled with coenzyme Q (CoQ) reducing and reactive sulfur species (RSS) production. Here, we assessed the reactivity of propanethiol (PT) as an alternative substrate for Sqr to maintain intracellular homeostasis in strain S&#8208;1 capable of degrading emerging sulfur&#8208;containing pollutants. We deleted a gene encoding Sqr, and serial transcriptional difference induced by RSS dynamics was therefore revealed. Next, the reaction properties of two Sqr homologs from strains JMP134 and S&#8208;1 were comparatively characterized, respectively. As a result, an additional role of Sqr in yielding RSS from PT was found in reaction mixture prepared by cell&#8208;free extracts or purified enzymes. Interestingly, the transformation velocity of PT by Sqr was slower than that of sulfides. From this scenario, it was a rate&#8208;determining step that PT as a nucleophilic compound can be added into Sqr cysteine to form disulfide bond and likely serve nonoptimal sulfur recipient. In addition, the role of persulfidation driven by RSS in combating oxidative and sulfur stresses required to be further clarified. Nevertheless, this promiscuity of Sqr&#8208;binding organosulfur compounds and its catalytic modulation underscored that expanded substrates might benefit sulfide homeostasis in thiol&#8208;degrading bacteria.</dc:description>

It has been reported that OGG1 incises the most frequently formed DNA lesion, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, and in the process a stable DNA&#8208;OGG1 cross&#8208;link is formed. However, the chemical structure of the adduct is not characterized. Here, we report that DNA&#8208;OGG1 cross&#8208;links result from cysteine and histidine addition to incised AP sites at 3&#8242;&#8208;DNA termini.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidrug Resistance Reversed by Maleimide Interactions. A Biological and Synthetic Overview for an Emerging Field</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multidrug Resistance (MDR) can be considered one of the most frightening adaptation types in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and eukaryotic cells. It allows the organisms to survive the attack of many drugs used in the daily basis. This force the development of new and more complex, highly specific drugs to fight diseases. Given the high usage of medicaments, poor variation in active chemical cores, and self&#8208;medication, the appearance of MDR is more frequent each time, and has been established as a serious medical and social problem. Over the years it has been possible the identification of several genes and proteins responsible for MDR and with that the development of blockers of them to reach MDR reversion and try to avoid a global problem. These mechanisms also have been observed in cancer cells, and several calcium channel blockers have been successful in MDR reversion, and the maleimide can be found included in them. In this review we explore the history, mechanisms, reversion efforts, and we specifically focused on the maleimide synthesis as MDR&#8208;reversers in co&#8208;administration, as well as their biological applications in a urge to expand the available information and explore a very plausible MDR reversion source</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkylurea ligands as specific activators of human Toll&#8208;like receptor 2/6 heterodimer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands for Toll&#8208;like&#8208;receptor 2 (TLR2) have demonstrated significant potential as immune&#8208;stimulating components in synthetic vaccines. Activation of TLR2 relies on the formation of dimeric complexes with either TLR1 or TLR6 and the nature of these dimers can impact therapeutic outcomes. The lipopeptide&#8208;based TLR2 ligands Pam3CysSK4 and Pam2CysSK4 have been extensively studied, and their recognition by different TLR&#8208;receptor heterodimers, TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6, respectively, has been established. However, the high lipophilicity of these ligands, containing multiple palmitoyl residues, can result in solubility issues when used as vaccine adjuvants. To address this, we previously synthesized a less lipophilic ligand containing a single palmitoyl chain called mini&#8208;UPam, which effectively stimulates human moDC maturation. We here probe the receptor&#8208;dimer specificity of several mini&#8208;Upam derivatives and reveal that these mini&#8208;UPam are hTLR2/TLR6 selective ligands and that the introduction of longer urea alkyl chains does not shift the binding specificity to hTLR2/TLR1 heterodimers, in contrast to their Pam2CysSK4 and Pam3CysSK4 counterparts, pointing to a different binding mode of the UPam ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>A spectroscopic study on the Amyloid&#8208;&#946;&#160;interaction with clicked peptide&#8208;porphyrin conjugates: a vision toward the detection of A&#946;&#160;peptides in aqueous solution.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a multifactorial form of dementia mainly affecting people in the elderly, but no effective cure is available. According to the amyloid hypothesis the aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric toxic species is believed to concur with the onset and progression of the disease heavily. By using a click chemistry approach, we conjugated a suitable designed peptide sequence to a metalloporphyrin moiety to obtain three hybrid peptide systems to be studied for their interact ion with Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides. The aim is to get new tools for the diagnosis and therapy in AD. The results described in this study, which were obtained through spectroscopic techniques (UV&#8208;Vis, CD, Bis&#8208;Ans and intrinsic porphyrin Fluorescence), Microfluidics (GCI) and cell biology (MTT, Live cell imaging and flow cytometry), reveal interesting features about the structure&#8208;activity relationships connecting these conjugates with the interaction with A&#946;, as well as on their potential use as sensing systems. In our opinion the data reported in this paper make the porphyrin&#8208;peptide conjugates highly compelling for further exploration as spectroscopic probes to detect A&#946; biomarkers in biological fluids.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cellular activities are predominantly carried out by proteins that can dynamically adopt different structural conformations and differentially interact with other biomolecules according to cellular needs. Chemical probes are small molecules used to selectively interact and modulate the activities of specific proteins to study their functions such as the validation of potential drug targets. The remarkable performance of AlphaFold algorithms in the prediction of protein structures has pivoted interest toward elucidating the intracellular dynamics of protein structural conformation where covalent modification of proteins by chemical probes could be used to shed light upon. However, due to the barrier to entry by cell membrane and the general unfavorable reactive conditions of the intracellular environment, most studies using reactive chemical probes are still conducted on purified proteins and cell lysates. Nevertheless, recent progresses have been made in designing chemical probes with improved membrane permeability, stability and reactivity. This paper surveys the literature on recent advancements in membrane&#8208;permeable chemical probes and their applications with protein mass spectrometry for the intracellular studies of protein structural conformations and biomolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is crucial for advancing the frontiers of click chemistry. Selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry, a versatile chemistry in click chemistry, represents an all&#8208;encompassing term for nucleophilic substitution events that replace nitrogen at an electrophilic selenium(II) center, enabling the flexible and efficient assembly of linkages around a Se(II) core. Several SeNEx chemistries have been developed inspired by the biochemical reaction between Ebselen and cysteine residue, and demonstrated significant potential in on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, selenium&#8208;containing DNA&#8208;encoded library (SeDEL) synthesis, as well as peptide and protein bioconjugation. This concept aims to present the origins, advancements, and applications of selenium(II)&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry while also outlining the potential directions for future research in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformation for the Preparation of Chromopyrrolic Acid and 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;Chromopyrrolic Acid in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) and its congeners are important intermediates for the biosynthesis and synthesis of various dimeric tryptophan natural products. We have constructed two E. coli strains (CPA001/CPA002) harboring a single plasmid carrying genes coding for a combination of two enzymes (LaStaO/LzrO and VioB) that are able to convert L&#8208;tryptophan (L&#8208;Trp)/5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryotophan (5&#8208;Cl&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) to chromopyrrolic acid (CPA)/5,5&#8217;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid (5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA). Effect on the production of CPA were evaluated by varying the parameters of strain cultivation and biotransformation process. Under the optimized conditions, up to 325 mg/L of CPA and 275 mg/L of 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA could be obtained by supplementing L&#8208;Trp and 5&#8208;Cl&#8208;L&#8208;Trp, respectively, to a working culture of CPA001, or to a phosphate buffer&#8208;resuspended culture of CPA002. The practicability of this whole&#8208;cell biotransformation system could also be served as a potential platform for the preparation of CPA congeners.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural studies and functional validation of Eugenol and Ferulic acid against Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is commonly occurring pathogen&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; associated with nosocomial infections. Infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) nature and their tendency to form biofilms. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches of treatment. In this regard, targeting an important&#160; protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface&#8208;exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it&#8217;s a promising drug target for the development of anti&#8208;microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development.&#160;To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have&#160;purified E. faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA&#916;N59).&#160; Structural studies&#160;along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were done and&#160;confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti&#8208;biofilm assays and inhibition assay of selected ligands were also done against E. faecalis individually and in synergistic combinations.&#160; Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to EfSrtA&#916;N59 with significant interactions and show promising results.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Folding in a Dopamine&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers are often employed as molecular recognition elements in the development of different types of biosensors. Many of these biosensors take advantage of the aptamer having a ligand&#8208;induced structure&#8208;formation binding mechanism. However, this binding mechanism is poorly understood. Here we use isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to study the binding and ligand&#8208;induced structural change exhibited by a dopamine&#8208;binding DNA aptamer. We analysed a series of aptamers where we shorten the terminal stem that contains the 5&#180;&#160;and 3&#180;termini of the aptamer sequence. All aptamers bind dopamine in an enthalpically driven process coupled with an unfavorable entropy. A general trend of the aptamer having a weaker binding affinity is observed as the terminal stem is shortened. For all aptamers studied, numerous signals appear in the imino region of the&#160;1H NMR spectrum indicating that new structure forms with ligand binding. However, it is only when this region of structure formation in the aptamer is brought close to the sensor surface that we obtain a functional electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine learning guided rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;based lysine dioxygenase improves its total turnover number</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective C&#8208;H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure&#8208;based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure&#8208;based machine&#8208;learning algorithm with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before&#8208;hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2&#8208;fold higher yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN = 160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low&#8208;barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre&#8208;existing protein engineering strategies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Highly selective C-H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure-based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure-based machine-learning algorithm with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non-heme iron-dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before-hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2-fold higher yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN = 160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low-barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre-existing protein engineering strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Antimycobacterial Evaluation of Novel Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazolines and Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the synthesis of a new series of pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines, at very good yields, from the cyclocondensation reaction of pyrazole&#8208;enaminones with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Dehydration of the pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines furnished another new series of the respective pyrazole&#8208;isoxazoles, at excellent yields. Both series of the obtained compounds were screened for antimycobacterial activity, and compounds 4f and 5c showed significant inhibition of bacterial growth with a time&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent bactericidal effect. Cytotoxicity tests in VERO cell line did not indicate toxicity of compounds 4f and 5c regarding cellular prediction, NO production or dsDNA release. However, both compounds were associated with an increase in total ROS levels, providing induction of oxidative stress, but without compromising cellular targets. These results highlight compounds 4f and 5c as promising candidates for antimycobacterial treatment with a favorable safety profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Protein Degradation by Smart PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC)&#160;has&#160;emerged&#160;as an attractive therapeutic modality&#160;in drug discovery.&#160;PROTACs are bifunctional molecules&#160;that effectively&#160;bridge proteins of interest&#160;(POIs)&#160;with&#160;E3 ubiquitin ligases, such that,&#160;the target proteins&#160;are&#160;tagged with ubiquitin and subsequently degraded via&#160;the proteasome. Despite significant progress&#160;in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), the application of conventional PROTAC degraders&#160;still faces significant&#160;challenges,&#160;including&#160;systemic toxicity induced by non&#8208;tissue&#8208;specific targeting.&#160;To address this issue, a variety of&#160;smart PROTACs that can be activated by&#160;specific stimuli, have been developed for achieving&#160;conditional and&#160;spatiotemporal modulation&#160;of protein levels.&#160;Here, on the basis of our contributions, we overview recent advances of smart PROTACs, including tumor microenvironment&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;responsive&#160;PROTACs, that enable controllable&#160;TPD. The design strategy, case studies, potential applications and challenges&#160;will be focused on.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a Versatile Immunoproteasome Activity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immunoproteasome (iCP) has gained significant interest in recent years as it has been discovered to be significantly expressed under inflammatory conditions, as well as playing significant roles in several diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, viral infection, and cancer. Selective inhibitors have been generated as a method to overcome the off&#8208;target effects of current proteasome inhibitor therapeutics. However, selective probes that allow for monitoring this protein complex remain limited, hindering our understanding of the iCP. Current probes are non&#8208;selective, not commercially available, or require difficult synthesis. Here, we describe the modular synthesis and application of an iCP&#8208;selective probe. The modular nature of the synthetic strategy can enable the incorporation of different fluorophores and covalent warheads, demonstrating the versatility of this probe.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of O&#8208;acetylation on the antigenicity and glycoconjugate immunogenicity of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 7F capsular polysaccharide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterial pathogen causing diseases as severe as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Commercial pneumococcal conjugate vaccines contain the 7F serotype, which is epidemiologically relevant and highly invasive. This serotype contains an O&#8208;acetyl group at the internal L&#8208;rhamnose of its polysaccharide repeating unit. Herein we report on the role of the O&#8208;acetyl moiety of 7F polysaccharide in both antigen recognition and the induction of a protective antibody response against 7F. Fully and partially de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 7F polysaccharides were chemically prepared and compared with the O&#8208;acetylated counterpart in their antigenicity and immunogenicity of their tetanus toxoid glycoconjugates. These comparative studies showed a slight but consistent decrease in the antigenicity for the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharide, but not for the partly de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated variant. The glycoconjugates derived from the O&#8208;acetylated and the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharides had similar sizes and polysaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;protein ratio, and all proved both to be immunogenic and induce opsonophagocytic responses in mice. Nevertheless, the immune response elicited by the O&#8208;acetylated glycoconjugate was better in both quantity and quality, proving that the O&#8208;acetyl group is not strictly necessary but also not irrelevant for the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the 7F serotype polysaccharide and its glycoconjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic folding strategies for chemical synthesis of disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides and proteins, including hormones, toxins, growth factors, and others, are abundant in living organisms. These molecules play crucial physiological roles such as regulating cell and organism growth, development, and metabolism. They have also found widespread applications as drugs or tool molecules in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. However, the chemical synthesis of disulfide&#8208;bonded proteins is complicated by the challenges associated with their folding. This review focuses on the latest advancements in disulfide&#8208;bonded peptide and protein folding technologies. Particularly, it highlights biomimetic folding strategies that emulate the naturally occurring oxidative folding processes in nature. These strategies include chaperone&#8208;assisted folding, glycosylation&#8208;assisted folding, and organic&#8208;based oxidative folding methods. The review also anticipates future directions in folding technology. Such research offers innovative approaches for the chemical synthesis of complex proteins that are otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable detergents for light&#8208;controlled liposome lysis and channel gating</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation of membrane properties via photoswitchable lipids has attracted attention due to the unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of their functional control. Beside lipids, detergents are another prominent class for selective membrane perturbations owing to their ease of handling and spontaneous insertion in lipid bilayers. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of three classes of visible light&#8208;sensitive surfactants with various azobenzene tail chain lengths. The photoswitchable detergents show water&#8208;solubility and micellization as well as undergo reversible isomerization under blue&#8208;/green light illumination. We demonstrate that the light&#8208;induced structural change of azobenzene can lead to vesicle rupture, making them a tool for controlled cargo release from vehicles. Via spontaneous insertion into the plasma membrane of mammalian cells transiently transfected with MscL, we used the azobenzene&#8208;derived detergents to optically activate the transmembrane mechanosensitive channel. This led to the rapid controlled uptake of membrane&#8208;impermeable molecules. Since detergents are extensively used in biochemistry and biotechnology, we propose that the photoswitchable detergents will be useful tools for the spatiotemporal modulation of membrane properties. Additionally, our work provides a design strategy for new detergents in membrane (protein) research.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Transfection Efficiency of Spermine Polar Head Cholesterol&#8208;based Cationic Lipids with Amino Acid Linker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a series of spermine polar head cholesterol&#8208;based cationic lipids with various amino acid spacers were synthesized and evaluated as non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. The physicochemical properties of the resulting lipoplexes, formed from these lipids and DOPE, were assessed, including zeta&#8208;potential, DNA binding and DNA protection from serum. Transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity were examined under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8208;40% serum&#8208;containing conditions. The results showed that the physicochemical properties of cationic lipids, both with and without amino acid spacers, were not significantly different. Cationic liposomes composed of lipid Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol, which has a 6&#8208;aminohexanoic acid spacer, and DOPE exhibited greater transfection efficiency in HeLa cells compared to Lipofectamine3000, both in the absence and presence of 10&#8208;40% serum. Additionally, lipid Sper&#8208;His&#8208;Chol with a histidine spacer and Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol showed higher efficiency than Lipofectamine3000 against HEK293T under 40% serum conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of amino acids into the cationic lipids can significantly enhance their DNA delivery efficiency. Specifically, certain amino acid modifications improved transfection efficiency while maintaining low cytotoxicity. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;tailored cationic lipids as promising vectors for enhanced DNA delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent labeling of Matrix Metalloproteases with affinity&#8208;based probes containing tuned reactive N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamide cleavable linkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Original covalent probes with an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamide cleavable linker were developed to target a broad set of human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs). The electrophilicity of this cleavable linker was modulated to improve the selectivity of the probes as well as reduce their unspecific reactivity in complex biological matrices. We first demonstrated that targeting the S3&#160;subsite of MMPs enables access to broad&#8208;spectrum affinity&#8208;based probes that exclusively react with the active version of these proteases. The probes were further assessed in proteomes of varying complexity, where human MMP&#8208;13 was artificially introduced at known concentration and the resulting labeled MMP was imaged by in&#8208;gel fluorescence imaging. We showed that the less reactive probe was still able to covalently modify MMP&#8208;13 while exhibiting reduced off&#8208;target unspecific reactivity. This study clearly demonstrated the importance of finely controlling the reactivity of the NASA warhead to improve the selectivity of covalent probes in complex biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Complex&#8208;Gold Nanoparticle Hybrid for Biofilm Inhibition and Eradication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofilms, which are resistant to conventional antimicrobial treatments, pose significant challenges in medical and industrial environments. This study introduces manganese complex&#8208;gold nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;DPA&#8208;AuNPs) as a hybrid strategy for biofilm inhibition and eradication. Upon exposure to green light, these nanoparticles significantly enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. This activity substantially reduces the regrowth potential of the surviving bacteria within the biofilm, with marked efficacy noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. This study highlights the potential of integrating manganese complexes with gold nanoparticles to develop advanced antimicrobial agents against resistant biofilms, offering a promising approach to enhance microbial control in diverse settings.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid conjugation methodologies involves linking the nucleic acid sequence to other (bio)molecules covalently. This typically allows for nucleic acid property enhancement whether it be for therapeutic purposes, biosensing, etc. Here, we report a streamlined aqueous compatible on&#8208;column conjugation methodology using nucleic acids containing a site&#8208;specific amino&#8208;modifier. Both monophosphates and carboxylates were amenable to the conjugation strategy, allowing for the introduction of a variety of useful handles including azide, aryl, and hydrophobic groups in DNA. We find that an on&#8208;column approach is superior to post&#8208;synthetic template&#8208;directed synthesis, mainly with respect to product purification and recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>The industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp derived monosaccharides d&#8208;Galacturonic acid and l&#8208;Arabinose.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review provides a perspective on the industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp (SBP) derived monosaccharides. The broad application of these monosaccharides could contribute to bio&#8208;based alternatives and sustainable practices, essential for the transition towards a more circular economy. This review focuses on the utilization and application of two SBP monosaccharides, d&#8208;galacturonic acid (d&#8208;GalA) and l&#8208;arabinose (l&#8208;Ara), derived from pectin and hemicellulose. These polysaccharides are major components of sugar beet pulp, an important side stream of sucrose production. d&#8208;GalA and l&#8208;Ara are therefore abundant in biomass and offer unique molecular structures amenable to selective chemical or enzymatic modifications. We review their application in various industrial applications such as the development and production of bioactive compounds, home and personal care products, and other industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Amyloid Fibril Formation on Neuronal Cells in the Coexistence of A&#946;40 and A&#946;42</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abnormal aggregation and subsequent deposition of amyloid &#946;&#8208;protein (A&#946;) in the brain are considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The two major species of A&#946; are A&#946;40 and A&#946;42, present at an approximate ratio of 9: 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal membranes are an important platform of amyloidogenesis by A&#946;. However, information on the aggregational behaviors of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 on membranes is lacking. In this study, the aggregation and resultant cytotoxicity of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 at a physiologically relevant ratio were investigated by fluorescence techniques. We found that the degree of coexistence of both A&#946;s in aggregates increased as the assembly proceeded, and reached a maximum in fibrils. However, the cytotoxicity of the mixed fibrils was weaker than that of A&#946;42 fibrils, indicating that A&#946;40 attenuates the toxicity of A&#946;42 by forming mixed fibrils. In contrast, the degree of coexistence was significantly lower in aqueous phase aggregation, highlighting different aggregation mechanisms between in membranes and in the aqueous phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of a New Antitumor Pyranonaphthoquinone from Streptomyces tanashiensis

DSM 731: Insights from Single&#8208;Molecule Stretching Assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guided by molecular networking based on single&#8208;molecule stretching assay, an unprecedented pyranonaphthoquinone, methyl kalafunginate (1) and five known compounds 2&#8211;6 were isolated from Streptomyces tanashiensis&#160;DSM 731. Compound 1 was characterized through a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis, ECD calculation, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Interestingly, we discovered that compound 1 was spontaneously converted from kalafungin (4) in methanol solution. All isolated compounds were assessed for their cytotoxic potential against a panel of five human cancer cell lines: A549, HepG2, BxPC&#8208;3, SW620, and C4&#8208;2B. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 exhibited remarkable cytotoxicity with IC50&#160;values below 2.382 &#956;M, suggesting their potential as promising anticancer agents. These findings  highlight the significance of using a combined approach of single&#8208;molecule stretching assays and molecular networking for efficiently discovering novel natural products with potential therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms in the Synthesis of S&#8208;Alcohols with 1,4&#8208;NADH Biomimetic Co&#8208;factor N&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide using Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase: A Hybrid Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH), was investigated via a hybrid computational approach, for molecular reactions involved in chiral synthesis of S&#8208;alcohols, when the natural co&#8208;factor, 1,4&#8208;dihyronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 1,4&#8208;NADH, was replaced with biomimetic co&#8208;factor, N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide, 1.&#160; We surmised that different hydride and proton transfer mechanisms were involved using co&#8208;factor, 1. An alternative mechanism, where the hydride transfer step occurred, via an &#951;1&#8208;keto&#8208;S&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;5,6&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide&#8208;Zn(II) complex, was previously investigated with a model of the HLADH&#8208;Zn(II) catalytic site (J. Organometal. Chem. 2021, 943, 121810). &#160;Presently, we studied canonical and alternative mechanisms compared to models of the entire enzyme structure. &#160;We disproved the &#951;2&#8208;Zn(II) complex, and discovered a canonical hydride transfer from biomimetic 1,4&#8208;NADH, 1, to the Zn(II) bound prochiral ketone substrate, followed by a new proton relay, consisting of a water chain connecting His51 to Ser48 that accomplished the S&#8208;alkoxy anion&#8217;s protonation to yield the final S&#8208;alcohol product. The HLADH catalysis, with biomimetic co&#8208;factor, 1, that replaced the ribose group, the 5'&#8208;diphosphate groups, and the adenine nucleotide with a N&#8208;benzyl group, has provided a new paradigm for the design of other structures of 1,4&#8208;NADH biomimetic co&#8208;factors, including their economic value in biocatalysis reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Guided Engineering of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase for Aliphatic Ester Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Esters are valuable aroma compounds and can be produced enzymatically by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) from (aliphatic) ketone precursors. However, a genetically encoded biosensor system for the assessment of BVMO activity and the detection of reaction products is missing. In this work, we assembled a synthetic enzyme cascade &#8211; featuring an esterase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, and LuxAB &#8211; in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Target esters are produced by a BVMO, subsequently cleaved, and the corresponding alcohol oxidized through the artificial pathway. Ultimately, aldehyde products are detected in vivo by LuxAB, a luciferase from Photorhabdus luminescens that emits bioluminescence upon the oxidation of aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylates. This biosensor system greatly accelerated the screening and selection of active BVMO variants from a focused library, omitting commonly used low&#8208;throughput chromatographic analysis. Engineered enzymes accepted linear aliphatic ketones such as 2&#8208;undecanone and 2&#8208;dodecanone and exhibited improved ester formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Multiplexed Assessment of Aromatic Prenyltransferase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An increasingly effective strategy to identify synthetically useful enzymes is to sample the diversity already present in Nature. Here, we construct and assay a panel of phylogenetically diverse aromatic prenyltransferases (PTs). These enzymes catalyze a variety of C&#8211;C bond forming reactions in natural product biosynthesis and are emerging as tools for synthetic chemistry and biology. Homolog screening was further empowered through substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening, which provides direct information on enzyme specificity. We perform a head&#8208;to&#8208;head assessment of the model members of the PT family and further identify homologs with divergent sequences that rival these superb enzymes. This effort revealed the first bacterial O&#8211;Tyr PT and, together, provide valuable benchmarking for future synthetic applications of PTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Based Discovery of New Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;dependent fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) hold significant potential for biotechnology, due to their capability to produce alka(e)nes directly from the corresponding (un)saturated natural fatty acids requiring light as the only reagent. This study expands the family of FAPs through cavity&#8208;based enzyme discovery methods. Thirty enzyme candidates with potential photodecarboxylation activity were identified by matching the cavities of four related template structures against the Protein Data Bank's flavoproteins, a library of proteins identified via the Foldseek Search Server, and homology models of sequences resulting from BLAST. Subsequent docking experiments narrowed this library to ten promising enzymes, which were expressed and assessed in vitro, identifying four photodecarboxylases. Out of these enzymes, the GMC oxidoreductase from Coccomyxa sp. Obi (CoFAP) was characterized in detail, which revealed high activity in the decarboxylation reactions of palmitic acid and octanoic acid and a broad pH tolerance (pH 6.5&#8208;9.5).</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical tools for probing the Ub/Ubl conjugation cascades</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) and structurally related ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (Ubl's), essential for many cellular processes, employs muti&#8208;step reactions orchestrated by specific E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. The E1 enzyme activates the Ub/Ubl C&#8208;terminus in an ATP&#8208;dependent process that results in the formation of a thioester linkage with the E1 active site cysteine. The thioester activated Ub/Ubl is transferred to the active site of an E2 enzyme which then interacts with an E3 enzyme to promote conjugation to the target substrate. The E1&#8208;E2&#8208;E3 enzymatic cascades utilize labile intermediates, extensive conformational changes, and vast combinatorial diversity of short&#8208;lived protein&#8208;protein complexes to conjugate Ub/Ubl to various substrates in a regulated manner. In this review, we discuss various chemical tools and methods used to study the consecutive steps of Ub/Ubl activation and conjugation, which are often too elusive for direct studies. We focus on methods developed to probe enzymatic activities and capture and characterize stable mimics of the transient intermediates and transition states thereby providing insights into fundamental mechanisms in the Ub/Ubl conjugation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;specific modification of native IgGs with flexible drug&#8208;load</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous, site&#8208;specifically conjugated antibodies have shown to result in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with improved efficacy and tolerability compared to stochastically conjugated ADCs. However, precisely controlling the drug&#8208;load as well as attaching multiple payload moieties on the antibody remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the simple and direct modification of native IgG&#8208;antibodies at the residue glutamine 295 (Q295) without the need for any protein engineering at flexible drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios of one or multiple payloads. The conjugation is enabled through short, positively charged lysine containing peptides and native, commercially available microbial transglutaminase. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, HER2&#8208;targeting ADCs based on trastuzumab were generated with drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios (DARs) of 2 and 4 of the same or different payloads using orthogonal conjugation chemistries. Quantitative biodistribution studies performed with 111In&#8208;radiolabeled conjugates showed high tumour uptake and low accumulation of radioactivity in non&#8208;targeted tissues. A single dose study of trastuzumab conjugated to the highly potent payload &#945;&#8208;Amanitin demonstrated complete and long&#8208;lasting tumour remissions and was well&#8208;tolerated at all dose levels tested.</dc:description>

However, precisely controlling the drug-load as well as attaching multiple payload moieties on the antibody remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the simple and direct modification of native IgG-antibodies at the residue glutamine 295 (Q295) without the need for any protein engineering at flexible drug-to-antibody ratios of one or multiple payloads. The conjugation is enabled through short, positively charged lysine containing peptides and native, commercially available microbial transglutaminase.

Quantitative biodistribution studies performed with 111In-radiolabeled conjugates showed high tumour uptake and low accumulation of radioactivity in non-targeted tissues. A single dose study of trastuzumab conjugated to the highly potent payload &#945;-Amanitin demonstrated complete and long-lasting tumour remissions and was well-tolerated at all dose levels tested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and antiproliferative activity of cisplatin&#8208;3&#8208;chloropiperidine conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of two novel cisplatin&#8208; alkylating agents conjugates. Combining a platinum based cytostatic agent with a sterically demanding alkylating agent could potentially induce further DNA damage, block cell repair mechanisms and keep the substrate active against resistant tumor cell lines. The 3&#8208;chloropiperidines utilized as ligands in this work are cyclic representatives of the N&#8208;mustard family and were not able to coordinate platinum on their own. The introduction of a second coordination site, in form of a pyridine moiety, led to the isolation of the desired conjugates. They were characterized with HRMS, CHN&#8208;analyses and XRD. We concluded this work by examining the cytotoxicity of the ligands and the obtained complexes with MTT assays in human cancer cell lines. While the ligands showed hardly any activity, the novel conjugates both displayed a high antiproliferative and cytotoxic potency in a panel of three cell lines. Moreover, both complexes were able to largely circumvent the acquired cisplatin resistance of A2780cisR ovarian cancer cells, both in the MTT assay and a flow&#8208;cytometric apoptosis assay.</dc:description>
