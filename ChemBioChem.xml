         <title>Halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole: valuable compounds to access biologically relevant molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;triazole is an important building block in organic chemistry. It is also now well known as bioisostere for various functions, such as the amide or the ester bond, positioning it as key pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry and it has found applications in various fields including life sciences. Attention was first focused on the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole molecules but 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have emerged as valuable molecules due to the possibility to expand the structural modularity. In the last decade, methods mainly derived from the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction have been developed to access halo&#8208;triazole compounds and have been applied to nucleosides, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins. In addition, late&#8208;stage modification of halo&#8208;triazole derivatives by metal&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling or halo&#8208;exchange reactions offers the possibility to access highly functionalized molecules that can be used as a tools for chemical biology. This review summarizes the synthesis, the functionalization, and the applications of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in biologically relevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;conjugated Nanoparticle Platforms for Targeted Delivery, Imaging, and Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides have become an indispensable tool&#160;in engineering of multifunctional nanostructure platforms for biomedical applications such as targeted drug and gene delivery, imaging and biosensing. They can be covalently incorporated into a variety of nanoparticles (NPs) including polymers, metallic nanoparticles, and others. Using different bioconjugation techniques, multifunctional peptide&#8208;modified NPs can be formulated to produce therapeutical and diagnostic platforms offering high specificity, lower toxicity, biocompatibility, and stimuli responsive behavior. Targeting peptides can direct the nanoparticles into specific tissues for targeted drug and gene delivery and imaging applications due to their specificity towards certain receptors. Furthermore, due to their stimuli&#8208;responsive features, they can offer controlled release of therapeutics into desired sites of disease. In addition, peptide&#8208;based biosensors and imaging agents can provide non&#8208;invasive detection and monitoring of diseases including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders. In this review, we covered the design and formulation of recent peptide&#8208;based NP platforms, as well as their utilization in in vitro and in vivo applications such as targeted drug and gene delivery, targeting, sensing, and imaging applications. In the end, we provided the future outlook to design new peptide conjugated nanomaterials for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Circularly Permuted Flavin&#8208;Based Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the rational design and biochemical characterization of a circularly permuted flavin&#8208;binding fluorescent reporter, which is optimized for high fluorescence. Additionally, this work demonstrates the application of this reporter as a genetically encoded sensor for detecting viral protease activity in mammalian cells.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;based fluorescent proteins are oxygen&#8208;independent reporters that hold great promise for imaging anaerobic and hypoxic biological systems. In this study, we explored the feasibility of applying circular permutation, a valuable method for the creation of fluorescent sensors, to flavin&#8208;based fluorescent proteins. We used rational design and structural data to identify a suitable location for circular permutation in iLOV, a flavin&#8208;based reporter derived from A. thaliana. However, relocating the N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini to this position resulted in a significant reduction in fluorescence. This loss of fluorescence was reversible, however, by fusing dimerizing coiled coils at the new N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini to compensate for the increase in local chain entropy. Additionally, by inserting protease cleavage sites in circularly permuted iLOV, we developed two protease sensors and demonstrated their application in mammalian cells. In summary, our work establishes the first approach to engineer circularly permuted FbFPs optimized for high fluorescence and further showcases the utility of circularly permuted FbFPs to serve as a scaffold for sensor engineering.

         <title>Monitoring Anthracycline Cancer Drug&#8208;Nucleosome Interaction by NMR Using a Specific Isotope Labeling Approach for Nucleosomal DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specific isotope&#8208;labeling strategy for nucleosomal DNA is used to monitor the binding of anthracycline cancer drug aclarubicin by NMR. The data highlight intrinsic flexibility in the 601 DNA sequence and indicate that aclarubicin binds first the terminal DNA ends including an exposed AT&#8208;rich segment to then progressively bind inward.







Abstract
Chromatinized DNA is targeted by proteins and small molecules to regulate chromatin function. For example, anthracycline cancer drugs evict nucleosomes in a mechanism that is still poorly understood. We here developed a flexible method for specific isotope labeling of nucleosomal DNA enabling NMR studies of such nucleosome interactions. We describe the synthesis of segmental one&#8208;strand 13C&#8208;thymidine labeled 601&#8208;DNA, the assignment of the methyl signals, and demonstrate its use to observe site&#8208;specific binding to the nucleosome by aclarubicin, an anthracycline cancer drug that intercalates into the DNA minor grooves. Our results highlight intrinsic conformational heterogeneity in the 601 DNA sequence and show that aclarubicin binds an exposed AT&#8208;rich region near the DNA end. Overall, our data point to a model where the drug invades the nucleosome from the terminal ends inward, eventually resulting in histone eviction and nucleosome disruption.

         <title>OptoProfilin: A Single Component Biosensor of Applied Cellular Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor that couples Profilin 1 with blue light responsive Cry2 from Arabidopsis. Upon light activation in HeLa cells, OptoProfilin recruits to focal adhesions when under non&#8208;stress conditions and to condensates under various applied cellular stress conditions. In both cases, Profilin&#8722;VASP interactions are the basis for OptoProfilin recruitment.







Abstract
The actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to ageing, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and viral infection. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin (&#8216;OptoProfilin&#8217;) can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of preexisting work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress&#8208;induced changes in the cytoskeleton.

         <title>Glutamic acid modified gold nanorod sensor for the detection of calcium ions in neuronal cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium ions play a crucial role in the functioning of neurons, governing various aspects of neuronal activity such as rapid modulation and alterations in gene expression. Ca2+ signaling has a significant impact on the development of diseases and the impairment of neuronal functions. Herein, the study reports a Ca2+ ion sensor in neuronal cells using a gold nanorod. The gold nanorod (GA&#8208;GNR) conjugated glutamic acid developed in the study was used as a nano&#8208;bio probe for the experimental and in vitro detection of calcium. The nanosensor is colloidally stable, preserves plasmonic properties, and shows good viability in neuronal cells, as well as promoting neuron cell line growth. The cytotoxicity and cell penetration of the nanosensor are studied using Raman spectroscopy, brightfield and darkfield microscopy imaging, and MTT assays. The quantification of Ca2+ ions in neuronal cells is determined by monitoring the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the GA&#8208;GNR. The change in the intensity profile in the presence of Ca2+ incubated neurons was effectively used to develop a portable prototype of an optical Ca2+ sensor, proposing it as a tool for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and neuromodulation evaluation.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Potential of Phenolic Compounds and Carbohydrates as Acceptor Substrates for Levansucrasse&#8208;Catalyzed Transfructosylation Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study characterizes the acceptor specificity of levansucrases (LSs) from Gluconobacter oxydans (LS1), Vibrio natriegens (LS2), Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (LS3), and Paraburkholderia graminis (LS4) using sucrose as&#160;fructosyl donor and selected phenolic compounds and carbohydrates as acceptors. Overall, V. natriegens LS2 proved to be the best biocatalyst for the transfructosylation of phenolic compounds. More than one fructosyl unit could be attached to fructosylated phenolic compounds. The transfructosylation of epicatechin by P. graminis LS4 resulted in the most diversified products, with up to five fructosyl units transferred. The acceptor specificity of LS towards phenolic compounds and their transfructosylation products were found to greatly depend on their chemical structure: number of phenolic rings,&#160; reactivity of hydroxyl groups and&#160; presence of aliphatic chains or methoxy groups. As for carbohydrates, the transfructosylation yield was more dependent on the acceptor type than LS source. The highest yield of fructosylated&#8208;trisaccharides&#160; was Erlose from the transfructosylation of maltose catalyzed by LS2, with production reaching 200 g/L. LS2 was more selective towards the transfructosylation of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates, while reactions catalyzed by LS1, LS3 and LS4 also produced&#160; fructooligosaccharides. This study shows the high potential for the application of&#160;LSs in the glycosylation of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates.</dc:description>

         <title>High Cell Density Cultivation Combined with high Specific Enzyme Activity: Cultivation Protocol for the Production of an Amine Transaminase from Bacillus megaterium in E. coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fed&#8208;batch protocol is established for the production of an amine transaminase of Bacillus megaterium. Hereby, the main goal is to reach high cell densities accompanied by high titers of active enzyme. Feed rate, inducer concentration, and post&#8208;induction temperature were key parameters of the investigation.







Abstract
High cell density cultivation is an established method for the production of various industrially important products such as recombinant proteins. However, these protocols are not always suitable for biocatalytic processes as the focus often lies on biomass production rather than high specific activities of the enzyme inside the cells. In contrast, a range of shake flask protocols are well known with high specific activities but rather low cell densities. To overcome this gap, we established a tailor&#8208;made fed&#8208;batch protocol combining both aspects: high cell density and high specific activities of heterologously produced enzyme. Using the example of an industrially relevant amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium, we describe a strategy to optimize the cultivation yield based on the feed rate, IPTG concentration, and post&#8208;induction temperature. By adjusting these key parameters, we were able to increase the specific activity by 2.6&#8208;fold and the wet cell weight by even 17&#8208;fold compared to shake flasks. Finally, we were able to verify our established protocol by transferring it to another experimenter. With that, our optimization strategy can serve as a template for the production of high titers of heterologously produced, active enzymes and might enable the availability of these catalysts for upscaling biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Novel Triazole&#8208;Containing &#8220;Dipeptides&#8221;: Synthesis, Molecular Docking and Analgesic Activity Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dipeptides&#8221; of a new structure have been synthesized. Molecular docking has established possible intermolecular interactions of dipeptides with potential targets. The analgesic properties of some synthesized dipeptides were studied and it was found that some compounds have identified antinociceptive activity in the tail flick test, compared with the control group.







Abstract
Dipeptides of a new structure based on &#946;&#8208;triazolalanines and (L)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids were synthesized and optimal conditions were developed that ensure both chemical and optical purity of the final products. Molecular docking was carried out and possible intermolecular interactions of dipeptides with potential targets were established. Based on these studies, the analgesic property of chosen dipeptides was studied and it was found that some compounds possess revealed antinociceptive activity in the tail&#8208;flick test.

         <title>Identification of a 2&#8208;Aminobenzimidazole Scaffold that Potentiates Gram&#8208;Positive Selective Antibiotics Against Gram&#8208;Negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule adjuvants have the potential to expand the spectrum of gram&#8208;positive selective antibiotics to encompass gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We identifiy a series of 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazole (2&#8208;ABI) macrolide adjuvants with activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Preliminary mechanism of action studies suggests that adjuvants bind to lipopolysaccharide in K.&#8197;pneumoniae, and modulate lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, assembly, or transport in A.&#8197;baumannii.







Abstract
The development of novel therapeutic approaches is crucial in the fight against multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, particularly gram&#8208;negative species. Small molecule adjuvants that enhance the activity of otherwise gram&#8208;positive selective antibiotics against gram&#8208;negative bacteria have the potential to expand current treatment options. We have previously reported adjuvants based upon a 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (2&#8208;AI) scaffold that potentiate macrolide antibiotics against several gram&#8208;negative pathogens. Herein, we report the discovery and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) investigation of an additional class of macrolide adjuvants based upon a 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazole (2&#8208;ABI) scaffold. The lead compound lowers the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clarithromycin (CLR) from 512 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/mL at 30&#8197;&#956;M against Klebsiella pneumoniae 2146, and from 32 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/mL at 5&#8197;&#956;M, against Acinetobacter baumannii 5075. Preliminary investigation into the mechanism of action suggests that the compounds are binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in K.&#8197;pneumoniae, and modulating lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis, assembly, or transport in A.&#8197;baumannii.

         <title>Overcoming Solubility Challenges: Liposomal isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole as a Promising Anti&#8208;Tumor Agent for Inoperable and Radiation&#8208;Insensitive cancers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study evaluated the potential of isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole, a diheterocyclic analog of isoCA&#8208;4, as an anti&#8208;tumor agent. To overcome its low aqueous solubility, liposomes were developed as a delivery system for the compound. In vitro experiments showed that loaded liposomes exhibited similar activity to the free form on multiple human tumor cell lines. In vivo experiments using a palliative intratumoral injection chemotherapy approach further demonstrated that isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole loaded liposomes significantly reduced tumor growth in a CA&#8208;4&#8208;resistant HT29 cell model, without inducing any observable toxicity or weight loss in the treated mice. These findings suggest that liposomal isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole may hold promise as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of inoperable, radiation&#8208;insensitive cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;independent CRISPR&#8208;associated protein labeling for presentation and co&#8208;delivery of molecules toward genetic and epigenetic regulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Labeling of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) associated proteins (Cas) is a huge challenge for their genome engineering applications. Cysteine&#8208;mediated bioconjugation is the most efficient strategy for labeling Cas proteins. Introducing a cysteine residue in the protein at the right place might be challenging without perturbing the enzymatic activity. We report a method that does not require cysteine residues for small molecule presentation on the CRISPR&#8208;associated protein SpCas9 for in vitro protein detection, probing cellular protein expression, and nuclear co&#8208;delivery of molecules in mammalian cells. We repurposed a simple protein purification tag His6 peptide for non&#8208;covalent labeling of molecules on the CRISPR enzyme SpCas9. The small molecule labeling enabled us to detect SpCas9 in a biochemical assay. We demonstrate that small molecule labeling can be utilized for probing bacterial protein expression in realtime. Furthermore, we coupled SpCas9&#8217;s nuclear&#8208;targeting ability in co&#8208;delivering the presenting small molecules to the mammalian cell nucleus for prospective genome engineering applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the method can be generalized to label oligonucleotides for multiplexing CRISPR&#8208;based genome editing and template&#8208;mediated DNA repair applications. This work paves the way for genomic loci&#8208;specific bioactive small molecule and oligonucleotide co&#8208;delivery toward genetic and epigenetic regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>PSL Chemical Biology Symposia: Recent Progress in Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not initially planned: While waiting for the large upcoming Ferroptosis event in late 2024 (CSHA,China), this 5th PSL Chemical Biology Symposium, was held at the Institut Curie in Paris on 26th January. This event showed the state of the art in Ferroptosis, an iron&#8208;dependent form of cell death. World&#8208;leading scientists featured the latest innovations and future trends in this innovative and dynamic field related to cancer and degenerative diseases.







Abstract
This symposium is the 5th PSL (Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres) Chemical Biology meeting (2015, 2016, 2019, 2023, 2024) held at Institut Curie. This initiative originally started at Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles (ICSN) in Gif&#8208;sur&#8208;Yvette, with a strong focus on chemistry. It was then continued at the Institut Curie (2015) covering a larger scope, before becoming the official PSL Chemical Biology meeting. This latest edition hosted around 150 participants and was focused on the burgeoning field of ferroptosis, its mechanism and implications in health and disease. While not initially planned, it was felt that the next large Ferroptosis venue (CSHA, China) would not happen before late 2024. A discussion involving Conrad, Birsoy, Ubellacker, Brabletz and Rodriguez next to lake Como in Italy sponsored by the DKFZ, prompted us to fill in this gap and to organize a Ferroptosis meeting in Paris beforehand.

         <title>Exploring a Solvent Dependent Strategy to Control Self&#8208;Assembling Behavior and Cellular Interaction in Laminin&#8208;Mimetic Short Peptide based Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The minimalist laminin&#8208;mimetic peptide hydrogels are being designed utilizing a co&#8208;solvent approach with varying concentrations of DMSO in aqueous medium. Higher concentration of DMSO enhanced the solubility of the hydrophobic peptide and promoted gelator&#8208;gelator interactions, thus forming hydrogels with a higher&#8208;order entangled network with improved mechanical properties. These solvent&#8208;triggered biomimetic self&#8208;assembled hydrogels act as cell&#8208;supportive bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled hydrogels, fabricated through diverse non&#8208;covalent interactions, have been extensively studied in regenerative medicines. Inspired from bioactive functional motifs of ECM protein, short peptide sequences have shown remarkable abilities to replicate the intrinsic features of the natural extracellular milieu. In this direction, we have fabricated two short hydrophobic bioactive sequences derived from the laminin protein i.&#8201;e., IKVAV and YIGSR. Based on the substantial hydrophobicity of these peptides, we selected a co&#8208;solvent approach as a suitable gelation technique that included different concentrations of DMSO as an organic phase along with an aqueous solution containing 0.1&#8201;% TFA. These hydrophobic laminin&#8208;based bioactive peptides with limited solubility in aqueous physiological environment showed significantly enhanced solubility with higher DMSO content in water. The enhanced solubility resulted in extensive intermolecular interactions that led to the formation of hydrogels with a higher&#8208;order entangled network along with improved mechanical properties. Interestingly, by simply modulating DMSO content, highly tunable gels were accessed in the same gelator domain that displayed differential physicochemical properties. Further, the cellular studies substantiated the potential of these laminin&#8208;derived hydrogels in enhancing cell&#8208;matrix interactions, thereby reinforcing their applications in tissue engineering.

         <title>Bacterial Hydrazine Biosynthetic Pathways Featuring Cupin/Methionyl tRNA Synthetase&#8208;like Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like didomain enzymes, also known as hydrazine synthetases, generate amino acid&#8208;based hydrazines, which serve as key biosynthetic precursors of several different N&#8722;N functional groups in natural products. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on hydrazine synthetases, including their reaction mechanisms and divergent pathways occurring after N&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;Nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bond&#8208;containing functional groups in natural products and synthetic drugs play significant roles in exerting biological activities. The mechanisms of N&#8722;N bond formation in natural organic molecules have garnered increasing attention over the decades. Recent advances have illuminated various enzymatic and nonenzymatic strategies, and our understanding of natural N&#8722;N bond construction is rapidly expanding. A group of didomain proteins with zinc&#8208;binding cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like domains, also known as hydrazine synthetases, generates amino acid&#8208;based hydrazines, which serve as key biosynthetic precursors of diverse N&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing functionalities such as hydrazone, diazo, triazene, pyrazole, and pyridazinone groups. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on hydrazine synthetase mechanisms and the various pathways employing this unique bond&#8208;forming machinery.

         <title>U1 snRNP Biogenesis Defects in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism. In several neurodegenerative diseases (SMA, PCH7 and FUS&#8208;ALS), U1 snRNP biogenesis pathway is impaired, reducing U1 snRNP nuclear concentration and triggering changes in neuronal RNA metabolism and activity. There are lines of evidences suggesting that a similar phenomenon could occur in other neurodegenerative diseases like FTLD or AD.







Abstract
The U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) plays a pivotal role in the intricate process of gene expression, specifically within nuclear RNA processing. By initiating the splicing reaction and modulating 3&#8217;&#8208;end processing, U1 snRNP exerts precise control over RNA metabolism and gene expression. This ribonucleoparticle is abundantly present, and its complex biogenesis necessitates shuttling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Over the past three decades, extensive research has illuminated the crucial connection between disrupted U snRNP biogenesis and several prominent human diseases, notably various neurodegenerative conditions. The perturbation of U1 snRNP homeostasis has been firmly established in diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and FUS&#8208;mediated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Intriguingly, compelling evidence suggests a potential correlation in Fronto&#8208;temporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease as well. Although the U snRNP biogenesis pathway is conserved across all eukaryotic cells, neurons, in particular, appear to be highly susceptible to alterations in spliceosome homeostasis. In contrast, other cell types exhibit a greater resilience to such disturbances. This vulnerability underscores the intricate relationship between U1 snRNP dynamics and the health of neuronal cells, shedding light on potential avenues for understanding and addressing neurodegenerative disorders.

&lt;p&gt;U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism. In several neurodegenerative diseases (SMA, PCH7 and FUS-ALS), U1 snRNP biogenesis pathway is impaired, reducing U1 snRNP nuclear concentration and triggering changes in neuronal RNA metabolism and activity. There are lines of evidences suggesting that a similar phenomenon could occur in other neurodegenerative diseases like FTLD or AD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) plays a pivotal role in the intricate process of gene expression, specifically within nuclear RNA processing. By initiating the splicing reaction and modulating 3&#8217;-end processing, U1 snRNP exerts precise control over RNA metabolism and gene expression. This ribonucleoparticle is abundantly present, and its complex biogenesis necessitates shuttling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Over the past three decades, extensive research has illuminated the crucial connection between disrupted U snRNP biogenesis and several prominent human diseases, notably various neurodegenerative conditions. The perturbation of U1 snRNP homeostasis has been firmly established in diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and FUS-mediated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Intriguingly, compelling evidence suggests a potential correlation in Fronto-temporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease as well. Although the U snRNP biogenesis pathway is conserved across all eukaryotic cells, neurons, in particular, appear to be highly susceptible to alterations in spliceosome homeostasis. In contrast, other cell types exhibit a greater resilience to such disturbances. This vulnerability underscores the intricate relationship between U1 snRNP dynamics and the health of neuronal cells, shedding light on potential avenues for understanding and addressing neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Influence of Hemipiperazine Photochromism on the Early Development of Zebrafish Embryo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch me, if you can! Plinabulin is a potent photoswitchable inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. Applied to zebrafish embryos, it can reversibly inhibit their early developmental phase called epiboly. Prolonged exposure to the active Z&#8208;isomer results in abnormal development or death. However, the embryos can be rescued by its light&#8208;driven inactivation to the E&#8208;form. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time a bidirectionally photocontrolled physiological effect inside of a living organism.







Abstract
This study explores the potential of controlling organismal development with light by using reversible photomodulation of activity in bioactive compounds. Specifically, our research focuses on plinabulin 1, an inhibitor of tubulin dynamics that contains a photochromic motif called hemipiperazine. The two isomeric forms, Z&#8208;1 and E&#8208;1, can partially interconvert with light, yet show remarkable thermal stability in darkness. The Z&#8208;isomer exhibits higher cytotoxicity due to stronger binding to &#945;&#8208;tubulin's colchicine site. The less toxic E&#8208;1 form, considered a &#8220;pro&#8208;drug&#8221;, can be isolated in&#8197;vitro and stored. Upon activation by blue or cyan light, it predominantly generates the more toxic Z&#8208;1 form. Here we demonstrate that 1 can effectively photomodulate epiboly, a critical microtubule&#8208;dependent cell movement during gastrulation in zebrafish embryos. This research highlights the potential of photomodulation for precise and reversible control of cellular activities and organismal development.

         <title>Conversion of &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;Glucans to Gentiobiose using an endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;Glucanase PsGly30A from Paenibacillus sp. GKG</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tasty conversion: PsGly30A is an endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase capable of hydrolysing &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucans: yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and pustulan from Lasallia pustulata. The main hydrolysis product is the valuable disaccharide gentiobiose. Gentiobiose is used as a flavour enhancer due to its refreshing bitter taste, similar to chocolate and coffee.







Abstract
A plethora of di&#8208; and oligosaccharides isolated from the natural sources are used in food and pharmaceutical industry. An enzymatic hydrolysis of fungal cell wall &#946;&#8208;glucans is a good alternative to produce the desired oligosaccharides with different functionalities, such as the flavour enhancer gentiobiose. We have previously identified PsGly30A as a potential yeast cell wall degrading &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glycosidase. The aim of this study is to characterise the PsGly30A enzyme, a member of the GH30 family, and to evaluate its suitability for the production of gentiobiose from &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucans. An endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase PsGly30A encoding gene from Paenibacillus sp. GKG has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme has been active towards pustulan and yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan, but not on laminarin from the Laminaria digitata, confirming the endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase mode of action. The PsGly30A shows the highest activity at pH&#8197;5.5 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. The specific activity of PsGly30A on pustulan (1262&#177;82&#8197;U/mg) is among the highest reported for GH30 &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glycosidases. Moreover, gentiobiose is the major reaction product when pustulan, yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan or yeast cell walls have been used as a substrate. Therefore, PsGly30A is a promising catalyst for valorisation of the yeast&#8208;related by&#8208;products.

         <title>Climbing into their Skin to Understand Contextual Protein&#8211;Protein Associations and Localizations: Functional Investigations in Transgenic Live Model Organisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What Stirs Beneath. Understanding protein&#8211;specific interactomes, or localization, is crucial for decoding protein function. New biotinylation methods can do just that even in live organisms. However, these methods have some limitations as they are intrinsically unable to directly probe function. Here new methods that can investigate locale&#8211;specific reactivity, are discussed, opening routes to locale&#8211;specific perturbation of function.







Abstract
Borrowing some quotes from Harper Lee's novel &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird&#8221; to help frame our manuscript, we discuss methods to profile local proteomes. We initially focus on chemical biology regimens that function in live organisms and use reactive biotin species for this purpose. We then consider ways to add new dimensions to these experimental regimens, principally by releasing less reactive (i.&#8201;e., more selective) (preter)natural electrophiles. Although electrophile release methods may have lower resolution and label fewer proteins than biotinylation methods, their ability to probe simultaneously protein function and locale raises new and interesting possibilities for the field.

         <title>Synthesis and Macrodomain Binding of Gln&#8208;carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ADP&#8208;ribosylation of glutamic acid in proteins is key for cell signalling. A stabilized mimic containing carba&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamine is accessible via solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Isothermal calorimetry studies with macrodomain proteins demonstrate that carba&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose is an accurate mimic of the native ADP&#8208;riboside moiety connected to the side chain of glutamine in the same peptide sequence







Abstract
Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a dynamic post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) with important roles in cell signalling. This modification occurs on a wide variety of amino acids, and one of the canonical modification sites within proteins is the side chain of glutamic acid. Given the transient nature of this modification (acylal linkage) and the high sensitivity of ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamic acid, stabilized isosteres are required for structural and biochemical studies. Here, we report the synthesis of a mimic of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide derived from histone H2B that contains carba&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamine as a potential mimic for Glu&#8208;ADPr. We synthesized a cyclopentitol&#8208;ribofuranosyl derivative of 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphoribosylated Fmoc&#8208;glutamine and used this in the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of the carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide mimicking the ADP&#8208;ribosylated N&#8208;terminal tail of histone H2B. Binding studies with isothermal calorimetry demonstrate that the macrodomains of human MacroD2 and TARG1 bind to carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide in the same way as ADPr&#8208;peptides containing the native ADP&#8208;riboside moiety connected to the side chain of glutamine in the same peptide sequence.

&lt;p&gt;ADP-ribosylation of glutamic acid in proteins is key for cell signalling. A stabilized mimic containing carba-ADP-ribosylated glutamine is accessible via solid-phase synthesis. Isothermal calorimetry studies with macrodomain proteins demonstrate that carba-ADP-ribose is an accurate mimic of the native ADP-riboside moiety connected to the side chain of glutamine in the same peptide sequence
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a dynamic post-translational modification (PTM) with important roles in cell signalling. This modification occurs on a wide variety of amino acids, and one of the canonical modification sites within proteins is the side chain of glutamic acid. Given the transient nature of this modification (acylal linkage) and the high sensitivity of ADP-ribosylated glutamic acid, stabilized isosteres are required for structural and biochemical studies. Here, we report the synthesis of a mimic of ADP-ribosylated peptide derived from histone H2B that contains carba-ADP-ribosylated glutamine as a potential mimic for Glu-ADPr. We synthesized a cyclopentitol-ribofuranosyl derivative of 5&#8242;-phosphoribosylated Fmoc-glutamine and used this in the solid-phase synthesis of the carba-ADPr-peptide mimicking the ADP-ribosylated N-terminal tail of histone H2B. Binding studies with isothermal calorimetry demonstrate that the macrodomains of human MacroD2 and TARG1 bind to carba-ADPr-peptide in the same way as ADPr-peptides containing the native ADP-riboside moiety connected to the side chain of glutamine in the same peptide sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering the activity of a newly identified arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase in the acetylation of 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase (AANAT) serves as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of melatonin by transforming 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine (5&#8208;HT) to N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine (NAS), while its low activity may hinder melatonin yield. In this study, a novel AANAT derived from Sus scrofa (SsAANAT) was identified through data mining using 5&#8208;HT as a model substrate, and a rational design of SsAANAT was conducted in the quest to improving its activity. After four rounds of mutagenesis procedures, a triple combinatorial dominant mutant M3 was successfully obtained. Compared to the parent enzyme, the conversion of the whole&#8208;cell reaction bearing the best variant M3 exhibted an increase from 50% to 99% in the transformation of 5&#8208;HT into NAS. Additionally, its catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was enhanced by 2&#8208;fold while retaining the thermostability (Tm &gt; 45 &#176;C). In the up&#8208;scaled reaction with a substrate loading of 50 mM, the whole&#8208;cell system incorporating variant M3 achieved a 99% conversion of 5&#8208;HT in 30 h with an 80% yield. Molecular dynamics simulations were ultilized to shed light on the origin of improved activity. This study broadens the repertoire of AANAT for the efficient biosynthesis of melatonin.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Sildenafil Diazeniumdiolates Acting as Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors and Nitric Oxide Donors&#8722; Towards Wound Healing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NONO to wounds! Inadequate wound healing is a worldwide concern with limited remedies. Low levels of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) worsen wounds and controlling NO release from compounds poses challenges. Sildenafil&#8208;derived PDE5 inhibitors facilitate healing. This research combines NO&#8208;releasing diazeniumdiolates with sildenafil derivatives, resulting in a compound that triggers NO release and effectively inhibits PDE5, showing promise for wound treatments.







Abstract
Inefficient wound healing poses a global health challenge with a lack of efficient treatments. Wound healing issues often correlate with low endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels. While exogenous delivery with NO&#8208;releasing compounds represents a promising therapeutic strategy, controlling the release of the highly reactive NO remains challenging. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, like sildenafil, have also been shown to promote wound healing. This study explores hybrid compounds, combining NO&#8208;releasing diazeniumdiolates with a sildenafil&#8208;derived PDE5 inhibitor. One compound demonstrated a favorable NO&#8208;release profile, triggered by an esterase (prodrug), and displayed in&#8197;vitro nanomolar inhibition potency against PDE5 and thrombin&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. Both factors are known to promote blood flow and oxygenation. Thus, our findings unveil promising prospects for effective wound healing treatments.

         <title>Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant Arylamines Enabled by a Nitroreductase from Bacillus tequilensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylamines are essential building blocks for the manufacture of valuable pharmaceuticals, pigments and dyes. However, their current industrial production involves the use of chemocatalytic procedures with a significant environmental impact. As a result, flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductases (NRs) have received increasing attention as sustainable catalysts for more ecofriendly synthesis of arylamines. In this study, we assessed a novel NR from Bacillus tequilensis, named BtNR, for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant arylamines, including valuable synthons used in the manufacture of blockbuster drugs such as vismodegib, sonidegib, linezolid and sildenafil. After optimizing the enzymatic reaction conditions, high conversion of nitroaromatics to arylamines (up to 97%) and good product yields (up to 56%) were achieved. Our results indicate that BtNR has a broad substrate scope, including bulky nitro benzenes, nitro pyrazoles and nitro pyridines. Hence, BtNR is an interesting biocatalyst for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant amine&#8208;functionalized aromatics, providing an attractive alternative to traditional chemical synthesis methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activatable Photocaged UNC2025 for Triggering TAM Kinase Inhibition in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photopharmacology: three photoactivatable small molecules based on the UNC2025 scaffold were developed for controlling TAM kinase activity in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo assays. The dicaged compound 3 proved to be the most striking with a complete loss of inhibition while recovering full activity upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Photopharmacology is an emerging field that utilizes photo&#8208;responsive molecules to enable control over the activity of a drug using light. The aim is to limit the therapeutic action of a drug at the level of diseased tissues and organs. Considering the well&#8208;known implications of protein kinases in cancer and the therapeutic issues associated with protein kinase inhibitors, the photopharmacology is seen as an innovative and alternative solution with great potential in oncology. In this context, we developed the first photocaged TAM kinase inhibitors based on UNC2025, a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule kinase inhibitor. These prodrugs showed good stability in biologically relevant buffer and rapid photorelease of the photoremovable protecting group upon UV&#8208;light irradiation (&lt;10&#8197;min.). These light&#8208;activatable prodrugs led to a 16&#8208;fold decrease to a complete loss of kinase inhibition, depending on the protein and the position at which the coumarin&#8208;type phototrigger was introduced. The most promising candidate was the N,O&#8208;dicaged compound, showing the superiority of having two photolabile protecting groups on UNC2025 for being entirely inactive on TAM kinases. Under UV&#8208;light irradiation, the N,O&#8208;dicaged compound recovered its inhibitory potency in enzymatic assays and displayed excellent antiproliferative activity in RT112&#8197;cell lines.

Under UV-light irradiation, the &lt;i&gt;N,O&lt;/i&gt;-dicaged compound recovered its inhibitory potency in enzymatic assays and displayed excellent antiproliferative activity in RT112&#8197;cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tripartite Split&#8208;GFP for High Throughput Screening of Small Molecules: A Powerful Strategy for Targeting Transient/Labile Interactors like E2&#8208;E3 Ubiquitination Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the in cellulo tripartite split&#8208;GFP assay for High Throughput Screening (HTS) of small molecules inhibiting an E2&#8208;E3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction (PPI). E3 and E2 are fused to GFP10 and GFP11 tags. When an E3 and an E2 interact, GFP10 and GFP11 come close together and reconstitute functional GFP. Molecules preventing the E2&#8208;E3 interaction prevent the reconstitution of a functional GFP







Abstract
The search for inhibitors of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an expanding area, due to the crucial role of UPS enzymes in several diseases. The complexity of the UPS and the multiple protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) involved, either between UPS proteins themselves or between UPS components and theirs targets, offer an incredibly wide field for the development of chemical compounds for specifically modulating or inhibiting metabolic pathways. However, numerous UPS PPIs are transient/labile, due the processivity of the system (Ubiquitin [Ub] chain elongation, Ub transfer, etc.). Among the different strategies that can be used either for deciphering UPS PPI or for identifying/characterizing small compounds inhibitors, the split&#8208;GFP approach offers several advantages notably for high throughput screening of drugs. Split&#8208;GFP is based on the principle of protein&#8208;fragment complementation assay (PCA). PCA allows addressing PPIs by coupling each protein of interest (POI) to fragments of a reporter protein whose reconstitution is linked to the interaction of the POI. Here, we review the evolution of the split&#8208;GFP approach from bipartite to tripartite Split&#8208;GFP and its recent applicability for screening chemical compounds targeting the UPS.

         <title>Biotin&#8208;Based Strategies to Explore the World of Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin&#8208;Like Modifiers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile biotin&#8208;based tools are highlighted here for studying ubiquitin&#8208; and ubiquitin&#8208;like modifications in cells and organisms. These powerful proteomic methods can eventually be coupled with other chemical biology concepts (e.&#8201;g. induced proximity pharmacology, targeted protein degradation, PROTACs, molecular glues, etc.) for addressing specificity and unraveling mechanisms in the complex ubiquitin signaling system. Created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
A complex code of cellular signals is mediated by ubiquitin and ubiquitin&#8208;like (Ub/UbL) modifications on substrate proteins. The so&#8208;called Ubiquitin Code specifies protein fates, such as stability, subcellular localization, functional activation or suppression, and interactions. Hundreds of enzymes are involved in placing and removing Ub/UbL on thousands of substrates, while the consequences of modifications and the mechanisms of specificity are still poorly defined. Challenges include rapid and transient engagement of enzymes and Ub/UbL interactors, low stoichiometry of modified versus non&#8208;modified cellular substrates, and protease&#8208;mediated loss of Ub/UbL in lysates. To decipher this complexity and confront the challenges, many tools have been created to trap and identify substrates and interactors linked to Ub/UbL modification. This review focuses on an assortment of biotin&#8208;based tools developed for this purpose (for example BioUbLs, UbL&#8208;ID, BioE3, BioID), taking advantage of the strong affinity of biotin&#8208;streptavidin and the stringent lysis/washing approach allowed by it, paired with sensitive mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based proteomic methods. Knowing how substrates change during development and disease, the consequences of substrate modification, and matching substrates to particular UbL&#8208;ligating enzymes will contribute new insights into how Ub/UbL signaling works and how it can be exploited for therapies.

         <title>Formation of Bridged Disulfide in Epidithiodioxopiperazines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epidithiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) alkaloids possess complex structures and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this concept, we summarize the biosynthesis of &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide bridged ETPs and outline the catalytic machineries for the transannular disulfide construction. This will facilitate the medical and industrial applications of ETPs.







Abstract
Epidithiodioxopiperazine (ETP) alkaloids, featuring a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine core and transannular disulfide bridge, exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. However, the structural complexity has prevented efficient chemical synthesis and further clinical research. In the past few decades, many achievements have been made in the biosynthesis of ETPs. Here, we discuss the biosynthetic progress and summarize them as two comprehensible metabolic principles for better understanding the complex pathways of &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide bridged ETPs. Specifically, we systematically outline the catalytic machineries to install &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by flavin&#8208;containing oxygenases. This concept would contribute to the medical and industrial applications of ETPs.

The novel N&#8208;[[4&#8208;(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]methyl]&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinemethanamine (L) coordinates Pt(II) and Pd(II) giving two complexes of formula [MLCl2]. The ligand and Pd(II) complex impaired 65&#8201;% and 59&#8201;%, respectively, of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication at the viable concentrations of 50&#8197;&#956;M. In the in&#8197;vitro antitumor evaluation, Pt(II) complex showed significant cytotoxicity with a GI50 of 10&#8197;&#956;M, and no selectivity in the panel of tumor cells evaluated.







Abstract
Pt(II) and Pd(II) coordinating N&#8208;donor ligands have been extensively studied as anticancer agents after the success of cisplatin. In this work, a novel bidentate N&#8208;donor ligand, the N&#8208;[[4&#8208;(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]methyl]&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinemethanamine, was designed to explore the antiparasitic, antiviral and antitumor activity of its Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes. Chemical and spectroscopic characterization confirm the formation of [MLCl2] complexes, where M=Pt(II) and Pd(II). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed a square&#8208;planar geometry for the Pd(II) complex. Spectroscopic characterization of the Pt(II) complex suggests a similar structure. 1H NMR, 195Pt NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS(+) analysis of DMSO solution of complexes indicated that both compounds exchange the chloride trans to the pyridine for a solvent molecule with different reaction rates. The ligand and the two complexes were tested for in&#8197;vitro antitumoral, antileishmanial, and antiviral activity. The Pt(II) complex resulted in a GI50 of 10.5&#8197;&#956;M against the NCI/ADR&#8208;RES (multidrug&#8208;resistant ovarian carcinoma) cell line. The ligand and the Pd(II) complex showed good anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 activity with around 65&#8201;% reduction in viral replication at a concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Biocatalytic Regioselective O&#8208;acylation of Sesquiterpene Lactones from Chicory: A Pathway to Novel Ester Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the first biocatalytic modification of sesquiterpene lactones (STL) found in chicory plants. Regioselective O&#8208;acylation of their primary alcohol group is achieved by the immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica, with various aliphatic vinyl esters as acyl donors. High conversion rates were observed, facilitating the synthesis of novel semi&#8208;synthetic STL ester derivatives with promising pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
We report the first biocatalytic modification of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) found in the chicory plants, specifically lactucin (Lc), 11&#946;,13&#8208;dihydrolactucin (DHLc), lactucopicrin (Lp), and 11&#946;,13&#8208;dihydrolactucopicrin (DHLp). The selective O&#8208;acylation of their primary alcohol group was carried out by the lipase B from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8208;B) using various aliphatic vinyl esters as acyl donors. Perillyl alcohol, a simpler monoterpenoid, served as a model to set up the desired O&#8208;acetylation reaction by comparing the use of acetic acid and vinyl acetate as acyl donors. Similar conditions were then applied to DHLc, where five novel ester chains were selectively introduced onto the primary alcohol group, with conversions going from &gt;99&#8201;% (acetate and propionate) to 69&#8201;% (octanoate). The synthesis of the corresponding O&#8208;acetyl esters of Lc, Lp, and DHLp was also successfully achieved with near&#8208;quantitative conversion. Molecular docking simulations were then performed to elucidate the preferred enzyme&#8208;substrate binding modes in the acylation reactions with STLs, as well as to understand their interactions with crucial amino acid residues at the active site. Our methodology enables the selective O&#8208;acylation of the primary alcohol group in four different STLs, offering possibilities for synthesizing novel derivatives with significant potential applications in pharmaceuticals or as biocontrol agents.

         <title>13C&#946;&#8208;Valine and 13C&#947;&#8208;Leucine Methine Labeling To Probe Protein Ligand Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel labeling approach introduces isolated 13C&#8722;H spin systems to the methyl&#8208;deuterated side chains of leucine and valine residues. Ligands with known binding geometries have been analyzed in combination with corresponding protein samples, showing that chemical shift perturbation data correlate well with the distance&#8208; and angle parameters of CH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Precise information regarding the interaction between proteins and ligands at molecular resolution is crucial for effectively guiding the optimization process from initial hits to lead compounds in early stages of drug development. In this study, we introduce a novel aliphatic side chain isotope&#8208;labeling scheme to directly probe interactions between ligands and aliphatic sidechains using NMR techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, we selected a set of Brd4&#8208;BD1 binders and analyzed 1H chemical shift perturbation resulting from CH&#8208;&#960; interaction of H&#946;&#8208;Val and H&#947;&#8208;Leu as CH donors with corresponding ligand aromatic moieties as &#960; acceptors.

         <title>Investigating Protein Binding with the Isothermal Ligand&#8208;induced Resolubilization Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal Ligand&#8208;Induced Resolubilization Assay (ILIRA) is a new screening method for identifying protein ligands that relies on differences in solubility between unliganded and liganded proteins under lyotropic stress conditions. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we demonstrate the application of ILIRA to different protein targets and present alternative assay modalities.







Abstract
Target engagement assays typically detect and quantify the direct physical interaction of a protein of interest and its ligand through stability changes upon ligand binding. Commonly used target engagement methods detect ligand&#8208;induced stability by subjecting samples to thermal or proteolytic stress. Here we describe a new variation to these approaches called Isothermal Ligand&#8208;induced Resolubilization Assay (ILIRA), which utilizes lyotropic solubility stress to measure ligand binding through changes in target protein solubility. We identified distinct buffer systems and salt concentrations that compromised protein solubility for four diverse proteins: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), nucleoside diphosphate&#8208;linked moiety X motif 5 (NUDT5), poly [ADP&#8208;ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1), and protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Ligand&#8208;induced solubility rescue was demonstrated for these proteins, suggesting that ILIRA can be used as an additional target engagement technique. Differences in ligand&#8208;induced protein solubility were assessed by Coomassie blue staining for SDS&#8208;PAGE and dot blot, as well as by NanoOrange, Thioflavin T, and Proteostat fluorescence, thus offering flexibility for readout and assay throughput.

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of Azabenzimidazole&#8208;Based PET Radioligands for &#947;&#8208;8 Dependent Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Protein Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azabenzimidazoles&#8208;based18F&#8208;labeled positron emission tomography (PET) ligand ([18F]TARP&#8208;2205) is synthesized and preliminarily evaluated. In vitro autoradiography studies indicate that these PET ligands possess high in&#8197;vitro specific binding to TARP &#947;&#8208;8.







Abstract
AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play a pivotal role in excitatory neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus where the TARP &#947;&#8208;8 subunit is enriched and serves as a target for emerging anti&#8208;epileptic drugs. To enable in&#8197;vivo visualization of TARP &#947;&#8208;8 distribution and expression by positron emission tomography (PET), this study focuses on the development of novel 18F&#8208;labeled TARP &#947;&#8208;8 inhibitors and their corresponding precursors, stemming from the azabenzimidazole scaffold. The resulting radioligands [18F]TARP&#8208;2204 and [18F]TARP&#8208;2205 were successfully synthesized with acceptable radiochemical yield, high molar activity, and excellent radiochemical purity. In vitro autoradiography demonstrates high level of specific binding of [18F]TARP&#8208;2205 to TARP &#947;&#8208;8 in both rat and nonhuman primate brain tissues. However, unexpected radiodefluorination in PET imaging studies of rodents emphasizes the need for further structural refinement. This work serves as an excellent starting point for the development of future 18F&#8208;labeled TARP &#947;&#8208;8 PET tracers, offering valuable insights into medicinal chemistry design, radiosynthesis and subsequent PET evaluation.

A biocatalytic process for synthesizing clinically important indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives using the &#945;&#8208;amylase catalyzed Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehyde, and isocyanide has been developed. Further, &#945;&#8208;amylase from Aspergillus oryzae was immobilized onto magnetic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials [Fe3O4@MIL&#8208;100(Fe)] to make it a robust and reusable catalyst for this transformation.







Abstract
The imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine scaffold has gained significant attention due to its presence as a lead structure in several commercially available pharmaceuticals like zolimidine, zolpidem, olprinone, soraprazan, etc. Further, indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives have been found interesting due to their anticancer and antibacterial activities. However, limited methods have been reported for the synthesis of indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. In this study, we have successfully developed a biocatalytic process for synthesizing indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives using the &#945;&#8208;amylase enzyme catalyzed Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehyde, and isocyanide. The generality and robustness of this protocol were shown by synthesizing differently substituted indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in good isolated yields. Furthermore, to make &#945;&#8208;amylase a reusable catalyst for GBB multicomponent reaction, it was immobilized onto magnetic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials [Fe3O4@MIL&#8208;100(Fe)] and found reusable up to four consecutive catalytic cycles without the significant loss in catalytic activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Amino Acid&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids and Study of the Role of the Cationic Head Group for Enhanced Drug and Nucleic Acid Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positively charged or basic amino acid&#8208;derived cationic amphiphiles exhibit promising outcomes in drug and nucleic acid delivery. Among these, histidine&#8208;containing amphiphiles demonstrate the highest potential in this regard. Notably, the drug and nucleic acid delivery efficiency of these amphiphiles is directly proportional to the number of histidine moieties incorporated. These findings underscore the significance of histidine&#8208;rich structures in optimizing and enhancing the efficacy of drug and nucleic acid delivery systems.







Abstract
Leveraging liposomes for drug and nucleic acid delivery, though promising due to reduced toxicity and ease of preparation, faces challenges in stability and efficiency. To address this, we synthesized cationic amphiphiles from amino acids (arginine, lysine, and histidine). Histidine emerged as the superior candidate, leading to the development of three histidine&#8208;rich cationic amphiphiles for liposomes. Using the hydration method, we have prepared the liposomes and determined the optimal N/P ratios for lipoplex formation via gel electrophoresis. In vitro transfection assays compared the efficacy of our lipids to Fugene, while MTT assays gauged biocompatibility across cancer cell lines (MDA&#8208;MB 231 and MCF&#8208;7). The histidine&#8208;based lipid demonstrated marked potential in enhancing drug and nucleic acid delivery. This improvement stemmed from increased zeta potential, enhancing electrostatic interactions with nucleic acids and cellular uptake. Our findings underscore histidine&#8216;s crucial role over lysine and arginine for effective delivery, revealing a significant correlation between histidine abundance and optimal performance. This study paves the way for histidine&#8208;enriched lipids as promising candidates for efficient drug and nucleic acid delivery, addressing key challenges in the field.

Fatty acids&#8208; and peptide&#8208;functionalized glycerol&#8208;based oligoesters synthesized in this work and their potential applications based on the performed derivatization.







Abstract
Switching from oil&#8208;based to bio&#8208;based feedstocks to ensure the green transition to a sustainable and circular future is one of the most pressing challenges faced by many industries worldwide. For the cosmetics and personal and house care industries there is a strong drive to accelerate this transition from the customers that starts favoring the purchase of naturally derived and bio&#8208;degradable products over the traditionally available products. In this work we developed a series of fully biobased macromolecules constituted of a glycerol&#8208;based oligoester backbone. Based on the subsequent derivatization with fatty acids or peptides, the resulting products may find application as emulsifiers, wetting agents, and potential vectors for the delivery of bioactive peptides. All steps of the resulting macromolecules were conducted following the green chemistry principles with no toxic or environmentally damaging compounds that were used in the overall production process.

         <title>Photo&#8208;affinity and Metabolic Labeling Probes Based on the Opioid Alkaloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leon Duque, Vallavoju, and colleagues report the design and development of photo&#8208;affinity and metabolic labeling probes based on the opioid alkaloids. These chemical probes are used to measure localization and protein interactions in a cellular context by confocal microscopy and chemical proteomics. These insights will inform the development of future probes inspired by the opioid alkaloids.







Abstract
The opioids are powerful analgesics yet possess contingencies that can lead to opioid&#8208;use disorder. Chemical probes derived from the opioid alkaloids can provide deeper insight into the molecular interactions in a cellular context. Here, we designed and developed photo&#8208;click morphine (PCM&#8208;2) as a photo&#8208;affinity probe based on morphine and dialkynyl&#8208;acetyl morphine (DAAM) as a metabolic acetate reporter based on heroin. Application of these probes to SH&#8208;SY5Y, HEK293T, and U2OS cells revealed that PCM&#8208;2 and DAAM primarily localize to the lysosome amongst other locations inside the cell by confocal microscopy and chemical proteomics. Interaction site identification by mass spectrometry revealed the mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein, solute carrier family 25 member 3, SLC25A3, and histone H2B as acylation targets of DAAM. These data illustrate the utility of chemical probes to measure localization and protein interactions in a cellular context and will inform the design of probes based on the opioids in the future.

         <title>A Facile and General Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis Methodology for DNA and RNA</title>

         <dc:description>
Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis (TOS) of (chemically modified) DNA and RNA using a commercially available cleavable linker. We show that the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldiethylene linker is effectively incorporated in DNA/RNA sequences, and efficiently cleaved during standard nucleic acid deprotection protocols. Moreover, we utilize our TOS approach to perform ligation experiments to incorporate N3&#8242;&#8594;P5&#8242; phosphoramidate, and pyrophosphate linkages in DNA strands







Abstract
Tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (TOS) is an attractive strategy to increase automated oligonucleotide synthesis efficiency. TOS is accomplished via the introduction of an immolative linker within a single sequence composed of multiple oligonucleotide fragments. Here, we report the use of a commercially available building block, typically utilized for the chemical phosphorylation of DNA/RNA oligomers, to perform TOS. We show that the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldiethylene linker is efficiently self&#8208;immolated during the standard deprotection of DNA and RNA and presents itself as a generalizable methodology for nucleic acid TOS. Furthermore, we show the utility of this methodology by assembling a model siRNA construct, and showcase a template&#8208;directed ligation pathway to incorporate phosphoramidate or pyrophosphate linkages within DNA oligomers.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of the MIO&#8208;forming Residues of Aromatic Ammonia Lyases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic analysis of protein sequences, several protein clusters of AAL&#8208;like enzymes with unusual MIO&#8208;forming motifs (ACG, TSG, SSG, and CSG) were identified, including two novel HALs with CSG motifs, one PAM with a TSG motif, and three novel ETLs without MIO motif. The systematic study and mutagenesis of MIO&#8208;groups in this work enable thus functional prediction and mutagenesis research of AALs.







Abstract
Aromatic ammonia lyases (AALs) and tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia mutases (TAM/PAM) are 3,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5&#8208;methylidene&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;one (MIO)&#8208;dependent enzymes. Usually, the MIO moiety is autocatalytically formed from the tripeptide Ala&#8208;Ser&#8208;Gly (ASG) and acts as an electrophile during the enzymatic reaction. However, the MIO&#8208;forming residues (ASG) have some diversity in this enzyme class. In this work, a systematic investigation on the variety of MIO&#8208;forming residues was carried out using in&#8208;depth sequence analyses. Several protein clusters of AAL&#8208;like enzymes with unusual MIO&#8208;forming residues such as ACG, TSG, SSG, and CSG were identified, including two novel histidine ammonia lyases and one PAM with CSG and TSG residues, respectively, as well as three novel ergothioneine trimethylammonia lyases without MIO motif. The mutagenesis of common MIO&#8208;groups confirmed the function of these MIO variants, which provides good starting points for future functional prediction and mutagenesis research of AALs.

         <title>Endogenous Production and Vibrational Analysis of Heavy&#8208;Isotope&#8208;Labeled Peptides from Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microcystis aeruginosa cultures were grown in 15N&#8208; and 13C&#8208;enriched medium to produce heavy&#8208;labeled cyanopeptides, which were characterized with vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Up to 98&#8201;% heavy isotope incorporation was observed for the peptides, which displayed strong vibrational bands associated with diene, thiazole, and phenyl functional groups.







Abstract
Stable isotope labeling is an extremely useful tool for characterizing the structure, tracing the metabolism, and imaging the distribution of natural products in living organisms using mass&#8208;sensitive measurement techniques. In this study, a cyanobacterium was cultured in 15N/13C&#8208;enriched media to endogenously produce labeled, bioactive oligopeptides. The extent of heavy isotope incorporation in these peptides was determined with LC&#8211;MS, while the overall extent of heavy isotope incorporation in whole cells was studied with nanoSIMS and AFM&#8208;IR. Up to 98&#8201;% heavy isotope incorporation was observed in labeled cells. Three of the most abundant peptides, microcystin&#8208;LR (MCLR), cyanopeptolin&#8208;A (CYPA), and aerucyclamide&#8208;A (ACAA), were isolated and further studied with Raman and FTIR spectroscopies and DFT calculations. This revealed several IR and Raman active vibrations associated with functional groups not common in ribosomal peptides, like diene, ester, thiazole, thiazoline, and oxazoline groups, which could be suitable for future vibrational imaging studies. More broadly, this study outlines a simple and relatively inexpensive method for producing heavy&#8208;labeled natural products. Manipulating the bacterial culture conditions by the addition of specific types and amounts of heavy&#8208;labeled nutrients provides an efficient means of producing heavy&#8208;labeled natural products for mass&#8208;sensitive imaging studies.

         <title>Front Cover: A Facile and General Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis Methodology for DNA and RNA (ChemBioChem 6/2024)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saraya and O'Flaherty report the use of a commercially available building block, typically used for chemical phosphorylation, to perform Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis (TOS). The TOS strategy allows the facile preparation of multiple DNA/RNA oligomers separated by a cleavable linker. The immolation of these linkers occurs during the standard ammonium hydroxide deprotection. (designed by Tiffany A. Mills). More information can be found in the Research Article by J. S. Saraya, D. K. O'Flaherty.

         <title>How many Mutations are needed to Evolve the Chemical Makeup of a Synthetic Cell?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating new biochemistries in living organisms requires adaptation for learning how to use new resources, a process governed by genetic mutations. When fed with tryptophan analogs, Escherichia coli cells learned to repress their general stress response and other molecular bioprocesses. This discovery creates more opportunities for the incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids with benefits in Xenobiology, Metabolic Engineering and Biocatalysis.







Abstract
The chemical evolution of a synthetic cell endowed with a synthetic amino acid as building block, analog to tryptophan, required the emergence of key mutations in genes involved in, inter alia, the general stress response, amino acid metabolism, stringent response, and chemotaxis. Understanding adaptation mechanisms to non&#8208;canonical biomass components will inform strategies for engineering synthetic metabolic pathways and cells.

This review highlights the key lessons learned on Mo&#8722;Cu interaction in Mo/Cu&#8208;CODH and ORP and how it controls the elevated cellular Cu level involved in WD and cancer through Cu&#8722;TTM therapy.







Abstract
The connection between 3d (Cu) and 4d (Mo) via the &#8220;Mo&#8722;S&#8722;Cu&#8221; unit is called Mo&#8722;Cu antagonism. Biology offers case studies of such interactions in metalloproteins such as Mo/Cu&#8722;CO Dehydrogenases (Mo/Cu&#8722;CODH), and Mo/Cu Orange Protein (Mo/Cu&#8722;ORP). The CODH significantly maintains the CO level in the atmosphere below the toxic level by converting it to non&#8211;toxic CO2 for respiring organisms. Several models were synthesized to understand the structure&#8211;function relationship of these native enzymes. However, this interaction was first observed in ruminants, and they convert molybdate (MoO42&#8722;) into tetrathiomolybdate (MoS42&#8722;; TTM), reacting with cellular Cu to yield biological unavailable Mo/S/Cu cluster, then developing Cu&#8208;deficiency diseases. These findings inspire the use of TTM as a Cu&#8208;sequester drug, especially for treating Cu&#8208;dependent human diseases such as Wilson diseases (WD) and cancer. It is well known that a balanced Cu homeostasis is essential for a wide range of biological processes, but negative consequence leads to cell toxicity. Therefore, this review aims to connect the Mo&#8722;Cu antagonism in metalloproteins and anti&#8208;copper therapy.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Regulators for Gene Switches to Program Mammalian Cell Behaviour</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 6, March 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules have been widely utilized within the synthetic biology community as trigger input for regulating implemented genetic circuit in engineered mammalian cells. Here, we described the most commonly used small molecules and their associated genetic switches, employed to program cell behaviors, particularly within a cell and gene therapy context.







Abstract
Synthetic or natural small molecules have been extensively employed as trigger signals or inducers to regulate engineered gene circuits introduced into living cells in order to obtain desired outputs in a controlled and predictable manner. Here, we provide an overview of small molecules used to drive synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;based gene circuits in mammalian cells, together with examples of applications at different levels of control, including regulation of DNA manipulation, RNA synthesis and editing, and protein synthesis, maturation, and trafficking. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of these small&#8208;molecule&#8208;responsive gene circuits, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of using small molecules as triggers, the mechanisms involved, and the requirements for selecting suitable molecules, including efficiency, specificity, orthogonality, and safety. Finally, we explore potential future directions for translation of these devices to clinical medicine.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Emissive Iridium(III) Complexes and Their Applications in Biological Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorescent iridium(III) complexes are widely recognized for their unique properties in the excited triplet state, making them crucial for various applications including biological sensing and imaging. Most of these complexes display single phosphorescence emission from the lowest&#8208;lying triplet state after undergoing highly efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and ultrafast internal conversion (IC) processes. However, in cases where these excited&#8208;state processes are restricted, the less common phenomenon of dual emission has been observed. This dual emission phenomenon presents an opportunity for developing biological probes and imaging agents with multiple emission bands of different wavelengths. Compared to intensity&#8208;based biosensing, where the existence and concentration of an analyte are indicated by the brightness of the probe, the emission profile response involves modifications in emission color. This enables quantification by utilizing the intensity ratio of different wavelengths, which is self&#8208;calibrating and unaffected by the probe concentration and excitation laser power. Moreover, dual&#8208;emissive probes have the potential to demonstrate distinct responses to multiple analytes at separate wavelengths, providing orthogonal detection capabilities. In this concept, we focus on iridium(III) complexes displaying fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence or phosphorescence&#8208;phosphorescence dual emission, along with their applications as biological probes for sensing and imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Products That Contain Higher Homologated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review focuses on discussing natural products (NPs) that contain higher homologs of amino acids (homoAAs) in the structure as well as the proposed and characterized biosynthesis of these non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids. Homologation of amino acids includes the insertion of a methylene group into its side chain. It is not a very common modification found in NP biosynthesis as approximately 450 homoAA&#8208;containing NPs have been isolated from four bacterial phyla (Cyanobacteria, Actinomycetota, Myxococcota, and Pseudomonadota), two fungal phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), and one animal phylum (Porifera), except for a few examples. Amino acids that are found to be homologated and incorporated in the NP structures include the following ten amino acids: alanine, arginine, cysteine, isoleucine, glutamic acid, leucine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, where isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine share the comparable enzymatic pathway. Other amino acids have their individual homologation pathway (arginine, proline, and glutamic acid for bacteria), likely utilize the primary metabolic pathway (alanine and glutamic acid for fungi), or have not been reported (cysteine and serine). Despite its possible high potential in the drug discovery field, the biosynthesis of homologated amino acids has a large room to explore for future combinatorial biosynthesis and metabolic engineering purpose.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Carbamate Self&#8208;Immolative Spacers Counterintuitively Release 3&#176; Alcohol at Much Faster Rates than 1&#176; Alcohol Payloads</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxy groups of structurally&#8208;similar imidazoquinoline payloads are released with different rates from amine&#8208;carbamate self&#8208;immolative (SI) spacers, depending on the extent of C&#8208;&#945; substitution. Unexpectedly, the 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol payloads are released with much faster rates than the 1&#176; alcohol, which can be uncaged only by a hyper&#8208;reactive SI spacer.







Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative (SI) spacers are degradable chemical connectors widely used in prodrugs and drug conjugates to release pharmaceutical ingredients in response to specific stimuli. Amine&#8208;carbamate SI spacers are particularly versatile, as they have been used to release different hydroxy cargos, ranging from 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohols to phenols and oximes. In this work, we describe the ability of three amine&#8208;carbamate SI spacers to release three structurally similar imidazoquinoline payloads, bearing either a 1&#176;, a 2&#176; or a 3&#176; alcohol as the leaving group. While the spacers showed comparable efficacy at releasing the 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohols, the liberation of the 1&#176; alcohol was much slower, unveiling a counterintuitive trend in nucleophilic acyl substitutions. The release of the 1&#176; alcohol payload was only possible using a SI spacer bearing a pyrrolidine ring and a tertiary amine handle, which opens the way to future applications in drug delivery systems.

         <title>Molecular Driving Forces in the Self&#8208;Association of Silaffin Peptide R5 from MD Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 19&#8208;residue silaffin&#8208;R5 peptide has been widely studied for its ability to precipitate uniform SiO2 particles through mild temperature and pH pathways, in the absence of any organic solvents. There is consensus that post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of side chains has a large impact on the biomineralization process. Thus, it is imperative to understand the precise mechanisms that dictate the formation of SiO2 from R5 peptide, including the effects of PTM on peptide aggregation and peptide&#8208;surface adsorption. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the aggregation of R5 dimer with multiple PTMs, with the presence of different ions in solution. Since this system has strong interactions with deep metastable states, we use parallel bias metadynamics with partitioned families to efficiently sample the different states of the system. We find that peptide aggregation is a prerequisite for biomineralization. We observe that the electrostatic interactions are essential in the R5 dimer aggregation; for wild type R5 that only has positively charged residues, phosphate ions HPO42&#8208; in the solution form a bridge between two peptides and are essential for peptide aggregation.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY Dyad: Enhancing Photodynamic Inactivation via Antenna Effect</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY dyad (P&#8208;BDP) was obtained through covalent bonding, featuring a two&#8208;segment design comprising a light&#8208;harvesting antenna system connected to an energy acceptor unit. The absorption spectrum of P&#8208;BDP resulted from an overlap of the individual spectra of its constituent parts, with the fluorescence emission of the BODIPY unit experiencing significant quenching (96%) due to the presence of the porphyrin unit. Spectroscopic, computational, and redox investigations revealed a competition between photoinduced energy and electron transfer processes. The dyad demonstrated the capability to sensitize both singlet molecular oxygen and superoxide radical anions. Additionally, P&#8208;BDP effectively induced the photooxidation of L&#8208;tryptophan. In suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus cells, the dyad led to a reduction of over 3.5 log (99.99%) in cell survival following 30 min of irradiation with green light. Photodynamic inactivation caused by P&#8208;BDP was also extended to the individual bacterium level, focusing on bacterial cells adhered to a surface. This dyad successfully achieved the total elimination of the bacteria upon 20 min of irradiation. Therefore, P&#8208;BDP presents an interesting photosensitizing structure that takes advantage of the light&#8208;harvesting antenna properties of the BODIPY unit combined with porphyrin, offering potential to enhance photoinactivation of bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Access to Green Fluorescent Albumin Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adduct derivative bearing a triphenylamine moiety is capable of reacting with human serum albumin shifting its emission from the blue to the green&#8208;yellow, leading to green fluorescent albumin (GFA) derivatives, and enlarging the platform of probes for fluorescent&#8208;based detection techniques. The results of investigations on the biological properties suggest that GFA retains the ability of binding drug molecules.







Abstract
A Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adduct (MBHA) derivative bearing a triphenylamine moiety was found to react with human serum albumin (HSA) shifting its emission from the blue to the green&#8208;yellow thus leading to green fluorescent albumin (GFA) derivatives and enlarging the platform of probes for aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescent&#8208;based detection techniques. A possible interaction of MBHA derivative 7 with a lipophilic pocket within the HSA structure was suggested by docking studies. DLS experiments showed that the reaction with HSA induce a conformational change of the protein contributing to the aggregation process of GFA derivatives. The results of investigations on the biological properties suggested that GFA retained the ability of binding drug molecules such as warfarin and diazepam. Finally, cytotoxicity evaluation studies suggested that, although the MBHA derivative 7 at 0.1&#8197;&#956;g/mL affected the percentage of cell viability in comparison to the negative control, it cannot be considered cytotoxic, whereas at all the other concentrations&#8805;0.5&#8197;&#956;g/mL resulted cytotoxic at different extent.

         <title>Development of an Enzyme Cascade System for the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure D&#8208;Amino Acids Utilizing Ancestral L&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8208;Amino acids (D&#8208;AAs) are increasingly recognized as valuable precursors for the synthesis of fine chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and pesticides. This study reports the construction of an enzyme cascade system specifically designed for the synthesis of D&#8208;AAs from their corresponding racemates and L&#8208;isomers. Employing this system, we successfully synthesized seven enantiomerically pure D&#8208;AAs at a preparative scale.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure D&#8208;amino acids hold significant potential as precursors for synthesizing various fine chemicals, including peptide&#8208;based drugs and other pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on establishing an enzymatic cascade system capable of converting various L&#8208;amino acids into their D&#8208;isomers. The system integrates four enzymes: ancestral L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (AncLAAO&#8208;N4), D&#8208;amino acid dehydrogenase (DAADH), D&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and catalase. AncLAAO&#8208;N4 initiates the process by converting L&#8208;amino acids to corresponding keto acids, which are then stereo&#8208;selectively aminated to D&#8208;amino acids by DAADH using NADPH and NH4Cl. Concurrently, any generated H2O2 is decomposed into O2 and H2O by catalase, while GDH regenerates NADPH from D&#8208;glucose. Optimization of reaction conditions and substrate concentrations enabled the successful synthesis of five D&#8208;amino acids, including a D&#8208;Phe derivative, three D&#8208;Trp derivatives, and D&#8208;phenylglycine, all with high enantiopurity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) at a preparative scale (&gt;100&#8197;mg). This system demonstrates a versatile approach for producing a diverse array of D&#8208;amino acids.

We spotlight on in&#8197;vivo methods using E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. cerevisiae as hosts, and highlight the various applications that can be explored after the assembly of large DNA fragments.







Abstract
Synthetic biology, a newly and rapidly developing interdisciplinary field, has demonstrated increasing potential for extensive applications in the wide areas of biomedicine, biofuels, and novel materials. DNA assembly is a key enabling technology of synthetic biology and a central point for realizing fully synthetic artificial life. While the assembly of small DNA fragments has been successfully commercialized, the assembly of large DNA fragments remains a challenge due to their high molecular weight and susceptibility to breakage. This article provides an overview of the development and current state of DNA assembly technology, with a focus on recent advancements in the assembly of large DNA fragments in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, the methods and challenges associated with the assembly of large DNA fragment in different hosts are highlighted. The advancements in DNA assembly have the potential to facilitate the construction of customized genomes, giving us the ability to modify cellular functions and even create artificial life. It is also contributing to our ability to understand, predict, and manipulate living organisms.

         <dc:description>S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) is an important cosubstrate in various biochemical processes, including selective methyl transfer reactions. Simple methods for the (re)generation of SAM analogs could expand the chemistry accessible with SAM&#8208;dependent transferases and go beyond methylation chemistry. Here we present an efficient enzyme engineering strategy to synthesize different SAM analogs from &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; iodoalkanes through enzymatic alkylation of&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH). This was achieved by mutating multiple hydrophobic and structurally dynamic amino acids simultaneously. Combinatorial mutagenesis was guided by the natural amino acid diversity and generated a highly functional mutant library. This approach increased the speed as well as the scale of enzyme engineering by providing a panel of optimized enzymes with orders of magnitude higher activities for multiple substrates in just one round of enzyme engineering. The optimized enzymes exhibit catalytic efficiencies up to 31&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, convert various iodoalkanes, including substrates bearing cyclopropyl or aromatic moieties, and catalyze&#160;S&#8208;alkylation of SAH with very high stereoselectivities (&gt;99%&#160;de). We further report a high throughput chromatographic screening system for reliable and rapid SAM analog analysis. We believe that the methods and enzymes described herein will further advance the field of selective biocatalytic alkylation chemistry by enabling SAM analog regeneration with &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable electrospun scaffolds of polyacrylonitrile loaded with carbon nanotubes: from synthesis to biological applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a multi&#8208;technique analysis, at both supra&#8208;fibre and intra&#8208;fibre scale, of 3D scaffolds structures made of thermally treated PAN electrospun fibres. Our results show that we can propose biocompatible scaffolds presenting the same topology but with different elastic properties. Therefore, these 3D electrospun PAN fibres scaffolds are a precious tool for the in&#8197;vitro study of many cell types.







Abstract
Growing cells in a biomimetic environment is critical for tissue engineering as well as for studying the cell biology underlying disease mechanisms. To this aim a range of 3D matrices have been developed, from hydrogels to decellularized matrices. They need to mimic the extracellular matrix to ensure the optimal growth and function of cells. Electrospinning has gained in popularity due to its capacity to individually tune chemistry and mechanical properties and as such influence cell attachment, differentiation or maturation. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) derived electrospun fibres scaffolds have shown exciting potential due to reports of mechanical tunability and biocompatibility. Building on previous work we fabricate here a range of PAN fibre scaffolds with different concentrations of carbon nanotubes. We characterize them in&#8208;depth in respect to their structure, surface chemistry and mechanical properties, using scanning electron microscopy, image processing, ultramicrotomic transmission electron microscopy, x&#8208;ray nanotomography, infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation. Together the data demonstrate this approach to enable finetuning the mechanical properties, while keeping the structure and chemistry unaltered and hence offering ideal properties for comparative studies of the cellular mechanobiology. Finally, we confirm the biocompatibility of the scaffolds using primary rat cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle (A7r5) and myoblast (C2C12) cell lines.

         <title>Photoisomerization and Light&#8208;Controlled Antibacterial Activity of Fluoroquinolone&#8208;Azoisoxazole Hybrids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable antibiotic hybrids: Potentials for creating phtoswitchable antibiotic hybrids using norfloxacin/ciproflocacin and azoisoxazole (photoswitch) pharmacophores have been explored. Against Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, all hybrids in their trans states exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to the parent drugs. Notably, the potency of the irradiated state (cis isomer) of a hybrid was found to be 2&#8208;fold lower than the nonirradiated state (trans isomer).







Abstract
Photopharmacology holds a huge untapped potential to locally treat diseases involving photoswitchable drugs via the elimination of drugs&#8217; off&#8208;target effects. The growth of this field has created a pressing demand to develop such light&#8208;active drugs. We explored the potential for creating photoswitchable antibiotic hybrids by attaching pharmacophores norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin and azoisoxazole (photoswitch). All compounds exhibited a moderate to a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, long thermal cis half&#8208;lives, and impressive photoresistance. Gram&#8208;negative pathogens were found to be insensitive to these hybrids, while against Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, all hybrids in their trans states exhibited antibacterial activity that is comparable to that of the parent drugs. Notably, the toxicity of the irradiated hybrid 6 was found to be 2&#8208;fold lower than the nonirradiated trans isomer, indicating that the pre&#8208;inactivated cis&#8208;enriched drug can be employed for the site&#8208;specific treatment of bacterial infection using light, which could potentially eliminate the unwanted exposure of toxic antibiotics to both beneficial and untargeted harmful microbes in our body. Molecular docking revealed different binding affinity of the cis and trans isomers with the topoisomerase IV enzyme, due to their different shapes.

         <title>Ether Bond Cleavage of a Phenylcoumaran &#946;&#8208;5 Lignin Model Compound and Polymeric Lignin Catalysed by a LigE&#8208;type Etherase from Agrobacterium sp.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LigE&#8208;type beta&#8208;etherase enzyme from lignin&#8208;degrading Agrobacterium sp. Is found to convert a phenylcoumaran &#946;&#8208;5 lignin dimer into a cis&#8208;stilbene, alkene and ketone products, via reaction of glutathione at the &#945; position, the first example of an etherase enzyme attacking the &#945; position of a &#946;&#8208;5 unit.







Abstract
A LigE&#8208;type beta&#8208;etherase enzyme from lignin&#8208;degrading Agrobacterium sp. has been identified, which assists degradation of polymeric lignins. Testing against lignin dimer model compounds revealed that it does not catalyse the previously reported reaction of Sphingobium SYK&#8208;6 LigE, but instead shows activity for a &#946;&#8208;5 phenylcoumaran lignin dimer. The reaction products did not contain glutathione, indicating a catalytic role for reduced glutathione in this enzyme. Three reaction products were identified: the major product was a cis&#8208;stilbene arising from C&#8722;C fragmentation involving loss of formaldehyde; two minor products were an alkene arising from elimination of glutathione, and an oxidised ketone, proposed to arise from reaction of an intermediate with molecular oxygen. Testing of the recombinant enzyme against a soda lignin revealed the formation of new signals by two&#8208;dimensional NMR analysis, whose chemical shifts are consistent with the formation of a stilbene unit in polymeric lignin.

         <title>Phylogeny&#8208;guided Characterization of Bacterial Hydrazine Biosynthesis Mediated by Cupin/methionyl tRNA Synthetase&#8208;like Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent N&#8208;monooxygenases and cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;like enzymes (hydrazine synthetases) are two key components of bacterial hydrazine biosynthetic pathways. Phylogenetic analysis of these two enzyme families provided a global perspective on the diversity of bacterial hydrazine biosynthesis. A phylogeny&#8208;guided enzyme&#8208;mining approach led to the identification of new bacterial hydrazines, including those based on 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane and putrescine.







Abstract
Cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like didomain enzymes catalyze nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bond formation between N&#969;&#8208;hydroxylamines and amino acids to generate hydrazines, key biosynthetic intermediates of various natural products containing N&#8722;N bonds. While the combination of these two building blocks leads to the creation of diverse hydrazine products, the full extent of their structural diversity remains largely unknown. To explore this, we herein conducted phylogeny&#8208;guided genome&#8208;mining of related hydrazine biosynthetic pathways consisting of two enzymes: flavin&#8208;dependent N&#969;&#8208;hydroxylating monooxygenases (NMOs) that produce N&#969;&#8208;hydroxylamine precursors and cupin/MetRS&#8208;like enzymes that couple the N&#969;&#8208;hydroxylamines with amino acids via N&#8722;N bonds. A phylogenetic analysis identified the largely unexplored sequence spaces of these enzyme families. The biochemical characterization of NMOs demonstrated their capabilities to produce various N&#969;&#8208;hydroxylamines, including those previously not known as precursors of N&#8722;N bonds. Furthermore, the characterization of cupin/MetRS&#8208;like enzymes identified five new hydrazine products with novel combinations of building blocks, including one containing non&#8208;amino acid building blocks: 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane and putrescine. This study substantially expanded the variety of N&#8722;N bond forming pathways mediated by cupin/MetRS&#8208;like enzymes.

         <title>Bioluminescence

The Vibrant Glow of Nature and its Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioluminescence, the mesmerizing natural phenomenon where living organisms produce light through chemical reactions, has long captivated scientists and laypersons alike, offering a rich tapestry of insights into biological function, ecology, evolution as well as the underlying chemistry.
This comprehensive review systematically explores the phenomenon of bioluminescence, addressing its historical context, geographic dispersion, and ecological significance with a focus on their chemical mechanisms.
We discuss terrestrial bioluminescence in various habitats, including fireflies in Central Europe, luminescent fungi in Brazil's Atlantic rainforest, and glowing species in New Zealand's Waitomo Caves and the Siberian Steppes. The marine section covers deep&#8208;sea jellyfish, seasonal bioluminescence in Japan's Toyama Bay, and symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria. Each organism's discovery, ecological function, and distribution are detailed, emphasizing the chemistry behind their luminescence. We conclude with practical experiments in bioluminescence and chemiluminescence for educational purposes.
Our goal with this review is to provide a summary of bioluminescence across the diverse ecological contexts, contributing to the broader understanding of this unique biological phenomenon and its chemical mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding dynamics of a stapled peptide targeting the transcription factor NF&#8208;Y</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in gene regulation, and their malfunction can result in a plethora of severe diseases. TFs are therefore interesting therapeutic targets, but their involvement in protein&#8208;protein interaction networks and the frequent lack of well&#8208;defined binding pockets render them challenging targets for classical small molecules. As an alternative, peptide&#8208;based scaffolds have proven useful, in particular with an &#945;&#8208;helical active conformation. Peptide&#8208;based strategies often require extensive structural optimization efforts, which could benefit from a more detailed understanding of the dynamics in inhibitor/protein interactions. In this study, we investigate how truncated stapled &#945;&#8208;helical peptides interact with the transcription factor Nuclear Factor&#8208;Y (NF&#8208;Y). We identified a 13&#8208;mer minimal binding core region, for which two crystal structures with an altered C&#8208;terminal peptide conformation when bound to NF&#8208;Y were obtained. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the C&#8208;terminal part of the stapled peptide is indeed relatively flexible while still showing defined interactions with NF&#8208;Y. Our findings highlight the importance of flexibility in the bound state of peptides, which can contribute to overall binding affinity.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for the Construction of Multicyclic Phage Display Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide therapeutics have gained great interest due to their multiple advantages over small molecule and antibody&#8208;based drugs. Peptide drugs are easier to synthesize, have the potential for oral bioavailability, and are large enough to target protein&#8208;protein interactions that are undruggable by small molecules. However, two major limitations have made it difficult to develop novel peptide therapeutics not derived from natural products, including the metabolic instability of peptides and the difficulty of reaching antibody&#8208;like potencies and specificities. Compared to linear and disulfide&#8208;monocyclized peptides, multicyclic peptides can provide increased conformational rigidity, enhanced metabolic stability, and higher potency in inhibiting protein&#8208;protein interactions. The identification of novel multicyclic peptide binders can be difficult, however, recent advancements in the construction of multicyclic phage libraries have greatly advanced the process of identifying novel multicyclic peptide binders for therapeutically relevant protein targets. This review will describe the current approaches used to create multicyclic peptide libraries, highlighting the novel chemistries developed and the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work done on validating these libraries against different protein targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifications of Protein&#8208;Bound Substrates by Trans&#8208;Acting Enzymes in Natural Products Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In polyketide biosynthesis, modifications commonly occur after the completion of the polyketide backbone assembly and the mature products are released from the acyl&#8208;carrier protein (ACP). However, exceptions to this rule are widespread, and some are modified on&#8208;line by discrete enzymes. This review article highlights more recently reported trans&#8208;acting proteins that catalyze modifications of ACP&#8208;bound substrates in natural product biosynthesis.







Abstract
Enzymatic modifications of small molecules are a common phenomenon in natural product biosynthesis, leading to the production of diverse bioactive compounds. In polyketide biosynthesis, modifications commonly take place after the completion of the polyketide backbone assembly by the polyketide synthases and the mature products are released from the acyl&#8208;carrier protein (ACP). However, exceptions to this rule appear to be widespread, as on&#8208;line hydroxylation, methyl transfer, and cyclization during polyketide assembly process are common, particularly in trans&#8208;AT PKS systems. Many of these modifications are catalyzed by specific domains within the modular PKS systems. However, several of the on&#8208;line modifications are catalyzed by stand&#8208;alone proteins. Those include the on&#8208;line Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, halogenation, epoxidation, and methyl esterification during polyketide assembly, dehydrogenation of ACP&#8208;bound short fatty acids by acyl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase&#8208;like enzymes, and glycosylation of ACP&#8208;bound intermediates by discrete glycosyltransferase enzymes. This review article highlights some of these trans&#8208;acting proteins that catalyze enzymatic modifications of ACP&#8208;bound small molecules in natural product biosynthesis.

         <dc:description>Identifying the drug&#8208;target interactome of small molecule therapeutics is essential for understanding the full pharmacological effects of a compound. These therapies often induce changes within the cellular proteome, leading to unexpected consequences such as changes in the targets complexation state or off&#8208;target interactions between the compound and additional proteins. Currently, unbiased target&#8208;ID approaches are being used to embark on this task. Here we provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of these methods, and a practical step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol for using the BioTAC system to assist with drug target and interactome ID.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Logic Gates Integrated on DNA Substrates in Molecular Computing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of DNA computers is evolving to solve biological and medical problems. DNA logic gates are used to create integrated circuits with biocompatibility and programmability. This minireview highlights the efforts in the development of DNA circuits by integration of DNA logic gates into long chains localized on DNA substrates. This approach of all&#8208;DNA integrated circuits (DNA ICs) has the advantage of biocompatibility, increased circuit response due to precise gate localization, increased circuit density, reduced unit concentration, and facilitated cell uptake.







Abstract
Due to nucleic acid's programmability, it is possible to realize DNA structures with computing functions, and thus a new generation of molecular computers is evolving to solve biological and medical problems. Pioneered by Milan Stojanovic, Boolean DNA logic gates created the foundation for the development of DNA computers. Similar to electronic computers, the field is evolving towards integrating DNA logic gates and circuits by positioning them on substrates to increase circuit density and minimize gate distance and undesired crosstalk. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the integration of DNA logic gates into circuits localized on DNA substrates. This approach of all&#8208;DNA integrated circuits (DNA ICs) offers the advantages of biocompatibility, increased circuit response, increased circuit density, reduced unit concentration, facilitated circuit isolation, and facilitated cell uptake. DNA ICs can face similar challenges as their equivalent circuits operating in bulk solution (bulk circuits), and new physical challenges inherent in spatial localization. We discuss possible avenues to overcome these obstacles.

         <title>Aldehyde Reductase Activity of Carboxylic Acid Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids is a challenge that the enzyme carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) is mastering. The R&#8208;domains of CARs, however, can additionally catalyze carbonyl reduction. This activity is a minor side reaction for many substrate/enzyme pairs but may be significant for others.







Abstract
Carboxylic acid reductase enzymes (CARs) are well known for the reduction of a wide range of carboxylic acids to the respective aldehydes. One of the essential CAR domains &#8208; the reductase domain (R&#8208;domain) &#8208; was recently shown to catalyze the standalone reduction of carbonyls, including aldehydes, which are typically considered to be the final product of carboxylic acid reduction by CAR. We discovered that the respective full&#8208;length CARs were equally able to reduce aldehydes. Herein we aimed to shed light on the impact of this activity on aldehyde production and acid reduction in general. Our data explains previously inexplicable results and a new CAR from Mycolicibacterium wolinskyi is presented.

         <title>Biophysical Investigation of RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triple helix and RNA:DNA heteroduplex formation by the lncRNAs MEG3 and Fendrr</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long non&#8208;coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and can associate with DNA as RNA:DNA heteroduplexes or RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triple helix structures. Here, we review in vitro biochemical and biophysical experiments including electromobility shift assays (EMSA), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, thermal melting analysis, microscale thermophoresis (MST), single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triple helix and RNA:DNA heteroduplex formation. We present the investigations of the antiparallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA MEG3 targeting the gene TGFB2 and the parallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA Fendrr with its target gene Emp2. The thermodynamic properties of these oligonucleotides lead to concentration&#8208;dependent heterogeneous mixtures, where a DNA duplex, an RNA:DNA heteroduplex and an RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triplex coexist and their relative populations are modulated in a temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The in vitro data provide a reliable readout of triplex structures, as RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triplexes show distinct features compared to DNA duplexes and RNA:DNA heteroduplexes. Our experimental results can be used to validate computationally predicted triple helix formation between novel disease&#8208;relevant lncRNAs and their DNA target genes.</dc:description>

         <title>Biophysical and Biochemical Characterization of Structurally Diverse Small Molecule Hits for KRAS Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biophysical and biochemical characterization of six compounds is presented. The target biding and inhibitory profiles described here suggest that these compounds can serves as useful starting points for the development of allosteric, non&#8208;covalent inhibitors of KRAS for cancer therapy.







Abstract
We describe six compounds as early hits for the development of direct inhibitors of KRAS, an important anticancer drug target. We show that these compounds bind to KRAS with affinities in the low micromolar range and exert different effects on its interactions with binding partners. Some of the compounds exhibit selective binding to the activated form of KRAS and inhibit signal transduction through both the MAPK or the phosphatidylinositide 3&#8208;kinase PI3K&#8208;protein kinase B (AKT) pathway in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Most inhibit intrinsic and/or SOS&#8208;mediated KRAS activation while others inhibit RAS&#8208;effector interaction. We propose these compounds as starting points for the development of non&#8208;covalent allosteric KRAS inhibitors.

         <title>Functional and Mechanistic Characterization of the 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;Isoishwarane Synthase from the Liverwort Radula lindenbergiana</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microbial type and multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase RlMTPSL4 from the liverwort Radula lindenbergiana produces the new sesquiterpene hydrocarbon 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane as the main product, besides the known compounds germacrene A, &#945;&#8208;selinene, eremophilene and 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;aristolochene. The enzyme mechanism for the formation of the main product and its absolute configuration were determined through isotopic labeling experiments.







Abstract
The microbial type sesquiterpene synthase RlMTPSL4 from the liverwort Radula lindenbergiana was investigated for its products, showing the formation of several sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The main product was structurally characterized as the new compound 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane, while the side products included the known hydrocarbons germacrene A, &#945;&#8208;selinene, eremophilene and 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;aristolochene. The cyclization mechanism towards 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane catalyzed by RlMTPSL4 was investigated through isotopic labeling experiments, revealing the stereochemical course for the deprotonation step to the neutral intermediate germacrene A, a reprotonation for its further cyclization, and a 1,2&#8208;hydride shift along the cascade. The absolute configuration of 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane was determined using a stereoselective deuteration approach, revealing an absolute configuration typically observed for a microbial type sesquiterpene.

         <title>Oxygen Activation in Aromatic Ring Cleaving Salicylate Dioxygenase: Detection of Reaction Intermediates with a Nitro&#8208;substituted Substrate Analog</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylate dioxygenase performs aromatic C&#8722;C bond scission of its substrates, salicylate and gentisate, with the aid of iron cofactor tethered to a 3&#8208;His binding motif. By utilizing a nitro substituted substrate analog, which attenuates the enzymatic kcat by 500&#8208;fold, detection and kinetics characterization two reaction intermediates was performed with stopped&#8208;flow optical absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cupin dioxygenases such as salicylate 1,2&#8208;dioxygense (SDO) perform aromatic C&#8722;C bond scission via a 3&#8208;His motif tethered iron cofactor. Here, transient kinetics measurements are used to monitor the catalytic cycle of SDO by using a nitro&#8208;substituted substrate analog, 3&#8208;nitrogentisate. Compared to the natural substrate, the nitro group reduces the enzymatic kcat by 500&#8208;fold, thereby facilitating the detection and kinetic characterization of reaction intermediates. Sums and products of reciprocal relaxation times derived from kinetic measurements were found to be linearly dependent on O2 concentration, suggesting reversible formation of two distinct intermediates. Dioxygen binding to the metal cofactor takes place with a forward rate of 5.9&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1: two orders of magnitude slower than other comparable ring&#8208;cleaving dioxygenses. Optical chromophore of the first intermediate is distinct from the in&#8197;situ generated SDO Fe(III)&#8722;O2&#8901;&#8722; complex but closer to the enzyme&#8208;substrate precursor.

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of the Reversible Monoacylglycerol Lipase PET Tracer (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132: Application in Drug Development and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 is a specific and selective PET tracer for MAGL brain imaging. It has the potential to accelerate MAGL drug discovery and may be used to stage neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) plays a crucial role in the degradation of 2&#8208;arachidonoylglycerol (2&#8208;AG), one of the major endocannabinoids in the brain. Inhibiting MAGL could lead to increased levels of 2&#8208;AG, which showed beneficial effects on pain management, anxiety, inflammation, and neuroprotection. In the current study, we report the characterization of an enantiomerically pure (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 as a novel MAGL PET tracer. It demonstrates an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to its racemate. High in&#8197;vitro MAGL specificity of (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 was confirmed by autoradiography studies using mouse and rat brain sections. In vivo, (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 displayed a high brain penetration, and high specificity and selectivity toward MAGL by dynamic PET imaging using MAGL knockout and wild&#8208;type mice. Pretreatment with a MAGL drug candidate revealed a dose&#8208;dependent reduction of (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 accumulation in WT mouse brains. This result validates its utility as a PET probe to assist drug development. Moreover, its potential application in neurodegenerative diseases was explored by in&#8197;vitro autoradiography using brain sections from animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]YH132 is a specific and selective PET tracer for MAGL brain imaging. It has the potential to accelerate MAGL drug discovery and may be used to stage neurodegenerative diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) plays a crucial role in the degradation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), one of the major endocannabinoids in the brain. Inhibiting MAGL could lead to increased levels of 2-AG, which showed beneficial effects on pain management, anxiety, inflammation, and neuroprotection. In the current study, we report the characterization of an enantiomerically pure (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]YH132 as a novel MAGL PET tracer. It demonstrates an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to its racemate. High &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; MAGL specificity of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]YH132 was confirmed by autoradiography studies using mouse and rat brain sections. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]YH132 displayed a high brain penetration, and high specificity and selectivity toward MAGL by dynamic PET imaging using MAGL knockout and wild-type mice. Pretreatment with a MAGL drug candidate revealed a dose-dependent reduction of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]YH132 accumulation in WT mouse brains. This result validates its utility as a PET probe to assist drug development. Moreover, its potential application in neurodegenerative diseases was explored by &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; autoradiography using brain sections from animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;gene Reporter&#8208;amplifier Architecture for Enhancing the Sensitivity of Molecular MRI by Water Exchange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of genetic reporters for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for investigating biological functions in vivo. However, current MRI reporters have low sensitivity, making it challenging to create significant contrast against the tissue background, especially when only a small fraction of cells express the reporter. To overcome this limitation, we developed an approach for amplifying the sensitivity of molecular MRI by combining a chemogenetic contrast mechanism with a biophysical approach to increase water diffusion through the co&#8208;expression of a dual&#8208;gene construct comprising an organic anion transporting polypeptide, Oatp1b3, and a water channel, Aqp1. We first show that the expression of Aqp1 amplifies MRI contrast in cultured cells engineered to express Oatp1b3. We demonstrate that the contrast amplification is caused by Aqp1&#8208;driven increase in water exchange, which provides the gadolinium ions internalized by Oatp1b3&#8208;expressing cells with access to a larger water pool compared with exchange&#8208;limited conditions. We further show that our methodology allows cells to be detected using approximately 10&#8208;fold lower concentrations of gadolinium than that in the Aqp1&#8208;free scenario. Finally, we show that our approach enables the imaging of mixed&#8208;cell cultures containing a low fraction of Oatp1b3labeled cells that are undetectable on the basis of Oatp1b3 expression alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Methylation of Phenyl Rings in Ester&#8208;Stabilized Phosphorus Ylides Vastly Enhances Their Protonophoric Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ester&#8208;stabilized triphenylphosphonium ylide precursor can carry protons across artificial and natural membranes. Methylation of aryl groups together with alkyl length shortening of this protonophore preserving its lipophilicity resulted in a 20&#8208;fold increase in the flip&#8208;flop rate constant of its cationic form. Accordingly, increased proton transport across lipid membranes and enhanced uncoupling of mitochondria were observed.







Abstract
We have recently discovered that ester&#8208;stabilized phosphorus ylides, resulting from deprotonation of a phosphonium salt such as [Ph3PCH2COOR], can transfer protons across artificial and biological membranes. To create more effective cationic protonophores, we synthesized similar phosphonium salts with one ((heptyloxycarbonylmethyl)(p&#8208;tolyl)bromide) or two ((butyloxycarbonylmethyl)(3,5&#8208;xylyl)osphonium bromide) methyl substituents in the phenyl groups. The methylation enormously augmented both protonophoric activity of the ylides on planar bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) and uncoupling of mammalian mitochondria, which correlated with strongly accelerated flip&#8208;flop of their cationic precursors across the BLM.

         <title>Discovery of a Photoaffinity Probe that Captures the Active Conformation of the Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a series of bifunctional photoaffinity CB2R selective probes based on the 5&#8208;fluoropyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;benzyl&#8208;imidazoleidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione derivative LEI&#8208;102, with both inverse agonist and partial agonist behaviour in&#8197;vitro. These photoaffinity probes have improved affinity and potency compared to previously published LEI&#8208;121.







Abstract
The cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) is a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor with therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Fluorescent probes are desirable to study its receptor localization, expression and occupancy. Previously, we have reported a photoaffinity probe LEI&#8208;121 that stabilized the inactive conformation of the CB2R. Here, we report the structure&#8208;based design of a novel bifunctional probe that captures the active conformation of the CB2R upon irradiation with light. An alkyne handle was incorporated to visualize the receptor using click&#8208;chemistry with fluorophore&#8208;azides. These probes may hold promise to study different receptor conformations in relation to their cellular localization and function.

         <title>O&#8208;nitrobenzyl Caged Molecule Enables Photo&#8208;controlled Release of Thiabendazole</title>

NP&#8208;TBZ is developed by covalently linking o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (NP) with thiabendazole (TBZ). Compound NP&#8208;TBZ can be controlled to release TBZ in dependent to light, which resulted in controllable in&#8208;vivo activity against wheat scab. It is promising for spatiotemporal controlled&#8208;release of TBZ in factual applications, posing a theoretical guidance in development of controlled&#8208;release pesticides.







Abstract
Pesticides are essential in agricultural development. Controlled&#8208;release pesticides have attracted great attentions. Base on a principle of spatiotemporal selectivity, we extended the photoremovable protective group (PRPG) into agrochemical agents to achieve controllable release of active ingredients. Herein, we obtained NP&#8208;TBZ by covalently linking o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (NP) with thiabendazole (TBZ). Compound NP&#8208;TBZ can be controlled to release TBZ in dependent to light. The irradiated and unirradiated NP&#8208;TBZ showed significant differences on fungicidal activities both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. In addition, the irradiated NP&#8208;TBZ displayed similar antifungal activities to the directly&#8208;used TBZ, indicating a factual applicability in controllable release of TBZ. Furthermore, we explored the action mode and microcosmic variations by SEM analysis, and demonstrated that the irradiated NP&#8208;TBZ retained a same action mode with TBZ against mycelia growth.

         <title>The Biological Activities of Polyether Ionophore Antibiotic Routiennocin is Independent of Absolute Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis was used to access both enantiomers of the polyether antibiotic routiennocin, and a diastereomeric variant, to probe the biological consequences of altering the naturally configured stereochemistry. Testing these compounds against a broad panel of bacteria and mammalian cells revealed independence of absolute stereochemistry in all tested cells.







Abstract
Carboxylic polyether ionophores (CPIs) are among the most prevalent agricultural antibiotics (notably in the US) and these compounds have been in use for decades. The potential to reposition CPIs beyond veterinary use, e.&#8201;g. through chemical modifications to enhance their selectivity window, is an exciting challenge and opportunity, considering their general resilience towards resistance development. Given the very large societal impact of these somewhat controversial compounds, it is surprising that many aspects of their mechanisms and activities in cells remain unclear. Here, we report comparative biological activities of the CPI routiennocin and two stereoisomers, including its enantiomer. We used an efficient convergent synthesis strategy to access the compounds and conducted a broad survey of antibacterial activities against planktonic cells and biofilms as well as the compounds&#8217; effects on mammalian cells, the latter assessed both via standard cell viability assays and broad morphological profiling. Interestingly, similar bioactivity of the enantiomeric pair was observed across all assays, strongly suggesting that chiral interactions do not play a decisive role in the mode of action. Overall, our findings are consistent with a mechanistic model involving highly dynamic behaviour of CPIs in biological membranes.

     alt="The Biological Activities of Polyether Ionophore Antibiotic Routiennocin is Independent of Absolute Stereochemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convergent synthesis was used to access both enantiomers of the polyether antibiotic routiennocin, and a diastereomeric variant, to probe the biological consequences of altering the naturally configured stereochemistry. Testing these compounds against a broad panel of bacteria and mammalian cells revealed independence of absolute stereochemistry in all tested cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carboxylic polyether ionophores (CPIs) are among the most prevalent agricultural antibiotics (notably in the US) and these compounds have been in use for decades. The potential to reposition CPIs beyond veterinary use, e.&#8201;g. through chemical modifications to enhance their selectivity window, is an exciting challenge and opportunity, considering their general resilience towards resistance development. Given the very large societal impact of these somewhat controversial compounds, it is surprising that many aspects of their mechanisms and activities in cells remain unclear. Here, we report comparative biological activities of the CPI routiennocin and two stereoisomers, including its enantiomer. We used an efficient convergent synthesis strategy to access the compounds and conducted a broad survey of antibacterial activities against planktonic cells and biofilms as well as the compounds&#8217; effects on mammalian cells, the latter assessed both via standard cell viability assays and broad morphological profiling. Interestingly, similar bioactivity of the enantiomeric pair was observed across all assays, strongly suggesting that chiral interactions do not play a decisive role in the mode of action. Overall, our findings are consistent with a mechanistic model involving highly dynamic behaviour of CPIs in biological membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fus&#8208;SMO: Kinetics, Biochemical Characterisation and In Silico Modelling of a Chimeric Styrene Monooxygenase Demonstrating Quantitative Coupling Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fus&#8208;SMO, a chimera of StyA and StyB in styrene monooxygenase, has a trimeric structure with one bound flavin. In silico modelling indicated a well&#8208;distanced arrangement due to the flexible linker. Pre&#8208;steady&#8208;state kinetics highlighted the intricacies of FADox reduction and aerobic FADH2 oxidation. NADH consumption vs. styrene epoxidation revealed quantitative coupling efficiency. These findings advance our understanding of FADH2 transfer mechanisms in SMO and underscore protein fusion&#8216;s role in enhancing biocatalysis.







Abstract
The styrene monooxygenase, a two&#8208;component enzymatic system for styrene epoxidation, was characterised through the study of Fus&#8208;SMO &#8211; a chimera resulting from the fusion of StyA and StyB using a flexible linker. Notably, it remains debated whether the transfer of FADH2 from StyB to StyA occurs through diffusion, channeling, or a combination of both. Fus&#8208;SMO was identified as a trimer with one bound FAD molecule. In silico modelling revealed a well&#8208;distanced arrangement (45&#8211;50&#8197;&#197;) facilitated by the flexible linker&#8216;s loopy structure. Pre&#8208;steady&#8208;state kinetics elucidated the FADox reduction intricacies (kred=110&#8197;s&#8722;1 for bound FADox), identifying free FADox binding as the rate&#8208;determining step. The aerobic oxidation of FADH2 (kox=90&#8197;s&#8722;1) and subsequent decomposition to FADox and H2O2 demonstrated StyA&#8242;s protective effect on the bound hydroperoxoflavin (kdec=0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1) compared to free cofactor (kdec=1.8&#8197;s&#8722;1). At varied styrene concentrations, kox for FADH2 ranged from 80 to 120&#8197;s&#8722;1. Studies on NADH consumption vs. styrene epoxidation revealed Fus&#8208;SMO&#8242;s ability to achieve quantitative coupling efficiency in solution, surpassing natural two&#8208;component SMOs. The results suggest that Fus&#8208;SMO exhibits enhanced FADH2 channelling between subunits. This work contributes to comprehending FADH2 transfer mechanisms in SMO and illustrates how protein fusion can elevate catalytic efficiency for biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Human 2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;Phosphate N&#8208;Hydrolase 1: The Catalytic Roles of Tyr24 and Asp80</title>

         <dc:description>
The human enzyme 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate N&#8208;hydrolase 1 (HsDNPH1) is a promising target for inhibition towards anticancer drug development. Crystal structures, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analysis, including pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent deuterium isotope effects, help quantify contributions from conserved residues Tyr24 and Asp80 to HsDNPH1&#8208;catalysed hydrolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate. These include nucleophile and substrate positioning and general&#8208;acid catalysis.







Abstract
The human enzyme 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate N&#8208;hydrolase 1 (HsDNPH1) catalyses the hydrolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate to generate 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil and 2&#8208;deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate via a covalent 5&#8208;phospho&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyribosylated enzyme intermediate. HsDNPH1 is a promising target for inhibitor development towards anticancer drugs. Here, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of conserved active&#8208;site residues, followed by HPLC analysis of the reaction and steady&#8208;state kinetics are employed to reveal the importance of each of these residues in catalysis, and the reaction pH&#8208;dependence is perturbed by each mutation. Solvent deuterium isotope effects indicate no rate&#8208;limiting proton transfers. Crystal structures of D80N&#8208;HsDNPH1 in unliganded and substrate&#8208;bound states, and of unliganded D80A&#8208; and Y24F&#8208;HsDNPH1 offer atomic level insights into substrate binding and catalysis. The results reveal a network of hydrogen bonds involving the substrate and the E104&#8208;Y24&#8208;D80 catalytic triad and are consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby D80 is important for substrate positioning, for helping modulate E104 nucleophilicity, and as the general acid in the first half&#8208;reaction. Y24 positions E104 for catalysis and prevents a catalytically disruptive close contact between E104 and D80.

         <title>Effect of DNA Origami Nanostructures on Bacterial Growth</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacteria can use DNA origami nanostructures as a nutrient source, leading to increased population growth. This process depends not only on the competence signal and uptake mechanisms of each species, but also on DNA origami shape and superstructure. It should thus be considered in the design and development of antimicrobial DNA origami nanostructures.







Abstract
DNA origami nanostructures are a powerful tool in biomedicine and can be used to combat drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. However, the effect of unmodified DNA origami nanostructures on bacteria is yet to be elucidated. With the aim to obtain a better understanding of this phenomenon, the effect of three DNA origami shapes, i.e., DNA origami triangles, six&#8208;helix bundles (6HBs), and 24&#8208;helix bundles (24HBs), on the growth of Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis is investigated. The results reveal that while triangles and 24HBs can be used as a source of nutrients by E. coli and thereby promote population growth, their effect is much smaller than that of genomic single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA. However, no effect on E. coli population growth is observed for the 6HBs. On the other hand, B. subtilis does not show any significant changes in population growth when cultured with the different DNA origami shapes or genomic DNA. The detailed effect of DNA origami nanostructures on bacterial growth thus depends on the competence signals and uptake mechanism of each bacterial species, as well as the DNA origami shape. This should be considered in the development of antimicrobial DNA origami nanostructures.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis and DNA Interactive Studies of New 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidines Hybrids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalyzed reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates and aryl azides resulted in the metal&#8208;free synthesis of novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidine hybrids in good yields. Spectroscopic methods (absorption and emission), viscosimetry, and molecular docking were employed to assess the interactions between the synthesized compounds and DNA, revealing promising results for the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting DNA&#8208;related processes.







Abstract
An organocatalytic [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;ketoester 1 and aryl azides 2 was employed to synthesize new 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidine hybrids 3. In this metal&#8208;free approach, twelve compounds were isolated in yields ranging from 23&#8201;% to 96&#8201;% by using diethylamine (10&#8197;mol%) and DMSO at 75&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;hours. DNA&#8208;binding assays were conducted through absorption, emission spectroscopy and viscosimetry analysis, to evaluate the interaction capacity of the studied derivatives with nucleic acids. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their interactions with a specific group of compounds containing the pharmacophoric groups triazole and thiazolidine through a molecular docking speculative study, aimed at identifying the interaction profile of these compounds with DNA. The obtained results suggest that 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidine hybrids could be a promising approach in the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting DNA&#8208;related processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organocatalytic [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between thiazolidine-containing &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ketoester &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and aryl azides &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was employed to synthesize new 1,2,3-triazolyl-thiazolidine hybrids &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. In this metal-free approach, twelve compounds were isolated in yields ranging from 23&#8201;% to 96&#8201;% by using diethylamine (10&#8197;mol%) and DMSO at 75&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;hours. DNA-binding assays were conducted through absorption, emission spectroscopy and viscosimetry analysis, to evaluate the interaction capacity of the studied derivatives with nucleic acids. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their interactions with a specific group of compounds containing the pharmacophoric groups triazole and thiazolidine through a molecular docking speculative study, aimed at identifying the interaction profile of these compounds with DNA. The obtained results suggest that 1,2,3-triazolyl-thiazolidine hybrids could be a promising approach in the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting DNA-related processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Aza&#8208;Michael Addition to Dehydrated Amino Acids in Natural Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global public health problem that has made the search for new antibiotics essential. Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides are a promising new class of antibiotics and in this work, we report site&#8208;selective modification of their dehydroamino acids by &#946;&#8208;amination in order to increase water solubility: the singly modified thiopeptide Thiostrepton showed an increase up to 35&#8208;fold and minimum inhibitory concentration tests demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity was still good, albeit lower than the natural peptide.







Abstract
We report the efficient and site selective modification of non&#8208;canonical dehydroamino acids in ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;transationally modified peptides (RiPPs) by &#946;&#8208;amination. The singly modified thiopeptide Thiostrepton showed an up to 35&#8208;fold increase in water solubility, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays showed that antimicrobial activity remained good, albeit lower than the unmodified peptide. Also the lanthipeptide nisin could be modified using this method.

         <title>Identification, characterization and application of M16AT, a new organic solvent&#8211;tolerant (R)&#8211;enantio&#8211;selective type IV amine transaminase from Mycobacterium sp. ACS1612</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new (R)&#8208;selective amine transaminase (R&#8208;ATA) from Mycobacterium sp. ACS1612 was identified via in silico prediction combined with genome and protein database information. The newly identified and characterized R&#8208;ATA displayed a broad substrate spectrum and strong tolerance to organic solvents. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of M16AT was demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;fendiline.







Abstract
Biocatalysis has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional chemical methods, especially for asymmetric synthesis. As biocatalysts usually exhibit excellent chemical, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, they facilitate and simplify many chemical processes for the production of a broad range of products. Here, a new biocatalyst called, R&#8208;selective amine transaminases (R&#8208;ATAs), was obtained from Mycobacterium sp. ACS1612 (M16AT) using in&#8211;silico prediction combined with a genome and protein database. A two&#8211;step simple purification process could yield a high concentration of pure enzyme, suggesting that industrial application would be inexpensive. Additionally, the newly identified and characterized R&#8208;ATAs displayed a broad substrate spectrum and strong tolerance to organic solvents. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of M16AT has been demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;fendiline from of (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine.

         <title>The Biocatalytic Potential of Aromatic Ammonia&#8208;Lyase from Loktanella atrilutea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Characterization of the aromatic ammonia&#8208;lyase from Loktanella atrilutea (LaAAL) revealed reduced activity towards canonical AAL substrates: L&#8208;Phe, L&#8208;Tyr, and L&#8208;His, contrasted by its pronounced efficiency towards 3,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine. Assessing optimal conditions, LaAAL exhibited maximal activity at pH 9.5 in the ammonia elimination reaction route, distinct from the typical pH ranges of most PALs and TALs. Within the exploration of the ammonia source for the opposite, synthetically valuable ammonia addition reaction, the stability of LaAAL, exhibited a positive correlation with the ammonia concentration, with the highest stability in 4 M ammonium carbamate of unadjusted pH of ~9.5. While the enzyme activity increased with rising temperatures yet, the highest operational stability and highest stationary conversions of LaAAL were observed at 30 &#176;C. The substrate scope analysis highlighted the catalytic adaptability of LaAAL in the hydroamination of diverse cinnamic acids, especially of meta&#8208;substituted and di&#8208;/multi&#8208;substituted analogues, with structural modelling exposing steric clashes between the substrates&#8217; ortho&#8208;substituents and catalytic site residues. LaAAL showed a predilection for ammonia elimination, while classifying as a tyrosine ammonia&#8208;lyase (TAL) among the natural AAL classes. However, its distinctive attributes, such as genomic context, unique substrate specificity and catalytic fingerprint, suggest a potential natural role beyond those of known AAL classes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterial Glycolipid Acting on Protein Transport across Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The process of protein transport across membranes involves a variety of factors and has been extensively investigated. Traditionally, proteinaceous translocons and chaperones have been recognized as crucial factors in this process. However, recent studies have highlighted the significant roles played by lipids and a glycolipid present in biological membranes in membrane protein transport. Membrane lipids can influence transport efficiency by altering the physicochemical properties of membranes. Notably, our studies have revealed that diacylglycerol (DAG) attenuates mobility in the membrane core region, leading to a dramatic suppression of membrane protein integration. Conversely, a glycolipid in Escherichia coli inner membranes, named membrane protein integrase (MPIase), enhances integration not only through the alteration of membrane properties but also via direct interactions with membrane proteins. This review explores the mechanisms of membrane protein integration mediated by membrane lipids, specifically DAG, and MPIase. Our results, along with the employed physicochemical analysis methods such as fluorescence measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance, surface plasmon resonance, and docking simulation, are presented to elucidate these mechanisms.</dc:description>

The cover shows the homodimeric neryl diphosphate synthase, a short&#8208;chaincis&#8208;prenyltransferase from tomato. The two active sites of the enzyme alternate in function, condensing two substrates on one site (represented by green tomatoes, front) while the other excretes the product (represented by red tomatoes, back). The conserved C&#8208;terminal motif of this enzyme changes its secondary structure during turnover and may, cooperatively with the unique N&#8208;terminal region, be important for the catalytic mechanism. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Yamashita et al.

         <dc:description>Halophilic organisms have adapted to multi&#8208;molar salt concentrations, their cytoplasmic proteins functioning despite stronger attraction between hydrophobic groups. These proteins, of interest in biotechnology because of decreasing fresh&#8208;water resources, have excess acidic amino acids.&#160; &#160;It has been suggested that conformational fluctuations &#8208;&#8208; critical for protein function &#8208;&#8208; decrease in the presence of a stronger hydrophobic effect, and that an acidic proteome would counteract this decrease. However, our understanding of the salt&#8208; and acidic amino acid dependency of enzymatic activity is limited. Here, using solution NMR relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations for in total 14 proteins, we show that salt concentration has a limited and moreover non&#8208;monotonic impact on protein dynamics. The results speak against the conformational&#8208;fluctuations model, instead indicating that maintaining protein dynamics to ensure protein function is not an evolutionary driving force behind the acidic proteome of halophilic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Mushroom Tyrosinase: Six Isoenzymes Catalyzing Distinct&#160;Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;Mushroom tyrosinase&#8221; from the common button mushroom is the most frequently used source of tyrosinase activity, both for basic and applied research. Here, the complete tyrosinase family from Agaricus bisporus var. bisporus (abPPO1&#8208;6) was cloned from mRNA and expressed heterologously using a single protocol. All six isoenzymes accept a wide range of phenolic and catecholic substrates, but display pronounced differences in their specificity and enzymatic reaction rate. AbPPO3 ignores &#947;&#8208;l&#8208;glutaminyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzene (GHB), a natural phenol present in mM concentrations in A. bisporus, while AbPPO4 processes 100 &#181;M GHB at 4&#8208;times the rate of the catechol l&#8208;DOPA. All six AbPPOs are biochemically distinct enzymes fit for different roles in the fungal life cycle, which challenges the traditional concept of isoenzymes as catalyzing the same chemical reaction and varying only in secondary properties. Transferring this approach to other enzymes and organisms will greatly stimulate both the study of the in vivo function(s) of enzymes and the application of these highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering A&#8208;type Dye&#8208;decolorizing Peroxidases by Modification of a Conserved Glutamate Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dye&#8208;decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) are recently identified microbial enzymes that have been used in several Biotechnology applications from wastewater treatment to lignin valorization. However, their properties and mechanism of action still have many open questions. Their heme&#8208;containing active site is buried by three conserved flexible loops with a putative role in modulating substrate access and enzyme catalysis. Here, we investigated the role of a conserved glutamate residue in stabilizing interactions in loop 2 of A&#8208;type DyPs. First, we did site saturation mutagenesis of this residue, replacing it with all possible amino acids in bacterial DyPs from Bacillus subtilis (BsDyP) and from Kitasatospora aureofaciens (KaDyP1), the latter being characterized here for the first time. We screened the resulting libraries of variants for activity towards ABTS and identified variants with increased catalytic efficiency. The selected variants were purified and characterized for activity and stability. We furthermore used Molecular Dynamics simulations to rationalize the increased catalytic efficiency and found that the main reason is the electron channeling becoming easier from surface&#8208;exposed tryptophans. Based on our findings, we also propose that this glutamate could work as a pH switch in the wild&#8208;type enzyme, preventing intracellular damage.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Functional Globular &#946;&#8208;Sheet Miniproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not just the beta versions. Miniprotein design has long been dominated by the well&#8208;understood &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil scaffolds. With increasing understanding, globular &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds, which are generally considered to be prone to aggregation, are also becoming accessible. We review the design of &#946;&#8208;hairpins and WW domains and discuss strategies for engineering these scaffolds into receptors, molecular switches and catalysts.







Abstract
The design of discrete &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides is far less advanced than e.&#8201;g. the design of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides. The reputation of &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides as being poorly soluble and aggregation&#8208;prone often hinders active design efforts. Here, we show that this reputation is unfounded. We demonstrate this by looking at the &#946;&#8208;hairpin and WW domain. Their structure and folding have been extensively studied and they have long served as model systems to investigate protein folding and folding kinetics. The resulting fundamental understanding has led to the development of hyperstable &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds that fold at temperatures of 100&#8201;&#176;C or high concentrations of denaturants. These have been used to design functional miniproteins with protein or nucleic acid binding properties, in some cases with such success that medical applications are conceivable. The &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds are not always completely rigid, but can be specifically designed to respond to changes in pH, redox potential or presence of metal ions. Some engineered &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides also exhibit catalytic properties, although not comparable to those of natural proteins. Previous reviews have focused on the design of stably folded and non&#8208;aggregating &#946;&#8208;sheet sequences. In our review, we now also address design strategies to obtain functional miniproteins from &#946;&#8208;sheet folding motifs.

         <title>The Impact of Activating Agents on Non&#8208;Enzymatic Nucleic Acid Extension Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension of RNA and DNA reveals an intrinsic battle between fidelity and rate. This review highlights pathways towards the optimization of these reactions to enable rapid, sequence&#8208;specific and scalable RNA and DNA synthesis.







Abstract
Non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension is increasingly being studied for the production of RNA and DNA. These reactions benefit from producing RNA or DNA in an aqueous, protecting group free system, without the need for expensive enzymes. However, these primer extension reactions suffer from a lack of fidelity, low reaction rates, low overall yields, and short primer extension lengths. This review outlines a detailed mechanistic pathway for non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension and presents a review of the thermodynamic driving forces involved in entropic templating. Through the lens of entropic templating, the rate and fidelity of a reaction are shown to be intrinsically linked to the reactivity of the activating agent used. Thus, a strategy is discussed for the optimization of non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension, providing a path towards cost&#8208;effective in&#8197;vitro synthesis of RNA and DNA.

         <title>Structural&#8208;Functional Correlations between Unique N&#8208;terminal Region and C&#8208;terminal Conserved Motif in Short&#8208;chain cis&#8208;Prenyltransferase from Tomato</title>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the unique N&#8208;terminal region and the C&#8208;terminal conserved RXG motif of neryl diphosphate synthase function with cooperative structural transitions in the dimer. X&#8208;ray crystallography employing massive data collections and a hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a heterogeneity of the active site and polymorphs of substrate binding mode.







Abstract
Neryl diphosphate (C10) synthase (NDPS1), a homodimeric soluble cis&#8208;prenyltransferase from tomato, contains four disulfide bonds, including two inter&#8208;subunit S&#8722;S bonds in the N&#8208;terminal region. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the S&#8722;S bond formation affects not only the stability of the dimer but also the catalytic efficiency of NDPS1. Structural polymorphs in the crystal structures of NDPS1 complexed with its substrate and substrate analog were identified by employing massive data collections and hierarchical clustering analysis. Heterogeneity of the C&#8208;terminal region, including the conserved RXG motifs, was observed in addition to the polymorphs of the binding mode of the ligands. One of the RXG motifs covers the active site with an elongated random coil when the ligands are well&#8208;ordered. Conversely, the other RXG motif was located away from the active site with a helical structure. The heterogeneous C&#8208;terminal regions suggest alternating structural transitions of the RXG motifs that result in closed and open states of the active sites. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the conserved glycine residue cannot be replaced. We propose that the putative structural transitions of the order/disorder of N&#8208;terminal regions and the closed/open states of C&#8208;terminal regions may cooperate and be important for the catalytic mechanism of NDPS1.

         <title>In&#8208;Bridge Stereochemistry: A Determinant of Stapled Peptide Conformation and Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significance of in&#8208;bridge stereochemistry has been underscored as a decisive factor influencing stapled peptides&#8217; &#945;&#8208;helicity, protease resistance, protein&#8208;binding affinity, and various other properties. This aspect introduces fresh opportunities for the innovative design and development of novel peptide tools and therapeutics.







Abstract
Peptide side chain stapling has been proven to be an effective strategy for fine&#8208;tuning peptide properties. This innovative approach leads to the creation of stapled peptides characterized by stabilized &#945;&#8208;helical conformations, enhanced protein&#8208;binding affinity, improved cell permeability, superior enzymatic stability, and numerous other advantages. Extensive research has explored the impact of various stapling bridges on the properties of these peptides, with limited investigation into the influence of bridge chirality, until very recently. In this concise review, we provide a brief overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the stereochemistry within the bridges of stapled peptides, offering insights into the potential applications of chiral bridges in the design and development of stapled peptides.

         <title>A Tight Contact: The Expanding Application of Salicylaldehydes in Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylaldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands can bind the protein targets forming imines with lysine&#8208;amino groups. This drug design improves the affinity and selectivity for specific biological targets. Given the abundance of lysine residues in proteins and the reversible covalent (RC) nature of ligand&#8208;protein interaction, SA&#8208;bearing ligands hold significant promise for future pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
The installation of aldehydes into synthetic protein ligands is an efficient strategy to engage protein lysine residues in remarkably stable imine bonds and augment the compound affinity and selectivity for their biological targets. The high frequency of lysine residues in proteins and the reversibility of the covalent ligand&#8208;protein bond support the application of aldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands, holding promises for their future use as drugs. This review highlights the increasing exploitation of salicylaldehyde modules in various classes of protein binders, aimed at the reversible&#8208;covalent engagement of lysine residues.
