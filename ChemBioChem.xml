         <title>Chemical regulation of the protein quality control E3 ubiquitin ligase C&#8208;terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitin ligase C&#8208;terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) is an important regulator of proteostasis. Despite playing an important role in maintaining proteostasis, little progress has been made in developing small molecules that regulate ubiquitin transfer by CHIP. Here we used differential scanning fluorimetry to identify compounds that bound CHIP. Compounds that bound CHIP were then analyzed by quantitative ubiquitination assays to identify those that altered CHIP function. One compound, MS.001, inhibited both the chaperone binding and ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP at low micromolar concentrations. Interestingly, we found that MS.001 did not have activity against isolated U&#8208;box or tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains, but instead only inhibited full&#8208;length CHIP. Using&#160;  in silico&#160;  docking we identified a potential MS.001 binding site on the linker domain of CHIP and mutation of this site rendered CHIP resistant to MS.001. Together our data identify an inhibitor of the E3 ligase CHIP and provides insight into the development of compounds that regulate CHIP activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized Hemolysin type 1 secretion system in&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;by directed evolution of the Hly enhancer fragment and including a terminator region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type 1 secretion systems (T1SS) have a relatively simple architecture compared to other classes of secretion systems and therefore, are attractive to be optimized by protein engineering. Here, we report a KnowVolution campaign for the hemolysin (Hly) enhancer fragment, an untranslated region upstream of the&#160;hly&#160;gene, of the hemolysin T1SS of&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;to enhance its secretion efficiency. The best performing variant of the Hly enhancer fragment contained five nucleotide mutations at five positions (A30U, A36U, A54G, A81U, and A116U) resulted in a 2&#8208;fold increase in the secretion level of a model lipase fused to the secretion carrier HlyA1. Computational analysis suggested that altered affinity to the generated enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein contributes to the enhanced secretion levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that involving a native terminator region along with the generated Hly enhancer fragment increased the secretion levels of the Hly system up to 5&#8208;fold.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Michael Additions of Acetaldehyde to Aliphatic Nitroalkenes Catalyzed by Proline&#8208;Based Carboligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The blockbuster drug Pregabalin is widely prescribed for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Given the continuous epidemic growth of diabetes, the development of sustainable synthesis routes for Pregabalin and structurally related pharmaceutically active &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives is of high interest. Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes are versatile synthons for the production of GABA derivatives, which can be prepared through a Michael&#8208;type addition of acetaldehyde to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes. Here we report that tailored variants of the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) can accept diverse aliphatic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes as substrates for acetaldehyde addition. Highly enantioenriched aliphatic (  R  )&#8208; and (  S  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes were obtained in good yields using two enantiocomplementary 4&#8208;OT variants. Our results underscore the synthetic potential of 4&#8208;OT for the preparation of structurally diverse synthons for bioactive analogues of Pregabalin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modern Strategies for the Diversification of the Supply of Natural Compounds: The Case of Alkaloid Painkillers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaloid pharmaceuticals supply&#8208;chain is highly dependent on opium poppy harvest. The biosynthesis of alkaloid painkillers encounters its first bottleneck in the enzymatic Pictet&#8208;Spengler stereoselective condensation of 4&#8208;HPAA and dopamine, to synthesize S&#8208;norcoclaurine. The enzyme mechanisms and possible methodology for the improvement of their efficiency are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived natural compounds have been used for treating diseases since prehistorical times. The supply of many plant&#8208;derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is primarily dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency adds an extra risk factor to ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Emerging technologies, such as biocatalysis, might help to solve this problem by diversifying the sources of supply of these compounds. Here we review the first committed step in the production of alkaloid painkillers, the production of S&#8208;norcoclaurine, and the enzymes involved. The improvement of these enzymes can be carried out experimentally by directed evolution and rational design strategies, supported by computational methods, to create variants that produce the S&#8208;norcoclaurine precursor for alkaloid painkillers in heterologous organisms, meeting the pharmaceutical industry standards and needs without depending on opium poppy crops.

         <title>Molecular Determinants of Carbocation Cyclisation in Bacterial Monoterpene Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active site residues in terpene synthases each have a unique and precise function in guiding the reactive carbocation intermediates to the final product. Here we used a combined experimental and computational approach to unravel the role of several active site residues in bacterial monoterpene synthases. These residues are often not conserved even in closely related enzymes demonstrating the importance of a tailored active site for each terpene product.







Abstract
Monoterpene synthases are often promiscuous enzymes, yielding product mixtures rather than pure compounds due to the nature of the branched reaction mechanism involving reactive carbocations. Two previously identified bacterial monoterpene synthases, a linalool synthase (bLinS) and a cineole synthase (bCinS), produce nearly pure linalool and cineole from geranyl diphosphate, respectively. We used a combined experimental and computational approach to identify critical residues involved in bacterial monoterpenoid synthesis. Phe77 is essential for bCinS activity, guiding the linear carbocation intermediate towards the formation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;terpinyl intermediate; removal of the aromatic ring results in variants that produce acyclic products only. Computational chemistry confirmed the importance of Phe77 in carbocation stabilisation. Phe74, Phe78 and Phe179 are involved in maintaining the active site shape in bCinS without a specific role for the aromatic ring. Phe295 in bLinS, and the equivalent Ala301 in bCinS, are essential for linalool and cineole formation, respectively. Where Phe295 places steric constraints on the carbocation intermediates, Ala301 is essential for bCinS initial cyclisation and activity. Our multidisciplinary approach gives unique insights into how carefully placed amino acid residues in the active site can direct carbocations down specific paths, by placing steric constraints or offering stabilisation via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Engineering the Ligand Specificity of the Human Galectin&#8208;1 by Incorporation of Tryptophan Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tryptophan analogues tailor lectin specificity: Atomic mutations introduced at the single tryptophan residue in the galectin&#8208;1 carbohydrate binding site reduce the affinity for selected, sulfated ligands without substantially affecting the interaction with other sugars. Molecular modeling traces this change in affinity back to altered solvation patterns, modulated CH&#8208;&#960; interactions, and electrostatic repulsion between the sulfated ligands and the introduced fluorine as well as nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Galectin&#8208;1 is a &#946;&#8208;galactoside&#8208;binding lectin with manifold biological functions. A single tryptophan residue (W68) in its carbohydrate binding site plays a major role in ligand binding and is highly conserved among galectins. To fine tune galectin&#8208;1 specificity, we introduced several non&#8208;canonical tryptophan analogues at this position of human galectin&#8208;1 and analyzed the resulting variants using glycan microarrays. Two variants containing 7&#8208;azatryptophan and 7&#8208;fluorotryptophan showed a reduced affinity for 3&#8217;&#8208;sulfated oligosaccharides. Their interaction with different ligands was further analyzed by fluorescence polarization competition assay. Using molecular modeling we provide structural clues that the change in affinities comes from modulated interactions and solvation patterns. Thus, we show that the introduction of subtle atomic mutations in the ligand binding site of galectin&#8208;1 is an attractive approach for fine&#8208;tuning its interactions with different ligands.

         <title>Characterization of competitive inhibitors of P. falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P. falciparum  cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is an enticing anti&#8208;malarial drug target. Novel chemotypes are needed because existing inhibitors have safety issues that may prevent further development. This work demonstrates isoxazole&#8208;based compounds are potent ATP competitive inhibitors of PfPKG and discloses a new analog in this series. Isoxazoles  3  and  5  had  K  i  values that are comparable to a known standard, 4&#8208;[2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(1&#8208;methylpiperidine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H pyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;yl] pyridine. They also exhibited excellent selectivity for PfPKG over the human ortholog and the gatekeeper mutant T618Q PfPKG, which mimics the less accessible binding site of the human ortholog. The human ortholog&#8217;s larger binding site volume was predicted to explain the selectivity of the inhibitors for the  P. falciparum  enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding Methylarginines and Methyllysines as Free Amino Acids: A Comparative Study of Multiple Host Classes**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparative binding studies for three different host classes (calixarenes, acyclic cucurbiturils and other cleft&#8208;like hosts) are presented. Each was studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships. Molecular modelling was used to gain insight on the preferences of the different hosts.







Abstract
Methylated free amino acids are an important class of targets for host&#8208;guest chemistry that have recognition properties distinct from those of methylated peptides and proteins. We present comparative binding studies for three different host classes that are each studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships. The hosts studied are all anionic and include three calixarenes, two acyclic cucurbiturils, and two other cleft&#8208;like hosts, a clip and a tweezer. We determined the binding association constants for a panel of methylated amino acids using indicator displacement assays. The acyclic cucurbiturils display stronger binding to the methylated amino acids, and some unique patterns of selectivity. The two other cleft&#8208;like hosts follow two different trends, shallow host (clip) following similar trends to the calixarenes, and the other more closed host (tweezer) binding certain less&#8208;methylated amino acids stronger than their methylated counterparts. Molecular modelling sheds some light on the different preferences of the various hosts. The results identify hosts with new selectivities and with affinities in a range that could be useful for biomedical applications. The overall selectivity patterns are explained by a common framework that considers the geometry, depth of binding pockets, and functional group participation across all host classes.

         <title>A NIR Emitting Cyanine with Large Stokes&#8217; Shift for Mitochondria and Identification of their Membrane Potential Disruption</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visualization of cellular mitochondria plays a key role in understanding their dynamics and functions. An NIR&#8208;emitting, highly biocompatible fluorescent probe was successfully developed and utilized for tracking mitochondrial dysfunction in cells via fluorescence confocal microscopy. The probe exhibited excellent biocompatibility and high selectivity for long&#8208;term imaging.







Abstract
An NIR emitting (&#955;em&#8776;730&#8197;nm) cyanine probe ExCy was synthesized in good yields by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length (i.&#8201;e., with furan moiety) to the donor&#8208;accepter system. ExCy exhibited a large Stokes&#8217; shift (&#916;&#955;&#8776;100&#8197;nm) due to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl&#8776;0.47 in DCM). Due to its low fluorescence in an aqueous environment (&#934;fl&#8776;0.007 in H2O), the probe exhibited the potential of achieving a large fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon entering a hydrophobic cellular environment. Fluorescence confocal microscopy studies revealed that ExCy was readily excitable with a far&#8208;red laser line (i.&#8201;e., 640&#8197;nm) while the corresponding emission was collected in the NIR region. ExCy exhibited excellent selectivity towards live cell mitochondria according to the co&#8208;localization studies. The probe also exhibited high photostability, long&#8208;term imaging ability and wash&#8208;free staining ability, when being applied to live cells. Our studies indicated that the mitochondrial localization of ExCy was dependent on the membrane potential of the mitochondria. ExCy was successfully utilized as a mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction indicator to visually identify cells with mitochondrial dysfunction via fluorescence confocal microscopy. ExCy was further examined for potential in&#8197;vivo imaging of zebrafish.

         <title>Discovery of Two Novel Oxidases Using a High&#8208;Throughput Activity Screen</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In search of novel enzymatic activities: Application of a high&#8208;throughput activity screening platform has led to the discovery of two novel enzymes: N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;hexosamine oxidase, a previously orphan enzyme, and a novel type of long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase, a non&#8208;homologous isofunctional enzyme (NISE) to known enzymes with this activity.







Abstract
Discovery of novel enzymes is a challenging task, yet a crucial one, due to their increasing relevance as chemical catalysts and biotechnological tools. In our work we present a high&#8208;throughput screening approach to discovering novel activities. A screen of 96 putative oxidases with 23 substrates led to the discovery of two new enzymes. The first enzyme, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;hexosamine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.29) from Ralstonia solanacearum, is a vanillyl alcohol oxidase&#8208;like flavoprotein displaying the highest activity with N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. Before our discovery of the enzyme, its activity was an orphan one &#8208; experimentally characterized but lacking the link to amino acid sequence. The second enzyme, from an uncultured marine euryarchaeota, is a long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase (LCAO, EC 1.1.3.20) active with a range of fatty alcohols, with 1&#8208;dodecanol being the preferred substrate. The enzyme displays no sequence similarity to previously characterised LCAOs, and thus is a completely novel representative of a protein with such activity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembling Properties and Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells of Chemically Synthesized Mannosylerythritol Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling properties and recovery effects on damaged skin cells using chemically synthesized mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) were investigated. Synthetic and homogeneous MELs exhibited significant self&#8208;assembling properties to form droplets or giant vesicles. In addition, a small difference in the length of the fatty acid chains of the MELs significantly affected their recovery effects on the damaged skin cells.







Abstract
Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), which are one of the representative sugar&#8208;based biosurfactants (BSs) produced by microorganisms, have attracted much attention in various fields in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) era. However, they are inseparable mixtures with respect to the chain length of the fatty acids. In this study, self&#8208;assembling properties and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of recovery effects on damaged skin cells using chemically synthesized MELs were investigated. It was revealed, for the first time, that synthetic and homogeneous MELs exhibited significant self&#8208;assembling properties to form droplets or giant vesicles. In addition, a small difference in the length of the fatty acid chains of the MELs significantly affected their recovery effects on the damaged skin cells. MELs with medium or longer length alkyl chains exhibited much higher recovery effects than that of C18&#8208;ceramide NP.

         <title>Rapid Estimation of Membrane Protein Orientation in Liposomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid fluorescence&#8208;based method for the estimation of membrane protein (MP) orientation in liposomes was developed. For the determination of MP orientation, the fluorescence of site&#8208;specifically labeled mutants was monitored. Outside&#8208;oriented fluorophores are quenched with membrane&#8208;impermeable corresponding quencher, before solubilization of liposomes by detergent, leading to maximal quench. MP orientation corresponds to the ratio of first to full quench.







Abstract
The topological organization of proteins embedded in biological membranes is crucial for the tight interplay between these enzymes and their accessibility to substrates in order to fulfil enzymatic activity. The orientation of a membrane protein reconstituted in artificial membranes depends on many parameters and is hardly predictable. Here, we present a convenient approach to assess this important property independent of the enzymatic activity of the reconstituted protein. Based on cysteine&#8208;specific chemical modification of a target membrane protein with a cyanine fluorophore and a corresponding membrane&#8208;impermeable fluorescence quencher, the novel strategy allows rapid evaluation of the distribution of the two orientations after reconstitution. The assay has been tested for the respiratory complexes bo3 oxidase and ATP synthase of Escherichia coli and the results agree well with other orientation determination approaches. Given the simple procedure, the proposed method is a powerful tool for optimization of reconstitution conditions or quantitative orientation information prior to functional measurements.

         <title>Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/S and S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds in Small Molecules and Proteins: A Combined CSD and PDB Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chalcogen bonds involving selenium and sulfur are prevalent in proteins. The work presented herein is the first extensive report on chalcogen bonds in proteins. Quantum mechanical calculations suggest that these interactions are highly directional and quite strong noncovalent interactions; the interaction energy can be as much as &#8722;15&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
The importance of selenium&#8208;centered noncovalent chalcogen bonds represented as Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;A (A=O/S) has been explored for short directional contacts in small molecules and proteins. In addition, S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O centered contacts have been analyzed. Computational analyses involving the quantitative assessment of the associated energetics, the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP), and electron density derived topological parameters, namely, quantum theory of atom in molecules (QTAIM) analyses, and NBO (natural bond orbital) based calculations, have been performed to unequivocally establish the strength, stability, and attractive role of chalcogen bonds in the solid&#8208;state. This investigation has been performed in molecules from both the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and Protein Data Bank (PDB). Thus futuristic materials may be designed keeping in mind the significance of these interactions, including their relevance in biology.

         <title>Varying the Directionality of Protein Catalysts for Aldol and Retro&#8208;Aldol Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein catalysts with varied levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions were generated using the same protein scaffold.







Abstract
Natural aldolase enzymes and created retro&#8208;aldolase protein catalysts often catalyze both aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions depending on the concentrations of the reactants and the products. Here, we report that the directionality of protein catalysts can be altered by replacing one amino acid. The protein catalyst derived from a scaffold of a previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst, catalyzed aldol reactions more efficiently than the previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst. The retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst efficiently catalyzed the retro&#8208;aldol reaction but was less efficient in catalyzing the aldol reaction. The results indicate that protein catalysts with varying levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions can be generated from the same protein scaffold.

         <title>Direct Enzymatic Synthesis of Fatty Amines from Renewable Triglycerides and Oils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils was achieved with an enzyme cascade comprised of a lipase, a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA). Multiple amines were successfully synthesized in one pot, with analytical yields as high as 97&#8201;%. Moreover, a 75&#8197;mL scale preparative scale reaction was carried out for trilaurin, obtaining 73&#8201;% isolated yield to the corresponding amine.







Abstract
Fatty amines represent an important class of commodity chemicals which have broad applicability in different industries. The synthesis of fatty amines starts from renewable sources such as vegetable oils or animal fats, but the process has multiple drawbacks that compromise the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the synthesis. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biocatalytic alternative towards the synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils. By coupling a lipase with a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA), we have accomplished the direct synthesis of multiple medium and long chain primary fatty amines in one pot with analytical yields as high as 97&#8201;%. We have also performed a 75&#8197;mL preparative scale reaction for the synthesis of laurylamine from trilaurin, obtaining 73&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Strong and Specific Recognition of CAG/CTG Repeat DNA (5&#8217;&#8208;dWGCWGCW&#8208;3&#8217;) by a Cyclic Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide</title>

A cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide, which binds to the CAG/CTG repeat sequence with high specificity and affinity, is reported.







Abstract
Abnormally expanded CAG/CTG repeat DNA sequences lead to a variety of neurological diseases, such as Huntington's disease. Here, we synthesized a cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide (cPIP), which can bind to the minor groove of the CAG/CTG DNA sequence. The double&#8208;stranded DNA melting temperature (Tm) and surface plasmon resonance assays revealed the high binding affinity of the cPIP. In addition, next&#8208;generation sequencing showed that the cPIP had high specificity for its target DNA sequence.

         <title>Scalable and Selective &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis Catalyzed by Promiscuous l&#8208;Threonine Transaldolase ObiH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
ObiH is an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase which catalyzes the diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. We have demonstrated the synthetic utility of this enzyme through preparative scale reactions to selectively generate a structurally diverse array of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, as well as downstream functionalization to generate important organic building blocks, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;keto acids.







Abstract
Enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways possess broad potential for the selective synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. However, the practical application of these enzymes for organic synthesis is dependent on the development of efficient, economical, operationally simple, and well&#8208;characterized systems for preparative scale reactions. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap for the selective biocatalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, which are important synthetic building blocks. To achieve this goal, we demonstrated the ability of ObiH, an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase, to achieve selective milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of a diverse array of non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs) using a scalable whole cell platform. We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids possessing broad functional&#8208;group diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ObiH&#8208;generated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids could be modified through additional transformations to access important motifs, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and substituted &#945;&#8208;keto acids.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Unprotected Dipeptides into Hydrogels: Water&#8208;Channels Make the Difference</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembling behaviour of the distinct stereoisomers of Ile&#8208;Phe and Phe&#8208;Ile was studied in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and found to form hydrogels. Single&#8208;crystal XRD data of the four non&#8208;enantiomeric dipeptides revealed water&#8208;channels as a distinctive feature only for the heterochiral hydrogelator D&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Ile.







Abstract
Unprotected dipeptides are attractive building blocks for environmentally friendly hydrogel biomaterials by virtue of their low&#8208;cost and ease of preparation. This work investigates the self&#8208;assembling behaviour of the distinct stereoisomers of Ile&#8208;Phe and Phe&#8208;Ile in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to form hydrogels, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), circular dichroism (CD), and oscillatory rheometry. Each peptide purity and identity was also confirmed by 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and HPLC&#8208;MS. Finally, single&#8208;crystal XRD data allowed the key interactions responsible for the supramolecular packing into amphipathic layers or water&#8208;channels to be revealed. The presence of the latter in the crystal structure is a distinctive feature of the only gelator of this work that self&#8208;organizes into stable hydrogels, with fast kinetics and the highest elastic modulus amongst its structural isomers and stereoisomers.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Early steps in the biosynthesis of the organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin are revealed, including a rare example of oxidative cyclization of an alcohol to form an epoxide.







Abstract
The fungal metabolite Fosfonochlorin features a chloroacetyl moiety that is unusual within known phosphonate natural product biochemistry. Putative biosynthetic genes encoding Fosfonochlorin in Fusarium and Talaromyces spp. were investigated through reactions of encoded enzymes with synthetic substrates and isotope labelling studies. We show that the early biosynthetic steps for Fosfonochlorin involve the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to form 2&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, followed by oxidative intramolecular cyclization of the resulting alcohol to form (S)&#8208;epoxyethylphosphonic acid. The latter reaction is catalyzed by FfnD, a rare example of a non&#8208;heme iron/2&#8208;(oxo)glutarate dependent oxacyclase. In contrast, FfnD behaves as a more typical oxygenase with ethylphosphonic acid, producing (S)&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid. FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.

         <title>A Modular System for the Rapid Comparison of Different Membrane Anchors for Surface Display on Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highway to optimized surface display: A modular surface display system, employing the SpyCatcher/SpyTag bioconjugation system, is used for rapid comparison of the membrane anchors Lpp&#8208;OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA&#8208;I with respect to their performance for surface display of the model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3. The described combinatorial screening method helps to minimize the workload required for identifying the most suitable membrane anchor for a given application.







Abstract
Comparison of different membrane anchor motifs for the surface display of a protein of interest (passenger) is crucial for achieving the best possible performance. However, generating genetic fusions of the passenger to various membrane anchors is time&#8208;consuming. We herein employ a recently developed modular display system, in which the membrane anchor and the passenger are expressed separately and assembled in&#8197;situ via SpyCatcher and SpyTag interaction, to readily combine a model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3) with four different membrane anchors (Lpp&#8208;OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA&#8208;I). This approach has the significant advantage that passengers and membrane anchors can be freely combined in a modular fashion without the need to generate direct genetic fusion constructs in each case. We demonstrate that the membrane anchors impact not only cell growth and membrane integrity, but also the BM3 surface display capacity and whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic activity. The previously used Lpp&#8208;OmpA as well as PgsA were found to be efficient for the display of BM3 via SpyCatcher/SpyTag interaction. Our strategy can be transferred to other user&#8208;defined anchor and passenger combinations and could thus be used for acceleration and improvement of various applications involving cell surface display.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highway to optimized surface display&lt;/b&gt;: A modular surface display system, employing the SpyCatcher/SpyTag bioconjugation system, is used for rapid comparison of the membrane anchors Lpp-OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA-I with respect to their performance for surface display of the model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3. The described combinatorial screening method helps to minimize the workload required for identifying the most suitable membrane anchor for a given application.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison of different membrane anchor motifs for the surface display of a protein of interest (passenger) is crucial for achieving the best possible performance. However, generating genetic fusions of the passenger to various membrane anchors is time-consuming. We herein employ a recently developed modular display system, in which the membrane anchor and the passenger are expressed separately and assembled &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; via SpyCatcher and SpyTag interaction, to readily combine a model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3) with four different membrane anchors (Lpp-OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA-I). This approach has the significant advantage that passengers and membrane anchors can be freely combined in a modular fashion without the need to generate direct genetic fusion constructs in each case. We demonstrate that the membrane anchors impact not only cell growth and membrane integrity, but also the BM3 surface display capacity and whole-cell biocatalytic activity. The previously used Lpp-OmpA as well as PgsA were found to be efficient for the display of BM3 via SpyCatcher/SpyTag interaction. Our strategy can be transferred to other user-defined anchor and passenger combinations and could thus be used for acceleration and improvement of various applications involving cell surface display.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyether Cyclization Cascade Alterations in Response to Monensin Polyketide Synthase Mutations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate promiscuity of the polyether cyclisation cascade enzymes in monensin biosynthesis in the conversion of redox derivatives of the nascent polyketide chain was studies. The post&#8208;polyketide synthase enzymes were found to have remarkable flexibility. They acted on derivatized polyketide backbones based on the three possible polyketide redox states within two different modules and gave rise to an altered polyether structure.







Abstract
The targeted manipulation of polyketide synthases has in recent years led to numerous new&#8208;to&#8208;nature polyketides. For type&#8197;I polyketide synthases the response of post&#8208;polyketide synthases (PKS) processing enzymes onto the most frequently polyketide backbone manipulations is so far insufficiently studied. In particular, complex processes such as the polyether cyclisation in the biosynthesis of ionophores such as monensin pose interesting objects of research. We present here a study of the substrate promiscuity of the polyether cyclisation cascade enzymes in monensin biosynthesis in the conversion of redox derivatives of the nascent polyketide chain. LC&#8208;HRMS/MS2&#8208;based studies revealed a remarkable flexibility of the post&#8208;PKS enzymes. They acted on derivatized polyketide backbones based on the three possible polyketide redox states within two different modules and gave rise to an altered polyether structure. One of these monensin derivatives was isolated and characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, crystallography, and bioactivity studies.

         <title>Interfacial Interactions within Amyloid Protein Corona Based on 2D MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer can be adsorbed to the surface of the MoS2 nanosheet through van der Waals forces. Especially the hIAPP (human islet amyloid peptide) pentamer can attach to the surface in a stable standing mode. The entire parallel surface of the &#946;&#8208;pleated structure greatly contributes to the interaction with the neighboring protein molecules, and further enhances the probability of amyloid formation.







Abstract
The interfacial interaction within the amyloid protein corona based on MoS2 nanomaterial is crucial, both for understanding the biological effects of MoS2 nanomaterial and the evolution of amyloid diseases. The specific nano&#8208;bio interface phenomenon of human islet amyloid peptide (hIAPP) and MoS2 nanosheet was investigated by using theoretical and experimental methods. The MoS2 nanosheet enables the attraction of hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer on its surface through van der Waals forces. Especially, the means of interaction between two hIAPP peptides might be changed by MoS2 nanosheet. In addition, it is interesting to find that the hIAPP oligomer can stably interact with the MoS2 nanosheet in one unique &#8220;standing&#8221; binding mode with an entire exposed &#946;&#8208;sheet surface. All the interaction modes on the surface of MoS2 nanosheet can be the essence of amyloid protein corona that may provide the venue to facilitate the fibrillation of hIAPP proteins. Further, it was verified experimentally that MoS2 nanosheets could accelerate the fibrillation of hIAPP at a certain concentration mainly based on the newly formed nano&#8208;bio interface. In general, our results provide insight into the molecular interaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;bio interface within the amyloid protein corona, and shed light on the pathway of amyloid protein aggregation that is related to the evolution of amyloid diseases.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Multi&#8208;Enzyme Synthesis and Purification of Uridine Diphosphate Galactose</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic platform was developed for the synthesis of UDP&#8208;Gal from low&#8208;cost and readily available precursors. The overall process was optimized for efficiency by bypassing time&#8208;consuming and expensive enzyme purification steps followed by a scale&#8208;up into a 1&#8197;L bioreactor. Here, within 23&#8197;h, a total of 23.4&#8197;g/L of UDP&#8208;galactose were produced. Costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;Gal synthesized were 0.26&#8197;&#8364;/g.







Abstract
High costs and low availability of UDP&#8208;galactose hampers the enzymatic synthesis of valuable oligosaccharides such as human milk oligosaccharides. Here, we report the development of a platform for the scalable, biocatalytic synthesis and purification of UDP&#8208;galactose. UDP&#8208;galactose was produced with a titer of 48&#8197;mM (27.2&#8197;g/L) in a small&#8208;scale batch process (200&#8197;&#956;L) within 24&#8197;h using 0.02 genzyme/gproduct. Through in&#8208;situ ATP regeneration, the amount of ATP (0.6&#8197;mM) supplemented was around 240&#8208;fold lower than the stoichiometric equivalent required to achieve the final product yield. Chromatographic purification using porous graphic carbon adsorbent yielded UDP&#8208;galactose with a purity of 92&#8201;%. The synthesis was transferred to 1&#8197;L preparative scale production in a stirred tank bioreactor. To further reduce the synthesis costs here, the supernatant of cell lysates was used bypassing expensive purification of enzymes. Here, 23.4&#8197;g/L UDP&#8208;galactose were produced within 23&#8197;h with a synthesis yield of 71&#8201;% and a biocatalyst load of 0.05 gtotal_protein/gproduct. The costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;galactose synthesized were around 0.26&#8197;&#8364;/g.

Microbial biosynthesis and catabolism of phosphonate natural products is a largely unexplored world of unusual enzyme reactions. Within this world resides Fosfonochlorin, a rare example of a halogenated phosphonate natural product, and a biosynthetic enigma since its discovery in 1988. In this study Gama and co&#8208;workers reveal two key steps in the biosynthesis of this deceptively simple molecule. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Pallitsch, D.&#8197;L.

Indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) catalyzes the indole&#8208;forming step in bacterial tryptophan biosynthesis. This minireview summarizes the data on expression, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition of IGPS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Crystal structures are also analyzed and compared to reveal structure&#8208;function relationships of value for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.







Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, affects millions of people worldwide. Several TB drugs have lost efficacy due to emerging drug resistance and new anti&#8208;TB targets are needed. Recent research suggests that indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) in M. tuberculosis (MtIGPS) could be such a target. IGPS is a (&#946;/&#945;)8&#8208;barrel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1&#8208;(o&#8208;carboxyphenylamino)&#8208;1&#8208;deoxyribulose 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (CdRP) into indole&#8208;glycerol&#8208;phosphate (IGP) in the bacterial tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. M. tuberculosis over expresses the tryptophan pathway genes during an immune response and inhibition of MtIGPS allows CD4 T&#8208;cells to more effectively fight against M. tuberculosis. Here we review the published data on MtIGPS expression, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition. We also discuss MtIGPS crystal structures and compare them to other IGPS structures to reveal potential structure&#8208;function relationships of interest for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.

         <title>Remote Photodamaging of DNA by Photoinduced Energy Transport</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far does energy migrate in DNA? DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport is a new pathway to DNA photodamage occurring at remote sites and not locally at the site of excitation by light. Although these distances might be small with regard to a whole gene, the proposal that a site might be damaged other than the site of initial photoexcitation is important to the understanding of mutations that are caused by remote DNA photodamages.







Abstract
Local DNA photodamaging by light is well&#8208;studied and leads to a number of structurally identified direct damage, in particular cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and indirect oxidatively generated damage, such as 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;hydroxyguanine. Similar damages have now been found at remote sites, at least more than 105&#8197;&#197; (30 base pairs) away from the site of photoexcitation. In contrast to the established mechanisms of local DNA photodamaging, the processes of remote photodamage are only partially understood. Known pathways include those to remote oxidatively generated DNA photodamages, which were elucidated by studying electron hole transport through the DNA about 20&#8197;years ago. Recent studies with DNA photosensitizers and mechanistic proposals on photoinduced DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport are summarized in this minireview. These new mechanisms to a new type of remote DNA photodamaging provide an important extension to our general understanding to light&#8208;induced DNA damage and their mutations.

         <title>Recent Developments in PROTAC&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation: From Bench to Clinic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past two decades, Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed as a new approach for targeted protein degradation by hijacking the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In this review, we describe recent PROTAC developments, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), an emerging paradigm&#8208;shifting technology, hijacks the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. PROTACs induce ternary complexes between an E3 ligase and POI, and this induced proximity leads to polyUb chain formation on substrates and eventual proteasomal&#8208;mediated POI degradation. PROTACs have shown great therapeutic potential by degrading many disease&#8208;causing proteins, such as the androgen receptor and BRD4. The PROTAC technology has advanced significantly in the last two decades, with the repertoire of PROTAC targets increased tremendously. Herein, we describe recent developments of PROTAC technology, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.

         <title>Ni2+ Catalyzed Cleavage of TrpLE&#8208;Fused Small Transmembrane Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;specific nickel&#8208;assisted cleavage (SNAC) of TrpLE&#8208;fused transmembrane (TM) peptides avoids the usage of toxic cyanogen bromide and produces small TM peptides in a highly efficient way under mild conditions.







Abstract
In addition to a membrane anchor, the transmembrane domain (TMD) of single&#8208;pass transmembrane proteins (SPTMPs) recently has shown essential roles in the cross&#8208;membrane activity or receptor assembly/clustering. However, these small TMD peptides are generally hydrophobic and dynamic, difficult to be expressed and purified. Here, we have integrated the power of TrpLE fusion protein and a sequence&#8208;specific nickel&#8208;assisted cleavage (SNAC)&#8208;tag to produce small TMD peptides in a highly efficient way under mild conditions, which uses Ni2+ as the cleavage reagent, avoiding the usage of toxic cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Furthermore, this method simplifies the downstream protein purification and reconstitution. Two representative TMDs, including the Spike&#8208;TMD from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS2), were successfully produced with high&#8208;quality nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Therefore, our study provides a more efficient and practical approach for general structural characterization of the small TM proteins.

         <title>Substrate Enolate Intermediate and Mimic Captured in the Active Site of Streptomyces coelicolor Methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA Epimerase**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 2, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising route to novel polyketides is through malonyl&#8208;CoA synthetases generating non&#8208;natural extender units. Yet, synthetases make extenders with (2R) stereocenters and polyketide synthases accept (2S). Engineered methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerases can overcome this incompatibility. Here we solve structures of methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerase to examine the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity determinants and find some unexpected interactions.







Abstract
Methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerase (MMCE) is proposed to use general acid&#8208;base catalysis, but the proposed catalytic glutamic acids are highly asymmetrical in the active site unlike many other racemases. To gain insight into the puzzling relationships between catalytic mechanism, structure, and substrate preference, we solved Streptomyces coelicolor MMCE structures with substrate or 2&#8208;nitropropionyl&#8208;CoA, an intermediate/transition state analogue. Both ligand bound structures have a planar methylmalonate/2&#8208;nitropropionyl moiety indicating a deprotonated C2 with &#8805;4&#8197;&#197; distances to either catalytic acid. Both glutamates interact with the carboxylate/nitro group, either directly or through other residues. This suggests the proposed catalytic acids sequentially catalyze proton shifts between C2 and carboxylate of the substrate with an enolate intermediate. In addition, our structures provide a platform to design mutations for expanding substrate scope to support combinatorial biosynthesis.

         <title>Controlling Protein Enrichment in Lipid Sponge Phase Droplets using SNAP&#8208;Tag Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step SNAP&#8208;tag bioconjugation strategy for controlling protein capture in lipid sponge phase droplets is described. The approach provides a stable covalent bond between the protein of interest and the lipid bilayer of sponge droplets, enabling protein sequestration even in the presence of the complex biochemical machinery required for cell&#8208;free protein expression.







Abstract
All cells use organized lipid compartments to facilitate specific biological functions. Membrane&#8208;bound organelles create defined spatial environments that favor unique chemical reactions while isolating incompatible biological processes. Despite the fundamental role of cellular organelles, there is a scarcity of methods for preparing functional artificial lipid&#8208;based compartments. Here, we demonstrate a robust bioconjugation system for sequestering proteins into zwitterionic lipid sponge phase droplets. Incorporation of benzylguanine (BG)&#8208;modified phospholipids that form stable covalent linkages with an O6&#8208;methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (SNAP&#8208;tag) fusion protein enables programmable control of protein capture. We show that this methodology can be used to anchor hydrophilic proteins at the lipid&#8208;aqueous interface, concentrating them within an accessible but protected chemical environment. SNAP&#8208;tag technology enables the integration of proteins that regulate complex biological functions in lipid sponge phase droplets, and should facilitate the development of advanced lipid&#8208;based artificial organelles.

         <title>Selection of M2+&#8208;Independent RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzymes with Side&#8208;Chains Mimicking Arginine and Lysine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take your chances: select the aces, lose the imidazole: Selection of self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates modified with ammonium and guanidinium cations in the absence of an imidazole&#8208;modified nucleoside yielded DNAzymes that are surprisingly M2+&#8208;independent despite the presence of Mg2+ during selection. This work tests the value of leaving out an imidazole and in favor of cationic amines and guanidines to discovery RNA cleaving DNAzymes.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of RNA by nucleic acid catalysts in the absence of a divalent metal cation (M2+) has remained an important goal in biomimicry with potential therapeutic applications. Given the lack of functional group diversity in canonical nucleotides, modified nucleotides with amino acid&#8208;like side chains were used to enhance self&#8208;cleavage rates at a single embedded ribonucleoside site. Previous works relied on three functional groups: an amine, a guanidine and an imidazole ensconced on three different nucleosides. However, to date, few studies have systematically addressed the necessity of all three modifications, as the value of any single modified nucleoside is contextualized at the outset of selection. Herein, we report on the use of only two modified dNTPs, excluding an imidazole, i.&#8201;e. 5&#8208;(3&#8208;guanidinoallyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;dUTP (dUgaTP) and 5&#8208;aminoallyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;dCTP (dCaaTP), to select in&#8208;vitro self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes that cleave in the absence of M2+ in a pH&#8208;independent fashion. Cleavage shows biphasic kinetics with rate constants that are significantly higher than in unmodified DNAzymes and compare favorably to certain DNAzymes involving an imidazole.

         <title>Quantitative Standards of 4&#8208;O&#8208;Acetyl&#8208; and 9&#8208;O&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylneuraminic Acid for the Analysis of Plasma and Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesised acetylated derivatives of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu4,5Ac2, alongside commercially available Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were utilised as standards for the quantitative analysis of these derivatives in plasma and serum samples. Multiple derivatives could be detected in one assay, which exhibited high specificity and low limits of detection and quantitation.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid, Neu5Ac) is one of a large, diverse family of nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharides that play roles in many biological functions such as immune response. Neu5Ac has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for the presence and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer. More recent research has highlighted acetylated sialic acid derivatives, specifically Neu5,9Ac2, as biomarkers for oral and breast cancers, but advances in analysis have been hampered due to a lack of commercially available quantitative standards. We report here the synthesis of 9&#8208;O&#8208; and 4&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu4,5Ac2) with optimisation of previously reported synthetic routes. Neu5,9Ac2 was synthesised in 1 step in 68&#8201;% yield. Neu4,5Ac2 was synthesised in 4 steps in 39&#8201;% overall yield. Synthesis was followed by analysis of these standards via quantitative NMR (qNMR) spectroscopy. Their utilisation for the identification and quantification of specific acetylated sialic acid derivatives in biological samples is also demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Disruption of Survivin's Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach Based on Guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole (GCP) ligands LNES and LHIS target key regions of the cancer relevant protein Survivin and are both capable of reducing cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Targeting specific protein binding sites to interfere with protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for the rational modulation of biologically relevant processes. Survivin, which is highly overexpressed in most cancer cells and considered to be a key player of carcinogenesis, features two functionally relevant binding sites. Here, we demonstrate selective disruption of the Survivin/Histone H3 or the Survivin/Crm1 interaction using a supramolecular approach. By rational design we identified two structurally related ligands (LNES and LHIS), capable of selectively inhibiting these PPIs, leading to a reduction in cancer cell proliferation.

&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;HIS&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), capable of selectively inhibiting these PPIs, leading to a reduction in cancer cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual activities of oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation by flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific flavoenzyme oxidases catalyze oxidative decarboxylation in addition to their classical oxidation reactions in the same active sites. The mechanisms underlying oxidative decarboxylation by these enzymes and how they control their two activities are not clearly known. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of four enzymes from the l&#8208;amino acid oxidase and l&#8208;hydroxy acid oxidase families, including l&#8208;tryptophan 2&#8208;monooxygenase, l&#8208;phenylalanine 2&#8208;oxidase and l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase and lactate monooxygenase which catalyze substrate oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation. Apart from specific interactions to allow substrate oxidation by the flavin cofactor, specific binding of oxidized product in the active sites appears to be important for enabling subsequent decarboxylation by these enzymes. Based on recent findings of l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase, we propose that nucleophilic attack of H2O2 on the imino acid product is the mechanism enabling oxidative decarboxylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and in vitro investigations of Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent enzymes involved in nucleic acid repair and modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of molecular oxygen for the highly selective functionalization and repair of DNA and RNA nucleobases is achieved by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/iron&#8208;dependent dioxygenases. Enzymes of special interest are the human homologs AlkBH of  Escherichia coli  EcAlkB and ten&#8208;eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in demethylation or dealkylation of DNA and RNA, although additional physiological functions are continuously being revealed. Given their importance, studying enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions, turnover and kinetic parameters is pivotal for the understanding of the mode of action of these enzymes. Diverse analytical methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy have been employed to study the changes in the active site and the overall enzyme structure upon substrate, cofactor and inhibitor addition. Several methods are now available to assess activity of these enzymes. By discussing limitations and possibilities of these techniques for EcAlkB, AlkBH and TET we aim to give a comprehensive synopsis from a bioinorganic point of view, addressing researchers from different disciplines working in the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field of epigenetic processes and DNA/RNA repair and modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for interference of insulin fibrillogenesis: challenges and advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of insulin came up with very high hopes for diabetic patients. In the year 2021, the world celebrated the 100  th  anniversary of the discovery of this vital hormone. However, external use of insulin is highly affected by its aggregating tendency that occurs during its manufacturing, transportation, and improper handling which ultimately leads its pharmaceutically and biologically ineffective form. In this review, we aim to discuss the various approaches used for decelerating insulin aggregation which results in the enhancement of its overall structural stability and usage. The approaches that are discussed are broadly classified as either a measure through excipient additions or by intrinsic modifications in the insulin native structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Promising Materials for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;efficient and specific catalysis of enzyme allow it to recognize a myriad of substrate that impels the biosensing. Nevertheless, the fragility of natural enzymes severely restricts their practical applications. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous network and attractive functions have been intelligently employed as supports to encase enzymes for protecting them against hash environments. More importantly, the customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative guideline to construct robust enzymes mimics. Herein, this review will introduce the concept of these biocatalytic MOFs, with the special emphasis on how the biocatalytic processes operated in these MOFs materials can reverse the plight of native enzymes&#8208;based biosensing. In addition, the present challenges and future outlooks in this research field are briefly put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Spectroscopic Properties of the Halotolerant Soluble Methane Monooxygenase Reductase from Methylomonas methanica MC09</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductase module of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylomonas methanica MC09 is catalytically active for NADH oxidation even at high salt concentrations. Spectroscopic analyses revealed one FeS cluster and FAD. During uncoupled turnover reactions, moderate levels of hydrogen peroxide were released. The characterization of this reductase is an important step for future biotechnological applications of a halotolerant sMMO.







Abstract
The soluble methane monooxygenase receives electrons from NADH via its reductase MmoC for oxidation of methane, which is itself an attractive C1 building block for a future bioeconomy. Herein, we present biochemical and spectroscopic insights into the reductase from the marine methanotroph Methylomonas methanica MC09. The presence of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and [2Fe2S] cluster as its prosthetic group were revealed by reconstitution experiments, iron determination and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. As a true halotolerant enzyme, MmoC still showed 50&#8201;% of its specific activity at 2&#8197;M NaCl. We show that MmoC produces only trace amounts of superoxide, but mainly hydrogen peroxide during uncoupled turnover reactions. The characterization of a highly active reductase is an important step for future biotechnological applications of a halotolerant sMMO.

         <dc:description>In this study, we developed a new bienzymatic reaction to produce enantioenriched phenylethanols. In a first step, the recombinant, unspecific peroxygenase from  Agrocybe aegerita  (r  Aae  UPO) was used to oxidise ethylbenzene and its derivatives to the corresponding ketones (prochiral intermediates) followed by enantioselective reduction into the desired (  R  )&#8208; or (  S  )&#8208;phenylethanols using the (  R  )&#8208;selective ADH from  Lactobacillus kefir  (  LK  ADH) or the (  S  )&#8208;selective ADH from  Rhodococcus ruber  (ADH&#8208;A). In a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade, 11 ethylbenzene derivatives were converted into the corresponding chiral alcohols at acceptable yields and often excellent enantioselectivity</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and characterization of site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated p53</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by various posttranslational modifications including different types of ubiquitylation, which exert distinct effects on p53. While modification by ubiquitin chains targets p53 for degradation, attachment of single ubiquitin moieties (mono&#8208;ubiquitylation) affects the intracellular location of p53 and/or its interaction with chromatin. However, how this is achieved at the molecular level remains largely unknown. Similarly, since p53 can be ubiquitylated at different lysine residues, it remains unclear if the eventual effect depends on the position of the lysine modified. Here, we combined genetic code expansion with oxime ligation to generate p53 site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated at position 120. We found that mono&#8208;ubiquitylation at this position does neither interfere with p53 ubiquitylation by the E3 ligases HDM2 and E6AP in complex with the viral E6 oncoprotein nor affect p53 binding to a cognate DNA sequence. Thus, ubiquitylation per se does not affect physiologically relevant properties of p53.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Amino Acid Substitutions on 70S Ribosomal Binding, Cellular Uptake, and Antimicrobial Activity of Oncocin Onc112</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antibacterial activity of substituted oncocin Onc112 peptides varied widely among different bacterial species, which could be partially explained by ribosome binding and cellular uptake. Onc112 analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better suggesting a complex mode of action.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are promising candidates for the treatment of infections caused by high&#8208;priority human pathogens. Their mode of action consists of (I) passive diffusion across the outer membrane, (II) active transport through the inner membrane, and (III) inhibition of protein biosynthesis by blocking the exit tunnel of the 70S ribosome. We tested whether in vitro data on ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake could predict the antibacterial activity of PrAMPs against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake rates were measured for 47 derivatives of PrAMP Onc112 and compared to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each peptide. Ribosomal binding was evaluated for ribosome extracts from four Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Bacterial uptake was assessed by quantifying each peptide in the supernatants of bacterial cultures. Oncocin analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better than for Onc112. The data suggest a complex mode of action influenced by further factors improving or reducing the antibacterial activity, including diffusion through membranes, transport mechanism, secondary targets, off&#8208;target binding, intracellular distribution, and membrane effects. Relying only on in vitro binding and uptake data may not be sufficient for the rational development of more active analogues.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Protein Manipulation Systems: From Function Regulation to Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami creates an ideal operation panel for positioning and manipulating individual proteins with nanoscale precision. This review provides an overview of the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems for protein function regulation and biological applications.







Abstract
Proteins directly participate in tremendous physiological processes and mediate a variety of cellular functions. However, precise manipulation of proteins with predefined relative position and stoichiometry for understanding protein&#8208;protein interactions and guiding cellular behaviors is still challenging. With superior programmability of DNA molecules, DNA origami technology is able to construct arbitrary nanostructures that can accurately control the arrangement of proteins with various functionalities to solve these problems. Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami&#8208;based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.

         <title>Engineering a Carbonyl Reductase for Scalable Preparation of (S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile, the Key Building Block of Ruxolitinib</title>

         <dc:description>
Rational engineering of the carbonyl reductase PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity toward the reduction of 3&#8208;cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile 1&#8201;a from 85&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%, as well as a 6&#8208;fold improvement in the specific activity. (S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;b) was prepared at 200&#8197;g/L (1.5&#8197;M) substrate concentration.







Abstract
(S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile is the key precursor for the synthesis of ruxolitinib. The bioreduction of 3&#8208;cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (1&#8201;a) offers an attractive method to access this important compound. A carbonyl reductase (PhADH) from Paraburkholderia hospita catalyzed the reduction of 1&#8201;a giving the (S)&#8208;alcohol (1&#8201;b) with 85&#8201;% ee. Rational engineering of PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity from 85&#8201;% to &gt;98&#8201;%, as well as a 6.3&#8208;fold improvement in the specific activity. The bioreduction of 1&#8201;a was performed at 200&#8197;g/L (1.5&#8197;M) substrate concentration, leading to isolation of (S)&#8208;1&#8201;b in 91&#8201;% yield. Similarly, using this mutant enzyme, 3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (2&#8201;a) and 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (3&#8201;a) were reduced at high concentration affording the corresponding alcohols in &gt;99&#8201;% ee, and 90&#8201;% and 92&#8201;% yield, respectively. The results showed that the variant H93C/A139L was a powerful biocatalyst for reduction of &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketonitriles.

         <title>Selective Immobilization of His&#8208;Tagged Phosphomannose Isomerase on Ni Chelated Nanoparticles with Good Reusability and Activity</title>

Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) with His&#8208;tag was successfully immobilized on Ni2+ charged pyridine&#8208;derived particles. The immobilized enzymes effectively maintained their activity. Excellent reusability and stability was observed after immobilization.







Abstract
Self&#8208;stable precipitation polymerization was used to prepare an enzyme&#8208;immobilized microsphere composite. Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) with His&#8208;tag was successfully immobilized on Ni2+ charged pyridine&#8208;derived particles. The maximum amount of PMI immobilized on such particles was &#8764;184&#8197;mg/g. Compared with free enzyme, the activity of the immobilized enzymes was significantly improved. In addition, the immobilized enzymes showed a much better thermostability than free enzymes. At the same time, the immobilized enzymes can be reused for multiple reaction cycles. We observed that the enzyme activity did not decrease significantly after six cycles. We conclude that the pyridine&#8208;derived particles can be used to selectively immobilize His&#8208;tagged enzymes, which can couple the enzyme purification and catalysis steps and improve the efficiency of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed industrial processes.

         <title>Charge Matters: Mutations in Omicron variant favor Binding to Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Evidence is strengthening that the novel SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mutant Omicron, with its more than 60 mutations, will spread and dominate worldwide. Although the mutations in the spike protein are known, the molecular basis for why the additional mutations in the spike protein that have not previously occurred account for Omicron's higher infection potential is not understood. We propose based on a chemical rational that the elevated occurrence of positively charged amino acids in certain domains of the spike protein (Delta: +4; Omicron: +5 vs. wild type) increases binding to cellular polyanionic receptors, such as heparan sulfate due to multivalent charge&#8208;charge interactions. This observation is a starting point for targeted drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Titration of Apparent In&#8208;Cellula Affinities of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using fluorescent probes, we estimate at the cellular level the fraction of Bait molecules bound by Prey molecules in a quantitative yeast&#8208;two hybrid assay. A titration&#8208;like analysis of flow cytometer data permits the extraction of the apparent in&#8208;cellula dissociation constant.







Abstract
A genetic assay permits simultaneous quantification of two interacting proteins and their bound fraction at the single&#8208;cell level using flow cytometry. Apparent in&#8208;cellula affinities of protein&#8208;protein interactions can be extracted from the acquired data through a titration&#8208;like analysis. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated on a diverse set of interactions with proteins from different families and organisms and with in&#8208;vitro dissociation constants ranging from picomolar to micromolar.

         <title>Oxidative stress in cancer therapy: Friend or enemy?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive cellular oxidative stress is widely perceived as a key factor in pathophysiological conditions and cancer development. Healthy cells use several mechanisms to maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overall redox homeostasis to avoid damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Cancer cells, in contrast, exhibit elevated ROS levels and upregulated protective antioxidant pathways. Counterintuitively, such elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defence mechanisms in cancer cells provide a therapeutic opportunity for the development of drugs with different anticancer mechanisms of action (MoA). In this review, oxidative stress and the role of ROS in cells are described. The tumour&#8208;suppressive and tumour&#8208;promotive functions of ROS are discussed to compare these two different therapeutic strategies (increasing or decreasing ROS to fight cancer). Clinically approved drugs with demonstrated oxidative stress anticancer MoAs are highlighted before describing examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates causing oxidative stress in cancer cells  via  novel MoAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Serum Compatible Spermine&#8208;based Cationic Lipids with Non&#8208;identical Hydrocarbon Tails Mediate High Transfection Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic lipids are widely used as non&#8208;viral synthetic vectors for gene delivery as a safer alternative to viral vectors. In this work, a library of L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with identical and non&#8208;identical hydrophobic chains having variable carbon length (from C10 to C18) was designed and synthesized. These lipids were characterized and the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds were determined for DNA binding and transfection ability when formulated as cationic liposomes. The liposomes were then used successfully for the transfection of HEK293T, HeLa, PC3, H460, HepG2, SH&#8208;SY5Y and Calu&#8217;3 cell lines. The transfection efficiency of lipids with non&#8208;identical hydrocarbon chains was greater than the identical analog. These reagents exhibited superior efficiency to the commercial reagent, Lipofectamine3000, under both serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40% serum conditions in HEK293T, HeLa and H460 cell lines. The lipids were also not toxic to the tested cells. The results suggested that L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with non&#8208;identical hydrocarbon tails could serve as an efficient and safe non&#8208;viral vector gene carrier for further  in vivo  studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel and efficient way for synthesis of N6&#8208;hydantoin modified adenosines, which utilizes readily available N6&#8208;(N&#8208;Boc&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;adenosine derivatives, was developed. The procedure is based on the epimerization free Tf2O&#8208;mediated conversion of the Boc group into an isocyanate moiety, followed by intramolecular cyclization. Using this method two recently discovered hydantoin modified tRNA adenosines, i.e. cyclic N6&#8208;threonylcarbamoyl&#8208;adenosine (ct6A) and 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;threonylcarbamoyladenosine (ms2ct6A) were prepared in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) and its application in clinical diagnosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isothermal exponential amplification technology have rarely been fabricated as the universal sensing platform for the detection of various proteins. To broaden its application, we here developed a strategy named protein recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce the DNA assembly which converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combining two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification technology. Taking advantage of this principle, diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations in the homogenous manner, making the PRIEAR suitable for clinical practice. Therefore, this strategy can expand the powerful isothermal exponential amplification technology to protein targets and thus provide a new toolbox into the clinical and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving structural stability and anticoagulant activity of a thrombin binding aptamer by aromatic modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) is a 15&#8208;mer DNA oligonucleotide (5&#8217;&#8208;GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG&#8208;3&#8217;), that can form a stable intramolecular antiparallel chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex structure. This aptamer shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with one of the two anion binding sites of thrombin, namely the fibrinogen&#8208;recognition exosite. Here, we demonstrate that terminal modification of TBA with aromatic fragments such as coumarin, pyrene and perylene diimide (PDI), improves the G&#8208;quadruplex stability.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) is a 15-mer DNA oligonucleotide (5&#8217;-GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG-3&#8217;), that can form a stable intramolecular antiparallel chair-like G-quadruplex structure. This aptamer shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with one of the two anion binding sites of thrombin, namely the fibrinogen-recognition exosite. Here, we demonstrate that terminal modification of TBA with aromatic fragments such as coumarin, pyrene and perylene diimide (PDI), improves the G-quadruplex stability. The large aromatic surface of these dyes can &#960;-&#960; stack to the G-quadruplex or to each other, thereby stabilizing the aptamer. With respect to the original TBA, monoPDI-functionalized TBA exhibited the most remarkable improvement in melting temperature (&#916;T  m  &#8776; +18 &#176;C) and displayed enhanced anticoagulant activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substrate Profiling of Anion Methyltransferases for Promiscuous Synthesis of S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine Analogs from Haloalkanes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;natural analogs of the ubiquitous co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) are difficult to access, but useful for the enzymatic functionalization of various molecules with high selectivity. We investigated the promiscuous synthesis of SAM analogs in the anion methyltransferase enzyme family. Several promiscuous enzymes have been identified that synthesize non&#8208;natural co&#8208;substrates from cheap and readily available haloalkanes. This opens new avenues for selective alkylation chemistry.







Abstract
Biocatalytic alkylation reactions can be performed with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) and SAM analogs. Currently, however, this methodology is limited in application due to the rather laborious protocols to access SAM analogs. It has recently been shown that halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable synthesis and recycling of SAM analogs with readily available haloalkanes as starting material. Here we expand this work by using substrate profiling of the anion MT enzyme family to explore promiscuous SAM analog synthesis. Our study shows that anion MTs are in general very promiscuous with respect to the alkyl chain as well as the halide leaving group. Substrate profiling further suggests that promiscuous anion MTs cluster in sequence space. Next to iodoalkanes, cheaper, less toxic, and more available bromoalkanes have been converted and several haloalkanes bearing short alkyl groups, alkyl rings, and functional groups such as alkene, alkyne and aromatic moieties are accepted as substrates. Further, we applied the SAM analogs as electrophiles in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective pyrazole allylation with 3&#8208;bromopropene as starting material.

         <title>Semi&#8208;rational Engineering of a Promiscuous Fatty Acid Hydratase for Alteration of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;rational mutant library of a promiscuous fatty acid hydrtatase (FA&#8208;HY1) revealed several mutants, which exhibited an impressive shift of regioselectivity towards eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) substrate. While the wild&#8208;type enzyme produces a mixture of two hydroxy fatty acid regioisomers at a ratio of 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH), six mutants were able to form exclusively a single hydroxy fatty acid regioisomer (15&#8208;OH).







Abstract
Fatty acid hydratases (FAHs) catalyze regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydration of unsaturated fatty acids to produce hydroxy fatty acids. Fatty acid hydratase&#8208;1 (FA&#8208;HY1) from Lactobacillus Acidophilus is the most promiscuous and regiodiverse FAH identified so far. Here, we engineered binding site residues of FA&#8208;HY1 (S393, S395, S218 and P380) by semi&#8208;rational protein engineering to alter regioselectivity. Although it was not possible to obtain a completely new type of regioselectivity with our mutant libraries, a significant shift of regioselectivity was observed towards cis&#8208;5, cis&#8208;8, cis&#8208;11, cis&#8208;14, cis&#8208;17&#8208;eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We identified mutants (S393/S395 mutants) with excellent regioselectivity, generating a single hydroxy fatty acid product from EPA (15&#8208;OH product), which is advantageous from application perspective. This result is impressive given that wild&#8208;type FA&#8208;HY1 produces a mixture of 12&#8208;OH and 15&#8208;OH products at 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 ratio (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH). Moreover, our results indicate that native FA&#8208;HY1 is at its limit in terms of promiscuity and regiospecificity, thus it may not be possible to diversify its product portfolio with active site engineering. This behavior of FA&#8208;HY1 is unlike its orthologue, fatty acid hydratase&#8208;2 (FA&#8208;HY2; 58&#8201;% sequence identity to FA&#8208;HY1), which has been shown earlier to exhibit significant promiscuity and regioselectivity changes by a few active site mutations. Our reverse engineering from FA&#8208;HY1 to FA&#8208;HY2 further demonstrates this conclusion.

         <title>Rational Design of a Cu Chelator That Mitigates Cu&#8208;Induced ROS Production by Amyloid Beta</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed mixed Cu chelator mitigates Cu&#8722;A&#946; induced reactive oxygen species formation by redox silencing and radical scavenging. The presence of oxidized amino acids in A&#946; correlates to their role in the entatic state.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease severely perturbs transition metal homeostasis in the brain leading to the accumulation of excess metals in extracellular and intraneuronal locations. The amyloid beta protein binds these transition metals, ultimately causing severe oxidative stress in the brain. Metal chelation therapy is an approach to sequester metals from amyloid beta and relieve the oxidative stress. Here we have designed a mixed N/O donor Cu chelator inspired by the proposed ligand set of Cu in amyloid beta. We demonstrate that the chelator effectively removes Cu from amyloid beta and suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by redox silencing and radical scavenging both in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. The impact of ROS on the extent of oxidation of the different aggregated forms of the peptide is studied by mass spectrometry, which, along with other ROS assays, shows that the oligomers are pro&#8208;oxidants in nature. The aliphatic Leu34, which was previously unobserved, has been identified as a new oxidation site.

         <title>Fatty Acyl Sulfonyl Fluoride as an Activity&#8208;Based Probe for Profiling Fatty Acid&#8208;Associated Proteins in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride chemical probe was developed for covalent targeting, activity profiling, proteomic identification, and inhibitor evaluation of diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.







Abstract
Fatty acids play fundamental structural, metabolic, functional, and signaling roles in all biological systems. Altered fatty acid levels and metabolism have been associated with many pathological conditions. Chemical probes have greatly facilitated biological studies on fatty acids. Herein, we report the development and characterization of an alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride probe for covalent labelling, enrichment, and identification of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells. Our quantitative chemical proteomics show that this sulfonyl fluoride probe targets diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins including many metabolic serine hydrolases that are known to be involved in fatty acid metabolism and modification. We further validate that the probe covalently modifies the catalytically or functionally essential serine or tyrosine residues of its target proteins and enables evaluation of their inhibitors. The sulfonyl fluoride&#8208;based chemical probe thus represents a new tool for profiling the expression and activity of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.

         <title>Extension of the Terpene Chemical Space: the Very First Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to a unique biosynthetic scheme, the diversification of terpene structure could be envisioned through the structural modification of the two universal common terpene precursors IPP and DMAPP. This minireview covers the synthesis, the use as prenyl transferase substrates, and the synthetic application of IPP and DMAPP homologues developed for diversifying the terpene chemical space.







Abstract
The structural diversity of terpenes is particularly notable and many studies are carried out to increase it further. In the terpene biosynthetic pathway this diversity is accessible from only two common precursors, i.&#8201;e. isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Methods recently developed (e.&#8201;g. the Terpene Mini Path) have allowed DMAPP and IPP to be obtained from a two&#8208;step enzymatic conversion of industrially available isopentenol (IOH) and dimethylallyl alcohol (DMAOH) into their corresponding diphosphates. Easily available IOH and DMAOH analogues then offer quick access to modified terpenoids thus avoiding the tedious chemical synthesis of unnatural diphosphates. The aim of this minireview is to cover the literature devoted to the use of these analogues for widening the accessible terpene chemical space.

         <title>Asymmetrically Substituted m&#8208;Terphenyl Phosphates Inhibit the Transcription Factor STAT5a</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry is overrated: Stafia&#8208;1, the first selective inhibitor of the transcription factor STAT5a, is a symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate that binds to an unsymmetrical protein binding pocket. We present synthetic methodology for generating asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate&#8208;based STAT5a inhibitors, which give insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships.







Abstract
We recently presented Stafia&#8208;1 as the first chemical entity that inhibits the transcription factor STAT5a with selectivity over the highly homologous STAT5b. Stafia&#8208;1, which was identified from a series of symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, binds to the interface between the SH2 domain and the linker domain of STAT5a. Here, we outline a synthetic strategy for the synthesis of asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, which can be tailored to address their asymmetric STAT5a binding site in a more specific manner. The asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate with the highest activity against STAT5a was converted to a phosphatase&#8208;stable monofluoromethylene phosphonate. The synthetic methodology and activity analysis described here provide first insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships of m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates for use as selective STAT5a inhibitors.

         <title>Monitoring the Response of Multiple Signal Network Components to Acute Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Perturbations in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical perturbation method is presented that allows parallel readout of multiple fluorescence&#8208;based response kinetics in individual, living cells. The method is used to uncover control mechanisms in cell contraction and their misregulation in disease.







Abstract
Cells process information via signal networks that typically involve multiple components which are interconnected by feedback loops. The combination of acute optogenetic perturbations and microscopy&#8208;based fluorescent response readouts enables the direct investigation of causal links in such networks. However, due to overlaps in spectra of photosensitive and fluorescent proteins, current approaches that combine these methods are limited. Here, we present an improved chemo&#8208;optogenetic approach that is based on switch&#8208;like perturbations induced by a single, local pulse of UV light. We show that this approach can be combined with parallel monitoring of multiple fluorescent readouts to directly uncover relations between signal network components. We present the application of this technique to directly investigate feedback&#8208;controlled regulation in the cell contraction signal network that includes GEF&#8208;H1, Rho and Myosin, and functional interactions of this network with tumor relevant RhoA G17 mutants.

         <title>Toward an Orthogonal Protein Lysine Acylation and Deacylation System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells, was rationally designed through genetically encoding artificially designed acylated lysine analogues and reshaping the substrate specificity of a bacterial protein deacetylase.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is one of the most basic molecular mechanisms to mediate protein functions in living organisms, and its abnormal regulation has been linked to many diseases. The drug development associated to this process is of great significance but severely hindered by the complex interplay of lysine acetylation and deacetylation in thousands of proteins, and we reasoned that targeting a specific protein acetylation or deacetylation event instead of the related enzymes should be a feasible solution to this issue. Toward this goal, we devised an orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells. The system includes a genetically encoded acylated lysine (PhOAcK) that is not a substrate of endogenous deacetylases, and an evolved sirtuin (CobB2/CobB3) that displays PhOAcK deacylase activities as well as reduced deacetylase activities. We believe the strategy introduced here holds potential for future in&#8208;depth biological applications.

         <title>Bioinorganic Chemistry of Zinc in Relation to the Immune System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc's role in human immunity has been extensively covered from a biological perspective. The structural, thermodynamic, and inorganic chemistry of zinc in relation to proteins and pathways of the immune system has received less attention and is the topic of the present review.







Abstract
Zinc is well&#8208;known to have a central role in human inflammation and immunity and is itself an anti&#8208;inflammatory and antiviral agent. Despite its massively documented role in such processes, the underlying chemistry of zinc in relation to specific proteins and pathways of the immune system has not received much focus. This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc&#8208;based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.

This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc-based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Beacons for Specific Sensing of Dilute Nucleic Acid**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, have been prepared by hedgehog catalyzed bioconjugation and shown to function as turn&#8208;on biosensors with single&#8208;base pair mismatch specificity using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a sample target.







Abstract
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, are 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 bioconjugates of the nanoluciferase enzyme linked covalently at its C&#8208;terminus to hairpin forming ssDNA equipped with a dark quencher. We prepared E&#8208;beacons biocatalytically using HhC, the promiscuous Hedgehog C&#8208;terminal protein&#8208;cholesterol ligase. HhC attached nanoluciferase site&#8208;specifically to mono&#8208;sterylated hairpin oligonucleotides, called steramers. Three E&#8208;beacon dark quenchers were evaluated: Iowa Black, Onyx&#8208;A, and dabcyl. Each quencher enabled sensitive, sequence&#8208;specific nucleic acid detection through enhanced E&#8208;beacon bioluminescence upon target hybridization. We assembled prototype dabcyl&#8208;quenched E&#8208;beacons specific for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Targeting the E484 codon of the virus Spike protein, E&#8208;beacons (80&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;M) reported wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleic acid at &#8805;1&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;M by increased bioluminescence of 8&#8208;fold. E&#8208;beacon prepared for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 E484K variant functioned with similar sensitivity. Both E&#8208;beacons could discriminate their target from the E484Q mutation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Kappa variant. Along with mismatch specificity, E&#8208;beacons are two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than synthetic molecular beacons.

         <title>Creation of an Engineered Amide Synthetase Biocatalyst by the Rational Separation of a Two&#8208;Step Nitrile Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational engineering of the ATP&#8208;dependent biocatalyst QueC converts a nitrile synthetase to an amide synthetase.







Abstract
The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitrile synthetase (NS) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The Bacillus subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is an NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.

         <title>Toward Engineered Biosynthesis of Drugs in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of programming human cells to produce antibiotics in&#8197;situ by transfecting cells with a heterologous biosynthetic gene packaged in a viral vector, is demonstrated. The cytochrome P450 gene fma&#8208;P450 from the antimicrobial fumagillin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus fumigatus was introduced to HeLa cells to enable these human cells to biosynthesize a cytotoxic natural product from a nontoxic precursor.







Abstract
Biosynthetic genes are not only responsible for the formation of bioactive substances but also suited for other applications including gene therapy. To test the feasibility of human cells producing antibiotics in&#8197;situ when provided with a heterologous biosynthetic gene, we focused on cytochrome P450, the class of enzymes important in conferring bioactivity to natural product precursors. We selected Fma&#8208;P450 that plays a central role in the fumagillin antimicrobial biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus to examine fungal metabolite production by HeLa cells that express fma&#8208;P450 heterologously. Here we show that HeLa cells harboring fma&#8208;P450 can biosynthesize 5&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamoten and cytotoxic 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demethoxyfumagillol when supplemented with the nontoxic precursor &#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamotene. While the production level was insufficient to effect cell death, we demonstrate that programming human cells to autogenerate antibiotics by introducing a heterologous biosynthetic gene is feasible.

         <title>Enhanced Immunostimulatory Activity of Covalent DNA Dendrons</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) have been developed. The DNA dendrons were more resistant to nuclease degradation than linear ODNs, and they enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from RAW264.7 cells as the number of immunostimulatory branches increased, suggesting that they could induce immune response through the activation of TLR9.







Abstract
The present study focused on the design and synthesis of covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) that can stimulate the immune system through the activation of TLR9. These dendrons were synthesized using branching trebler phosphoramidite containing three identical protecting groups that enabled the simultaneous synthesis of multiple strands on a single molecule. Compared with linear ODNs, covalent DNA dendrons were found to be more resistant to nuclease degradation and were more efficiently taken up by macrophage&#8208;like RAW264.7 cells. Cellular uptake was suggested to be mediated by macrophage scavenger receptors. The covalent DNA dendrons composed of multivalent immunostimulatory branches enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945; and IL&#8208;6 from RAW264.7 cells, and 9&#8208;branched DNA dendrons showed the highest enhancement. Given their enhanced efficacy, we expect covalent DNA dendrons to be useful structures of oligonucleotide medicines.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hydrogel Nanoparticles: Synthetic Antibodies for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles have great potential as materials of the future in nanomedicine. We show that these synthetic antibodies can compete seriously with their biological counterparts for immunostaining of cell glycans and protein biomarkers, for targeted drug delivery, and as therapeutic agents for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) accounted for 10 million deaths in 2020. Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, etc.), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells. In this review, we describe an emerging class of targeting ligands, molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles for their application in the early detection of disease, with the aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.

Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli-responsiveness, etc.), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells. In this review, we describe an emerging class of targeting ligands, molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles for their application in the early detection of disease, with the aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prebiotic Membranes and Micelles Do Not Inhibit Peptide Formation During Dehydration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dried dispersions of decanoic acid vesicles produce stacks of membranes. In the presence of the dried membranes, serine&#8208;ethyl&#8208;esters are converted into dipeptides at a rate that is at least as fast as in the absence of membranes. Our results enhance the plausibility that protocells (which would have colocalized membranes, RNA, and peptides) could have developed in evaporating environments on the prebiotic Earth.







Abstract
Cycles of dehydration and rehydration could have enabled formation of peptides and RNA in otherwise unfavorable conditions on the early Earth. Development of the first protocells would have hinged upon colocalization of these biopolymers with fatty acid membranes. Using atomic force microscopy, we find that a prebiotic fatty acid (decanoic acid) forms stacks of membranes after dehydration. Using LC&#8208;MS&#8208;MS (liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry) with isotope internal standards, we measure the rate of formation of serine dipeptides. We find that dipeptides form during dehydration at moderate temperatures (55&#8201;&#176;C) at least as fast in the presence of decanoic acid membranes as in the absence of membranes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that protocells could have formed within evaporating environments on the early Earth.

         <title>Fluorobenzene Nucleobase Analogues for Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,4&#8208;Difluorobenzene as a nonpolar isosteric analogue of uridine nucleobase in peptide nucleic acid forms a Hoogsteen base triplet with adenosine&#8208;uridine base pair in double helical RNA. The stability and selectivity of modified triplets suggest that 2,4&#8208;difluorobenzene uses fluorine and C&#8722;H groups in non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding similar to natural uridine&#8208;adenosine&#8208;uridine base triplets.







Abstract
2,4&#8208;Difluorotoluene is a nonpolar isostere of thymidine that has been used as a powerful mechanistic probe to study the role of hydrogen bonding in nucleic acid recognition and interactions with polymerases. In the present study, we evaluated five fluorinated benzenes as nucleobase analogues in peptide nucleic acids designed for triple helical recognition of double helical RNA. We found that analogues having para and ortho fluorine substitution patterns (as in 2,4&#8208;difluorotoluene) selectively stabilized Hoogsteen triplets with U&#8722;A base pairs. The results were consistent with attractive electrostatic interactions akin to non&#8208;canonical F to H&#8722;N and C&#8722;H to N hydrogen bonding. The fluorinated nucleobases were not able to stabilize Hoogsteen&#8208;like triplets with pyrimidines in either G&#8722;C or A&#8722;U base pairs. Our results illustrate the ability of fluorine to engage in non&#8208;canonical base pairing and provide insights into triple helical recognition of RNA.

Abstract
The synthesis, structural analysis, and evaluation of the photophysical properties of twelve novel 2&#8208;aryl(heteroaryl)&#8208;6&#8208;(4&#8208;alkyl(aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (6&#8208;8), where aryl(heteroaryl)=Ph, 4&#8208;Me&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;F&#8208;C6H4 and 2&#8208; furyl; 4&#8208;alkyl(aryl)=&#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;(CH2)5CH3 and Ph, are reported. Hybrid scaffolds 6&#8211;8 were synthesized at 77&#8211;95&#8201;% yields by regioselective copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of unpublished 6&#8208;azido&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (2) with selected terminal alkynes (3&#8211;5). Azido intermediates 2 were obtained from the reaction of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (1) and sodium azide at good yields (78&#8211;87&#8201;%). Compounds 6&#8211;8 were structurally fully characterized by 1H&#8722;, 13C&#8722; and 19F&#8722; and 1H&#8722;13C 2D&#8208;NMR (HSQC, HMBC) spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) and HRMS analysis. Moreover, the photophysical properties, DNA&#8208; and HSA&#8208;binding experiments (bio&#8208;interactions), and molecular docking studies for compounds 6&#8211;8 were performed. These are discussed and compared with similar compounds from recent research.

         <title>A Conformationally Stable Acyclic &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Scaffold Tolerating the Incorporation of Poorly &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Prone Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open but tight: Combining the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn motif with cross&#8208;strand Trp/Lys(Arg) interactions leads to a conformationally and thermally highly stable &#946;&#8208;hairpin that is not sensitive to the type of residues occupying the upper face. This &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is suited to accommodate a variety of amino acids, including poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone ones, and it does not require backbone cyclization







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hairpin is a structural element of native proteins, but it is also a useful artificial scaffold for finding lead compounds to convert into peptidomimetics or non&#8208;peptide structures for drug discovery. Since linear peptides are synthetically more easily accessible than cyclic ones, but are structurally less well&#8208;defined, we propose XWXWXpPXK(/R)X(R) as an acyclic but still rigid &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold that is robust enough to accommodate different types of side chains, regardless of the secondary&#8208;structure propensity of the X residues. The high conformational stability of the scaffold results from tight contacts between cross&#8208;strand cationic and aromatic side chains, combined with the strong tendency of the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro dipeptide to induce a type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn. To demonstrate the robustness of the scaffold, we elucidated the NMR structures and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of peptides displaying mainly non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;branched, poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone residues at the X positions. Both the NMR and MD data confirm that our acyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is highly versatile as regards the amino&#8208;acid composition of the &#946;&#8208;sheet face opposite to the cationic&#8722;aromatic one.

Both the NMR and MD data confirm that our acyclic &#946;-hairpin scaffold is highly versatile as regards the amino-acid composition of the &#946;-sheet face opposite to the cationic&#8722;aromatic one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multi&#8208;enzyme Cascade for the Biosynthesis of AICA Ribonucleoside Di&#8208; and Triphosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of AICA (5&#8242;&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide) nucleotides, the pharmaceutically active metabolites of AICA based drugs, was explored in this study. In an enzymatic cascade, a phosphoribosyl transferase is combined with two different polyphosphate kinases to selectively produce AICA ribonucleoside di&#8208; or triphosphate, respectively.







Abstract
AICA (5&#8242;&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide) ribonucleotides with different phosphorylation levels are the pharmaceutically active metabolites of AICA nucleoside&#8208;based drugs. The chemical synthesis of AICA ribonucleotides with defined phosphorylation is challenging and expensive. In this study, we describe two enzymatic cascades to synthesize AICA derivatives with defined phosphorylation levels from the corresponding nucleobase and the co&#8208;substrate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The cascades are composed of an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from Escherichia coli (EcAPT) and different polyphosphate kinases: polyphosphate kinase from Acinetobacter johnsonii (AjPPK), and polyphosphate kinase from Meiothermus ruber (MrPPK). The role of the EcAPT is to bind the nucleobase to the sugar moiety, while the kinases are responsible for further phosphorylation of the nucleotide to produce the desired phosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide. The selected enzymes were characterized, and conditions were established for two enzymatic cascades. The diphosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide derivative ZDP, synthesized from the cascade EcAPT/AjPPK, was produced with a conversion up to 91&#8201;%. The EcAPT/MrPPK cascade yielded ZTP with conversion up to 65&#8201;% with ZDP as a side product.

         <title>Exploring Dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;Reductase Reactivity and Selectivity by QM/MM&#8208;MD Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;reductase catalysis of dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanidins is promoted by access to near&#8208;attack conformers (NAC) by lowering the activation barrier (&#9653;G&#8800;). The frequency of sampling of these metastable pre&#8208;reactive states is an important factor influencing DFR selectivity, which reduces the dihydroquercetin substrate faster than dihydrokaempferol.







Abstract
Flavonoids are secondary metabolites ubiquitously found in plants. Their antioxidant properties make them highly interesting natural compounds for use in pharmacology. Therefore, unravelling the mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis is an important challenge. Among all the enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway, dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;reductase (DFR) plays a key role in the production of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Here, we provide new information on the mechanism of action of this enzyme by using QM/MM&#8208;MD simulations applied to both dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and dihydrokaempferol (DHK) substrates. The consideration of these very similar compounds shed light on the major role played by the enzyme on the stabilization of the transition state but also on the activation of the substrate before the reaction through near&#8208;attack conformer effects.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One scaffold &#8211; different organelle sensors: The structure&#8208;organelle relationship (SOR) of an important synthetic intermediate targeting the nucleus and its transformation into other pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes is demonstrated. The fluorescent probes were synthesized using a single synthetic route. As shown in the cover picture, the assembly line illustrates that a common synthetic intermediate (rectangle shape) was transformed into another molecule (triangle or hexagonal shape) in a one&#8208;step reaction to target specific cell organelles in live microglial cells. The common intermediate targets the cell nucleus, the cationic probe targets mitochondria, whereas the amine&#8208;containing probe with pH&#8208;activable property targets acidic lysosomes. The graphic was created by Ryann Davis. More information can be found in the Communication by G. Chopra et&#8197;al.

The three nitrogenase isoenzymes: The molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase, the vanadium (V) nitrogenase and the iron (Fe)&#8208;only nitrogenase, here depicted as superheroes, have a unique spectrum of activities for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The cover feature (created by Ehmad Chehrghani Bozcheloe) summarizes this minireview: the Mo nitrogenase has the highest activity for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), the V nitrogenase for the reduction of CO and the Fe&#8208;only nitrogenase for the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right tool can do the trick: A novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis was identified using the computer&#8208;assisted prediction tool Tome, and two variants with altered active sites were constructed based on homology models. All new enzyme variants showed significantly increased thermostability compared with the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens to date. The enzyme variants showed different substrate specificities and different activities in the presence of a range of co&#8208;solvents. The most stable variant was then immobilized and used for continuous production of enantiopure benzoin. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;S. Rabe et&#8197;al.

         <title>Tailoring Enzyme Stringency Masks the Multispecificity of a Lyngbyatoxin (Indolactam Alkaloid) Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolactam alkaloids are potentially valuable molecular tools for modulating the activity of protein kinase C. In an attempt to generate novel lyngbyatoxin (LTX) variants, we mutated the A&#8208;domain of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase, LtxA, in an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain expressing the cyanobacterial LTX pathway. The mutations resulted in the differential production of valine&#8208;, isoleucine&#8208;, and leucine&#8208;derived pathway products.







Abstract
Indolactam alkaloids are activators of protein kinase C (PKC) and are of pharmacological interest for the treatment of pathologies involving PKC dysregulation. The marine cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway for lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis, which we previously expressed in E.&#8197;coli, was studied for its amenability towards the biosynthesis of indolactam variants. Modification of culture conditions for our E.&#8197;coli heterologous expression host and analysis of pathway products suggested the native lyngbyatoxin pathway NRPS does possess a degree of relaxed specificity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of two positions within the adenylation domain (A&#8208;domain) substrate&#8208;binding pocket was performed, resulting in an alteration of substrate preference between valine, isoleucine, and leucine. We observed relative congruence of in&#8197;vitro substrate activation by the LtxA NRPS to in&#8197;vivo product formation. While there was a preference for isoleucine over leucine, the substitution of alternative tailoring domains may unveil the true in&#8197;vivo effects of the mutations introduced herein.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. The results show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages. These results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia &#8211; the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens that rely on this mechanism to obtain PLP. For this reason, Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases. The results obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i)&#8197;activation of Cys87, (ii)&#8197;deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii)&#8197;hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv)&#8197;enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature (19.1&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) agree very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step (18.2&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;11), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site. This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)&#8197;it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)&#8197;the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii) Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process. Together, these results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.

         <title>Novel Quinic Acid Glycerates from Tussilago farfara Inhibit Polypeptide GalNAc&#8208;Transferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate isolated from T.&#8197;farfara, was found to inhibit the activity of GalNAc&#8208;T2.







Abstract
The discovery of a bioactive inhibitor tool for human polypeptide N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyl transferases (GalNAc&#8208;Ts), the initiating enzyme for mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation, remains challenging. In the present study, we identified an array of quinic acid derivatives, including four new glycerates (1&#8211;4) from Tussilago farfara, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, as active inhibitors of GalNAc&#8208;T2 using a combined screening approach with a cell&#8208;based T2&#8208;specific sensor and purified enzyme assay. These inhibitors dose&#8208;dependently inhibited human GalNAc&#8208;T2 but did not affect O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), the other type of glycosyltransferase. Importantly, they are not cytotoxic and retain inhibitory activity in cells lacking elongated O&#8208;glycans, which are eliminated by the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study unveiled a novel quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate pharmacophore that directs inhibition. Overall, these new natural product inhibitors could serve as a basis for developing an inhibitor tool for GalNAc&#8208;T2.

         <title>A Specialized Dehydrogenase Provides l&#8208;Phenyllactate for FR900359 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenase FrsC is involved in biosynthesis of the Gq protein inhibiting natural product FR900359. Here, we biochemically characterized FrsC, catalyzing the formation of l&#8208;phenyllactate, and its subsequent incorporation into the FR assembly line followed by epimerization. A detailed bioinformatic analysis revealed that FrsC has evolved from primary metabolic enzymes to a specialized reductase accepting only aromatic substrates.







Abstract
d&#8208;Phenyllactate (PLA) is a component of the selective Gq protein inhibitor and nonribosomal cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). Here we report a detailed biochemical investigation of PLA biosynthesis and its incorporation into the natural product FR. The enzyme FrsC, member of the lactate/malate dehydrogenase superfamily, was shown to catalyze the formation of l&#8208;PLA from phenylpyruvate. FrsC was kinetically characterized and its substrate specificity determined. Incorporation of l&#8208;PLA was probed by assaying the adenylation domain FrsE&#8208;A3 and feeding studies with a Chromobacterium vaccinii &#916;frsC mutant, confirming preferred activation of l&#8208;PLA followed by on&#8208;line epimerization to d&#8208;PLA. Finally, detailed bioinformatic analyses of FrsC revealed its close relation to malate dehydrogenases from primary metabolism and suggest extensions in the substrate binding loop to be responsible for its adaptation to accepting larger aromatic substrates with high specificity.

         <title>Characterization of Structure and Dynamics of the Guanidine&#8208;II Riboswitch from Escherichia coli by NMR Spectroscopy and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gdn&#8208;II riboswitch aptamer from E.&#8197;coli with wild&#8208;type and loop&#8208;mutated constructs were investigated in the context of ligand interactions. Based on NMR spectroscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data, previous crystal structures were confirmed, and an intermolecular ligand binding mechanism with the P1 loop as interaction interface instead of the postulated (intramolecular) P1&#8208;P2 kissing loop was found.







Abstract
Riboswitches are regulatory RNA elements that undergo functionally important allosteric conformational switching upon binding of specific ligands. The here investigated guanidine&#8208;II riboswitch binds the small cation, guanidinium, and forms a kissing loop&#8208;loop interaction between its P1 and P2 hairpins. We investigated the structural changes to support previous studies regarding the binding mechanism. Using NMR spectroscopy, we confirmed the structure as observed in crystal structures and we characterized the kissing loop interaction upon addition of Mg2+ and ligand for the riboswitch aptamer from Escherichia coli. We further investigated closely related mutant constructs providing further insight into functional differences between the two (different) hairpins P1 and P2. Formation of intermolecular interactions were probed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR DOSY data. All data are consistent and show the formation of oligomeric states of the riboswitch induced by Mg2+ and ligand binding.

     alt="Characterization of Structure and Dynamics of the Guanidine-II Riboswitch from Escherichia coli by NMR Spectroscopy and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gdn-II riboswitch aptamer&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; with wild-type and loop-mutated constructs were investigated in the context of ligand interactions. Based on NMR spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, previous crystal structures were confirmed, and an intermolecular ligand binding mechanism with the P1 loop as interaction interface instead of the postulated (intramolecular) P1-P2 kissing loop was found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riboswitches are regulatory RNA elements that undergo functionally important allosteric conformational switching upon binding of specific ligands. The here investigated guanidine-II riboswitch binds the small cation, guanidinium, and forms a kissing loop-loop interaction between its P1 and P2 hairpins. We investigated the structural changes to support previous studies regarding the binding mechanism. Using NMR spectroscopy, we confirmed the structure as observed in crystal structures and we characterized the kissing loop interaction upon addition of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ligand for the riboswitch aptamer from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We further investigated closely related mutant constructs providing further insight into functional differences between the two (different) hairpins P1 and P2. Formation of intermolecular interactions were probed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR DOSY data. All data are consistent and show the formation of oligomeric states of the riboswitch induced by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ligand binding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfation Pattern Dependent Iron(III) Mediated Interleukin&#8208;8 Glycan Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of hyaluronan sulfation degree and metal ion on interleukin&#8208;8 binding was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations.







Abstract
Cytokines such as interleukin&#8208;8 activate the immune system during infection and interact with sulfated glycosaminoglycans with specific sulfation patterns. In some cases, these interactions are mediated by metal ion binding which can be used to tune surface&#8208;based glycan&#8208;protein interactions. We evaluated the effect of both hyaluronan sulfation degree and Fe3+ on interleukin&#8208;8 binding by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations. Our results show that sulfation degree and metal ion interactions have a synergistic effect in tuning the electrochemical response of the glycated surfaces to the cytokine.

         <title>Identification and Analysis of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus, was identified. It has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases, which consist of eight modules. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of compounds accumulated in the mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in Streptomyces remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus. The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total. In&#8197;vitro analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl&#8208;CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.

         <title>The Small Open Reading Frame&#8208;Encoded Peptides: Advances in Methodologies and Functional Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small open reading frames (sORFs) were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of sORFs&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.







Abstract
Small open reading frames (sORFs) are an important class of genes with less than 100 codons. They were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that sORFs could encode a considerable number of polypeptides, many of which play important roles in both physiology and disease pathology. However, it has been technically challenging to directly detect sORF&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here, we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.

         <title>Deep Sequencing of a Systematic Peptide Library Reveals Conformationally&#8208;Constrained Protein Interface Peptides that Disrupt a Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. We utilized high throughput oligonucleotide synthesis, peptide phage display library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing to show a peptide library encompassing a binding partner in a protein&#8208;protein interaction can serve as a source of peptides that mimic the interface and provide a starting point for developing inhibitors that block the interface.







Abstract
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. The BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II proteins are unrelated in sequence and structure and yet each potently inhibit &#946;&#8208;lactamases. High&#8208;throughput oligonucleotide synthesis was used to construct a 12,470&#8208;member library containing overlapping linear and cyclic peptides ranging in size from 6 to 21 amino acids that scan through the sequences of BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II. Phage display affinity selections and deep sequencing revealed that, despite the differences in interaction surfaces with &#946;&#8208;lactamases, rapid enrichment of consensus peptide regions originating from both BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II contact residues in the binding interface occurred. BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II peptides that were enriched by affinity selection were shown to bind &#946;&#8208;lactamases and disrupt the BLIP/&#946;&#8208;lactamase interaction. The results suggest that peptides that bind at and disrupt PPI interfaces can be identified through systematic peptide library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing.

         <title>Incorporation and Utility of a Responsive Ribonucleoside Analogue in Probing the Conformation of a Viral RNA Motif by Fluorescence and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>

Design, synthesis and incorporation of an environment&#8208;sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two&#8208;channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy techniques are described.







Abstract
Development of versatile probes that can enable the study of different conformations and recognition properties of therapeutic nucleic acid motifs by complementing biophysical techniques can greatly aid nucleic acid analysis and therapy. Here, we report the design, synthesis and incorporation of an environment&#8208;sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two&#8208;channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy techniques. The nucleoside analogue is based on a 5&#8208;fluorobenzofuran&#8208;uracil core and its fluorescence and 19F NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to changes in solvent polarity and viscosity. Notably, the modified ribonucleotide and phosphoramidite substrates can be efficiently incorporated into RNA oligonucleotides (ONs) by in&#8197;vitro transcription and standard solid&#8208;phase ON synthesis protocol, respectively. Fluorescence and 19F readouts of the nucleoside incorporated into model RNA ONs are sensitive to the neighbouring base environment. The responsiveness of the probe was aptly utilized in detecting and quantifying the metal ion&#8208;induced conformational change in an internal ribosome entry site RNA motif of hepatitis C virus, which is an important therapeutic target. Taken together, our probe is a good addition to the nucleic acid analysis toolbox with the advantage that it can be used to study nucleic acid conformation and recognition simultaneously by two biophysical techniques.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design, synthesis&lt;/b&gt; and incorporation of an environment-sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two-channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopy techniques are described.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of versatile probes that can enable the study of different conformations and recognition properties of therapeutic nucleic acid motifs by complementing biophysical techniques can greatly aid nucleic acid analysis and therapy. Here, we report the design, synthesis and incorporation of an environment-sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two-channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopy techniques. The nucleoside analogue is based on a 5-fluorobenzofuran-uracil core and its fluorescence and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to changes in solvent polarity and viscosity. Notably, the modified ribonucleotide and phosphoramidite substrates can be efficiently incorporated into RNA oligonucleotides (ONs) by &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription and standard solid-phase ON synthesis protocol, respectively. Fluorescence and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F readouts of the nucleoside incorporated into model RNA ONs are sensitive to the neighbouring base environment. The responsiveness of the probe was aptly utilized in detecting and quantifying the metal ion-induced conformational change in an internal ribosome entry site RNA motif of hepatitis C virus, which is an important therapeutic target. Taken together, our probe is a good addition to the nucleic acid analysis toolbox with the advantage that it can be used to study nucleic acid conformation and recognition simultaneously by two biophysical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligo Pools as an Affordable Source of Synthetic DNA for Cost&#8208;Effective Library Construction in Protein&#8208; and Metabolic Pathway Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of large variant libraries is critical for rational protein engineering, directed evolution, and protein de novo design, but is constrained by the relatively high cost of DNA synthesis. Here, we consolidate methods that allow using array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools as DNA input &#8211; a cheap but error&#8208;prone source of DNA.







Abstract
The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user&#8208;defined sequences (up to &#8764;350&#8197;bases in length) have emerged as a low&#8208;cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost &#8804;10&#8201;% (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next&#8208;generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence&#8208;function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de&#8208;novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.

         <title>Mammalian Chemical Genomics towards Identifying Targets and Elucidating Modes&#8208;of&#8208;Action of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical genomic screens using shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA libraries in mammalian cultured cells play central roles in identifying modes of action of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances of chemical genomic approaches in mammalian cultured cells to identify the molecular target, modes of action, and synthetic lethal pathways of compounds of interest, with a focus on recent examples including our results are discussed.







Abstract
The step of identifying target molecules and elucidating the mode of action of bioactive compounds is a major bottleneck for drug discovery from phenotypic screening. Genetic screening for genes that affect drug sensitivity or phenotypes of mammalian cultured cells is a powerful tool to obtain clues to their modes of action. Chemical genomic screening systems for comprehensively identifying such genes or genetic pathways have been established using shRNA libraries for RNA interference&#8208;mediated mRNA knockdown or sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene knockout. The combination of chemical genomic screening in mammalian cells with other approaches such as biochemical searches for target molecules, phenotypic profiling, and yeast genetics provides a systematic way to elucidate the mode of action by converging various pieces of information regarding target molecules, target pathways, and synthetic lethal pathways.

         <title>The Application of Biocatalysis in the Preparation and Resolution of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adducts and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction is an important carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reaction in organic synthesis. A new stereogenic centre is created in this reaction and much effort has been invested over the years into finding methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman products. In this review, the contribution of biocatalysis towards achieving this goal is discussed.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction affords highly functionalised allylic alcohols containing a new stereogenic centre. These MBH adducts are very versatile and have been transformed into a large range of products, some of which have medicinal potential. Several examples of asymmetric syntheses of MBH adducts have been reported, although a generally applicable method remains to be developed. Biocatalytic approaches for the synthesis and enzymatic kinetic resolution of MBH adducts have been reported, and are discussed in detail in this review. Enzymes able to catalyse the asymmetric MBH reaction have been identified, but selectivity and efficiency have generally been low. Lipases, esterases and nitrile&#8208;converting enzymes have all been successfully applied in the resolution of MBH adducts, with excellent selectivity being realised in most cases.

         <title>Selective Capture of Anti&#8208;N&#8208;glucosylated NTHi Adhesin Peptide Antibodies by a Multivalent Dextran Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;based tentacles were decorated with peptide antigens as a way to increase the ability to capture circulating IgM antibodies in multiple sclerosis patient sera as disease biomarkers. A novel peptide&#8208;dextran conjugate bearing multiple copies of a selected epitope of the non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus Influenzae adhesin protein was synthesis and characterized. Immunological experiments provide the proof&#8208;of concept for the identification and capture of specific IgM antibodies in patient sera.







Abstract
Tentacle&#8208;like polymers decorated with several copies of peptide antigens can be interesting tools for increasing the ability to capture circulating antibodies in patient sera, using cooperative effects for stronger avidity. We previously showed that antibodies from multiple sclerosis (MS) patient sera preferentially recognize hyperglucosylated adhesin protein HMW1ct of non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). We selected the C&#8208;terminal HMW1ct(1347&#8211;1354) minimal epitope and prepared the diglucosylated analogue Ac&#8208;KAN(Glc)VTLN(Glc)TTG&#8208;K(N3)&#8208;NH2 to graft a 40&#8197;kDa dextran scaffold modified with glycidyl&#8208;propargyl moieties to perform a copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide coupling reaction (CuAAC). Quantitative NMR measurements allowed the characterization of the peptide loading (19.5&#8201;%) on the multivalent dextran conjugate. This novel polymeric structure displayed optimal capturing properties of both IgG and, more interestingly, IgM antibodies in MS sera. Specific antibodies from a representative MS serum, were successfully depleted using a Sepharose resin bearing the new glucosylated multivalent conjugate, as confirmed by ELISA. These results may offer a promising proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the selective purification of high affinity autoantibodies from sera of autoimmune patients, in general, and of specific high affinity antibodies against a minimally glcosylated epitope Asn(Glc) from sera of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in particular.

         <title>Targeting the Central Pocket of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectin LecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ligand binding pocket for additional pharmacophores in inhibitors of the bacterial lectin and virulence factor LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified and successfully targeted, using a suite of modelling, chemical synthesis, and biophysical analyses. The crystal structure of LecA with one ligand targeting this central pocket was solved, and validated the concept.







Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen that produces two lectins, LecA and LecB, as part of its large arsenal of virulence factors. Both carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are central to the initial and later persistent infection processes, i.&#8201;e. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The biofilm matrix is a major resistance determinant and protects the bacteria against external threats such as the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the development of drugs against the P. aeruginosa biofilm is of particular interest to restore efficacy of antimicrobials. Carbohydrate&#8208;based inhibitors for LecA and LecB were previously shown to efficiently reduce biofilm formations. Here, we report a new approach for inhibiting LecA with synthetic molecules bridging the established carbohydrate&#8208;binding site and a central cavity located between two LecA protomers of the lectin tetramer. Inspired by in silico design, we synthesized various galactosidic LecA inhibitors with aromatic moieties targeting this central pocket. These compounds reached low micromolar affinities, validated in different biophysical assays. Finally, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the interactions of this compound class with LecA. This new mode of action paves the way to a novel route towards inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilms.

     alt="Targeting the Central Pocket of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectin LecA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new ligand binding pocket&lt;/b&gt; for additional pharmacophores in inhibitors of the bacterial lectin and virulence factor LecA from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; was identified and successfully targeted, using a suite of modelling, chemical synthesis, and biophysical analyses. The crystal structure of LecA with one ligand targeting this central pocket was solved, and validated the concept.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen that produces two lectins, LecA and LecB, as part of its large arsenal of virulence factors. Both carbohydrate-binding proteins are central to the initial and later persistent infection processes, i.&#8201;e. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The biofilm matrix is a major resistance determinant and protects the bacteria against external threats such as the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the development of drugs against the &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm is of particular interest to restore efficacy of antimicrobials. Carbohydrate-based inhibitors for LecA and LecB were previously shown to efficiently reduce biofilm formations. Here, we report a new approach for inhibiting LecA with synthetic molecules bridging the established carbohydrate-binding site and a central cavity located between two LecA protomers of the lectin tetramer. Inspired by &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; design, we synthesized various galactosidic LecA inhibitors with aromatic moieties targeting this central pocket. These compounds reached low micromolar affinities, validated in different biophysical assays. Finally, X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the interactions of this compound class with LecA. This new mode of action paves the way to a novel route towards inhibition of &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of DNA Containing Iodinated Pyrimidine or 7&#8208;Deazapurine Nucleobases and Their Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications through the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Iodinated pyrimidine or 7&#8208;deazapurine 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were found to be excellent substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic construction of oligonucleotide (ONs) or DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications through Suzuki cross&#8208;couplings worked in the terminal positions or single&#8208;stranded ONs but not in internal positions of double&#8208;stranded DNA.







Abstract
All four iodinated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) derived from 5&#8208;iodouracil, 5&#8208;iodocytosine, 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine and 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine were prepared and studied as substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase. All of the nucleotides were readily incorporated by primer extension and by PCR amplification to form DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. Systematic study of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with two bulkier arylboronic acids revealed that the 5&#8208;iodopyrimidines were more reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products both in the terminal or internal position in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides (ssONs) and in the terminal position of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA), whereas the 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurines were less reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products only in the terminal position. None of the four iodinated bases reacted in an internal position of dsDNA. These findings are useful for the use of the iodinated nucleobases for post&#8208;synthetic modification of DNA with functional groups for various applications.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Reversible Nanoassemblies of G&#8208;Triplexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible dimeric G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies were developed using a ligand &#8211; an alkaloid of sanguinarine &#8211; as &#8216;glue&#8217;. The glue's adhesivity can be dynamically tuned by prevalent factors including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2, to efficiently regulate the G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies. However, the G&#8208;quadruplex counterpart does not respond to give nanoassemblies. Our work provides new perspectives in developing G&#8208;triplex&#8208;based nanodevices.







Abstract
G&#8208;triplex (G3) structures formed with three consecutive G&#8208;tracts have recently been identified as a new emerging guanine&#8208;rich DNA fold. There could likely be a wide range of biological functions for G3s as occurring for G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures formed with four consecutive G&#8208;tracts. However, in comparison to the many reports on G4 nanoassemblies that organize monomers together in a controllable manner, G3&#8208;favored nanoassemblies have yet to be explored. In this work, we found that a natural alkaloid of sanguinarine can serve as a dynamic ligand glue to reversibly switch the dimeric nanoassemblies of the thrombin binding aptamer G3 (TBA&#8208;G3). The glue planarity was considered to be a crucial factor for realizing this switching. More importantly, external stimuli including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2 can be employed as common regulators to easily modulate the glue's adhesivity for constructing and destructing the G3 nanoassemblies as a result of the ligand converting between isoforms. However, this assembly behavior does not occur with the counterpart TBA&#8208;G4. Our work demonstrates that higher&#8208;order G3 nanoassemblies can be reversibly operated by manipulating ligand adhesivity. This provides an alternative understanding of the unique behavior of guanine&#8208;rich sequences and focuses attention on the G3 fold since the nanoassembly event investigated herein might occur in living cells.

         <title>Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharide Supplementation Modulates Pathogen&#8208;Commensal Competition between Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus salivarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of the infant microbiome and how the microbiota is affected by feeding choice has recently gained interest. We designed a two&#8208;species microbiome in which a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, is cultured with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that the common infant formula supplement, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides are able to reverse the effects of S. salivarius growth suppression by S. agalactiae.







Abstract
The members of the infant microbiome are governed by feeding method (breastmilk vs. formula). Regardless of the source of nutrition, a competitive growth advantage can be provided to commensals through prebiotics &#8211; either human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) or plant oligosaccharides that are supplemented into formula. To characterize how prebiotics modulate commensal &#8211; pathogen interactions, we have designed and studied a minimal microbiome where a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae engages with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that while S. agalactiae suppresses the growth of S. salivarius via increased lactic acid production, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation reverses the effect. This result has major implications in characterizing how single species survive in the gut, what niche they occupy, and how they engage with other community members.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive natural proteins have been widely investigated and show great potential for their application in various fields. This minireview highlights the recent advances in natural proteins with specific stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, including temperature, light, force, electric field, and magnetic field.







Abstract
Natural proteins are essential biomacromolecules that fulfill versatile functions in the living organism, such as their usage as cytoskeleton, nutriment transporter, homeostasis controller, catalyzer, or immune guarder. Due to the excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility/biodegradability, natural protein&#8208;based biomaterials are well equipped for prospective applications in various fields. Among these natural proteins, stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins can be reversibly and precisely manipulated on demand, rendering the protein&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for numerous applications, including disease detection, drug delivery, bio&#8208;sensing, and regenerative medicine. Therefore, we present some typical natural proteins with diverse physical stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, including temperature, light, force, electrical, and magnetic sensing in this review. The structure&#8208;function mechanism of these proteins is discussed in detail. Finally, we give a summary and perspective for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins.

         <title>New Trends and Future Opportunities in the Enzymatic Formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research on the biocatalytic formation of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O is surveyed in this review to provide an overview of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field as well as future perspectives.







Abstract
Organic chemistry provides society with fundamental products we use daily. Concerns about the impact that the chemical industry has over the environment is propelling major changes in the way we manufacture chemicals. Biocatalysis offers an alternative to other synthetic approaches as it employs enzymes, Nature's catalysts, to carry out chemical transformations. Enzymes are biodegradable, come from renewable sources, operate under mild reaction conditions, and display high selectivities in the processes they catalyse. As a highly multidisciplinary field, biocatalysis benefits from advances in different areas, and developments in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering have accelerated the extension of the range of available transformations (E.&#8197;L. Bell et&#8197;al., Nat. Rev. Meth. Prim. 2021, 1, 1&#8211;21). Recently, we surveyed advances in the expansion of the scope of biocatalysis via enzyme discovery and protein engineering (J.&#8197;R. Marshall et&#8197;al., Tetrahedron 2021, 82, 131926). Herein, we focus on novel enzymes currently available to the broad synthetic community for the construction of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bonds, with the purpose of providing the non&#8208;specialist with new and alternative tools for chiral and sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Yariv reagents are a class of tris&#8208;azo dyes, some of which stain and precipitate arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), plant cell wall proteoglycans. These dyes form supramolecular aggregates in solution. In this study, CD spectroscopy revealed that the aggregates exhibit helical chirality. Only those aggregates with right&#8208;handed helicity have a fertile interaction with AGP, while those with left&#8208;handed helicity do not bind. Artwork credit: D. Caianiello and M. Bohne.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Up Sugars: Glycosyltransferase Cross&#8208;Reactivity in Cancerous Tissues and Their Therapeutic Targeting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically incompatible and/or cryptic glycans can be expressed in cancer. In humans, both humoral and cellular natural immunity exists against these glycans. The fact that tumors expressing these glycans grow indicates that immunity is not strong enough. However, it can be enhanced by active/passive immunization, for example, using mini&#8208;transfusion of glycan&#8208;expressing red blood cells, which may have the potential to be used for novel cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
The main categories of glycan changes in cancer are: (1)&#8197;decreased expression of histo&#8208;blood group A and/or B antigens and increased Lewis&#8208;related antigens, (2)&#8197;appearance of cryptic antigens, such as Tn and T, (3)&#8197;emergence of genetically incompatible glycans, such as A antigen expressed in tumors of individuals of group B or O and heterophilic expression of Forssman antigen (FORS1), and (4)&#8197;appearance of neoglycans. This review focuses on the expression of genetically incompatible A/B/FORS1 antigens in cancer. Several possible molecular mechanisms are exemplified, including missense mutations that alter the sugar specificity of A and B glycosyltransferases (AT and BT, respectively), restoration of the correct codon reading frame of O alleles, and modification of acceptor specificity of AT to synthesize the FORS1 antigen by missense mutations and/or altered splicing. Taking advantage of pre&#8208;existing natural immunity, the potential uses of these glycans for immunotherapeutic targeting will also be discussed.

         <title>Biomimetic DNA Nanotechnology to Understand and Control Cellular Responses</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, and differentiate. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool.







Abstract
At the cellular level, numerous nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, differentiate, etc. Understanding and manipulating the cellular functions in&#8197;vitro, necessitates the elucidation of these nanocues provided to the cells by the extracellular matrix (ECM), neighbouring cells or in the form of ligands. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool. We also provide a brief outlook on the current challenges and the future potentials of these DNA&#8208;based nanostructures so as to inspire novel innovations in the field.

         <title>Controlling Enzymatic Activity by Modulating the Oligomerization State via Chemical Rescue and Optical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching activity by switching the oligomerization state: The cover feature illustrates the switching of an enzyme's activity by modulating its oligomerization state using light. A photo&#8208;sensitive unnatural amino acid (UAA) was incorporated into the oligomerization interface of the enzyme, leading to disassembly of the native hexamer into dimers. This was associated with a loss of activity, symbolized by the red dots at the active sites. Upon light exposure, the UAA was cleaved, which led to hexamer reformation and recovery of activity (green dots at the active sites). More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Kropp, A. Bruckmann, and P. Babinger.
