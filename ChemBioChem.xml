         <title>Design and Synthesis of Xanthone Analogs Conjugated with Aza&#8208;aromatic Substituents as Promising G&#8208;Quadruplex Stabilizing Ligands and their Selective Cancer Cell Cytotoxic Action</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have examined the stabilization of higher order non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures formed by the G&#8208;rich sequences in the promoter region of oncogenes&#160;by newly synthesized, novel nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics conjugated to xanthone moiety. Compounds with N&#8208;heterocyclic such as pyridine (XNiso), benzimidazole (XBIm), quinoxaline (XQX) and fluorophore dansyl (XDan) substituents showed greater effectiveness on the stabilization of the G4 DNA as well as selective cancer cell (mainly A549 cells) cytotoxicity over normal cells both in terms of UV&#8208;Vis spectral titrations and cytotoxicity assay respectively. Both fluorescence spectral titrimetric measurements and circular dichroism (CD) melting experiments further substantiated the G4 stabilization phenomenon by these small molecular ligands.&#160;In polymerase stop assay, the formation of stable G4 structures in the promoter of oncogenes and halting of DNA synthesis in the presence of the above&#8208;mentioned compounds was demonstrated by using oncogene promoter as the DNA synthesis template. Apoptosis&#8208;mediated cell death of the cancer cells was proved by Annexin V&#8208;PI dual staining assay and cell cycle arrest occurred in the S phase of the cell cycles. The plausible mode of binding involves the stacking of the xanthone core on the G4 DNA plane with the possibility of interaction with the 5&#8217;&#8208;overhang as indicated by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;dependent re&#8208;alignment of the short multifunctional peptide BP100 in membranes revealed by solid&#8208;state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BP100 is a cationic 11&#8208;mer peptide with antimicrobial and cell&#8208;penetrating activities. The orientation of this amphiphilic &#945;&#8208;helix in lipid bilayers was examined under numerous conditions using solid&#8208;state 19F&#8208;, 15N&#8208; and 2H&#8208;NMR. At high temperatures in saturated phosphatidylcholine lipids, BP100 lies flat on the membrane surface, as expected. Upon lowering the temperature towards the lipid phase transition, the helix is found to flip into an upright transmembrane orientation. In thin bilayers, this inserted state was stable at low peptide concentration, but thicker membranes required higher peptide concentrations. In the presence of lyso&#8208;lipids, the inserted state prevailed even at high temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that BP100 monomer insertion can be stabilized by snorkeling lysine side&#8208;chains. These results demonstrate that even a very short helix like BP100 can span (and thereby penetrate through) a cellular membrane under suitable conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1&#8208;Azasugar analogues of L&#8208;iduronic acid (L&#8208;IdoA) and D&#8208;glucuronic acid (D&#8208;GlcA) and their corresponding enantiomers were synthesized as potential pharmacological chaperones for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding &#945;&#8208;iduronidase (IDUA). The compounds were efficiently synthesized in nine or ten steps from D&#8208; or L&#8208;arabinose and the structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of key intermediates. All compounds were inactive against IDUA, although L&#8208;IdoA&#8208;configured 8 moderately inhibited &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase (&#946;&#8208;GLU). The D&#8208;GlcA&#8208;configured 9 was a potent inhibitor of &#946;&#8208;GLU and a moderate inhibitor of the endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase heparanase. Co&#8208;crystallization of 9 with heparanase revealed that the endocyclic nitrogen of 9 forms close interactions with both the catalytic acid and catalytic nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoclick and Release: Co&#8208;activation of Carbon Monoxide and a Fluorescent Self&#8208;reporter, COS or Sulfonamide with Fast Kinetics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal prodrugs with both fast reaction kinetics and multiple outputs are highly desirable but remain very sporadic. Herein, we report a novel photoclick and release strategy for the co&#8208;activation of carbon monoxide and a self&#8208;reporter, carbonyl sulfide, or sulfonamide with fast reaction kinetics (k: 1.4~22.6 M &#8208;1 s &#8208;1 ). Such a photoclick and release strategy was successfully applied in live cells to deliver carbon monoxide and a fluorescent self&#8208;reporter, both of which exhibited pronounced antiproliferative activity against 4T1 cancer cells. It is conceivable that this photoclick and release strategy may find applications in other fields, wherein a controlled bond cleavage is preferred.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chromatin Regulator HMGA1a Undergoes Phase Separation in the Nucleus
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) behaviour of the high mobility group A1a (HMGA1a) is presented. As an important chromatin regulator protein, HMGA1a can interact with DNA molecules and readily forms liquid condensates. This sheds light on its new biophysical role in regulating chromatin.







Abstract
The protein high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) is an important regulator of chromatin organization and function. However, the mechanisms by which it exerts its biological function are not fully understood. Here, we report that the HMGA isoform, HMGA1a, nucleates into foci that display liquid&#8208;like properties in the nucleus, and that the protein readily undergoes phase separation to form liquid condensates in&#8197;vitro. By bringing together machine&#8208;leaning modelling, cellular and biophysical experiments and multiscale simulations, we demonstrate that phase separation of HMGA1a is promoted by protein&#8208;DNA interactions, and has the potential to be modulated by post&#8208;transcriptional effects such as phosphorylation. We further show that the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal tail of HMGA1a significantly contributes to its phase separation through electrostatic interactions via AT hooks 2 and 3. Our work sheds light on HMGA1 phase separation as an emergent biophysical factor in regulating chromatin structure.

         <title>Biosynthetic Pathways of Dimeric Natural Products Containing Bisanthraquinone and Related Xanthones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimeric natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones, with high bioactivities against bacteria and cancer cells, as well as excellent activity in photodynamic therapy, have been isolated over the years. However, the biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated only recently, which are summarized in this concept article to widen our comprehension and application of these important class of compounds in the future.







Abstract
Many dimeric natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones with diverse structures and versatile bioactivities have been isolated over the years. However, the complicated biosynthetic pathways of such natural products, which have remained elusive until recently, negatively impact their mass bioproduction and biosynthetic structural modification for drug discovery. In this concept, we summarize the recent progress in gene cluster mining and biosynthetic pathway elucidation of natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones. These pioneering works may pave the way for further biosynthetic pathway elucidation and structure modification of dimeric natural products through gene and protein engineering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many dimeric natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones with diverse structures and versatile bioactivities have been isolated over the years. However, the complicated biosynthetic pathways of such natural products, which have remained elusive until recently, negatively impact their mass bioproduction and biosynthetic structural modification for drug discovery. In this concept, we summarize the recent progress in gene cluster mining and biosynthetic pathway elucidation of natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones. These pioneering works may pave the way for further biosynthetic pathway elucidation and structure modification of dimeric natural products through gene and protein engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Enzymatic Degradation by Room Temperature Alkali Pre&#8208;treatment for Reduced Polymer Crystallinity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali pre&#8208;treatment at mild temperatures modifies the surface of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) samples and reduces the crystallinity. These two effects improve the access of PETase to hydrolysable chemical bonds increasing the production of terephthalic acid (TPA) and monohydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) by one order of magnitude.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most widely employed plastic for single&#8208;use applications. The use of enzymes isolated from microorganisms, such as PETase with the capacity to hydrolyze PET into its monomers, represents a promising method for its sustainable recycling. However, the accessibility of the enzyme to the hydrolysable bonds is an important challenge that needs to be addressed for effective biodegradation of postconsumer PET. Here, we combined an alkali pre&#8208;treatment (25&#8201;&#176;C) with PETase incubation (30&#8201;&#176;C) with post&#8208;consumed PET bottles. The pre&#8208;treatment modifies the surface of the plastic and decreases its crystallinity enabling the access of the enzyme to the hydrolysable chemical bonds. When the alkali pre&#8208;treatment is incorporated into the enzymatic process the degradation yields increase more than one order of magnitude reaching values comparable to those obtained during heating/cooling cycles. Our results show energetic advantages over other reported pre&#8208;treatments and open new avenues for sustainable PET recycling.

         <title>Comparing the Catalytic and Structural Characteristics of a &#8216;Short&#8217; Unspecific Peroxygenase (UPO) Expressed in Pichia&#8197;pastoris and Escherichia&#8197;coli</title>

         <dc:description>
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are valuable tools for the oxygenation of non&#8208;activated carbon atoms, as they exhibit high turnovers, good stability and depend only on hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant for activity. We have cloned the gene encoding an &#8216;artificial&#8217; peroxygenase (artUPO), close in sequence to the &#8216;short&#8217; UPO from Marasmius rotula (MroUPO), and expressed it in both the yeast Pichia pastoris and E.&#8197;coli to compare the catalytic and structural characteristics of the enzymes produced in each system.







Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have emerged as valuable tools for the oxygenation of non&#8208;activated carbon atoms, as they exhibit high turnovers, good stability and depend only on hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant for activity. However, the isolation of UPOs from their natural fungal sources remains a barrier to wider application. We have cloned the gene encoding an &#8216;artificial&#8217; peroxygenase (artUPO), close in sequence to the &#8216;short&#8217; UPO from Marasmius rotula (MroUPO), and expressed it in both the yeast Pichia pastoris and E.&#8197;coli to compare the catalytic and structural characteristics of the enzymes produced in each system. Catalytic efficiency for the UPO substrate 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodioxole (NBD) was largely the same for both enzymes, and the structures also revealed few differences apart from the expected glycosylation of the yeast enzyme. However, the glycosylated enzyme displayed greater stability, as determined by nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nano&#8208;DSF) measurements. Interestingly, while artUPO hydroxylated ethylbenzene derivatives to give the (R)&#8208;alcohols, also given by a variant of the &#8216;long&#8217; UPO from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO), it gave the opposite (S)&#8208;series of sulfoxide products from a range of sulfide substrates, broadening the scope for application of the enzymes. The structures of artUPO reveal substantial differences to that of AaeUPO, and provide a platform for investigating the distinctive activity of this and related'short&#8217; UPOs.

         <title>Membrane Permeant Analogs for Independent Cellular Introduction of the Terpene Precursors Isopentenyl&#8208; and Dimethylallyl&#8208;Pyrophosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) are the five&#8208;carbon precursors for all terpenes and are cell impermeant due to the negatively charged pyrophosphate. We report that addition of two self&#8208;immolative esters on the &#946;&#8208;phosphates of IPP and DMAPP made them membrane permeant, allowing for the independent investigation of their biochemical properties.







Abstract
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) are the central five&#8208;carbon precursors to all terpenes. Despite their significance, exogenous, independent delivery of IPP and DMAPP to cells is impossible as the negatively charged pyrophosphate makes these molecules membrane impermeant. Herein, we demonstrate a facile method to circumvent this challenge through esterification of the &#946;&#8208;phosphate with two self&#8208;immolative esters (SIEs) that neutralize the negatively charged pyrophosphate to yield membrane&#8208;permeant analogs of IPP and DMAPP. Following cellular incorporation, general esterase activity initiates cleavage of the SIEs, resulting in traceless release of IPP and DMAPP for metabolic utilization. Addition of the synthesized IPP and DMAPP precursor analogs rescued cell growth of glioblastoma (U&#8208;87MG) cancer cells concurrently treated with the HMG&#8208;CoA reductase inhibitor pitavastatin, which otherwise abrogates cell growth via blocking production of IPP and DMAPP. This work demonstrates a new application of a prodrug strategy to incorporate a metabolic intermediate and promises to enable future interrogation of the distinct biological roles of IPP and DMAPP.

The incorporation of N&#8208;alkyl glycine derivatives (peptoids) into the GBAP quorum sensing signal in Enterococcus faecalis revealed important structure&#8208;function insights.







Abstract
As multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria become a more pressing risk to human health, alternate approaches to treating bacterial infections are being increasingly investigated. Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for a large percentage of secondary enterococci infections. Its pathogenicity has been shown to be largely dependent on a cell&#8208;density communication mechanism, termed quorum sensing. In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation of the lactone&#8208;containing macrocyclic signaling peptide used by E.&#8197;faecalis for Fsr&#8208;mediated communication, termed gelatinase biosynthesis activating pheromone (GBAP). Specifically, through a combination of the on&#8208;resin sub&#8208;monomer and solution phase peptoid building block synthesis approaches, we successfully synthesized a library of peptoid&#8208;peptide hybrid analogs of GBAP and determined the biological effects associated with the introduction of the peptoid (N&#8208;alkyl glycine derivative) modifications. Within the macrocycle region of the peptide, as have been seen with other modifications, the F7 site was unusually tolerant toward peptoid modification, compared with other macrocyclic sites. Interestingly, within the exocyclic tail, peptoid modification at the N2 site completely abolished activity, a first for a single tail modification.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides can self&#8208;assemble into various hierarchical nanostructures through noncovalent interactions. These materials hold broad application prospects in bio&#8208;/nanotechnology, including tissue engineering, anticancer treatment, biomimetic catalysis, energy harvesting. We introduce the self&#8208;assembly mechanism, self&#8208;assembly morphology and applications of self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials, which will inspire the rational design and development of novel self&#8208;assembling biomaterials.

Peptides can self&#8208;assemble into various hierarchical nanostructures through noncovalent interactions and form functional materials exhibiting excellent chemical and physical properties, which have broad applications in bio&#8208;/nanotechnology. The self&#8208;assembly mechanism, self&#8208;assembly morphology of peptide supramolecular architecture and their various applications, have been widely explored which have the merit of biocompatibility, easy preparation, and controllable functionality. Herein, we introduce the latest research progress of self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials and review their applications in biomedicine and optoelectronics, including tissue engineering, anticancer therapy, biomimetic catalysis, energy harvesting. We believe that this review will inspire the rational design and development of novel peptide&#8208;based functional bio&#8208;inspired materials in the future.

         <title>A Chimeric Peptide Inhibits Red Blood Cell Invasion by Plasmodium falciparum with Hundredfold Increased Efficacy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inhibition of tight junction formation between two malaria parasite proteins, apical membrane antigen 1 and rhoptry neck protein 2, crucial for red blood cell invasion, prevents the disease progression. In this work, we have utilized a unique approach to design a chimeric peptide, prepared by fusion of the best features of two peptide inhibitors, that has displayed parasite growth inhibition,  ex vivo  , with nanomolar IC50, which is hundredfold better than any of its parent peptides. Further, to gain structural insights, we computationally modeled the hybrid peptide on its receptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Function of CtXyn5A from Acetivibrio thermocellus: Dual Arabinoxylanase and Feruloyl Esterase Activity in the Same Active Site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncharacterized side activities of enzymes can have significant effects on reaction products and yields. Hence, their identification and characterization are crucial for the development of successful reaction systems. Here, we report the presence of feruloyl esterase activity in CtXyn5A from Acetivibrio thermocellus, besides its well&#8208;known arabinoxylanase activity, for the first time. Activity analysis of enzyme variants mutated in the catalytic nucleophile, Glu279, confirmed removal of all activity for E279A and E279L, and increased esterase activity while removing xylanase activity for E279S, allowing the proposal that both reaction types are catalysed in the same active site in two subsequential steps. The ferulic acid substituent is cleaved off first, followed by hydrolysis of the xylan backbone. The esterase activity on complex carbohydrates was found to be higher than the one of a designated ferulic acid esterase (E&#8208;FAERU). Therefore, we conclude that the enzyme exhibits a dual function rather than an esterase side activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemical and structural insights into FIH&#8208;catalysed hydroxylation of transient receptor potential ankyrin repeat domains</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels have important roles in environmental sensing in animals. Human TRP subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) is responsible for sensing allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and other electrophilic sensory irritants. TRP subfamily vanilloid member 3 (TRPV3) is involved in skin maintenance. TRPV3 is a reported substrate of the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate oxygenase factor inhibiting hypoxia inducible factor (FIH). We report biochemical and structural studies concerning asparaginyl hydroxylation of the ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs) of TRPA1 and TRPV3 catalysed by FIH. The results with ARD peptides support a previous report on FIH&#8208;catalysed TRPV3 hydroxylation and show that, of the 12 potential TRPA1 sequences investigated, one sequence (TRPA1 residues 322&#8208;348) undergoes hydroxylation at Asn&#8208;336. Structural studies reveal that the TRPA1 and TRPV3 ARDs bind to FIH with a similar overall geometry to most other reported FIH substrates. However, the binding mode of TRPV3 to FIH is distinct from that of other substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of immunogenic cell death (ICD) by small molecules (e.g., chemotherapeutic drugs) intrigued medicinal chemists to exploit anticancer agents with such a trait because ICD agents provoke anti&#8208;cancer immune responses in addition to their cytotoxicity. However, the unclear molecular mechanism of ICD hampers further achievements in drug development. Fortunately, increasing efforts have been paid in this area in recent years using either chemical or biological approaches. Here, we review the current achievements toward understanding the mechanisms of the small molecule&#8208;induced ICD effects. Based on the established role of unfolded protein response (UPR) in ICD, we classify the mechanisms of different inducers by their dependency on UPR. Key proteins and pathways with important implications are majorly discussed. We also give our perspectives on the research strategies for future investigations of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>An Engineered &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Peptide Forming Thermostable Complexes with Zn(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II) through a His3 Site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The three&#8208;dimensional structure of a peptide, which determines its function, can denature at elevated temperatures, in the presence of chaotropic reagents, or in organic solvents. These factors limit the applicability of peptides. Here we present an engineered &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide containing a His3 site that forms complexes with Zn(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II). Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that the peptide&#8208;metal complexes exhibit melting temperatures up to 80 &#176;C and remain folded in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride as well as in organic solvents. Intrinsic fluorescence titration experiments were used to determine dissociation constants of metal binding in the nano&#8208; to sub&#8208;nanomolar range. The coordination geometry of the peptide&#8208;Cu(II) complex was studied by EPR spectroscopy and reveals a distorted square planar coordination geometry with weak interactions to axial ligands. Due to their impressive stability, the presented peptide&#8208;metal complexes open up interesting fields of application, such as the development of a new class of peptide&#8208;metal catalysts for stereoselective organic synthesis or the directed design of extremophilic &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Reverse Transcriptases: From Discovery and Applications to Xenobiology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reverse transcriptases, enzymes that originally use RNA to write DNA, are featured in the review. They play important roles in modern research as well as diagnostics. Recent fields of activities include their tailoring, detection of RNA modifications or the reverse transcription of xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs).







Abstract
Reverse transcriptases are DNA polymerases that can use RNA as a template for DNA synthesis. They thus catalyze the reverse of transcription. Although discovered in 1970, reverse transcriptases are still of great interest and are constantly being further developed for numerous modern research approaches. They are frequently used in biotechnological and molecular diagnostic applications. In this review, we describe the discovery of these fascinating enzymes and summarize research results and applications ranging from molecular cloning, direct virus detection, and modern sequencing methods to xenobiology.

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Aptamer&#8208;Ligand Binding in RNA Light&#8208;Up Aptamers Containing G&#8208;Quadruplex Using Chemical Stimuli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling aptamer&#8208;ligand binding is important for designing nucleic acid&#8208;based circuits and regulators. Using simple chemical stimuli, we show that the interactions of RNA aptamers to their corresponding ligands can be reversibly controlled by targeting a specific secondary structure, a G&#8208;quadruplex, present within the aptamer. This is also the first report showing disruption of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes by addition of silver ions.







Abstract
Regulating a system in equilibrium transiently to out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium by using certain stimuli is the strategy used by natural biomolecules to function. Herein, we showed that the interaction of synthetic RNA aptamers, having a G&#8208;quadruplex core structure, with their corresponding ligands could be regulated from their equilibrium state to non&#8208;equilibrium state in a reversible manner using simple chemical stimuli (Ag+ and cysteine). The approach would be useful for designing aptamer regulators that work in a dynamic nucleic acid network, where a strict control on aptamer&#8208;ligand interaction is needed. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which shows that RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes can be disrupted by the addition of silver ions. This would be useful not only in designing RNA&#8208;based sensors or regulators but would also be useful for understanding the role of metal ions in RNA folding and catalysis.

         <title>Stafiba: A STAT5&#8208;Selective Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual inhibition of the transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b is a valuable approach with promising applications in tumor biology. We describe the development of resorcinol bisphosphate to Stafiba, a phosphatase&#8208;stable inhibitor of STAT5a and STAT5b with activity in the low micromolar concentration range.







Abstract
The transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b are constitutively active in many human tumors. Combined inhibition of both STAT5 proteins is a valuable approach with promising applications in tumor biology. We recently reported resorcinol bisphosphate as a moderately active inhibitor of the protein&#8208;protein interaction domains, the SH2 domains, of both STAT5a and STAT5b. Here, we describe the development of resorcinol bisphosphate to Stafiba, a phosphatase&#8208;stable inhibitor of STAT5a and STAT5b with activity in the low micromolar concentration range. Our data provide insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships of resorcinol bisphosphates and the corresponding bisphosphonates for use as inhibitors of both STAT5a and STAT5b.

         <title>Two&#8208;Helix Supramolecular Proteomimetic Binders Assembled via PNA&#8208;Assisted Disulfide Crosslinking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular proteomimetic peptide&#8208;PNA hybrid displaying a 2&#8208;helix binding motif was validated as a tight, low&#8208;nM, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD (receptor binding domain) binder. Mimicking of the coiled helices interface was leveraged on achieving conformational stability via hybridization of the short peptide&#8208;nucleic acid sequence and subsequent templated crosslinking. Applying supramolecular pairing together with a stabilizing disulfide bridge removed the need for optimizing the primary sequence and constitutes a novel proteomimetic strategy.







Abstract
Peptidic motifs folded in a defined conformation are able to inhibit protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) covering large interfaces and as such they are biomedical molecules of interest. Mimicry of such natural structures with synthetically tractable constructs often requires complex scaffolding and extensive optimization to preserve the fidelity of binding to the target. Here, we present a novel proteomimetic strategy based on a 2&#8208;helix binding motif that is brought together by hybridization of peptide nucleic acids (PNA) and stabilized by a rationally positioned intermolecular disulfide crosslink. Using a solid phase synthesis approach (SPPS), the building blocks are easily accessible and such supramolecular peptide&#8208;PNA helical hybrids could be further coiled using precise templated chemistry. The elaboration of the structural design afforded high affinity SARS CoV&#8208;2 RBD (receptor binding domain) binders without interference with the underlying peptide sequence, creating a basis for a new architecture of supramolecular proteomimetics.

         <title>Proline C&#8722;H Bonds as Loci for Proline Assembly via C&#8722;H/O Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H bonds of proline are particularly favorable sites for C&#8722;H/O interactions, including intermolecular assembly and intramolecular structure stabilization. These C&#8722;H/O interactions, which occur at all proline ring positions, exhibit short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O distances, and are significantly stabilized by stereoelectronic effects, with only a minor electrostatic contribution in solution.







Abstract
Proline residues within proteins lack a traditional hydrogen bond donor. However, the hydrogens of the proline ring are all sterically accessible, with polarized C&#8722;H bonds at H&#945; and H&#948; that exhibit greater partial positive character and can be utilized as alternative sites for molecular recognition. C&#8722;H/O interactions, between proline C&#8722;H bonds and oxygen lone pairs, have been previously identified as modes of recognition within protein structures and for higher&#8208;order assembly of protein structures. In order to better understand intermolecular recognition of proline residues, a series of proline derivatives was synthesized, including 4R&#8208;hydroxyproline nitrobenzoate methyl ester, acylated on the proline nitrogen with bromoacetyl and glycolyl groups, and Boc&#8208;4S&#8208;(4&#8208;iodophenyl)hydroxyproline methyl amide. All three derivatives exhibited multiple close intermolecular C&#8722;H/O interactions in the crystallographic state, with H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O distances as close as 2.3&#8197;&#197;. These observed distances are well below the 2.72&#8197;&#197; sum of the van der Waals radii of H and O, and suggest that these interactions are particularly favorable. In order to generalize these results, we further analyzed the role of C&#8722;H/O interactions in all previously crystallized derivatives of these amino acids, and found that all 26 structures exhibited close intermolecular C&#8722;H/O interactions. Finally, we analyzed all proline residues in the Cambridge Structural Database of small&#8208;molecule crystal structures. We found that the majority of these structures exhibited intermolecular C&#8722;H/O interactions at proline C&#8722;H bonds, suggesting that C&#8722;H/O interactions are an inherent and important mode for recognition of and higher&#8208;order assembly at proline residues. Due to steric accessibility and multiple polarized C&#8722;H bonds, proline residues are uniquely positioned as sites for binding and recognition via C&#8722;H/O interactions.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Sterically Hindered Biaryls by Suzuki Coupling and Vanadium Chloroperoxidase Catalyzed Halogenations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase (CiVCPO)&#8208;catalyzed tribromination of biaryls to transform freely rotating biaryl bonds to a sterically hindered axis is described. The strategy was used to produce 14 examples in analytical and preparative scales. The combination of Suzuki coupling and chemoenzymatic halogenations has enabled the chemoenzymatic one&#8208;pot synthesis of the tribrominated products in aqueous phase.







Abstract
Halogenated biaryls are vital structural skeletons in bioactive products. In this study, an effective chemoenzymatic halogenation by vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from Camponotus inaequalis (CiVCPO) enabled the transformation of freely rotating biaryl bonds to sterically hindered axis. The yields were up to 84&#8201;% for the tribrominated biaryl products and up to 65&#8201;% when isolated. Furthermore, a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step chemoenzymatic strategy by incorporating transition metal catalyzed Suzuki coupling and the chemoenzymatic halogenation in aqueous phase were described. This strategy demonstrates a simplified one&#8208;pot reaction sequence with organometallic and biocatalytic procedures under economical and environmentally beneficial conditions that may inspire further research on synthesis of sterically hindered biaryls.

         <title>Impact of Peptide Sequences on Their Structure and Function: Mimicking of Virus&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Nucleic Acid Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Impact of peptide sequence on structure and function: The synthetic building block guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole (GCP) is pivotal to establishing definite secondary structures out of short peptide sequences. Its rational positioning enables the assembly of different supramolecular nanostructures, like fibres, nanorods or spheres. Complexed with nucleic acids, formed virus&#8208;like particles mediate gene delivery.







Abstract
We rationally designed a series of amphiphilic hepta&#8208;peptides enriched with a chemically conjugated guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole (GCP) unit at the lysine side chain. All peptides are composed of polar (GCP) and non&#8208;polar (cyclohexyl alanine) residues but differ in their sequence periodicity, resulting in different secondary as well as supramolecular structures. CD spectra revealed the assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;, &#945;&#8208;helical and random structures for peptides 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Consequently, this enabled the formation of distinct supramolecular assemblies such as fibres, nanorod&#8208;like or spherical aggregates. Notably, all three cationic peptides are equipped with the anion&#8208;binding GCP unit and thus possess a nucleic acid&#8208;binding centre. However, only the helical (2) and the unstructured (3) peptide were able to assemble into small virus&#8208;like DNA&#8208;polyplexes and effectively deliver DNA into cells. Notably, as both peptides (2 and 3) were also capable of siRNA&#8208;delivery, they could be utilized to downregulate expression of the caner&#8208;relevant protein Survivin.

         <title>Applications of Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Enzyme in Biotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a unique polymerase enzyme that does not require a DNA template in order to amplify DNA. The enzyme allows for the stepwise addition of single nucleotides onto the 3&#8217; end of any oligonucleotide sequence. This has made TdT a very exciting molecular tool in biotechnology applications. In this review we explore these applications.







Abstract
The use of polymerase enzymes in biotechnology has allowed us to gain unprecedented control over the manipulation of DNA, opening up new and exciting applications in areas such as biosensing, polynucleotide synthesis, and DNA storage, aptamer development and DNA&#8208;nanotechnology. One of the most intriguing enzymes which has gained prominence in the last decade is terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is one of the only polymerase enzymes capable of catalysing the template independent stepwise addition of nucleotides onto an oligonucleotide chain. This unique enzyme has seen a significant increase in a variety of different applications. In this review, we give a comprehensive discussion of the unique properties and applications of TdT as a biotechnology tool, and the application in the enzymatic synthesis of poly/oligonucleotides. Finally, we look at the increasing role of TdT enzyme in biosensing, DNA storage, synthesis of DNA nanostructures and aptamer development, and give a future outlook for this technology.

         <title>Pineapple Lectin AcmJRL binds SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein in a carbohydrate&#8208;dependent fashion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The highly glycosylated spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is essential for infection and constitutes a prime target for antiviral agents. The pineapple&#8208;derived jacalin&#8208;related lectin (AcmJRL) is present in the medication bromelain in significant quantities and has previously been described to bind mannosides. Here, we performed a large ligand screening of AcmJRL by glycan array analysis, quantified the interaction with carbohydrates and validated high&#8208;mannose glycans as preferred ligands. Because the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein was previously reported to carry a high proportion of high&#8208;mannose  N  &#8208;glycans, we tested the binding of AcmJRL to recombinantly produced spike protein. We could demonstrate that AcmJRL binds the spike protein with a low micromolar K  D  in a carbohydrate&#8208;dependent fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comprehensive Characterization of &#8220;Off/On&#8221; Rhodol&#8208;based Lysosomal Tracker for Orthogonal Cellular Analysis by Confocal Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Two florescent xanthene&#8208;cyanamide lysosomal trackers emitting strongly at ~525 nm were prepared using microwave assisted reactions from fluorescein and rhodol methyl esters. A comprehensive characterization of both forms &#8220;off&#8221; (non&#8208;fluorescent lactam) and &#8220;on&#8221; (strongly fluorescent ring&#8208;opened amide) have been carried out using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, X Ray analysis, fluorimetry and confocal microscopyl. Known rhodamines bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) exhibit this equilibrium depending on the dielectric constant of the medium. Here, cyanamide was introduced as EWG amine into the fluorescein and rhodol framework. Unlike rhodamine&#8208;type dyes, the ring&#8208;opened form of fluorescein&#8208; and rhodol&#8208;cyanamides are stable in protic solvents under circumneutral and basic pH conditions. The osteoblastic cell line MC3T3&#8208;E1 from C57BL/6 mouse calvaria was used for confocal imaging where the different organelles and nuclei were distinguished using an orthogonal combination of fluorescent dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Late&#8208;Stage Halogenation of Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage halogenation of peptides has become feasible using a highly flexible halogenase that catalyses bromination of a wide range of amides and peptides. Upon optimization studies, even longer peptides carrying a terminal tryptophan residue were reasonably accepted leading to high conversions and remarkable selectivity. This novel bioorthogonal approach was exemplified by halogenating an RGD peptide derivative in the final step.







Abstract
The late&#8208;stage site&#8208;selective derivatisation of peptides has many potential applications in structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and postsynthetic modification or conjugation of bioactive compounds. The development of orthogonal methods for C&#8722;H functionalisation is crucial for such peptide derivatisation. Among them, biocatalytic methods are increasingly attracting attention. Tryptophan halogenases emerged as valuable catalysts to functionalise tryptophan (Trp), while direct enzyme&#8208;catalysed halogenation of synthetic peptides is yet unprecedented. Here, it is reported that the Trp 6&#8208;halogenase Thal accepts a wide range of amides and peptides containing a Trp moiety. Increasing the sequence length and reaction optimisation made bromination of pentapeptides feasible with good turnovers and a broad sequence scope, while regioselectivity turned out to be sequence dependent. Comparison of X&#8208;ray single crystal structures of Thal in complex with d&#8208;Trp and a dipeptide revealed a significantly altered binding mode for the peptide. The viability of this bioorthogonal approach was exemplified by halogenation of a cyclic RGD peptide.

The selection of an appropriate protein scaffold plays a key role in the design process. This review aims at giving a general overview of the most common protein scaffolds exploitable to generate artificial enzymes. Several examples are discussed and categorized accordingly to the strategy used for the design of the artificial biocatalyst, namely the functionalization of natural enzymes, the creation of a new catalytic site in a protein scaffold bearing a wide hydrophobic pocket and the de novo protein design. The review is concluded by a comparison of these different methods and by our perspective on the topic.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparison of Different Competitive Proteome Profiling Approaches in Target Identification of Covalent Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two competitive proteome profiling approaches were employed and compared in the identification of cellular targets of a covalent drug, afatinib, leading to the discovery of MYH9 as an off&#8208;target partner. Functional validation experiments have been carried out to validate this off&#8208;target.







Abstract
Competitive proteome profiling is a powerful approach for the identification of targets of small molecules. This approach usually employs an inhibitor&#8208;derived probe or a cysteine&#8208;reactive probe such as an IA&#8208;alkyne in a comparison between inhibitor&#8208;treated and untreated samples, thus enabling distinction between genuine targets and nonspecific labeling. We have developed an active probe derived from an EGFR inhibitor, afatinib, and a cysteine reactive probe, an alkyne&#8208;containing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amide, to compare their characterization of cellular targets. In both approaches, myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) was identified as an off&#8208;target. Subsequent functional validation experiments suggested that MYH9 might be involved in the function of afatinib.

         <title>Characterization of the Gateway Decarboxylase for Psilocybin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the magic begins: The l&#8208;tryptophan decarboxylase PsiD initiates the biosynthesis of the psychotropic natural product psilocybin in Psilocybe mushrooms. Its in&#8197;vitro biochemical characterization and in silico modeling of its structure identified a non&#8208;canonical serine protease triad for autocatalytic cleavage of the proenzyme. PsiD's substrate flexibility makes it a versatile catalyst for biotechnological applications.







Abstract
The l&#8208;tryptophan decarboxylase PsiD catalyzes the initial step of the metabolic cascade to psilocybin, the major indoleethylamine natural product of the &#8220;magic&#8221; mushrooms and a candidate drug against major depressive disorder. Unlike numerous pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent decarboxylases for natural product biosyntheses, PsiD is PLP&#8208;independent and resembles type&#8197;II phosphatidylserine decarboxylases. Here, we report on the in&#8197;vitro biochemical characterization of Psilocybe cubensis PsiD along with in silico modeling of the PsiD structure. A non&#8208;canonical serine protease triad for autocatalytic cleavage of the pro&#8208;protein was predicted and experimentally verified by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

         <title>Optimization of RiPCA for the Live&#8208;Cell Detection of Pre&#8208;MicroRNA&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interest in studying reported, but under&#8208;characterized RNA&#8208;protein interactions (RPI) warrants the development of tools to detect and validate these interactions. RiPCA is a cell&#8208;based assay capable of detecting pre&#8208;miRNA&#8208;protein interactions in a sequence&#8208;specific manner. This study reports the optimization of RiPCA and its application in detecting interactions between the RBPs hnRNP A1, Msi1, and Msi2 and select pre&#8208;miRNA binding partners.







Abstract
Advancements in methods for identifying RNA&#8208;protein interactions (RPIs) on a large scale has necessitated the development of assays for validation of these interactions, particularly in living cells. We previously reported the development of RiPCA (RNA interaction with protein&#8208;mediated complementation assay) to enable the cellular detection of the well&#8208;characterized interaction between the pre&#8208;microRNA, pre&#8208;let&#8208;7, and its RNA&#8208;binding protein (RBP) partner Lin28. In this study, the applicability of RiPCA for the detection of putative pre&#8208;miRNA&#8208;protein interactions was explored using an improved RiPCA protocol, termed RiPCA&#8197;2.0. RiPCA&#8197;2.0 was adapted to detect the sequence specificity of the RBPs hnRNP&#8197;A1, Msi1, and Msi2 for reported pre&#8208;microRNA binding partners. Additionally, the ability of RiPCA&#8197;2.0 to detect site&#8208;specific binding was explored. Collectively, this work highlights the versatility of RiPCA&#8197;2.0 in detecting cellular RPIs.

         <title>Inverse In Vitro Selection Enables Comprehensive Analysis of Cross&#8208;Chiral L&#8208;Aptamer Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;aptamers, those made of L&#8208;(deoxy)ribose nucleic acids, are a promising class of RNA affinity reagent, but their selectivity remains poorly characterized. Herein, we developed an &#8220;inverse&#8221; in&#8197;vitro selection method that enables comprehensive analysis of L&#8208;aptamer selectivity and revealed promiscuous RNA&#8208;binding behaviors for a model L&#8208;aptamer.







Abstract
Aptamers composed of mirror&#8208;image L&#8208;(deoxy)ribose nucleic acids, referred to as L&#8208;aptamers, are a promising class of RNA&#8208;binding reagents. Yet, the selectivity of cross&#8208;chiral interactions between L&#8208;aptamers and their RNA targets remain poorly characterized, limiting the potential utility of this approach for applications in biological systems. Herein, we carried out the first comprehensive analysis of cross&#8208;chiral L&#8208;aptamer selectivity using a newly developed &#8220;inverse&#8221; in&#8197;vitro selection approach that exploits the genetic nature of the D&#8208;RNA ligand. By employing a library of more than a million target&#8208;derived sequences, we determined the RNA sequence and structural preference of a model L&#8208;aptamer and revealed previously unidentified and potentially broad off&#8208;target RNA binding behaviors. These results provide valuable information for assessing the likelihood and consequences of potential off&#8208;target interactions and reveal strategies to mitigate these effects. Thus, inverse in&#8197;vitro selection provides several opportunities to advance L&#8208;aptamer technology.

         <title>Chemoselective Labeling and Immobilization of Phosphopeptides with Phosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective enrichment of phosphopeptides is crucial for investigating protein phosphorylation. Here, we describe the selective, mild capture and release of phosphopeptides (CLIPP). The cover, designed by Barth van&#8197;Rossum, compares the mild conditions of CLIPP to a day in the spa. Phosphopeptides are selectively modified in a &#8220;pool&#8221; of phosphorimidazolide reagent, irradiated with UV light in a &#8220;tanning bed&#8221; to produce pyrophosphopeptides, and finally hydrolyzed to the original phosphopeptide in a lanthanide ion &#8220;sauna&#8221;. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Fiedler et&#8197;al.

         <title>Volatiles of the apicomplexan alga Chromera velia and associated bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Volatiles released by the apicomplexan alga  Chromera velia  CCAP1602/1 and their associated bacteria were investigated. A metagenome analysis allowed the identification of the most abundant heterotrophic bacteria of the phycosphere, but the isolation of additional strains showed that metagenomics underestimated the complexity of the algal microbiome, However, the culture&#8208;independent approach revealed the presence of a planctomycete that likely represents a novel bacterial family. Wwe analysed algal and bascterial volatiles by open&#8208;system&#8208;stripping analysis (OSSA) on Tenax TA desorption tubes, followed by thermodesorption, cryofocusing and GC/MS&#8208;analysis. The analyses of the alga and the abundant bacterial strains  Sphingopyxis litoris  A01A&#8208;101,  Algihabitans albus  A01A&#8208;324, &#8220;  Coraliitalea coralii  &#8221; A01A&#8208;333 and  Litoreibacter  sp. A01A&#8208;347 revealed sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic compounds, amides, one lactone, as well as typical algal products, apocarotenoids. The compounds were identified by gas chromatographic retention indices, comparison of mass spectra and syntheses of reference compounds. A major algal metabolite was 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylcyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one, an apocarotenoid indicating the presence of carotenoids related to capsanthin, not reported from algae so far. A low overlap in volatiles bouquets between  C. velia  and the bacteria was found and the xenic algal culture almost exclusively released algal components.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Volatiles released by the apicomplexan alga  Chromera velia  CCAP1602/1 and their associated bacteria were investigated. A metagenome analysis allowed the identification of the most abundant heterotrophic bacteria of the phycosphere, but the isolation of additional strains showed that metagenomics underestimated the complexity of the algal microbiome, However, the culture-independent approach revealed the presence of a planctomycete that likely represents a novel bacterial family. Wwe analysed algal and bascterial volatiles by open-system-stripping analysis (OSSA) on Tenax TA desorption tubes, followed by thermodesorption, cryofocusing and GC/MS-analysis.

         <title>Development of a transcriptional activator&#8208;like effector protein to accurately discriminate single nucleotide difference</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcriptional activator&#8208;like effector (TALE), a DNA&#8208;binding protein, is widely used in genome editing. However, the recognition of the target sequence by the TALE is adversely affected by the number of mismatches. Therefore, the association constant of DNA&#8211;TALE complex formation can be controlled by appropriately introducing a mismatch into the TALE recognition sequence. This study aimed to construct a TALE that can distinguish a single nucleotide difference. Our results showed that a single mismatch present in repeats 2 or 3 of TALE did not interfere with the complex formation with DNA, whereas continuous mismatches present in repeats 2 and 3 significantly reduced association with the target DNA. Based on the findings, we constructed a detection system of the one nucleotide difference in gene with high accuracy and constructed a TALE&#8208;nuclease (TALEN) that selectively cleaves DNA with a single mismatch.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterially Secretable Single&#8208;Chain Tandem Macrocyclic Peptides for High Affinity and Inhibitory Activity.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) is an effective approach for therapy. Owing to their large binding surface areas to target proteins, macrocyclic peptides are suitable molecules for PPI inhibition. In this study, we developed single&#8208;chain tandem macrocyclic peptides (STaMPtides) that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2). They were artificially designed to comprise two different VEGFR2&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides linked in tandem by peptide linkers and secreted by Corynebacterium glutamicum. Most potent VEGFR2&#8208;inhibitory STaMPtides with length&#8208;optimized linkers exhibited &gt;1000 times stronger inhibitory activity than their parental monomeric peptides, possibly due to the avidity effect of heterodimerization. Our approach of using STaMPtides for PPI inhibition may be used to inhibit other extracellular factors, such as growth factors and cytokines.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Modification of the 5&#8242; Cap with Photocleavable ONB&#8208;Derivatives Using GlaTgs V34A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 5&#8242; cap of mRNA plays a critical role in mRNA processing, quality control and turnover. Enzymatic availability of the 5&#8242; cap governs translation and could be a tool to investigate cell fate decisions and protein functions, or develop protein replacement therapies. We have previously reported on the chemical synthesis of 5&#8242; cap analogs with photocleavable groups for this purpose. However, the synthesis is complex and post&#8208;synthetic enzymatic installation may make the technique more applicable to biological researchers. Common 5&#8242; cap analogs, like the cap 0, are commercially available and routinely used for in vitro transcription. Here, we report a facile enzymatic approach to attach photocleavable groups site&#8208;specifically to the N2 position of m7G of the 5&#8242; cap. By expanding the substrate scope of the methyltransferase variant GlaTgs V34A and using synthetic cosubstrate analogs, we could enzymatically photocage the 5&#8242; cap and recover it after irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides as Protein Helical Domain Mimetics to Manipulate the Angiogenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and application of homogenous sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides for modulating different protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is briefly introduced in this concept article. Most importantly, we describe in detail how sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides mimic the critical binding domain on VEGRA (helix&#8208;&#945;1) to modulate VEGF/VEGFR PPI. We have identified two active mimetics V2 and V3 that potently activate and inhibit angiogenesis and are highly resistant to proteolytic degradation. This demonstrates the versatility of sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides to mimic the protein helical domain to manipulate various PPIs.







Abstract
Sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides recently developed in our group have been proven to be a new class of unnatural foldamer with well&#8208;defined helical structure and have been demonstrated to mimic protein helical domains and disrupt biomedically relevant protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Based on our design concept in a recent report, we discovered two similar sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides V2 and V3 which were designed to mimic the VEGF N&#8208;terminal helix &#945;1 known to directly interact with VEGFRs. Interestingly, V2 was shown to possess the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect, whereas V3 was proved to be a potent inhibitor for angiogenesis. We speculate that the distinct angiogenesis signaling was due to the selective binding of the two molecules to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, respectively. Together with their remarkable resistance to proteolytic degradation, relatively small sizes, and amenability to modification with diverse functional groups, V2 and V3 could serve as lead molecules for the development of potential therapeutic agents and molecular probes. These findings highlight sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides as an alternative paradigm to mimic the &#945;&#8208;helical domain to modulate a wide variety of PPIs in the future.

Abstract
The design of novel aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), has generally been facilitated by disrupting the possibility of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The recent literature describes a novel strategy to design AIEgens by introducing anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions to prevent the detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. This new strategy provides access to intrinsically charged AIEgens whose photophysical properties can be tuned either by incorporating different substituents on the &#960;&#8208;molecular scaffold to modulate the acidity for tuning the interaction energy between a &#960;&#8208;acceptor and counter&#8208;anions. This concept article provides a brief overview of the field, focusing on the synthesis of AIEgens, their photophysical properties, crystallography studies and their applications in live cell fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Covalent Modification of Bromodomain Proteins by Peptides Containing a DNA Damage&#8208;Induced, Histone Post&#8208;Translational Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
KMP&#8208;modified histones are a nonenzymatic, post&#8208;translational modification produced from the DNA lesion C4&#8208;AP. Chemically synthesized KMP&#8208;containing histone peptides selectively modify cysteine&#8208;containing bromodomain proteins, the readers of N&#8208;acetyllysine. Covalent modification of nuclear proteins, such as bromodomains, by KMP could affect their function in cells.







Abstract
An electrophilic 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolone modification (KMP) is produced at lysine residues of histone proteins in nucleosome core particles upon reaction with a commonly formed DNA lesion (C4&#8208;AP). The nonenzymatic KMP modification is also generated in the histones of HeLa cells treated with the antitumor agent, bleomycin that oxidizes DNA and forms C4&#8208;AP. This nonenzymatic covalent histone modification has the same charge as the N&#8208;acetyllysine (KAc) modification but is more electrophilic. In this study we show that KMP&#8208;containing histone peptides are recognized by, and covalently modify bromodomain proteins that are KAc readers. Distinct selectivity preferences for covalent bromodomain modification are observed following incubation with KMP&#8208;containing peptides of different sequence. MS/MS analysis of 3&#8197;covalently modified bromodomain proteins confirmed that Cys adduction was selective. The modified Cys was not always proximal to the KAc binding site, indicating that KMP&#8208;containing peptide interaction with bromodomain protein is distinct from the former. Analysis of protein adduction yields as a function of bromodomain pH at which the protein charge is zero (pI) or cysteine solvent accessible surface area are also consistent with non&#8208;promiscuous interaction between the proteins and electrophilic peptides. These data suggest that intracellular formation of KMP could affect cellular function and viability by modifying proteins that regulate genetic expression.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Micro&#8208;Sized Hexagons Built from Short DNA in a Crowded Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hexagonal liquid crystals were built by assembling only one pair of short double&#8208;stranded DNA in buffer&#8208;salt solutions containing poly (ethylene glycol). Complementary overhangs were required to construct the hexagonal DNA assemblies. Circular dichroism spectral measurements and polarization microscopy observations indicated a parallel alignment of double&#8208;stranded DNA in the hexagonal platelet.







Abstract
DNA programmable structures of various morphologies have attracted extensive attention due to their potential for materials science and biomedical applications. Here, we report the formation of micro&#8208;sized hexagons via assembly of only one pair of short double&#8208;stranded DNA in buffer&#8208;salt poly(ethylene glycol) solution. Each DNA strand had complementary bases with a two&#8208;base overhang. The procedure of heating and subsequent cooling of blunt&#8208;ended double&#8208;stranded DNA resulted in different assemblies. These results indicated that end&#8208;to&#8208;end adhesion at the terminals induced by complementary overhangs were required to construct the hexagonal DNA assemblies. The stable formation of the hexagons was highly dependent on heating temperature. In addition, concentration adjustments of DNA and poly(ethylene glycol) were essential. Circular dichroism spectral measurements and polarization microscopy observations indicated parallel alignment of double&#8208;stranded DNA in the hexagonal platelet. Self&#8208;assembled micro&#8208;sized hexagons composed of simple building blocks may have great potential for future biomedical device development.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Plate Superstructures of the Immunogenic 33&#8208;mer Gliadin Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immunogenic 33&#8208;mer gliadin peptide builds up thin&#8208;plate superstructures that could be responsible for an innate immune response in the context of gluten&#8208;related disorders. A multi&#8208;technique evaluation provides insight into the self&#8208;assembly process showing that the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence is a sensor for monitoring the formation of the thin&#8208;plate structures.







Abstract
Gluten related&#8208;disorders have a prevalence of 1&#8211;5&#8201;% worldwide triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins in wheat, rye, barley, and some oats. In wheat gluten, the most studied protein is gliadin, whose immunodominant 33&#8208;mer amino acid fragment remains after digestive proteolysis and accumulates in the gut mucosa. Here, we report the formation of 33&#8208;mer thin&#8208;plate superstructures using intrinsic tyrosine (Tyr) steady&#8208;state fluorescence anisotropy and cryo&#8208;TEM in combination with water tension measurements. Furthermore, we showed that fluorescence decay measurements of 33&#8208;mer intrinsic fluorophore Tyr provided information on the early stages of the formation of the thin&#8208;plate structures. Finally, conformational analysis of Tyr residues using minimalist models by molecular dynamic simulations (MD) demonstrated that changes in Tyr rotamer states depend on the oligomerization stage. Our findings further advance the understanding of the formation of the 33&#8208;mer gliadin peptide superstructures and their relation to health and disease.

         <title>Identification of Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase Inhibitors Using the Cell Painting Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A morphological fingerprint has been identified for the suppression of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis which is shared by inhibitors of enzymes that are involved in pyrimidine synthesis such as DHODH and inhibitors of complex&#8197;III. This bioactivity cluster can be employed to identify further modulators of these targets.







Abstract
Profiling approaches have been increasingly employed for the characterization of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes or compound perturbation as they provide a broad, unbiased view on impaired cellular states. We report that morphological profiling using the cell painting assay (CPA) can detect modulators of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in particular. The CPA can differentiate between impairment of pyrimidine and folate metabolism, which both affect cellular nucleotide pools. The identified morphological signature is shared by inhibitors of DHODH and the functionally tightly coupled complex&#8197;III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as by UMP synthase, which is downstream of DHODH. The CPA appears to be particularly suited for the detection of DHODH inhibitors at the site of their action in cells. As DHODH is a validated therapeutic target, the CPA will enable unbiased identification of DHODH inhibitors and inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis for biological research and drug discovery.

         <title>Intracellular Protein Photoactivation Using Sterically Bulky Caging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for intracellular protein photoactivation is reported. The protein of interest was biotinylated through a photodegradable linker and then conjugated with streptavidin for steric hinderance, via biotin&#8208;streptavidin binding. This caged protein was transduced into living cells and activated inside the cells by light&#8208;induced degradation of the conjugates.







Abstract
Methods for intracellular protein photoactivation have been studied to elucidate the spatial and temporal roles of proteins of interest. In this study, an intracellular protein photoactivation method was developed using sterically bulky caging. The protein of interest was modified with biotin via a photocleavable linker, and then conjugated with streptavidin to sterically block the protein surface for inactivation. The caged protein was transduced into cells and reactivated by light&#8208;induced degradation of the conjugates. A cytotoxic protein, saporin, was caged and photoactivated both in&#8197;vitro and in living cells with this method. This method achieved control of the cytotoxic activity in an off&#8208;on manner, introducing cell death selectively at the designed location using light. This simple and versatile photoactivation method is a promising tool for studying spatio&#8208;temporal cellular events that are related to intracellular proteins of interest.

The caged protein was transduced into cells and reactivated by light-induced degradation of the conjugates. A cytotoxic protein, saporin, was caged and photoactivated both &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in living cells with this method. This method achieved control of the cytotoxic activity in an off-on manner, introducing cell death selectively at the designed location using light. This simple and versatile photoactivation method is a promising tool for studying spatio-temporal cellular events that are related to intracellular proteins of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Selenium&#8208;Substituted Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizer for Near&#8208;Infrared Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium&#8208;substituted heptamethine cyanine photosensitizer for near&#8208;infrared photodynamic therapy was developed with a high singlet oxygen quantum yield and low cellular dark toxicity.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively safe approach to cancer treatment without significant systemic side effects or drug resistance. However, the current PDT efficiency is unsatisfactory due to the lack of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers. Heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) dyes are well&#8208;known NIR fluorophores and are also used as photosensitizers. But their singlet oxygen quantum yields (&#934;&#916;) are not ideal. Herein, we developed an NIR photosensitizer with a long&#8208;lived excited triplet state (&#964;=4.3&#8197;&#956;s) by introducing a selenium atom into the structure of a Cy7 dye. The new NIR photosensitizer exhibits a significantly high singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=0.11). Its good PDT effect was demonstrated in the living cells. Considering that the selenium&#8208;substituted photosensitizer has a very low dark cytotoxicity and good chemical stability, we conclude that it will have a promising future in biomedical and clinical applications.

         <title>Tunable Toxicity of Bufadienolides is Regulated through a Configuration Inversion Catalyzed by a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;epi&#8208;Bufadienolides with unique structures and lower toxicities have been isolated from toad bile. A short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase, HSE&#8208;1, was cloned from a toad liver cDNA library and verified to regulate the epimerization of bufadienolides.







Abstract
Bufadienolides are toxic components widely found in amphibious toads that exhibit a wide range of biological activities. Guided by UPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;MS analysis, several 3&#8208;epi&#8208;bufadienolides with unique structures were isolated from the bile of the Asiatic toad, Bufo gargarizans. However, the enzymatic machinery of this epimerization in toads and its significance in chemical ecology remains poorly understood. Herein, we firstly compared the toxicities of two typical bufadienolides, bufalin (featuring a 14&#946;&#8208;hydroxyl) and resibufogenin (containing a 14, 15&#8208;epoxy group), with their corresponding 3&#8208;epi isomers in a zebrafish model. The results of the toxicology assays showed that the ratio of maximum non&#8208;toxic concentrations of these two pairs of compounds are 256 and 96&#8197;times, respectively, thereby indicating that 3&#8208;hydroxyl epimerization leads to a significant decrease in toxicity. Aiming to investigate the biotransformation of 3&#8208;epi bufadienolides in toads, we applied liver lysate to transform bufalin and found that it could stereoselectively catalyze the conversion of bufalin into its 3&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl epimer. Following this, we cloned and characterized a short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase, HSE&#8208;1, from the toad liver cDNA library and verified its 3(&#946;&#8594;&#945;)&#8208;hydroxysteroid epimerization activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hydroxyl epimerase identified from amphibians that regulates the toxicity of animal&#8208;derived natural products.

         <title>N&#8208;Acyl Amides from Neisseria meningitidis and Their Role in Sphingosine Receptor Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study expands on the biosynthetic and functional diversity of N&#8208;acyl amides through structural characterization of previously undescribed N&#8208;acyl amides from bacterial and mammalian origin and functional characterization of such molecules to signal through G&#8208;protein coupled receptor S1PR4, downregulate IL&#8208;10 in a macrophage model, and decrease IL17A+ population in TH17 cells.







Abstract
Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram&#8208;negative opportunistic pathogen that is responsible for causing human diseases with high mortality, such as septicemia and meningitis. The molecular mechanisms N.&#8197;meningitidis employ to manipulate the immune system, translocate the mucosal and blood&#8208;brain barriers, and exert virulence are largely unknown. Human&#8208;associated bacteria encode a variety of bioactive small molecules with growing evidence for N&#8208;acyl amides as being important signaling molecules. However, only a small fraction of these metabolites has been identified from the human microbiota thus far. Here, we heterologously expressed an N&#8208;acyltransferase encoded in the obligate human pathogen N.&#8197;meningitidis and identified 30&#8197;N&#8208;acyl amides with representative members serving as agonists of the G&#8208;protein coupled receptor (GPCR) S1PR4. During this process, we also characterized two mammalian N&#8208;acyl amides derived from the bovine medium. Both groups of metabolites suppress anti&#8208;inflammatory interleukin&#8208;10 signaling in human macrophage cell types, but they also suppress the pro&#8208;inflammatory interleukin&#8208;17A+ population in TH17&#8208;differentiated CD4+ T cells.

         <title>Enaminone Formation Drives the Coupling of Biosynthetic Pathways to Generate Cyclic Lipopeptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of enaminone&#8208;containing cyclic lipopeptides were surprisingly found to be formed in microbial cells. The enaminone moiety results from the coupling of two biosynthetic pathways via amine&#8208;aldehyde condensation.







Abstract
A family of novel cyclic lipopeptides named tasikamides A&#8722;H (Tsk A&#8722;H) were discovered recently in Streptomyces tasikensis P46. Aside from the unique cyclic pentapeptide scaffold shared by the tasikamides, Tsk A&#8722;C contain a hydrazone bridge that connects the cyclic pentapeptide to the lipophilic alkyl 5&#8208;hydroxylanthranilate (AHA) moiety. Here we report the production of tasikamides I&#8722;K (Tsk I&#8722;K) by a mutant strain of S. tasikensis P46 that overexpresses two pathway&#8208;specific transcription regulators. Unlike Tsk A&#8722;C, Tsk I&#8722;K feature a rare enaminone&#8208;bridge that links the cyclic peptide scaffold to the AHA moiety. Our experimental data suggest that Tsk I&#8722;K are generated by the coupling of two biosynthetic pathways via a nonenzymatic condensation reaction between an arylamine and a &#946;&#8208;keto aldehyde&#8208;containing precursor. The results underscore the nucleophilic and electrophilic reactivity of the &#946;&#8208;keto aldehyde moiety and its ability to promote fragment coupling reactions in live microbial cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Hydrogel for Accelerated Wound Healing: Impact of N&#8208;Terminal and C&#8208;Terminal Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Impact of N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal modifications on the self&#8208;assembly of peptides (LIVAGD) was investigated for wound healing. Fmoc protecting groups at the N terminus provided additional &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which improved structural stability, supported 3&#8208;D cell culture, provided anti&#8208;inflammatory properties to the self&#8208;assemblies and enhanced wound healing ability. The C&#8208;terminus modified with lysine additionally contributed to the antimicrobial property.







Abstract
Wound dressings are required to provide a moist environment for wounds, protect against invading infections, expedite tissue regeneration, and improve wound healing efficiency. Developing biomaterials with all aforesaid properties is still a big challenge. However, peptide&#8208;based hydrogels have the potential to overcome these challenges as they are biocompatible, biodegradable as well as have the ability to mimic the extracellular matrix and provide an appropriate moist environment which is important for wound healing. With this in mind, we report the preparation and comparison of three hexapeptide&#8208;based hydrogels, LIVAGD, with the aim to understand the importance of the N&#8208;terminal protecting group as well as the C&#8208;terminal amino acid substitution on its various biological efficacies. Fmoc and acetyl groups were used for N&#8208;terminal peptide protection, while aspartic acid was substituted with lysine at the C&#8208;terminus. The resulting peptide&#8208;based hydrogels were compared. Fmoc peptide&#8208;based hydrogels exhibited efficient anti&#8208;inflammatory action along with improved biocompatibility while lysine provided enhanced antibacterial effect to the hydrogel. Additionally, in&#8197;vivo efficacy was examined using a mouse model, and Fmoc hydrogels demonstrated an improved wound healing ability with &#8764;40&#8201;% faster healing rate in comparison to the reported acetylated peptide hydrogels.

         <title>Continuous Flow Biocatalytic Reductive Amination by Co&#8208;Entrapping Dehydrogenases with Agarose Gel in a 3D&#8208;Printed Mould Reactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A customisable approach, whereby an agarose hydrogel containing co&#8208;entrapped dehydrogenases was cast in a 3D&#8208;printed mould, was developed. The reactor was applied to the reductive amination of benzaldehyde in continuous flow over 120&#8197;h (space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 7.4&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;day&#8722;1, 0.03&#8197;mol% biocatalysts loading). This work also shows how 3D&#8208;printing technology can accelerate prototyping of enzymatic reactions in flow.







Abstract
Herein, we show how the merge of biocatalysis with flow chemistry aided by 3D&#8208;printing technologies can facilitate organic synthesis. This concept was exemplified for the reductive amination of benzaldehyde catalysed by co&#8208;immobilised amine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase in a continuous flow micro&#8208;reactor. For this purpose, we investigated enzyme co&#8208;immobilisation by covalent binding, or ion&#8208;affinity binding, or entrapment. Entrapment in an agarose hydrogel turned out to be the most promising solution for this biocatalytic reaction. Therefore, we developed a scalable and customisable approach whereby an agarose hydrogel containing the co&#8208;entrapped dehydrogenases was cast in a 3D&#8208;printed mould. The reactor was applied to the reductive amination of benzaldehyde in continuous flow over 120&#8197;h and afforded 47&#8201;% analytical yield and a space&#8208;time yield of 7.4&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8201;day&#8722;1 using 0.03&#8197;mol% biocatalysts loading. This work also exemplifies how rapid prototyping of enzymatic reactions in flow can be achieved through 3D&#8208;printing technology.

         <title>Towards Non&#8208;stick Silk: Tuning the Hydrophobicity of Silk Fibroin Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk fibroin protein is used in myriad biomaterial applications. We showcase covalent decoration of silk with long&#8208;chain fluorocarbons, thereby converting it into a material more hydrophobic than Teflon! &#8242;Non&#8208;stick&#8242; silk bars fabricated in this fashion maintain structural integrity and show dramatically reduced water uptake and will be useful in directing bioorthogonal non&#8208;covalent interactions.







Abstract
Silk fibroin protein is a biomaterial with excellent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity. These properties have catapulted the material as a leader for extensive use in stents, catheters, and wound dressings. Modulation of hydrophobicity of silk fibroin protein to further expand the scope and utility however has been elusive. We report that installing perfluorocarbon chains on the surface of silk fibroin transforms this water&#8208;soluble protein into a remarkably hydrophobic polymer that can be solvent&#8208;cast. A clear relationship emerged between fluorine content of the modified silk and film hydrophobicity. Water contact angles of the most decorated silk fibroin protein exceeded that of Teflon&#174;. We further show that water uptake in prefabricated silk bars is dramatically reduced, extending their lifetimes, and maintaining mechanical integrity. These results highlight the power of chemistry under moderate conditions to install unnatural groups onto the silk fibroin surface and will enable further exploration into applications of this versatile biomaterial.

Weaving a tunable hydrophobic web! Silk fibroin, a protein extracted from the silkworm cocoon can be tailored to possess different properties by means of chemical functionalization. In this study, we sought to induce hydrophobicity using fluorination. Fluorocarbon&#8208;appending iodonium salts accomplish the fluorination in one step. A trend of increasing hydrophobicity with the number of fluorine atoms was observed, with the most hydrophobic material exhibiting a water contact angle greater than that of Teflon! This work shows the first development of directly modified silk fibroin to create hydrophobic films. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;M. Davis, D.&#8197;L. Kaplan, K. Kumar et&#8197;al.

         <title>Feruloyl Esterases Protein Engineering to Enhance Their Performance as Biocatalysts: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 22, November 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to enhance enzymes performance is presented in this review. Analyses of the current protein engineering strategies that have been used to improve feruloyl esterases in terms of thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and selectivity are discussed. The result is a framework that suggests the direction of feruloyl esterases protein engineering to generate robust industrial biocatalysts.







Abstract
Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) are versatile enzymes able to release hydroxycinnamic acids or synthesize their ester derivatives, both molecules with interesting biological activities such as: antioxidants, antifungals, antivirals, antifibrotic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, among others. The importance of these molecules in medicine, food or cosmetic industries provides FAEs with several biotechnological applications as key industrial biocatalysts. However, FAEs have some operational limitations that must be overcome, which can be addressed through different protein engineering approaches to enhance their thermal stability, catalytic efficiencies, and selectivity. This review aims to present a brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to improve enzymes performance and analyze the current protein engineering strategies applied to FAEs as interesting biocatalysts. Finally, an outlook of the future of FAEs protein engineering approaches to achieve successful industrial biocatalysts is given.

         <title>Prebiotic Foam Environments to Oligomerize and Accumulate RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotic foams are a new environment for the emergence of life. The wet&#8208;dry cycling at the enhanced interfacial area caused higher yields in catalyst&#8208;free RNA polymerization compared to an environment with low interfacial area. At the surfaces of air bubbles, we observed growth of DNA rich aggregates, which were able to fuse and detach to be accumulated at other bubbles.







Abstract
When water interacts with porous rocks, its wetting and surface tension properties create air bubbles in large number. To probe their relevance as a setting for the emergence of life, we microfluidically created foams that were stabilized with lipids. A persistent non&#8208;equilibrium setting was provided by a thermal gradient. The foam's large surface area triggers capillary flows and wet&#8208;dry reactions that accumulate, aggregate and oligomerize RNA, offering a compelling habitat for RNA&#8208;based early life as it offers both wet and dry conditions in direct neighborhood. Lipids were screened to stabilize the foams. The prebiotically more probable myristic acid stabilized foams over many hours. The capillary flow created by the evaporation at the water&#8208;air interface provided an attractive force for molecule localization and selection for molecule size. For example, self&#8208;binding oligonucleotide sequences accumulated and formed micrometer&#8208;sized aggregates which were shuttled between gas bubbles. The wet&#8208;dry cycles at the foam bubble interfaces triggered a non&#8208;enzymatic RNA oligomerization from 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic CMP and GMP which despite the small dry reaction volume was superior to the corresponding dry reaction. The found characteristics make heated foams an interesting, localized setting for early molecular evolution.

         <title>Enzymatic Generation of Double&#8208;Modified AdoMet Analogues and Their Application in Cascade Reactions with Different Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MAT (methionine adenosyltransferase) is capable of generating double&#8208;modified AdoMet analogues (DM&#8208;AdoMets) when provided with non&#8208;natural methionine analogues and nucleoside&#8208;modified ATP analogues. DM&#8208;AdoMets have unique properties and not all MTases (methyltransferases) can easily convert them. This increases selectivity for MTase&#8208;based biomolecular labelling applications, enabling differential MTase targeting wherein multiple MTases are present (i.&#8201;e., in cell).







Abstract
Methyltransferases (MTases) have become an important tool for site&#8208;specific alkylation and biomolecular labelling. In biocatalytic cascades with methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs), transfer of functional moieties has been realized starting from methionine analogues and ATP. However, the widespread use of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (AdoMet) and the abundance of MTases accepting sulfonium centre modifications limit selective modification in mixtures. AdoMet analogues with additional modifications at the nucleoside moiety bear potential for acceptance by specific MTases. Here, we explored the generation of double&#8208;modified AdoMets by an engineered Methanocaldococcus jannaschii MAT (PC&#8208;MjMAT), using 19 ATP analogues in combination with two methionine analogues. This substrate screening was extended to cascade reactions and to MTase competition assays. Our results show that MTase targeting selectivity can be improved by using bulky substituents at the N6 of adenine. The facile access to &gt;10 new AdoMet analogues provides the groundwork for developing MAT&#8208;MTase cascades for orthogonal biomolecular labelling.

         <title>Mimicking Natural Metabolisms: Cell&#8208;Free Flow Preparation of Dopamine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dopamine in&#8208;vivo metabolism was reproduced employing a combination of immobilized enzymes integrated in a flow chemistry reactor. A decarboxylase from Bacillus pumilis and a tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus have been selected for their cofactor&#8208;independency. The efficient ex&#8208;vivo cascade allowed for dopamine biosynthesis with excellent yields (85&#8201;%) and rapid reaction times (45&#8197;min).







Abstract
The biosynthesis of dopamine (DA) from L&#8208;tyrosine as starting material is an excellent yet challenging strategy. Here we developed a versatile, multi&#8208;enzymatic platform for the biocatalytic preparation of DA in a continuous mode with excellent conversion (90&#8201;%) and reaction time (45&#8197;min). The system exploits the immobilization of a decarboxylase from Bacillus pumilis (Fdc) and a tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus (Tyr), which were combined to mimic the in&#8208;vivo synthesis of DA (both primary and secondary metabolisms) giving rise to an efficient strategy with a considerable reduction of process associated costs and environmental impact. To enhance the system automation, an in&#8208;line purification via catch&#8208;and&#8208;release procedure was added.

         <title>Synthetic Studies with Bacitracin A and Preparation of Analogues Containing Alternative Zinc Binding Groups</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved synthetic route is reported for the clinically used natural product antibiotic bacitracin A. This new route provides access to the bacitracin scaffold with confidence in the stereochemical purity of the product and enables studies involving structural variation of the bacitracin framework.







Abstract
The growing threat of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria is a global concern, highlighting the urgent need for new antibiotics and antibacterial strategies. In this light, practical synthetic access to natural product antibiotics can provide important structure&#8208;activity insights while also opening avenues for the development of novel analogues with improved properties. To this end, we report an optimised synthetic route for the preparation of the clinically used macrocyclic peptide antibiotic bacitracin. Our combined solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;phase approach addresses the problematic, and previously unreported, formation of undesired epimers associated with the stereochemically fragile N&#8208;terminal thiazoline moiety. A number of bacitracin analogues were also prepared wherein the thiazoline motif was replaced by other known zinc&#8208;binding moieties and their antibacterial activities evaluated.

         <title>The Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Activity of a Gallium(III)&#8208;Phenanthroline Complex Appended to Salicylate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osteosarcoma is the most commonly diagnosed primary bone cancer and has strikingly low survival rates. Here we report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma properties of a six&#8208;coordinate gallium(III) complex with two polypridyl ligands and salicylate, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The gallium(III) complex kills bulk osteosarcoma cells and osteosarcoma stem cells in the micromolar range by evoking apoptosis through DNA damage and cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 downregulation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterisation, and anti&#8208;osteosarcoma properties of a gallium(III) complex (1) comprising of two 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands and salicylate, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The gallium(III) complex 1 displays micromolar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs). Notably, the gallium(III) complex 1 exhibits significantly higher toxicity towards OSCs grown in monolayer and three&#8208;dimensional cultures than cisplatin, a frontline anti&#8208;osteosarcoma drug. Nuclei isolation and immunoblotting studies show that the gallium(III) complex 1 enters osteosarcoma cell nuclei and induces DNA damage. Flow cytometry and cytotoxicity studies (in the presence of prostaglandin E2) indicate that the gallium(III) complex 1 downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) expression and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2&#8208;dependent manner. Further, the mode of osteosarcoma cell death evoked by the gallium(III) complex 1 is characterised as caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis.

Further, the mode of osteosarcoma cell death evoked by the gallium(III) complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is characterised as caspase-dependent apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of Charged Lipids on Giant Unilamellar Vesicle Fusion and Inner Content Mixing via Freeze&#8208;Thawing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liposomes prepared with 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;oleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (POPC) and negatively charged phospholipid (1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;oleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8208;rac&#8208;glycerol)) showed a greater ratio of inner content mixing by freeze&#8208;thawing (F/T) with a lower rate of rupture, while liposomes with POPC and positively charged phospholipids (1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;3&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;propane) showed a greater ratio of rupture. These findings could be useful for providing an improved artificial model.







Abstract
Fusion between giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) can incorporate and mix components of biochemical reactions. Recently, GUV fusion induced by freeze&#8208;thawing (F/T) was employed to construct artificial cells that can easily and repeatedly fuse GUVs with efficient content mixing. However, GUVs were ruptured during F/T, and the inner contents leaked. Herein, we investigated the effects of charged lipids on GUV fusion via F/T. The presence of 10&#8201;%&#8208;50&#8201;% (w/w%) negatively charged lipids in GUV membranes, mainly composed of the neutral charged lipid 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;oleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (POPC), improved resistance to GUV rupture and decreased inner content leakage. Furthermore, we found that the presence of positively charged lipids in GUV membranes elevated GUV rupture compared with F/T between GUVs containing POPC alone. Modified GUVs may better incorporate nutrients and lipid membranes with less damage following GUV fusion via F/T, providing an improved artificial model.

         <title>Harnessing Split&#8208;Inteins as a Tool for the Selective Modification of Surface Receptors in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Split&#8208;inteins are master puppeteers of proteins, carrying out protein splicing in a traceless, auto&#8208;processing, site&#8208;specific manner that is biorthogonal to mammalian systems. The David group have utilized split&#8208;inteins to selectively modify cell&#8208;surface proteins. Here they show the utility of this method by labeling extracellular portion of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with a synthetic fluorophore for live cell imaging. The Front Cover graphic was designed by Eliot Fuks. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. David et&#8197;al.

         <title>Reaction pathways for the enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate): What characterizes an efficient PET&#8208;hydrolase?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioprocessing of polyester waste has emerged as a promising tool in the quest for a cyclic plastic economy. One key step is the enzymatic breakdown of the polymer, and this entails a complicated pathway with substrates, intermediates, and products of variable size and solubility. We have elucidated this pathway for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and four enzymes. Specifically, we combined different kinetic measurements and a novel stochastic model, and found that the ability to hydrolyze internal bonds in the polymer (endo&#8208;lytic activity) was a key parameter for overall enzyme performance. Endo&#8208;lytic activity promoted the release of soluble PET fragments with two or three aromatic rings, which, in turn, were broken down with remarkable efficiency (k  cat  /K  M  &#8208;values of about&#160;10  5  &#160;M  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  ) in the aqueous bulk. This meant that about 70% of the final, monoaromatic products was formed via soluble di&#8208; or tri&#8208;aromatic intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of the bridging pattern of the lantibiotic pseudomycoicidin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lantibiotics are posttranslationally modified antibiotic peptides with lanthionine thioether bridges that represent potential alternatives to conventional antibiotics. The lantibiotic pseudomycoicidin is produced by Bacillus pseudomycoides DSM 12442 and is effective against many Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While prior work demonstrated that pseudomycoicidin possesses one disulfide bridge and four thioether bridges, the ring topology has so far remained unclear. Here, we analyzed several pseudomycoicidin analogues that are affected in ring formation via MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS and tandem mass spectrometry with regard to their dehydration and fragmentation patterns, respectively. As a result, we propose a bridging pattern involving Thr8 and Cys13, Thr10 and Cys16, Ser18 and Cys21, and Ser20 and Cys26, thus, forming two double ring systems. Additionally, we localized the disulfide bridge to connect Cys3 and Cys7 and, therefore, fully elucidated the bridging pattern of pseudomycoicidin.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt&#8208;toggled Capture Selection of Uric Acid Binding Aptamers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uric acid is the end&#8208;product of purine metabolism in humans and an important biomarker for many diseases. To achieve the detection of uric acid without using enzymes, we previously selected a DNA aptamer for uric acid with a Kd of 1 &#181;M but the aptamer required multiple Na+ ions for binding. Saturated binding was achieved with around 700 mM Na+ and the binding at the physiological condition was much weaker. In this work, a new selection was performed by alternating Mg2+&#8208;containing buffers with Na+ and Li+. After 13 rounds of selection, a new aptamer sequence named UA&#8208;Mg&#8208;1 was obtained. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed aptamer binding in both selection buffers, and the Kd was around 8 &#181;M. The binding of UA&#8208;Mg&#8208;1 to UA required only Mg2+. This is an indicator of successful switching of metal dependency via the salt toggled selection method. The UA&#8208;Mg&#8208;1 aptamer was engineered into a fluorescent biosensor based on the strand&#8208;displacement assay with a limit of detection of 0.5 &#181;M uric acid in the selection buffer. Finally, a comparison with the previously reported Na+&#8208;dependent aptamer and a xanthine/uric acid riboswitch was also made.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxetane Derivative Containing Carboxy Group as a Chemiluminophore&#8208;Introducing Reagent</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carboxy group&#8208;containing chemiluminophore derivative, which enabled the simple introduction of a chemiluminophore to the molecule of interest, was developed. This chemiluminophore cast luminescence light without enzymes, such as luciferase. Chemiluminophore&#8208;containing probes thus obtained could be visualized by in&#8197;vivo imaging system.







Abstract
Some types of dioxetanes are called chemiluminophores because they produce luminescence light without the use of enzymes. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel carboxy group&#8208;containing chemiluminophore derivative, which enabled the simple introduction of such a chemiluminophore to the molecule of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the in&#8197;vivo imaging system (IVIS imaging system) can recognize tagged chemicals, indicating that such a chemiluminophore could be employed as a tracer molecule for biological studies.

         <title>In vitro Applications of the Terpene Mini&#8208;Path 2.0</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic platform &#8220;TMP 2.0&#8221; is described for in&#8197;vitro natural and non&#8208;natural terpenoid enzymatic synthesis.







Abstract
In 2019 four groups reported independently the development of a simplified enzymatic access to the diphosphates (IPP and DMAPP) of isopentenol and dimethylallyl alcohol (IOH and DMAOH). The former are the two universal precursors of all terpenes. We report here on an improved version of what we call the terpene mini&#8208;path as well as its use in enzymatic cascades in combination with various transferases. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the in&#8197;vitro utility of the TMP in, i) synthesizing various natural terpenes, ii) revealing the product selectivity of an unknown terpene synthase, or iii) generating unnatural cyclobutylated terpenes.

         <title>Monitoring gut epithelium serotonin and melatonin overflow provides spatial mapping of inflammation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical array was used to measure the overflow of serotonin (5&#8208;HT) and melatonin (MEL) from the entire colon of healthy mice and mice with chemical&#8208;induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), to understand the interplay between inflammation and colonic function. We show that 5&#8208;HT overflow is increased, whilst MEL levels are reduced, in inflamed tissues. The levels of MEL are increased at the interface between healthy and inflamed regions within the colon and may limit the spread of inflammation. Understanding the interplay between inflammation and mucosal epithelial signaling can provide key insight into colonic function and aid the development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>A multiplex assay to assess the transaminase activity toward chemically diverse amine donors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of methods to engineer and immobilize Amine transaminases (ATAs) improving their functionality and operational stability is gaining momentum. Nowadays, the quest for robust, fast, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use methods to screen the activity of large collections of transaminases, is essential. This work presents a novel and multiplex fluorescence&#8208;based kinetic assay to assess ATA activity using 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde as an amine acceptor. The developed assay allows us to screen a battery of amine donors using free and immobilized ATAs from different microbial sources as biocatalysts. As a result, using chromatographic methods, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylamine was identified as the best amine donor for the amination of hydroxy methyl furfural. Finally, we adapt this method to determine the apparent Michaelis&#8208;Menten parameters of a model immobilized ATA at the microscopic (single&#8208;particle) level. Our studies promote the use of this multiplex, multidimensional assay to screen ATAs for further improvement.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes for Cancer Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for cancer treatment is gaining attention owing to its non&#8208;invasive property and ultrasound's deep tissue penetration ability (US). In SDT, the US activates the sonosensitizer at the target deep&#8208;seated tumors to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ultimately damages tumors. However, drawbacks such as insufficient ROS production, aggregation of sonosensitizer, off&#8208;target side effects, etc., of the current organic/nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers limited the effectiveness of cancer SDT. Very recently, metal complexes with tunable physio&#8208;chemical properties (such as sonostability, HOMO to LUMO energy gap, ROS generation ability, aqueous solubility, emission, etc) are evolving as effective sonosensitizers, which could overcome the limitation of organic/nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers. This concept introduces all the reported metal&#8208;based sonosensitizers and delineates the prospects of metal complexes in cancer sonodynamic therapy. This new concept of metal&#8208;based sonosensitizer can deliver next&#8208;generation cancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Amino Acids Behind In Situ Assembled Bioactive Peptide Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid toolkit exhibiting stimulus&#8208;responsiveness allows for establishment of a considerable number of in&#8197;situ peptide assembling systems via rational incorporation into peptide backbones, thereby serving as a versatile strategy for precise formation of bioactive materials at pathological sites with disease therapeutic and diagnostic functions.







Abstract
In situ self&#8208;assembly of peptides into well&#8208;defined nanostructures represents one of versatile strategies for creation of bioactive materials within living cells with great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. The intimate relationship between amino acid sequences and the assembling propensity of peptides has been thoroughly elucidated over the past few decades. This has inspired development of various controllable self&#8208;assembling peptide systems based on stimuli&#8208;responsive naturally occurring or non&#8208;canonical amino acids, including redox&#8208;, pH&#8208;, photo&#8208;, enzyme&#8208;responsive amino acids. This review attempts to summarize the recent progress achieved in manipulating in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly of peptides by controllable reactions occurring to amino acids. We will highlight the systems containing non&#8208;canonical amino acids developed in our laboratory during the past few years, primarily including acid/enzyme&#8208;responsive 4&#8208;aminoproline, redox&#8208;responsive (seleno)methionine, and enzyme&#8208;responsive 2&#8208;nitroimidazolyl alanine. Utilization of the stimuli&#8208;responsive assembling systems in creation of bioactive materials will be specifically introduced to emphasize their advantages for addressing the concerns lying in disease theranostics. Eventually, we will provide the perspectives for the further development of stimulus&#8208;responsive amino acids and thereby demonstrating their great potential in development of next&#8208;generation biomaterials.

D&#8208;protein enantiomers can be accessed through total chemical synthesis and their preparation enables establishment of mirror&#8208;image life, structural analysis through racemic protein crystallography and discovery of proteolysis&#8208;resistant ligands. Here, we highlight the recent advances in D&#8208;protein and D&#8208;peptide technology and discuss upcoming challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Total chemical protein synthesis provides access to entire D&#8208;protein enantiomers enabling unique applications in molecular biology, structural biology, and bioactive compound discovery. Key enzymes involved in the central dogma of molecular biology have been prepared in their D&#8208;enantiomeric forms facilitating the development of mirror&#8208;image life. Crystallization of a racemic mixture of L&#8208; and D&#8208;protein enantiomers provides access to high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of polypeptides. Additionally, D&#8208;enantiomers of protein drug targets can be used in mirror&#8208;image phage display allowing discovery of non&#8208;proteolytic D&#8208;peptide ligands as lead candidates. This review discusses the unique applications of D&#8208;proteins including the synthetic challenges and opportunities.

         <title>Characterization and Structural Determination of CmnG&#8208;A, the Adenylation Domain That Activates the Nonproteinogenic Amino Acid Capreomycidine in Capreomycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structures of CmnG&#8208;A, which activates a nonproteinogenic amino acid l&#8208;Cap, provide insights into the specificity and engineering opportunities of adenylation domains.







Abstract
Capreomycidine (Cap) is a nonproteinogenic amino acid and building block of nonribosomal peptide (NRP) natural products. We report the formation and activation of Cap in capreomycin biosynthesis. CmnC and CmnD catalyzed hydroxylation and cyclization, respectively, of l&#8208;Arg to form l&#8208;Cap. l&#8208;Cap is then adenylated by CmnG&#8208;A before being incorporated into the nonribosomal peptide. The co&#8208;crystal structures of CmnG&#8208;A with l&#8208;Cap and adenosine nucleotides provide insights into the specificity and engineering opportunities of this unique adenylation domain.

         <title>Anthranilic Acid Accumulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Induced by Expression of a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Gene from Paecilomyces cinnamomeus BCC 9616</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expression of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene from Paecilomyces cinnamomeus BCC 9616 caused the anthranilic acid accumulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPH 499.







Abstract
Heterologous expression of nrps33, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, from Paecilomyces cinnamomeus BCC 9616 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae unexpectedly resulted in the accumulation of anthranilic acid, an intermediate in tryptophan biosynthesis. Based on transcriptomic and real&#8208;time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT&#8208;qPCR) results, expression of nrps33 affected the transcription of tryptophan biosynthesis genes especially TRP1 which is also the selectable auxotrophic marker for the expression vector used in this work. The product of nrps33 could inhibit the activity of Trp4 involved in the conversion of anthranilate to N&#8208;(5&#8242;&#8208;phosphoribosyl)anthranilate and therefore caused the accumulation of anthranilic acid. This accumulation could in turn result in down&#8208;regulation of downstream tryptophan biosynthesis genes. Anthranilic acid is typically produced by chemical synthesis and has been used as a substrate for synthesising bioactive compounds including commercial drugs; our results could provide a new biological platform for production of this compound.

         <dc:description>
Microtubules are dynamic structures regulated by post&#8208;translational modifications called a tubulin code. The pictured jester's cap &#8216;n&#8217; bells resembles disassembling microtubules&#8212;a catastrophe&#8212;with the bells illustrating the C&#8208;terminal tyrosine on tubulins. One is replaced by our chemical proteomics probe, which is being attached by tubulin&#8208;tyrosine ligase. The juggling amino acids of the proteins animate the tyrosination cycle. The background is a fluorescence imaging picture showing the distribution of tyrosination&#8208;probe labelled proteins in neuroblastoma cells.

         <title>Antiviral Disaccharide Lead Compounds against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8201;through Computer&#8208;Aided High&#8208;Throughput Screen</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiviral mechanism of disaccharide lead compounds: Disaccharide lead compounds bind to the RBD structure of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2/ SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Omicron variant spike protein, restraining their formation of a ternary complex with heparan sulfate (HS) and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thus inhibiting virus attachment to the cell surface.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infects human epithelial cells through specific interaction with angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition, heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as the attachment factor to promote the binding of viral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 on host cells. Though the rapid development of vaccines has contributed significantly to preventing severe disease, mutated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains, especially the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Omicron variant, show increased affinity of RBD binding to ACE2, leading to immune escape. Thus, there is still an unmet need for new antiviral drugs. In this study, we constructed pharmacophore models based on the spike RBD of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Omicron variant and performed virtual screen for best&#8208;hit compounds from our disaccharide library. Screening of 96 disaccharide structures identified two disaccharides that displayed higher binding affinity to RBD in comparison to reported small molecule antiviral drugs. Further, screening PharmMapper demonstrated interactions of the disaccharides with a number of inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a potential for disaccharides with multiple&#8208;protein targets.

         <title>In&#8208;plate Chemical Synthesis of Isopeptide&#8208;linked SUMOylated Peptide Fluorescence Polarization Reagents for High&#8208;Throughput Screening of SENP preferences</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small ubiquitin&#8208;like modifiers (SUMOs) are conjugated to protein substrates in cells to regulate their function. The attachment of SUMO family members SUMO1&#8208;3 to substrate proteins is reversed by specific isopeptidases called SENPs (sentrin&#8208;specific protease). Whereas SENPs are SUMO&#8208;isoform or linkage type specific, comprehensive analysis is missing. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of SENP linkage specificity remains unclear. We present a high&#8208;throughput synthesis of 83 isopeptide&#8208;linked SUMO&#8208;based fluorescence polarization reagents to study enzyme preferences. The assay reagents were synthesized via a native chemical ligation&#8208;desulfurization protocol between 11&#8208;mer peptides containing a &#947;&#8208;thiolysine and a SUMO3 thioester. Subsequently, five recombinantly expressed SENPs were screened using these assay reagents to reveal their deconjugation activity and substrate preferences. In general, we observed that SENP1 is the most active and non&#8208;selective SENP while SENP6 and SENP7 show the least activity. Furthermore, SENPs differentially process peptides derived from SUMO1&#8208;3, who form a minimalistic representation of diSUMO chains. To validate our findings, five distinct isopeptide&#8208;linked diSUMO chains were chemically synthesized and proteolysis was monitored using a gel&#8208;based read&#8208;out.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comparative Study of Nitroxide&#8208;Based Biradicals for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization in Cellular Environments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroxide&#8208;based biradicals are increasingly being used as polarization agents for sensitivity&#8208;enhanced NMR spectroscopy in cells. They are, however, susceptible to reduction in the cellular environment. Here, we evaluate the stability of three popular polarization agents, AMUPol, AsymPolPOK, and TOTAPOL in cellular lysates, and introduce a new polarization agent, POPAPOL, which exhibits improved properties under reducing conditions.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful tool to enhance the NMR signals of molecules by transferring polarization from unpaired electron spins to nuclei through microwave irradiation. The resulting signal enhancements can enable the analysis of samples that have previously been intractable by NMR spectroscopy, including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites in cells. To carry out DNP, the sample is doped with a polarization agent, a biradical containing two nitroxide moieties. DNP applications in cells, however, present significant challenges as nitroxides are often susceptible to the reducing cellular environment. Here, we introduce a novel polarization agent, POPAPOL, that exhibits increased lifetimes under reducing conditions. We also compare its bioresistance and DNP performance with three popular, commercially available polarization agents. Our work indicates that pyrrolidine&#8208;based nitroxides can outperform piperidine&#8208;based nitroxides in cellular environments, and that future polarization agent designs must carefully balance DNP performance and stability for cellular applications.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline metal&#8208;peptide networks (MPNs) constructed from coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of metal ions and peptidic ligands display distinctive 2D or 3D reticular architectures. MPNs have attracted much attention due to their potential for development of versatile materials, but there are several underlying hurdles to be addressed for practical applications. In this review, we introduce various examples of MPNs with comprehensive descriptions of their structural characteristics and discuss future perspectives. More information can be found in the Review by H.&#8208;S. Lee, S. Kwon et&#8197;al.

         <title>Mapping of Methyl Epitopes of a Peptide&#8208;Drug with Its Receptor by 2D STDD&#8208;Methyl TROSY NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol by integrating two well&#8208;known NMR&#8208;based solution&#8208;state methods is reported. Saturation transfer double&#8208;difference with methyl&#8208;TROSY (STDD&#8208;Methyl TROSY NMR) was used to probe methyl binding epitopes of the ligand in a label&#8208;free environment. Methyl epitopes identified from STDD&#8208;Methyl TROSY NMR spectroscopy were validated through the HADDOCK platform to generate a drug&#8208;receptor model. This method has the potential to screen a large set of peptide&#8208;drug interactions for optimum receptor binding.







Abstract
The current trend in the biopharmaceutical market has boosted the development and production of biological drugs with high efficacy and fidelity for receptor binding. While high&#8208;resolution structural insights into binding epitopes of the receptor are indispensable for better therapeutic design, it is tedious and costly. In this work, we develop a protocol by integrating two well&#8208;known NMR&#8208;based solution&#8208;state methods. Saturation transfer double&#8208;difference with methyl&#8208;TROSY (STDD&#8208;Methyl TROSY NMR) was used to probe methyl binding epitopes of the ligand in a label&#8208;free environment. This study was carried out with Human insulin as a model peptide drug, with the insulin growth factor receptor (IGFR), which is an off&#8208;target receptor for insulin. Methyl epitopes identified from STDD&#8208;Methyl TROSY NMR spectroscopy were validated through the HADDOCK platform to generate a drug&#8208;receptor model. Since this method can be applied at natural abundance, it has the potential to screen a large set of peptide&#8208;drug interactions for optimum receptor binding. Thus, we propose STDD&#8208;Methyl TROSY NMR spectroscopy as a technique for rapid screening of biologics for the development of optimized biopharmaceutics.

         <dc:description>
A colorimetric assay of sequence&#8208;specific DNA cleavage by bleomycin (BLM) derivatives is a promising methodology for facilitating the development of DNA&#8208;associated drugs with antitumor activity. Double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles (dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs) possessing BLM&#8208;mediated DNA cleavage sites were designed. The front cover highlights a non&#8208;fluorescence&#8208;based analytical method that allows visual screening of potent antitumor agents using the DNA&#8208;protruding structure formed by BLM&#8208;mediated DNA cleavage on the outermost surfaces of the dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs. This study could provide a facile method for efficiently screening BLM&#8208;like drug candidates obtained from combinatorial synthesis. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.

         <title>Immobilization and Application of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recently discovered fatty acid photodecarboxylase shows great promise for the synthesis of drop&#8208;in fuels, but several factors limit its applicability, such as poor photostability and poor solubility of the substrates. In this work we show, for the first time, its immobilization in a solid carrier, and its applicability in deep eutectic solvents.







Abstract
Since its discovery in 2017, the fatty acid decarboxylase (FAP) photoenzyme has been the focus of extensive research, given its ability to convert fatty acids into alka(e)nes using merely visible blue light. Unfortunately, there are still some drawbacks that limit the applicability of this biocatalyst, such as poor solubility of the substrates in aqueous media, poor photostability, and the impossibility of reusing the catalyst for several cycles. In this work, we demonstrate the use of FAP in non&#8208;conventional media as a free enzyme and an immobilized preparation. Namely, its applicability in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept immobilization using a commercial His&#8208;tag selective carrier, a thorough study of reaction and immobilization conditions in each case, as well as reusability studies are shown. We observed an almost complete selectivity of the enzyme towards C18 decarboxylation over C16 when used in a DES, with a product analytical yield up to 81&#8201;% when using whole cells. Furthermore, when applying the immobilized enzyme in DES, we obtained yields &gt;10&#8208;fold higher than the ones obtained in aqueous media.

&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 2017, the fatty acid decarboxylase (FAP) photoenzyme has been the focus of extensive research, given its ability to convert fatty acids into alka(e)nes using merely visible blue light. Unfortunately, there are still some drawbacks that limit the applicability of this biocatalyst, such as poor solubility of the substrates in aqueous media, poor photostability, and the impossibility of reusing the catalyst for several cycles. In this work, we demonstrate the use of FAP in non-conventional media as a free enzyme and an immobilized preparation. Namely, its applicability in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and a &lt;i&gt;proof-of-concept&lt;/i&gt; immobilization using a commercial His-tag selective carrier, a thorough study of reaction and immobilization conditions in each case, as well as reusability studies are shown. We observed an almost complete selectivity of the enzyme towards C18 decarboxylation over C16 when used in a DES, with a product analytical yield up to 81&#8201;% when using whole cells. Furthermore, when applying the immobilized enzyme in DES, we obtained yields &amp;gt;10-fold higher than the ones obtained in aqueous media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

</title>

         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly behaviour of a pH&#8208;responsive amphiphile, mono&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl phosphate (DDP) is illustrated on the front cover. As shown, they readily form vesicles over a very wide pH range by themselves, thereby providing a robust alternative to fatty acid&#8208;based protocellular systems. This feature also provides a respite from the constraints that limit the environments that would have been suitable for the emergence of protocells on the early Earth. Further, they result in robust vesicles when mixed with other single&#8208; and di&#8208;acyl chain derivatives. In all, the unique pH&#8208;responsive nature of DDP&#8208;based membranes highlights the advantages that these systems would have had for emergence of early functional cells and for the engineering of tuneable membranes with potential translational implications.

         <title>Efficient production of epoxy&#8208;norbornane from norbornene by an engineered P450 peroxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy&#8208;norbornane (EPO&#8208;NBE) is a crucial building block for the synthesis of various biologically active heterocyclic systems. To develop an efficient protocol for producing EPO&#8208;NBE using norbornene (NBE) as a substrate, cytochrome P450 enzyme from Pseudomonas putida (CYP238A1) was examined and its crystal structure (PDB code: 7X53) was resolved. Molecular mechanism analysis showed a high energy barrier related to iron&#8208;alkoxy radical complex formation. Therefore, a protein engineering strategy was developed and an optimal CYP238A1NPV variant containing a local hydrophobic &#8220;fence&#8221; at the active site was obtained, which increased the H2O2&#8208;dependent epoxidation activity by 7.5&#8208;fold compared with that of CYP238A1WT. Among the &#8220;fence&#8221;, Glu255 participates in an efficient proton transfer system. Whole&#8208;cell transformation using CYP238A1NPV achieved an EPO&#8208;NBE yield of 77.6 g&#183;L&#8208;1 in a 30&#8208;L reactor with 66.3% conversion. These results demonstrate the potential of this system for industrial production of EPO&#8208;NBE and provides a new biocatalytic platform for epoxidation chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterial Dehydrogenases Facilitate Oxidative Inactivation and Bioremediation of Chloramphenicol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial resistance represents a major threat to human health and knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is therefore vital. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of oxidoreductases that inactivate the broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic chloramphenicol via dual oxidation of the C3&#8208;hydroxyl group. Accordingly, chloramphenicol oxidation either depends on standalone glucose&#8208;methanol&#8208;choline (GMC)&#8208;type flavoenzymes, or on additional aldehyde dehydrogenases that boost overall turnover. These enzymes also enable the inactivation of the chloramphenicol analogs thiamphenicol and azidamfenicol, but not of the C3&#8208;fluorinated florfenicol. Notably, distinct isofunctional enzymes can be found in Gram&#8208;positive (e.g., Streptomyces sp.) and Gram&#8208;negative (e.g., Sphingobium sp.) bacteria, which presumably evolved their selectivity for chloramphenicol independently based on phylogenetic analyses. Mechanistic and structural studies provide further insights into the catalytic mechanisms of these biotechnologically interesting enzymes, which, in sum, are both a curse and a blessing by contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance as well as to the bioremediation of chloramphenicol.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of Selenoprotein F Binding to UDP&#8208;Glucose:Glycoprotein Glucosyltransferase (UGGT) by a Photoreactive Crosslinker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoprotein F binds to the TRXL2 domain of human UGGT1, and it forms a covalent bond with amino acids in the TRXL3 region and the interdomain between &#946;S2 and GT24 of human UGGT1 via a synthetic crosslinker.







Abstract
In the endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein quality control system, UDP&#8208;glucose : glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) functions as a folding sensor. Although it is known to form a heterodimer with selenoprotein F (SelenoF), the details of the complex formation remain obscure. A pulldown assay using co&#8208;transfected SelenoF and truncated mutants of human UGGT1 (HUGT1) revealed that SelenoF binds to the TRXL2 domain of HUGT1. Additionally, a newly developed photoaffinity crosslinker was selectively introduced into cysteine residues of recombinant SelenoF to determine the spatial orientation of SelenoF to HUGT1. The crosslinking experiments showed that SelenoF formed a covalent bond with amino acids in the TRXL3 region and the interdomain between &#946;S2 and GT24 of HUGT1 via the synthetic crosslinker. SelenoF might play a role in assessing and refining the disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins in the hydrophobic cavity of HUGT1 as it binds to the highly flexible region of HUGT1 to reach its long hydrophobic cavity. Clarification of the SelenoF&#8208;binding domain of UGGT and its relative position will help predict and reveal the function of SelenoF from a structural perspective.

         <title>Optogenetic Protein Cleavage in Zebrafish Embryos
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical control of nuclear translocation and activation of apoptosis in zebrafish embryos was demonstrated by using a photocleavable fluorescent protein. Rapid and precise activation of caspase&#8208;3 was observed in cells irradiated with a short pulse of a confocal microscope 405&#8197;nm laser.







Abstract
A wide array of optogenetic tools are available that allow for precise spatiotemporal control over cellular processes. These tools are particularly important to zebrafish researchers who take advantage of the embryo's transparency. However, photocleavable optogenetic proteins have not been utilized in zebrafish. We demonstrate successful optical control of protein cleavage in embryos using PhoCl, a photocleavable fluorescent protein. This optogenetic tool offers temporal and spatial control over protein cleavage events, which we demonstrate in light&#8208;triggered protein translocation and light&#8208;triggered apoptosis.

         <title>Effects of Gly Residue and Cholesterol on the GXXXG&#8208;Mediated Parallel Association of Transmembrane Helices: A Single&#8208;Pair FRET Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small residue&#8208;mediated interhelical packing is ubiquitous in helical membrane proteins; however, the lipid dependence of its stability remains unclear. A single&#8208;molecule study of de novo&#8208;designed transmembrane helices revealed elaborate regulation by cholesterol. A change of only single amino acid (L17G) completely reversed the cholesterol dependence of helix dimerization.







Abstract
Small residue&#8208;mediated interhelical packing is ubiquitous in helical membrane proteins: however, the lipid dependence of its stability remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that the introduction of a GXXXG sequence in the middle of de novo&#8208;designed (AALALAA)3 helices (AALALAA AGLALGA AALALAA) facilitated their dimerization, which was abolished by cholesterol. Here single&#8208;pair FRET measurements revealed that a longer GXXXGXXXG segment (AALALAA A GLALGA AAGALAA) promoted helix dimerization in POPC/cholesterol bilayers, but not without cholesterol. The predicted dimer structures and degrees of helix packing suggested that helix dimers with small (&#8764;10&#176;) and large (&#8764;55&#176;) crossing angles were only stabilized in POPC and POPC/cholesterol membranes, respectively. A steric hindrance in the dimer interface and the large flexibility of helices prevented the formation of stable dimers. Therefore, amino acid sequences and lipid compositions distinctively constrain stable dimer structures in membranes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small residue-mediated&lt;/b&gt; interhelical packing is ubiquitous in helical membrane proteins; however, the lipid dependence of its stability remains unclear. A single-molecule study of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;-designed transmembrane helices revealed elaborate regulation by cholesterol. A change of only single amino acid (L17G) completely reversed the cholesterol dependence of helix dimerization.

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Reveals Protein Tyrosination Extends Beyond the Alpha&#8208;Tubulins in Human Cells
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications allow cells to swiftly adjust activity and localization of proteins. Here, we developed a chemical proteomic approach to determine a protein tyrosination status using an O&#8208;propargyl tyrosine probe. We show that tyrosination modifies previously described alpha&#8208;tubulins with &#8208;EEY C&#8208;terminal sequence together with other proteins including TUBA4A and MAPRE1 and changes dramatically during neuronal differentiation.







Abstract
Tubulin detyrosination&#8208;tyrosination cycle regulates the stability of microtubules. With respect to &#945;&#8208;tubulins, the tyrosination level is maintained by a single tubulin&#8208;tyrosine ligase (TTL). However, the precise dynamics and tubulin isoforms which undergo (de)tyrosination in neurons are unknown. Here, we exploit the substrate promiscuity of the TTL to introduce an O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;l&#8208;tyrosine to neuroblastoma cells and neurons. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemical proteomics in neuroblastoma cells using the O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;l&#8208;tyrosine probe revealed previously discussed tyrosination of TUBA4A, MAPRE1, and other non&#8208;tubulin proteins. This finding was further corroborated in differentiating neurons. Together we present the method for tubulin tyrosination profiling in living cells. Our results show that detyrosination&#8208;tyrosination is not restricted to &#945;&#8208;tubulins with coded C&#8208;terminal tyrosine and is thus involved in fine&#8208;tuning of the tubulin and non&#8208;tubulin proteins during neuronal differentiation.

         <title>Serendipitous Identification of a Covalent Activator of Liver Pyruvate Kinase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MS/MS experiments and molecular modelling studies identified a mechanism by which a lysine residue in the active site of human liver pyruvate kinase (PKL) can be targeted by benzo[d]isothiazole&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxide derivatives, resulting in the covalent activation of PKL. This previously unknown mechanism holds promise for further development of PKL activators.







Abstract
Enzymes are effective biological catalysts that accelerate almost all metabolic reactions in living organisms. Synthetic modulators of enzymes are useful tools for the study of enzymatic reactions and can provide starting points for the design of new drugs. Here, we report on the discovery of a class of biologically active compounds that covalently modifies lysine residues in human liver pyruvate kinase (PKL), leading to allosteric activation of the enzyme (EC50=0.29&#8197;&#956;M). Surprisingly, the allosteric activation control point resides on the lysine residue K282 present in the catalytic site of PKL. These findings were confirmed by structural data, MS/MS experiments, and molecular modelling studies. Altogether, our study provides a molecular basis for the activation mechanism and establishes a framework for further development of human liver pyruvate kinase covalent activators.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Dependent Electrical Conductance of DNA Origami Nanowires</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring the structural and electrical properties of DNA origami nanowires is an important endeavor for the advancement of DNA nanotechnology and DNA nanoelectronics. Highly conductive DNA origami nanowires are a desirable target for creating low&#8208;cost self&#8208;assembled nanoelectronic devices and circuits. In this work, the structure&#8208;dependent electrical conductance of DNA origami nanowires is investigated. A silicon nitride (Si  3  N  4  ) on silicon semiconductor chip with gold electrodes is used for collecting electrical conductance measurements of DNA origami nanowires, which are found to be an order of magnitude less electrically resistive on Si  3  N  4  substrates treated with a monolayer of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) (~10  13  ohms) than on native Si  3  N  4  substrates without HMDS (~10  14  ohms). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the height of DNA origami nanowires on mica and Si  3  N  4  substrates reveal that DNA origami nanowires are ~1.6 nm taller on HMDS&#8208;treated substrates than on the untreated ones indicating that the DNA origami nanowires undergo increased structural deformation when deposited onto untreated substrates, causing a decrease in electrical conductivity. This study highlights the importance of understanding and controlling the interface conditions that affect the structure of DNA and thereby affect the electrical conductance of DNA origami nanowires.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mediator&#8208;assisted laccase&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of alcohols is a green alternative to established classical synthetic protocols. However, the consecutive interaction between oxygen, laccase, mediator and substrate comprises a complicated, multivariate system. This complexity can represent a substantial entry burden for the typical organic chemist, feeling both motivated and overwhelmed, just as the scientist in the cartoon. Herein, we present a detailed comparative study evaluating the most important parameters as a guidebook to using this powerful and attractive biocatalytic solution. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Stanetty et&#8197;al.

         <title>Advance in the Polymerization Strategy for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Peptides and &#946;&#8208;Peptoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in the polymerization strategies for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;peptides and &#946;&#8208;peptoids are summarized in this review. Polymerization in one&#8208;pot can minimize the repeated separation and purification process used in solid&#8208;phase synthesis, and has the advantages of high efficiency and low cost, and can synthesize &#946;&#8208;peptides and &#946;&#8208;peptoids with high molecular weight, diverse structures and functions.







Abstract
Peptide mimics, possessing excellent biocompatibility and protease stability, have attracted broad attention and research in the biomedical field. &#946;&#8208;Peptides and &#946;&#8208;peptoids, as two types of vital peptide mimics, have demonstrated great potential in the field of foldamers, antimicrobials and protein binding, etc. Currently, the main synthetic strategies for &#946;&#8208;peptides and &#946;&#8208;peptoids include solid&#8208;phase synthesis and polymerization. Among them, polymerization in one&#8208;pot can minimize the repeated separation and purification used in solid&#8208;phase synthesis, and has the advantages of high efficiency and low cost, and can synthesize &#946;&#8208;peptides and &#946;&#8208;peptoids with high molecular weight. This review summarizes the polymerization methods for &#946;&#8208;peptides and &#946;&#8208;peptoids. Moreover, future developments of the polymerization method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;peptides and &#946;&#8208;peptoids will be discussed.

         <title>Harnessing Split&#8208;Inteins as a Tool for the Selective Modification of Surface Receptors in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Split&#8208;inteins represent a unique avenue for the modification of proteins in cells as they carryout protein splicing in a traceless, auto&#8208;processing, site specific manner that is biorthogonal to mammalian systems. Here we utilize split&#8208;inteins to label extracellular portion of EGFR with a synthetic fluorophore for live cell imaging.







Abstract
Biochemical studies of integral membrane proteins are often hampered by low purification yields and technical limitations such as aggregation causing in&#8197;vitro manipulations to be challenging. The ability of controlling proteins in live cells bypasses these limitations while broadening the scope of accessible questions owing to the proteins being in their native environment. Here we take advantage of the intein biorthogonality to mammalian systems, site specificity, fast kinetics, and auto&#8208;processing nature as an attractive option for modifying surface proteins. Using EGFR as a model, we demonstrate that the split&#8208;intein pair AvaN/NpuC can be used to efficiently and specifically modify target membrane proteins with a synthetic adduct for downstream live cell application.

         <title>Development of the First Tritiated Tetrazine: Facilitating Tritiation of Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tritiated tetrazine based on a phenyl/pyridyl core structure was successfully radiolabeled with NaBT4 by reducing an aldehyde moiety. The synthon was effectively employed to label an antibody in&#8197;vitro with pretargeted autoradiography.







Abstract
Tetrazine (Tz)&#8211;trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) ligation is an ultra&#8208;fast and highly selective reaction and it is particularly suited to label biomolecules under physiological conditions. As such, a 3H&#8208;Tz based synthon would have wide applications for in&#8197;vitro/ex vivo assays. In this study, we developed a 3H&#8208;labeled Tz and characterized its potential for application to pretargeted autoradiography. Several strategies were explored to synthesize such a Tz. However, classical approaches such as reductive halogenation failed. For this reason, we designed a Tz containing an aldehyde and explored the possibility of reducing this group with NaBT4. This approach was successful and resulted in [3H]&#8208;(4&#8208;(6&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenyl)methan&#8208;t&#8208;ol with a radiochemical yield of 22&#8201;%, a radiochemical purity of 96&#8201;% and a molar activity of 0.437&#8197;GBq/&#956;mol (11.8&#8197;Ci/mmol). The compound was successfully applied to pretargeted autoradiography. Thus, we report the synthesis of the first 3H&#8208;labeled Tz and its successful application as a labeling building block.

         <title>Chemically Enhanced Immunogenicity of Bacteria by Supramolecular Functionalization with an Adjuvant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poorly immunogenic pathogens are a major cause of infectious disease. We chemically modified the surface of such a pathogen (Staphylococcus aureus) with a synthetic adjuvant to boost immunogenicity. &#8220;Adjuvanted&#8221; S. aureus induced improved immune responses in macrophages compared to unadulterated bacteria.







Abstract
Many pathogens blunt immune responses because they lack immunogenic structural features, which typically results in disease. Here, we show evidence suggesting that pathogen immunogenicity can be chemically enhanced. Using supramolecular host&#8208;guest chemistry, we complexed onto the surface of a poorly immunogenic bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) a TLR7 agonist&#8208;based adjuvant. &#8220;Adjuvanted&#8221; bacteria were readily recognized by macrophages and induced a more pro&#8208;inflammatory immunophenotype. Future applications of this concept could yield treatment modalities that bolster the immune system's response to pathogenic microbes.

         <title>A Novel Coenzyme A Analogue in the Anaerobic, Sulfate&#8208;Reducing, Marine Bacterium Desulfobacula toluolica Tol2T</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters are formed during anabolic and catabolic reactions in every organism. Degradation pathways of growth&#8208;supporting substrates in bacteria can be predicted by differential proteogenomic studies. Direct detection of proposed metabolites such as CoA thioesters by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography coupled with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry can confirm the reaction sequence and demonstrate the activity of these degradation pathways. In the metabolomes of the anaerobic sulfate&#8208;reducing bacterium Desulfobacula toluolica Tol2T grown with different substrates various CoA thioesters, derived from amino acid, fatty acid or alcohol metabolism, have been detected. Additionally, the cell extracts of this bacterium revealed a number of CoA analogues with molecular masses increased by 1 atomic mass unit. By comparing the chromatographic and mass spectrometric properties of synthetic reference standards with those of compounds detected in cell extracts of D. toluolica Tol2T and by performing co&#8208;injection experiments, these analogues were identified as inosino&#8208;CoAs. These CoA thioesters contain inosine instead of adenosine as the nucleoside. To the best of our knowledge, this finding represents the first detection of naturally occurring inosino&#8208;CoA analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication and Functionalisation of Nanocarbon&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Next&#8208;generation diagnostics: Nanocarbon&#8208;based field effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) use incoming target analytes to impart a gating effect on conductance. Here, we review the operational mechanisms behind NC&#8208;FETs, the fabrication and functionalisation of NC&#8208;FETs with receptor biomolecules and downstream biosensing applications.







Abstract
Nanocarbon&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (NC&#8208;FET) biosensors are at the forefront of future diagnostic technology. By integrating biological molecules with electrically conducting carbon&#8208;based platforms, high sensitivity real&#8208;time multiplexed sensing is possible. Combined with their small footprint, portability, ease of use, and label&#8208;free sensing mechanisms, NC&#8208;FETs are prime candidates for the rapidly expanding areas of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing, environmental monitoring and biosensing as a whole. In this review we provide an overview of the basic operational mechanisms behind NC&#8208;FETs, synthesis and fabrication of FET devices, and developments in functionalisation strategies for biosensing applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Biological Evaluation of New Conjugates BODIPY: Dinuclear Trithiolato&#8208;Bridged Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Arene Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen new dinuclear arene&#8208;ruthenium (II)&#8208;BODIPY conjugates were synthesized. Despite a fluorescence quenching effect, these conjugates can be used as fluorescent tracers. Their antiparasitic activity but also their toxicity against healthy human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) was reduced compared to the parent ruthenium compounds.

The synthesis, photophysical properties and antiparasitic efficacy against Toxoplasma gondii &#946;&#8208;gal (RH strain tachyzoites expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase) grown in human foreskin fibroblast monolayers (HFF) of a series of 15 new conjugates BODIPY&#8208;trithiolato&#8208;bridged dinuclear ruthenium(II)&#8208;arene complexes are reported (BODIPY=4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene, derivatives used as fluorescent markers). The influence of the bond type (amide vs. ester), as well as that of the length and nature (alkyl vs. aryl) of the spacer between the dye and the diruthenium(II) complex moiety, on fluorescence and biological activity were evaluated. The assessed photophysical properties revealed that despite an important fluorescence quenching effect observed after conjugating the BODIPY to the diruthenium unit, the hybrids could nevertheless be used as fluorescent tracers. Although the antiparasitic activity of this series of conjugates appears limited, the compounds demonstrate potential as fluorescent probes for investigating the intracellular trafficking of trithiolato&#8208;bridged dinuclear Ru(II)&#8208;arene complexes in&#8197;vitro.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fifteen new&lt;/b&gt; dinuclear arene-ruthenium (II)-BODIPY conjugates were synthesized. Despite a fluorescence quenching effect, these conjugates can be used as fluorescent tracers. Their antiparasitic activity but also their toxicity against healthy human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) was reduced compared to the parent ruthenium compounds. TEM images revealed profound alterations of the tachyzoite mitochondrion.

         <title>Grid&#8208;Type Quaternary Metallosupramolecular Compounds Inhibit Human Cholinesterases through Dynamic Multivalent Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear quaternary metallosupramolecular grid complexes bind to human cholinesterases in their full or partial complex form with weak affinities. Tetranuclear bisquaternary metallosupramolecular grid complexes bind in their dissociate form with strong affinities as a result of dual binding site interactions.







Abstract
We report the implementation of coordination complexes containing two types of cationic moieties, i.&#8201;e. pyridinium and ammonium quaternary salt, as potential inhibitors of human cholinesterase enzymes. Utilization of ligands containing NNO&#8208;coordination site and binding zinc metal ion allowed mono&#8208; and tetra&#8208;nuclear complexes to be obtained with corner and grid structural type, respectively, thus affecting the overall charge of the compounds (from +1 to +8). We were able to examine for the first time the multivalency effect of metallosupramolecular species on their inhibitory abilities towards acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Importantly, resolution of the crystal structures of the obtained enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes provided a better understanding of the inhibition process at the molecular level.

         <title>Engineering Human Neuroglobin into a Cytochrome c&#8208;Like Protein with a Single Thioether Bond in Non&#8208;native State</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;native state: A double mutant of human H64M/V71C neuroglobin (Ngb) was engineered, which formed a single thioether bond as that in atypical cytochrome c (Cyt c), whereas the heme distal Met64 was oxidized to both sulfoxide (SO&#8208;Met) and sulfone (SO2&#8208;Met), representing a non&#8208;native state of Cyt c.







Abstract
A double mutant of human H64M/V71C neuroglobin (Ngb) was engineered, which formed a single thioether bond as that in atypical cytochrome c, whereas the heme distal Met64 was oxidized to both sulfoxide (SO&#8208;Met) and sulfone (SO2&#8208;Met). By contrast, no Cys&#8208;heme cross&#8208;link was formed in V71C Ngb with His64/His96 coordination, as shown by the X&#8208;ray crystal structure, which indicates that an open distal site facilitates the activation of heme iron for structural modifications.

         <title>Recent Advances towards the Reversible Chemical Modification of Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjustable regulation of proteins of interest is particularly promising for fine tuning of the structural proprieties and activities of target enzymes. This review provides on outline of the general design and current progress in conditional control of chemical modification of variable proteins and the reversible regulation applications pertaining to their activities.







Abstract
Proteins are intriguing biomacromolecules for all living systems, not only as essential building blocks of organisms, but also as participants in almost every aspect of cellular activity such as metabolism and gene transcription/expression. Developing chemical biology tools that are capable of labeling/modifying proteins is a powerful method for decoding their detailed structures and functions. However, most current approaches heavily rely on the installation of permanent tags or genetic engineering of unnatural amino acids. There has been slow development in reversible chemical labeling using small organic probes and bioorthogonal transformations to construct site&#8208;selectively modified proteins and conditionally restore their activities or structures. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of chemical regulation of proteins with reversible transformations towards distinct motifs, including amino acid residues, amide backbones and native post&#8208;translational lysine. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Chemoselective Labeling and Immobilization of Phosphopeptides with Phosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorimidazolide reagents react selectively with phosphoryl groups. Using a biotinylated, photocleavable phosphorimidazolide reagent a method was established for capture and release of phosphopeptides which has the potential to mildly and selectively enrich phosphopeptides in biological samples.







Abstract
Protein phosphorylation is one of the most ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modifications, regulating numerous essential processes in cells. Accordingly, the large&#8208;scale annotation of phosphorylation sites continues to provide central insight into the regulation of signaling networks. The global analysis of the phosphoproteome typically relies on mass spectrometry analysis of phosphopeptides, with an enrichment step necessary due to the sub&#8208;stoichiometric nature of phosphorylation. Several affinity&#8208;based methods and chemical modification strategies have been developed to date, but the choice of enrichment method can have a considerable impact on the results. Here, we show that a biotinylated, photo&#8208;cleavable phosphorimidazolide reagent permits the immobilization and subsequent cleavage of phosphopeptides. The method is capable of the capture and release of phosphopeptides of varying characteristics, and this mild and selective strategy expands the current repertoire for phosphopeptide chemical modification with the potential to enrich and identify new phosphorylation sites in the future.

         <title>A Simple Colorimetric Assay of Bleomycin&#8208;Mediated DNA Cleavage Utilizing Double&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The colorimetric detection of bleomycin (BLM)&#8208;mediated DNA cleavage with sequence selectivity is successfully demonstrated using dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs with high colloidal stability. Notably, the cleavage pathways between oxidative base release and DNA cleavage can be identified according to a change in color using a colloidal stability test applied to dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs with a blunt end and dangling end.







Abstract
A colorimetric assay of DNA cleavage by bleomycin (BLM) derivatives was developed utilizing high colloidal stability on double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles (dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs) possessing a cleavage site. The assay was performed using dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs treated with inactive BLM or activated BLM (Fe(II)&#8901;BLM). A 10&#8208;min exposure in dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs with inactive BLM treatment resulted in a rapid color change from red to purple because of salt&#8208;induced non&#8208;crosslinking aggregation of dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs. In contrast, the addition of active Fe(II)&#8901;BLM retained the red color, probably because of the formation of protruding structures at the outermost phase of dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs caused by BLM&#8208;mediated DNA cleavage. Furthermore, the results of our model experiments indicate that oxidative base release and DNA&#8208;cleavage pathways could be visually distinguished with color change. The present methodology was also applicable to model screening assays using several drugs with different mechanisms related to antitumor activity. These results strongly suggest that this assay with a rapid color change could lead to simple and efficient screening of potent antitumor agents.

In contrast, the addition of active Fe(II)&#8901;BLM retained the red color, probably because of the formation of protruding structures at the outermost phase of dsDNA-AuNPs caused by BLM-mediated DNA cleavage. Furthermore, the results of our model experiments indicate that oxidative base release and DNA-cleavage pathways could be visually distinguished with color change. The present methodology was also applicable to model screening assays using several drugs with different mechanisms related to antitumor activity. These results strongly suggest that this assay with a rapid color change could lead to simple and efficient screening of potent antitumor agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
