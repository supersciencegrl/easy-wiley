         <title>A Fluorophore&#8208;Labeled Lysine Dendrimer with an Oxo&#8208;Anion&#8208;Binding Motif for Tracking Gene Transfection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;armed lysine dendrimer 1*, which contains an oxo&#8208;anion binding GCP&#8208;motif (guanidiniocarbonylpyrrol), was designed to monitor the mechanism underlying gene transfection with this class of compound. Several steps in the transfection process could be tracked. In addition to extracellular condensation events, confocal microscopy allowed the process to be monitored from cellular uptake to gene expression.







Abstract
A transfection vector based on a peptide dendrimer (1) has been developed and its abilities for DNA binding and transport have been investigated. By attaching a fluorophore to the vector system (1*), several steps in the transfection process could be monitored directly. As DLS and AFM studies showed, the labeled vector 1* condensed DNA into tightly packed aggregates able to enter eukaryotic cells. Co&#8208;localization experiments revealed that the ligand/plasmid complex is taken up by the endosomal pathway followed by an endosomal escape or lysosomal degradation. Afterwards, the plasmid DNA seems to enter the nucleus due to a breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis, as only cells that have recently undergone mitosis showed H2B&#8208;GFP expression.

         <title>Controlled E.&#8201;coli Aggregation Mediated by DNA and XNA Hybridization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When nucleic acids exit the cells to glue them: DNA and XNA oligonucleotides were immobilized on cell surfaces of engineered E.&#8197;coli and triggered the controlled formation of synthetic bacterial tissues.







Abstract
Chemical cell surface modification is a fast&#8208;growing field of research, due to its enormous potential in tissue engineering, cell&#8208;based immunotherapy, and regenerative medicine. However, engineering of bacterial tissues by chemical cell surface modification has been vastly underexplored and the identification of suitable molecular handles is in dire need. We present here, an orthogonal nucleic acid&#8208;protein conjugation strategy to promote artificial bacterial aggregation. This system gathers the high selectivity and stability of linkage to a protein Tag expressed at the cell surface and the modularity and reversibility of aggregation due to oligonucleotide hybridization. For the first time, XNA (xeno nucleic acids in the form of 1,5&#8208;anhydrohexitol nucleic acids) were immobilized via covalent, SNAP&#8208;tag&#8208;mediated interactions on cell surfaces to induce bacterial aggregation.

         <title>Epitopes Displayed in a Cyclic Peptide Scaffold Bind SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting cyclic SFTI&#8208;1 peptide for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 serological tests. Epitopes from the spike protein were grafted onto a constrained peptide scaffold, and reactivity was determined by using ELISA. Reactivity differs substantially when compared to linear epitopes. The peptide shown here, comprising SFTI&#8208;1 structural loop (yellow) and spike protein residues 1146&#8211;1161, matched commercial serological assay.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus that causes COVID&#8208;19 is a global health issue. The spread of the virus has resulted in seven million deaths to date. The emergence of new viral strains highlights the importance of continuous surveillance of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus by using timely and accurate diagnostic tools. Here, we used a stable cyclic peptide scaffolds to present antigenic sequences derived from the spike protein that are reactive to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies. Using peptide sequences from different domains of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike proteins, we grafted epitopes on the peptide scaffold sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI&#8208;1). These scaffold peptides were then used to develop an ELISA to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies in serum. We show that displaying epitopes on the scaffold improves reactivity overall. One of the scaffold peptides (S2_1146&#8208;1161_c) has reactivity equal to that of commercial assays, and shows diagnostic potential.

         <title>Engineering Glucose Dehydrogenase to Favor Totally Synthetic Biomimetic Cofactors Containing Carboxyl Group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucose dehydrogenase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsGDH) was engineered to favor a synthesized unnatural cofactor 3&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybenzyl) pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium (BANA+). Mutation hotspots E44 and E114 were identified by in&#8197;situ ligand minimization program. Double mutant E44D/E114&#8197;L with 7.7&#8208;fold increased activity and 10.6&#8208;fold increased catalytic efficiency toward BANA+ was obtained.







Abstract
The utilization of unnatural nicotinamide cofactors for reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases has gained increasing interest. Totally synthetic nicotinamide cofactor biomimetics (NCBs) are cost&#8208;effective and convenient to synthesize. Thus, it has become increasingly important to develop enzymes that accept NCBs. Here, we have engineered SsGDH to favor a newly synthesized unnatural cofactor 3&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybenzyl) pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium (BANA+). Using in&#8197;situ ligand minimization tool, sites 44 and 114 were identified as hotspots for mutagenesis. All the double mutants demonstrated 2.7&#8211;7.7&#8208;fold improvements in catalytic activity, and the best double mutant E44D/E114&#8197;L exhibited 10.6&#8208;fold increased catalytic efficiency toward BANA+. These results provide valuable information for the rational engineering of oxidoreductases with versatile NCBs&#8208;dependency, as well as the design of novel biomimetic cofactors.

         <title>De Novo Design of Polyhedral Protein Assemblies: Before and After the AI Revolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional de novo polyhedral protein assemblies can be generated by computational design using first principle&#8208; or AI&#8208;based methods supplemented by tailored surface modifications of validated designs. Here, we detail current design methods and explore how they may be combined to expand the variety and application of such assemblies.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling polyhedral protein biomaterials have gained attention as engineering targets owing to their naturally evolved sophisticated functions, ranging from protecting macromolecules from the environment to spatially controlling biochemical reactions. Precise computational design of de novo protein polyhedra is possible through two main types of approaches: methods from first principles, using physical and geometrical rules, and more recent data&#8208;driven methods based on artificial intelligence (AI), including deep learning (DL). Here, we retrospect first principle&#8208; and AI&#8208;based approaches for designing finite polyhedral protein assemblies, as well as advances in the structure prediction of such assemblies. We further highlight the possible applications of these materials and explore how the presented approaches can be combined to overcome current challenges and to advance the design of functional protein&#8208;based biomaterials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Poly(Amino Acid)s Mediated by Secondary Conformations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The factors influencing secondary conformational regulation of PAAs, especially order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational transitions, and specific methods for regulating the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of poly(amino acid)s through secondary conformations reported in recent years are summarized, in the hope of providing some insights for the future design and application of synthetic polypeptides.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers has recently drawn great attention due to its remarkable performance and wide variety of applications in biomedicine, biomaterials, microelectronics, photoelectric materials, catalysts, etc. Poly(amino acid)s (PAAs), formed by introducing synthetic amino acids into copolymer backbones, are able to fold into different secondary conformations when compared with traditional amphiphilic copolymers. Apart from changing the chemical composition and degree of polymerization of copolymers, the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of PAAs could be controlled by their secondary conformations, which are more flexible and adjustable for fine structure tailoring. In this article, we summarize the latest findings on the variables that influence secondary conformations, in particular the regulation of order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational changes and the approaches used to manage the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of PAAs. These strategies include controlling pH, redox reactions, coordination, light, temperature, and so on. Hopefully, we can provide valuable perspectives that will be useful for the future development and use of synthetic PAAs.

         <title>3&#8209;Alkyl&#8209;2&#8209;methoxypyrazines: Overview of Their Occurrence, Biosynthesis and Distribution in Edible Plants</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazines are ubiquitous in nature &#8211; biosynthesized by microorganisms, insects, and plants. Due to their great structural diversity, they own manifold biological functions. Alkyl&#8208; and alkoxypyrazines for instance play a key role as semiochemicals, but also as important aroma compounds in foods. Especially 3&#8209;alkyl&#8209;2&#8209;methoxypyrazines&#160;(MPs) have been of great research interest. MPs are associated with green and earthy attributes. They are responsible for the distinctive aroma properties of numerous vegetables. Moreover, they have a strong influence on the aroma of wines, in which they are primarily grape&#8208;derived. Over the years various methods have been developed and implemented to analyse the distribution of MPs in plants. In addition, the biosynthetic pathway of MPs has always been of particular interest. Different pathways and precursors have been proposed and controversially discussed in the literature. While the identification of genes encoding O&#8209;methyltransferases gave important insights into the last step of MP&#8209;biosynthesis, earlier biosynthetic steps and precursors remained unknown. It was not until 2022 that in vivo feeding experiments with stable isotope labeled compounds revealed L&#8209;leucine and L&#8209;serine as important precursors for IBMP. This discovery gave evidence for a metabolic interface of the MP&#8208;biosynthesis and photorespiration.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishment of an In Bacterio assay for the Assessment of Carbon Storage Regulator A (CsrA) inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymicrobial infections involving various combinations of microorganisms, such as Escherichia, Pseudomonas, or Yersinia, can lead to acute and chronic diseases in for example the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Our aim is to modulate microbial communities by targeting the posttranscriptional regulator system called carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) (or also repressor of secondary metabolites (RsmA)). In previous studies, we identified easily accessible CsrA binding scaffolds and macrocyclic CsrA binding peptides through biophysical screening and phage display technology. However, due to the lack of an appropriate in bacterio assay to evaluate the cellular effects of these inhibitor hits, the focus of the present study is to establish an in bacterio assay capable of probing and quantifying the impact on CsrA&#8208;regulated cellular mechanisms. We have successfully developed an assay based on a luciferase reporter gene assay, which in combination with a qPCR expression gene assay, allows for the monitoring of expression levels of different downstream targets of CsrA. The chaperone protein CesT was used as a suitable positive control for the assay, and in time&#8208;dependent experiments, we observed a CesT&#8208;mediated increase in bioluminescence over time. By this means, the cellular on&#8208;target effects of non&#8208;bactericidal/non&#8208;bacteriostatic virulence modulating compounds targeting CsrA/RsmA can be evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Short Peptides with Perfluoroalkyl Side Chains and Evaluation of Their Cellular Uptake Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>With an increasing demand for macromolecular biotherapeutics, the issue of their poor cell&#8208;penetrating abilities requires viable and relevant solutions. Herein, we report&#160;tripeptides&#160;bearing an amino acid with a perfluoroalkyl (RF) group adjacent to the&#160;a&#8208;carbon. RF&#8208;containing tripeptides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to transport a conjugated hydrophilic dye (Alexa Fluor 647) into&#160;the cells. RF&#8208;containing tripeptides with the fluorophore&#160;showed high cellular uptake efficiency and none of them were&#160;cytotoxic.&#160;Interestingly, we demonstrated that the absolute configuration of&#160;perfluoroalkylated amino acids (RF&#8208;AAs)&#160;affects&#160;not only nanoparticle formation but also&#160;the&#160;cell permeability of&#160;the tripeptides. These&#160;novel RF&#8208;containing tripeptides are potentially useful as short and noncationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs).</dc:description>

         <title>A Single Site Mutation Tunes Fluorescence and Chromophorylation of an Orange Fluorescent Cyanobacteriochrome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR)&#160;cGMP&#8208;specific phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase, and FhlA&#160;(GAF) domains bind bilin cofactors to confer sensory wavelengths important for various cyanobacterial photosensory processes. Many isolated GAF domains autocatalytically bind bilins,&#160;including the third GAF domain of CBCR Slr1393 from&#160;Synechocystis&#160;sp. PCC6803, which binds phycoerythrobilin (PEB) to yield a bright orange fluorescent protein. Compared to green fluorescent proteins, the smaller size and lack of an oxygen requirement for fluorescence make Slr1393g3 a promising platform for new genetically encoded fluorescent tools.&#160;Slr1393g3, however, shows low PEB binding efficiency (chromophorylation) at ~3% compared to total&#160;Slr1393g3&#160;expressed in&#160;E. coli. Here we used site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and plasmid&#160;redesign&#160;methods to improve&#160;Slr1393g3&#8208;PEB binding and demonstrate its utility as a fluorescent marker in live cells.&#160;Mutation at a single site, Trp496, tuned&#160;the emission over ~30 nm, likely by shifting autoisomerization of PEB to phycourobilin (PUB). Plasmid&#160;modifications for tuning relative expression of Slr1393g3 and PEB synthesis enzymes also improved chromophorylation and moving from a dual to single plasmid system facilitated exploration of a range of mutants via site saturation mutagenesis and sequence truncation. Collectively, the PEB/PUB chromophorylation was raised&#160;up to a total of 23% with combined sequence truncation and W496H mutation.</dc:description>

         <title>A degron blocking strategy towards improved CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTAC selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules inducing protein degradation are important pharmacological tools to interrogate complex biology and are rapidly translating into clinical agents. However, to fully realise the potential of these molecules, selectivity remains a limiting challenge. Herein, we addressed the issue of selectivity in the design of CRL4CRBN recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). Thalidomide derivatives used to generate CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTACs have well described intrinsic monovalent degradation profiles by inducing the recruitment of neo&#8208;substrates such as GSPT1, Ikaros and Aiolos. We leveraged structural insights from known CRL4CRBN neo&#8208;substrates to attenuate and indeed remove this monovalent degradation function in well&#8208;known CRL4CRBN molecular glues degraders, namely CC&#8208;885 and Pomalidomide. We then applied these design principles on a previously published BRD9 PROTAC (dBRD9&#8208;A) and generated an analogue with improved selectivity profile. Finally, we implemented a computational modelling pipeline to show that our degron blocking design does not impact PROTAC induced ternary complex formation. We believe that the tools and principles presented in this work will be valuable to support the development of targeted protein degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Chemistry Platform for the Development of a Cereblon E3 Ligase&#8208;based Partial PROTAC Library</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising therapeutic strategy to selectively promote the degradation of protein targets by exploiting the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. Among the limited number of E3 ligase ligands discovered for the PROTAC technology, ligands of cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase such as pomalidomide, thalidomide, or lenalidomide are the most frequently used for the development of PROTACs. Our group previously reported that a phenyl group could be tolerated on the C4&#8208;position of lenalidomide as the ligand of CRBN to develop PROTACs. Herein, we report a modular chemistry platform for the efficient attachment of various ortho, meta, and para substituted phenyls to the C4&#8208;position of the lenalidomide via Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which allows the systematic investigation of the linker effect for the development of PROTACs against any target. We examined the substrate scope by preparing twelve lenalidomide&#8208;derived CRBN E3 ligase ligands with different linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetically Encoded Crosslinking Enables Identification of Multivalent Ubiquitin&#8208;Deubiquitylating Enzyme Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally guided genetic incorporation of p&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine into ubiquitin paired with bottom&#8208;up proteomics leads to the next generation of ubiquitin probes for elucidating interacting interfaces, a feature distinguished from its first&#8208;generation counterparts. This study uses these probes to profile interactions of ubiquitin with deubiquitylating enzymes capable of multivalent interactions.







Abstract
Ubiquitin (Ub) proteoforms control nearly every aspect of eukaryotic cell biology through their diversity. Inspired by the widely used Ub C&#8208;terminal electrophiles (Ub&#8722;E), here we report the identification of multivalent binding of Ub with deubiquitylating enzymes (Dubs) using genetic code expansion (GCE) and crosslinking mass spectrometry. While the Ub&#8722;Es only gather structural information with the S1 Dub sites, we demonstrate that GCE of Ub with p&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine enables identification of interaction modes beyond the S1 site with a panel of Dubs of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic origin. Collectively, this represents the next generation of Ub&#8208;based affinity probes with a unique ability to unravel Ub interaction landscapes beyond what is afforded by cysteine&#8208;based chemistries.

         <title>Structures and Mechanisms of a Novel Bacterial Transport System for Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bacterial tripartite ATP&#8208;independent transporters facilitate the uptake of dicarboxylates and similar metabolites. Some have evolved to work with an additional lipoprotein component, TatT, whose role remained elusive. This work demonstrates that TatT displays a preference for lipophilic molecules and represents a novel transport system for lipids.







Abstract
Bacterial acquisition of metabolites is largely facilitated by transporters with unique substrate scopes. The tripartite ATP&#8208;independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters comprise a large family of bacterial proteins that facilitate the uptake of a variety of small molecules. It has been reported that some TRAP systems encode a fourth protein, the T component. The T&#8208;component, or TatT, is predicted to be a periplasmic&#8208;facing lipoprotein that enables the uptake of metabolites from the outer membrane. However, no substrates were revealed for any TatT and their functional role(s) remained enigmatic. We recently identified a homolog in Methylococcus capsulatus that binds to sterols, and herein, we report two additional homologs that demonstrate a preference for long&#8208;chain fatty acids. Our bioinformatics, quantitative analyses of protein&#8208;ligand interactions, and high&#8208;resolution crystal structures suggest that TatTs might facilitate the trafficking of hydrophobic or lipophilic substrates and represent a new class of bacterial lipid and fatty acid transporters.

         <title>A Novel Near&#8208;IR Absorbing Ruthenium(II) Complex as Photosensitizer for Photodynamic Therapy and its Cetuximab Bioconjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Ru(II) cyclometalated complex activatable at 740&#8197;nm is reported as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy. Two ruthenium&#8208;cetuximab bioconjugates have been prepared to gain cancer cell specificity, but were found to be not phototoxic.







Abstract
A novel Ru(II) cyclometalated photosensitizer (PS), Ru&#8208;NH2, for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of formula [Ru(appy)(bphen)2]PF6 (where appy=4&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpyridine and bphen=bathophenanthroline) and its cetuximab (CTX) bioconjugates, Ru&#8208;Mal&#8208;CTX and Ru&#8208;BAA&#8208;CTX (where Mal=maleimide and BAA=benzoylacrylic acid) were synthesised and characterised. The photophysical properties of Ru&#8208;NH2 revealed absorption maxima around 580&#8197;nm with an absorption up to 725&#8197;nm. The generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) upon light irradiation was confirmed with a 1O2 quantum yield of 0.19 in acetonitrile. Preliminary in&#8197;vitro experiments revealed the Ru&#8208;NH2 was nontoxic in the dark in CT&#8208;26 and SQ20B cell lines but showed outstanding phototoxicity when irradiated, reaching interesting phototoxicity indexes (PI) &gt;370 at 670&#8197;nm, and &gt;150 at 740&#8197;nm for CT&#8208;26 cells and &gt;50 with NIR light in SQ20B cells. The antibody CTX was successfully attached to the complexes in view of the selective delivery of the PS to cancer cells. Up to four ruthenium fragments were anchored to the antibody (Ab), as confirmed by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass spectrometry. Nonetheless, the bioconjugates were not as photoactive as the Ru&#8208;NH2 complex.

         <title>Nucleobase and Linker Modification for Triple&#8208;Helical Recognition of Pyrimidines in RNA Using Peptide Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) nucleobases for triple&#8208;helical recognition of pyrimidines in C&#8208;G and U&#8208;A base pairs in RNA revealed a complex interplay of heterocycles and linkers that connect them to PNA backbone. The results suggest that extended linkers may be promising for future optimization of heterocyclic nucleobases for recognition of double&#8208;stranded RNA.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;helical recognition of any sequence of double&#8208;stranded RNA requires high affinity Hoogsteen hydrogen binding to pyrimidine interruptions of polypurine tracts. Because pyrimidines have only one hydrogen bond donor/acceptor on Hoogsteen face, their triple&#8208;helical recognition is a formidable problem. The present study explored various five&#8208;membered heterocycles and linkers that connect nucleobases to backbone of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to optimize formation of X&#8226;C&#8208;G and Y&#8226;U&#8208;A triplets. Molecular modeling and biophysical (UV melting and isothermal titration calorimetry) results revealed a complex interplay between the heterocyclic nucleobase and linker to PNA backbone. While the five&#8208;membered heterocycles did not improve pyrimidine recognition, increasing the linker length by four atoms provided promising gains in binding affinity and selectivity. The results suggest that further optimization of heterocyclic bases with extended linkers to PNA backbone may be a promising approach to triple&#8208;helical recognition of RNA.

         <title>Selective and Sustainable Production of Sub&#8208;terminal Hydroxy Fatty Acids by a Self&#8208;Sufficient CYP102 Enzyme from Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic hydroxylation of fatty acids by Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) offers an eco&#8208;friendly route to hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), high&#8208;value oleochemicals with various applications in materials industry and with potential as bioactive compounds. However, instability and poor regioselectivity of CYPs are their main drawbacks. A newly discovered self&#8208;sufficient CYP102 enzyme, BAMF0695 from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 7, exhibits preference for hydroxylation of sub&#8208;terminal positions (&#969;&#8208;1, &#969;&#8208;2 and &#969;&#8208;3) of fatty acids. Our studies show that BAMF0695 has a broad temperature optimum (over 70 % of maximal enzymatic activity retained between 20 &#176;C to 50 &#176;C) and is highly thermostable (T50 &gt; 50 &#176;C), affording excellent adaptive compatibility for bioprocesses. We further demonstrate that BAMF0695 can utilize renewable microalgae lipid as a substrate feedstock for HFA production. Moreover, through extensive site&#8208;directed and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis, we isolated variants with high regioselectivity, a rare property for CYPs that usually generate complex regioisomer mixtures. BAMF0695 mutants were able to generate a single HFA regiosiomer (&#969;&#8208;1 or &#969;&#8208;2) with selectivities from 75 % up to 91 %, using C12 to C18 fatty acids. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of a recent CYP and its variants for sustainable and green production of high&#8208;value HFAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Light&#8208;Driven Consortia for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia composed of phototrophs and heterotrophs have attracted increasing attention owing to their potential to be used in sustainable biotechnology. In recent years, synthetic phototrophic consortia have been used to produce bulk chemicals, biofuels, and other valuable bioproducts. In addition, autotrophic&#8208;heterotrophic symbiosis systems have potential applications in wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and as a method for phytoplankton bloom control. Here, we discuss progress made on the biosynthesis of phototrophic microbial consortia. In addition, strategies for optimizing the synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia are summarized. Moreover, we highlight current challenges and future research directions for the development of robust and controllable synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia.</dc:description>

         <title>Phospholipid&#8208;Coated Boronic Oxide Nanoparticles as Boron Agents for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gotcha! Phospholipid&#8208;coated boronic oxide nanoparticles exhibited excellent BNCT activity in cancer spheroids through efficient penetration and the provision of highly concentrated boron atoms in nanoparticles.







Abstract
Minimally invasive boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an elegant approach for cancer treatment. The highly selective and efficient deliverability of boron agents to cancer cells is the key to maximizing the therapeutic benefits of BNCT. In addition, enhancement of the frequencies to achieve boron neutron capture reaction is also significant in improving therapeutic efficacy by providing a highly concentrated boron agent in each boron nanoparticle. As the density of the thermal neutron beam remains low, it is unable to induce high&#8208;efficiency cell destruction. Herein, we report phospholipid&#8208;coated boronic oxide nanoparticles as agents for BNCT that can provide a highly concentrated boron atom in each nanoparticle. The current system exhibited in&#8197;vitro BNCT activity seven times higher than that of commercial boron agents. Furthermore, the system could penetrate cancer spheroids deeply, efficiently suppressing thermal neutron irradiation&#8208;induced growth.

         <title>Precise and Controlled Modification of Proteins using Multifunctional Chemical Constructs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled protein modification using multifunctional chemical constructs emerged as novel tools in biomedical sciences. This concept article discusses the integration of elements that are usually found in protein modifying enzymes in artificial synthetic constructs. Directions to incorporate additional features are provided in order to aid the development of even more sophisticated precision tools for protein modification.







Abstract
Bioconjugation of chemical entities to biologically active proteins has increased our insight in the inner workings of a cell and resulted in novel therapeutic agents. A current challenge is the efficient generation of homogeneous conjugates of native proteins, not only when isolated, but also when still present in their native environment. To do this, various features of protein&#8208;modifying enzymes have been combined in artificial constructs. In this concept, the current status of this approach is evaluated, and the interplay between designs and protein modification will be discussed. Particular focus is directed on the protein&#8208;binding anchor, the chemistry that is used for the modification, and the linker that connects these two units. Suggestions how to include additional elements such as a trigger&#8208;responsive switch that regulated protein modification are also presented.

         <title>Rieske Oxygenases and Other Ferredoxin&#8208;Dependent Enzymes: Electron Transfer Principles and Catalytic Capabilities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rieske oxygenases are multi&#8208;component enzymes whose activities rely on the single&#8208;electron activation of oxygen. As shown in the cover image, electrons are transferred between a reductase and the terminal oxygenase, often mediated by a small carrier protein called ferredoxin. As reviewed herein, their highly diverse reactivities and outstandingly broad substrate scope have attracted increasing attention in the field of biocatalysis. More information can be found in the Review by S. Schmidt et al.

         <title>Integrating Ligands into Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Signal transduction from non&#8208;nucleic acid ligands (small molecules and proteins) to structural changes of nucleic acids plays a crucial role in both biomedical analysis and cellular regulations. However, how to bridge between these two types of molecules without compromising the expandable complexity and programmability of the nucleic acid nanomachines is a critical challenge. Compared with the previously most widely applied transduction strategies, we summarize the latest advances of a kinetically controlled approach for ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction in this Concept. This new design works through an intrinsic conformational alteration of the nucleic acid aptamer upon the ligand binding as a governing factor for nucleic acid strand displacement reactions. The functionalities and applications of this transduction system as a ligand converter on biosensing and DNA computation are described and discussed in this mini&#8208;review. Furthermore, we propose some potential scenarios for utilization of this ligand transduction design to regulate gene expressions through synthetic RNA switches in the cellular contexts. Finally, future perspectives regarding this ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction platform are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative analysis of The High Yield Hydrolysis of Kelp by Laminarinase and Alginate Lyase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kelp is an abundant, farmable biomass containing laminarin and alginate as major polysaccharides, providing an excellent model substrate for study of their deconstruction by simple enzyme mixtures. Our previous study showed strong reactivity of glycoside hydrolase family 55 during hydrolysis of purified laminarin, raising the question of its reactivity with intact kelp. In this study, we determined that combination of a single glycoside hydrolase family 55 &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;exoglucanase with a broad specificity alginate lyase from polysaccharide lyase family 18 gives efficient hydrolysis of untreated kelp to a mixture of simple sugars glucose, gentiobiose, mannitol&#8208;end glucose, and mannuronic and guluronic acids and their soluble oligomers. Quantitative assignments from nanostructure initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) and 2D HSQC NMR and analysis of the reaction time&#8208;course are provided. The data suggests that binary combinations of enzymes targeted to the unique polysaccharide composition of marine biomass are sufficient to deconstruct kelp into soluble sugars for microbial fermentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Definition of an Index Parameter To Screen Highly Functional Enzymes Derived from a Biochemical and Thermodynamic Analysis of Ancestral meso&#8208;Diaminopimelate Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is broadly applied to protein engineering; however, screening highly functional enzymes from the designed sequences remains a time&#8208;consuming task. The new index parameter defined in this study (the balance in the bubble) helps to efficiently screen the highly functional ancestral enzymes (represented as &#8220;positive bioCATalyst&#8221;).

Abstract
Sequence&#8208;based protein design approaches are being adopted to generate highly functional enzymes; however, screening the enzymes remains a time&#8208;consuming task. In this study, by analyzing the enzymatic properties of four ancestral meso&#8208;2,6&#8208;diaminopimelate dehydrogenases (AncDAPDHs), AncDAPDH&#8208;N1, &#8208;N2, &#8208;N3, and &#8208;N4, we attempted to define a new index parameter that is helpful for efficiently screening the enzymes. Biochemical and thermodynamic analyses indicated that only AncDAPDH&#8208;N4 exhibited greater thermal stability than and activity similar to those of native DAPDHs. Structural and sequence comparisons between DAPDH from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgDAPDH) and the AncDAPDHs suggested that &#8220;quality of mutations&#8221; is a potential index parameter. In fact, the mutations introduced from CgDAPDH to AncDAPDH&#8208;N4 correlated highly with the mutations accumulated during the evolution process from mesophiles to thermophiles. These results suggest that, although there are several exceptions, the correlation coefficient can be used as an index parameter for screening high&#8208;functioning enzymes from sequence data.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted JNK Inhibitor and Its Protective Effect on Parkinson's Disease Phenotypes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of location: P2 specifically inhibited the activation of mitochondrial JNK, but did not affect the activation of nuclear JNK signaling. The mitochondrial&#8208;targeting JNK inhibitor P2 rescued mitochondrial dysfunction and climbing disorder in both cellular and Drosophila Parkinson's disease models and could be a potential therapeutic method for PD.







Abstract
C&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase (JNK) is a key mediator involved in a variety of physiological processes. JNK activation is regulated in a complex manner by upstream kinases and phosphatases, and plays an important role in physiological processes such as the immune response and neuronal function. Therefore, JNK has become a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, arthritis and other diseases. Inhibition of JNK activation in mitochondria holds great potential for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. However, no specific mitochondrial&#8208;targeted JNK inhibitor has been reported. We have developed a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted JNK inhibitor, P2, by linking a mitochondrial&#8208;specific cell&#8208;penetrating peptide to SP600125 (SP), a commercialized specific inhibitor of JNK. We found that P2 specifically inhibited mitochondrial JNK phosphorylation instead of nuclear JNK signaling. Further studies showed that P2 effectively rescued PD phenotypes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, thus indicating that it is a potential therapeutic for PD.

         <title>Light Chain Q166C Mutation Permits One&#8208;step Site Specific Conjugation on Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
When engineered cysteines are used for site&#8208;specific conjugation in antibody&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC) development, the sulfhydryl groups on the engineered cysteines are mostly in an oxidized form post cell culture process. In this study, we screened for potential cysteine mutation sites in the constant region of bevacizumab heavy and light chains to identify mutation sites where engineered cysteine can maintain its free thiol group during the cell culture and purification process, enabling single&#8208;step site&#8208;specific conjugation. Q166C mutation in the light chain (Ava&#8208;166C) was identified that showed high free thiol ratio upon cell culture and subsequent purification and a nearly complete conjugation of two Ang&#8208;2 binding peptides on bevacizumab (one on each light chain) can be achieved. The mutation has no negative impact on the binding of bevacizumab to VEGF. The bispecific antibody&#8208;peptide, named Ava&#8208;Plus, showed high affinity to both VEGF and Ang&#8208;2 and higher activity than bevacizumab and/or the anti&#8208;Ang&#8208;2 peptide to neutralize VEGF and Ang&#8208;2, which promote the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In in&#8197;vivo experiments, Ava&#8208;Plus showed strong anti&#8208;angiogenesis effects on chicken chorioallantoic membrane and higher anti&#8208;tumor activity than bevacizumab and Ava&#8208;166C in a COLO 205 human colorectal tumor cell xenograft model in mice. Meanwhile, lower CD31, an angiogenesis indicator, expression in Ava&#8208;Plus treated tissue was observed. The Q166C mutation holds the potential to be generally applied to all antibodies with kappa light chains.







Abstract
Engineered cysteines are frequently used for site&#8208;specific conjugation in antibody&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC) development. When cysteine&#8208;engineered mAbs are produced in the cell culture process, the sulfhydryl groups on the engineered cysteines are mostly in an oxidized form. The oxidized cysteines require multiple steps (such as reduction, reoxidation, and buffer exchanges) to reactivate for bioconjugation, which complicates the ADC production process and reduces yields. In this study, we identified a Q166C mutation in the light chain that allows the presence of free sulfhydryl groups during cell culture and purification process. This mutation is in the constant region and away from sites involved in antigen binding or Fc&#8208;mediated functions. The free sulfhydryl reacts readily with maleimide in a mild solution at a high conjugation rate. This is only the second such site reported (the first one is Q124C in the light chain). Using the Q166C mutation, we conjugated an anti&#8208;angiopoietin&#8208;2 (Ang&#8208;2) peptide on bevacizumab, an anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, to construct a peptide antibody conjugate, Ava&#8208;Plus, which could block two pro&#8208;angiogenic factors simultaneously. Ava&#8208;Plus showed high affinity for both VEGF and Ang&#8208;2 and demonstrated higher activity than bevacizumab in in&#8197;vitro cell migration and in&#8197;vivo mouse xenograft models.

Ava-Plus showed high affinity for both VEGF and Ang-2 and demonstrated higher activity than bevacizumab in in&#8197;vitro cell migration and in&#8197;vivo mouse xenograft models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constraining and Modifying Peptides Using Pd&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Allylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cysteine allylation is used for peptide stapling and the resulting alkene&#8208;containing staples are further modified via biorthogonal reactions to introduce additional probes.







Abstract
Over the past decades, several strategies for inducing and stabilizing secondary structure formation in peptides have been developed to increase their proteolytic stability and their binding affinity to specific interaction partners. Here, we report how our recently introduced chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cysteine allylation reaction can be extended to stapling and how the resulting alkene&#8208;containing staples themselves can be further modified to introduce additional probes into such stabilized peptides. The latter is demonstrated by introducing a fluorophore as well as a PEG moiety into different stapled peptides using bioorthogonal thiol&#8208;ene and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Furthermore, we investigated structural implications of our allyl staples when used to replace conformationally relevant disulfide bridges. To this end, we chose a selective binder of integrin &#945;3&#946;1 (LXY3), which is only active in its cyclic disulfide form. We replaced the disulfide bridge by different stapling reagents in order to increase stability and binding affinity towards integrin &#945;3&#946;1.

         <title>Deciphering the Mechanistic Basis for Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>

Although rarely used in nature, fluorine has emerged as an important elemental ingredient in the design of engineered proteins. Adding to the molecular modification toolbox, here we report the ability of privileged perfluorinated amphiphiles to noncovalently decorate proteins to alter their conformational plasticity and potentiate their dispersion into fluorous phases.







Abstract
Although rarely used in nature, fluorine has emerged as an important elemental ingredient in the design of proteins with altered folding, stability, oligomerization propensities, and bioactivity. Adding to the molecular modification toolbox, here we report the ability of privileged perfluorinated amphiphiles to noncovalently decorate proteins to alter their conformational plasticity and potentiate their dispersion into fluorous phases. Employing a complementary suite of biophysical, in&#8208;silico and in&#8208;vitro approaches, we establish structure&#8208;activity relationships defining these phenomena and investigate their impact on protein structural dynamics and intracellular trafficking. Notably, we show that the lead compound, perfluorononanoic acid, is 106 times more potent in inducing non&#8208;native protein secondary structure in select proteins than is the well&#8208;known helix inducer trifluoroethanol, and also significantly enhances the cellular uptake of complexed proteins. These findings could advance the rational design of fluorinated proteins, inform on potential modes of toxicity for perfluoroalkyl substances, and guide the development of fluorine&#8208;modified biologics with desirable functional properties for drug discovery and delivery applications.

         <title>A Hairpin Ribozyme Derived Spliceozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hairpin ribozyme derived spliceozyme supports the removal of a defined segment (intron) out of a parent RNA and ligates the remaining fragments (exons). The intron then acts as a positive regulator of the activity of a bipartite DNAzyme.







Abstract
The vast majority of RNA splicing in today&#8216;s organisms is achieved by the highly regulated and precise removal of introns from pre&#8208;mRNAs via the spliceosome. Here we present a model of how RNA splicing may have occurred in earlier life forms. We have designed a hairpin ribozyme derived spliceozyme that mediates two RNA cleavages and one ligation event at specific positions and thus cuts a segment (intron) out of a parent RNA and ligates the remaining fragments (exons). The cut&#8208;out intron then performs a downstream function, acting as a positive regulator of the activity of a bipartite DNAzyme. This simple scenario shows how small RNAs can perform complex RNA processing dynamics, involving the generation of new phenotypes by restructuring segments of given RNA species, as well as delivering small RNAs that may play a functional role in downstream processes.

         <title>Advancing Multicomponent Strategies to Macrobicyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difficult but worthy. Peptide macrobicycles are more difficult to obtain than their monocyclic counterparts, but their remarkable biological applications make their synthesis worthwhile. This report describes solution and solid&#8208;phase strategies that rely on multicomponent reactions to assemble two dissimilar types of macrobicyclic peptide scaffolds. NMR and circular dichroism studies show they may occur in stable tertiary folds.







Abstract
Macrocyclization of peptides is typically used to fix specific bioactive conformations and improve their pharmacological properties. Recently, macrobicyclic peptides have received special attention owing to their capacity to mimic protein structures or be key components of peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Here, we describe the development of novel synthetic strategies for two distinctive types of peptide macrobicycles. A multicomponent macrocyclo&#8208;dimerization approach is introduced for the production of interconnected &#946;&#8208;turns, allowing two macrocyclic rings to be formed and dimerized in one pot. Also, an on&#8208;resin double stapling strategy is described for the assembly of lactam&#8208;bridged macrobicycles with stable tertiary folds.

         <title>Hydroxy Acid Activation in Fungal Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis Assessed by Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid activation in the adenylation domains of fungal, iterative non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases. The results suggest a stabilization of the substrate's hydroxy group by hydrogen bond formation via backbone carbonyls of two distinct residues. The substitution of a frequently apparent Pro residue adjacent to one of the carbonyls seems mandatory for adenylation.







Abstract
The fungal cyclodepsipeptides (CDPs) enniatin, beauvericin, bassianolide, and PF1022 consist of alternating N&#8208;methylated l&#8208;amino and d&#8208;hydroxy acids. They are synthesized by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). The amino acid and hydroxy acid substrates are activated by adenylation (A) domains. Although various A domains have been characterized thus giving insights into the mechanism of substrate conversion, little is known about the utilization of hydroxy acids in NRPSs. Therefore, we used homology modelling and molecular docking of the A1 domain of enniatin synthetase (EnSyn) to gain insights into the mechanism of hydroxy acid activation. We introduced point mutations into the active site and used a photometric assay to study the substrate activation. The results suggest that the hydroxy acid is selected by interaction with backbone carbonyls rather than by a specific side chain. These insights enhance the understanding of non&#8208;amino acid substrate activation and could contribute to the engineering of depsipeptide synthetases.

These insights enhance the understanding of non-amino acid substrate activation and could contribute to the engineering of depsipeptide synthetases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Independent Logical Regulation of the Assembly and Disassembly of DNA Polyhedra</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal, base&#8208;sequence&#8208;independent strategy for the logic controls of DNA self&#8208;assembly through external small molecules. The INHIBIT and XOR logic controls over DNA self&#8208;assembly, have been realized based on cystamine (Cyst) and ethylenediamine (EN) respectively, achieving a higher&#8208;level logic circuit of half subtractor.







Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembly of DNA nanostructures using rationally designed logic gates is a major goal of dynamic DNA nanotechnology, which could facilitate the development of biomedicine, molecular computation, et&#8197;al. In previous works, the regulations mostly relied on either toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement or stimuli&#8208;driven conformational switch, requiring elaborately&#8208;designed or specific DNA sequences. Herein, we reported a facile, base&#8208;sequence&#8208;independent strategy for logically controlling DNA self&#8208;assembly through external molecules. The INHIBIT and XOR logic controls over the assembly/disassembly of DNA polyhedra were realized through cystamine (Cyst) and ethylenediamine (EN) respectively, which were further integrated into a half subtractor circuit thanks to the sharing of the same inputs. Our work provides a sequence&#8208;independent strategy in logically controlling DNA self&#8208;assembly, which may open up new possibilities for dynamic DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Quinolyl&#8208;Based PGM Metallarectangles: Antiproliferative Activity, DNA and BSA Protein Interactions, and a Molecular Docking Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a different angle: We explored the incorporation of a quinolyl motif, ubiquitous to antimalarial chemotherapy, as part of PGM metallarectangles, intending to gain insight into the anticancer properties exemplified by this structure.







Abstract
The increased success of small metal&#8208;containing molecules as pharmaceutical agents has prompted investigations into the pharmacological activity of a different class of metal&#8208;based compounds; supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs). Such complexes have been extensively investigated for their anticancer activity, with many displaying activities comparable or superior to available clinical chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we evaluated a series of quinoline&#8208;containing binuclear complexes and metallarectangles for their in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity in the hormone receptor positive MCF&#8208;7 and triple negative MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cell lines. The preliminary cytotoxic screen, in the MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell line, revealed that the ligand (7&#8208;chloro&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)quinoline, L) and metallarectangle [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(Cp*)}4(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 display superior activity to cisplatin, while [{Ru(p&#8208;cymene)}4(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;C2O4)2(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 was more potent than cisplatin in the triple&#8208;negative MDA&#8208;MD&#8208;231&#8197;cell line. Upon evaluation in a multidose screen, ligand L and metallarectangle [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(Cp*)}4(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 displayed antiproliferative activity almost two&#8208;fold greater than cisplatin in the MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell line, while [{Ru(p&#8208;cymene)}4(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;C2O4)2(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 was over two&#8208;times more active than cisplatin in the MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line. Additionally, using the non&#8208;tumorigenic MCF&#8208;12&#8197;A breast epithelial cell line, the compounds demonstrate increased selectivity toward breast cancer cells over non&#8208;tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, investigations into the interactions of ligand L and selected complexes with calf thymus DNA (CT&#8208;DNA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) indicate favourable binding.

         <title>Boronic Acid Moieties Stabilize Adhesion of Microalgal Biofilms on Glassy Substrates: A Chemical Tool for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>

A biofilm of diatoms microalgae is stably anchored on glassy substrates by covalent boronic acid&#8208;diol condensation: it efficiently bioremediates seawater from heavy metals.







Abstract
Photosynthetic organisms such as diatoms microalgae provide innovative routes to eco&#8208;friendly technologies for environmental pollution bioremediation. Living diatoms are capable to incorporate in&#8197;vivo a wide variety of chemical species dispersed in seawater, thus being promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly removal of toxic contaminants. However, their exploitation requires immobilization methods that allow to confine microalgae during water treatment. Here we demonstrate that a biofilm of Phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom cells grown on the surface of a glassy substrate bearing boronic acid protruding moieties is stably anchored to the substrate resisting mechanical stress and it is suitable for removal of up to 80&#8201;% metal ions (As, Cr, Cu, Zn, Sn, Pb, Sb) in a model polluted water sample. Control experiments also suggest that stabilization of the biofilm adhesion occurs by interaction of boronic acid surface groups of the substrate with the hydroxyl groups of diatoms extracellular polysaccharides.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Validation Approach for Tools To Study the DNA Repair Enzyme SNM1A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step validation approach can evaluate metal&#8208;binding groups that are suitable for targeting the active site of the DNA damage&#8208;repair enzyme SNM1A. A fragment&#8208;based screening approach first identified metal&#8208;binding fragments suitable for targeting the enzyme. Effective fragments were then incorporated into oligonucleotides using a CuAAC reaction; the modified oligonucleotides showed effective recognition by SNM1A.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step validation approach to evaluate the suitability of metal&#8208;binding groups for targeting DNA damage&#8208;repair metalloenzymes using model enzyme SNM1A. A fragment&#8208;based screening approach was first used to identify metal&#8208;binding fragments suitable for targeting the enzyme. Effective fragments were then incorporated into oligonucleotides using the copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. These modified oligonucleotides were recognised by SNM1A at &gt;1000&#8208;fold lower concentrations than their fragment counterparts. The exonuclease SNM1A is a key enzyme involved in the repair of interstrand crosslinks, a highly cytotoxic form of DNA damage. However, SNM1A and other enzymes of this class are poorly understood, as there is a lack of tools available to facilitate their study. Our novel approach of incorporating functional fragments into oligonucleotides is broadly applicable to generating modified oligonucleotide structures with high affinity for DNA damage&#8208;repair enzymes.

         <title>Probing Tyrosine Nitration with a Small TbIII&#8208;Metallopeptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine nitration has been suggested as a regulatory mechanism of signal transduction. Here we describe a TbIII&#8208;metallopeptide whose luminescence response after peroxynitrite treatment is directly related to the degree of tyrosine nitration. Importantly, the luminescence changes after nitration are not affected in a complex biological medium, thus making it a promising tool for studying this protein modification.







Abstract
Tyrosine nitration, a post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) that takes place under nitrosative stress conditions, occurs through a non&#8208;enzymatic peroxynitrite&#8208;mediated reaction. Although protein nitration has long been considered an irreversible PTM involved in nitrosative stress&#8208;associated diseases, it has also been suggested to be a regulatory mechanism of signal transduction. Therefore, the development of tools that help to understand this protein modification is of great interest. Herein, we explore a TbIII&#8208;chelating metallopeptide to monitor tyrosine nitration. The luminescence of this probe decreases significantly between its non&#8208;nitrated and nitrated states, and this reduction in the luminescence intensity is directly related to the degree of tyrosine nitration after treatment with peroxynitrite. Remarkably, the luminescence intensity changes after nitration are not affected in the presence of complex biological media, which makes it a promising tool for understanding this protein modification.

         <title>Front Cover: Constraining and Modifying Peptides Using Pd&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Allylation (ChemBioChem 13/2023)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;mediated cysteine allylation allows to constrain and rigidify peptides by linking two cysteine side chains with a large set of easily available stapling reagents. The staple itself can be further functionalized based on its inherent reactivity thereby allowing construction of a large variety of solid peptides. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. F. W. Becker et al.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Metabolite Interactions: Discovery and Significance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of protein function upon metabolite binding is a key mechanism driving cellular physiology. In this review, we examine major technological advances that have enabled the discovery of global cellular metabolite&#8208;interacting proteomes with special emphasis on mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic platforms, and discuss the ramifications of these discoveries on drug development.







Abstract
Metabolites orchestrate cellular processes as either substrates, co&#8208;enzymes, inhibitors, or activators of cellular proteins such as enzymes and receptors. Although traditional biochemical and structural biology&#8208;based approaches have been successfully employed for the discovery of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions, they often fail to detect transient and low&#8208;affinity biomolecular relationships. Another limitation of these approaches is that they are performed under in vitro conditions lacking the physiological context. Recently developed mass spectrometry&#8208;based methodologies overcome both these shortcomings, and have resulted in the discovery of global protein&#8208;metabolite cellular interaction networks. Herein, we describe traditional and modern approaches for the discovery of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions, and discuss the impact of these discoveries on our understanding of cellular physiology and on drug development.

         <title>Glycosphingolipid and Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Affect Each Other in and on the Cell</title>

Double act: Glycosphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositols are compartmentalized in the lipid rafts of the cell membrane to interact with each other and with other molecules and so play a critical role in many biological events.







Abstract
Glycosphingolipid (GSL) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) are the two major glycolipids expressed by eukaryotic cells, and their metabolisms share the same machineries. Moreover, both GSLs and GPI&#8208;anchored proteins (GPI&#8208;APs) are localized in the cholesterol&#8208;rich regions, namely the lipid rafts, of the cell membrane, where many other signaling molecules are compartmentalized as well. Therefore, the interaction between GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs and their interactions with other molecules in the lipid rafts are inevitable. This review is focused on the influences of GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs on each other's biosynthesis, trafficking, cell membrane distribution, and biological functions, such as signal transduction.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of deep learning shows great promise for drug discovery, from predicting protein structures to designing ligands de novo. AI for structure&#8208;based drug discovery has the potential to tackle unsolved challenges, such as predicting ligand affinity for unexplored protein targets and navigating uncharted regions in the chemical space. This review delves into cutting&#8208;edge deep&#8208;learning concepts for structure&#8208;based drug discovery and explores the exciting applications, opportunities, and challenges that lie ahead.







Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of deep learning has promise for drug discovery and chemical biology, for example, to predict protein structure and molecular bioactivity, plan organic synthesis, and design molecules de novo. While most of the deep learning efforts in drug discovery have focused on ligand&#8208;based approaches, structure&#8208;based drug discovery has the potential to tackle unsolved challenges, such as affinity prediction for unexplored protein targets, binding&#8208;mechanism elucidation, and the rationalization of related chemical kinetic properties. Advances in deep&#8208;learning methodologies and the availability of accurate predictions for protein tertiary structure advocate for a renaissance in structure&#8208;based approaches for drug discovery guided by AI. This review summarizes the most prominent algorithmic concepts in structure&#8208;based deep learning for drug discovery, and forecasts opportunities, applications, and challenges ahead.

         <title>Taking Synthetic Biology to the Seas: From Blue Chassis Organisms to Marine Aquaforming</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marine bacteria have recently been established as chassis organisms for synthetic biology. Their unique capabilities for sustainable bioproduction and large&#8208;scale bioremediation are summarized in this review, and recent advances in genetic tool development, use of marine raw materials, and emerging technologies for aquaforming are highlighted.







Abstract
Oceans cover 71&#8201;% of Earth's surface and are home to hundreds of thousands of species, many of which are microbial. Knowledge about marine microbes has strongly increased in the past decades due to global sampling expeditions, and hundreds of detailed studies on marine microbial ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry. However, the translation of this knowledge into biotechnological applications or synthetic biology approaches using marine microbes has been limited so far.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oceans cover 71&#8201;% of Earth's surface and are home to hundreds of thousands of species, many of which are microbial. Knowledge about marine microbes has strongly increased in the past decades due to global sampling expeditions, and hundreds of detailed studies on marine microbial ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry. However, the translation of this knowledge into biotechnological applications or synthetic biology approaches using marine microbes has been limited so far. This review highlights key examples of marine bacteria in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and outlines possible future work based on the emerging marine chassis organisms &lt;i&gt;Vibrio natriegens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Halomonas bluephagenesis&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the valorization of algal polysaccharides by genetically enhanced microbes is presented as an example of the opportunities and challenges associated with blue biotechnology. Finally, new roles for marine synthetic biology in tackling pressing global challenges, including climate change and marine pollution, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Computing for Molecular Biology
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A road map for quantum computing in molecular biology with a potentially ground&#8208;breaking quantum advantage is presented. Key concepts are introduced to connect the terminology of biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science that are all relevant for this transdisciplinary endeavor. Molecular simulations of biochemical reactions are the most promising target, but quantum computing might also benefit data&#8208;driven approaches and structure prediction of biomacromolecules.







Abstract
Molecular biology and biochemistry interpret microscopic processes in the living world in terms of molecular structures and their interactions, which are quantum mechanical by their very nature. Whereas the theoretical foundations of these interactions are well established, the computational solution of the relevant quantum mechanical equations is very hard. However, much of molecular function in biology can be understood in terms of classical mechanics, where the interactions of electrons and nuclei have been mapped onto effective classical surrogate potentials that model the interaction of atoms or even larger entities. The simple mathematical structure of these potentials offers huge computational advantages; however, this comes at the cost that all quantum correlations and the rigorous many&#8208;particle nature of the interactions are omitted. In this work, we discuss how quantum computation may advance the practical usefulness of the quantum foundations of molecular biology by offering computational advantages for simulations of biomolecules. We not only discuss typical quantum mechanical problems of the electronic structure of biomolecules in this context, but also consider the dominating classical problems (such as protein folding and drug design) as well as data&#8208;driven approaches of bioinformatics and the degree to which they might become amenable to quantum simulation and quantum computation.

         <title>Development of a Novel Tool To Demystify Drug Distribution at Tissue&#8208;Blood Barriers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 13, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blood&#8208;tissue barriers directly affect the efficacy and toxicity of small&#8208;molecule drugs, and yet the chemical logic of these barriers remains largely enigmatic. Here we curate/reconcile in&#8208;vivo literature data on 73 drugs across four mouse models of barrier function. This dataset enables visualization and computational analyses on the tissue&#8208;distribution of clinical drugs.







Abstract
Tissue endothelial cells express ABC&#8208;transporter enzymes that change the concentration of small molecules within different tissue compartments. These &#8220;blood&#8208;tissue barriers&#8221; have been shown to directly affect the efficacy and toxicity of anticancer, antimicrobial, psychiatric, and anti&#8208;epileptic drugs. Currently this phenomenon is best studied for the blood&#8208;brain barrier, but remains enigmatic for most other tissues. In addition, canonical pharmacokinetic theory specifically assumes an equal concentration of free drug within all tissue compartments. Inspired by Lipinski's &#8220;rule of 5,&#8221; we here clarify current knowledge on drug&#8211;tissue distribution by: 1)&#8197;curating the in&#8208;vivo literature on 73 drugs across 23 tissues and 2)&#8197;developing two graphical web&#8208;based applications to visually describe and interpret data. These curated in&#8208;vivo dataset and visualization tools enabled us to achieve new insights into the logic of the barrier&#8208;tissue organization and showed remarkable correspondence to whole&#8208;body imaging of radiolabeled molecules.

         <title>Detection and Imaging of Active Substances in Early Atherosclerotic Lesions Using Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to its excellent performance, fluorescence detection and imaging can be designed to detect the abnormal expression of active substances and other biological targets in the early stages of disease. In this review, we summarize the latest research on the detection and imaging of early atherosclerosis, and discuss current challenges and potential future directions.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis (AS) is a vascular disease caused by chronic inflammation and lipids that is the main cause of myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is often difficult to detect in its early stages due to the absence of clinically significant vascular stenosis. This is not conducive to early intervention or treatment of the disease. Over the past decade, researchers have developed various imaging methods for the detection and imaging of atherosclerosis. At the same time, more and more biomarkers are being found that can be used as targets for detecting atherosclerosis. Therefore, the development of a variety of imaging methods and a variety of targeted imaging probes is an important project to achieve early assessment and treatment of atherosclerosis. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optical probes used to detect and target atherosclerosis imaging in recent years, and describes the current challenges and future development directions.

         <title>Noncovalent Association Thermodynamics of Turn&#8208;on Fluorescent Probes with Human Serum Albumin: Dual&#8208;concentration Ratio Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient quantification of the affinity of a drug and the targeted protein is critical for strategic drug design. Among the various molecules, turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes are the most promising signal transducers to reveal the binding strength and site&#8208;specificity of designed drugs. However, the conventional method of measuring the binding ability of turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes using the fractional occupancy under the law of mass action is time&#8208;consuming and a massive sample is required. Here, we report a new method, called dual&#8208;concentration ratio method, for quantifying the binding affinity of fluorescent probes and human serum albumin (HSA). Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity ratios of a one&#8208;to&#8208;one complex (L&#183;HSA) for a turn&#8208;on fluorescent probe (L), e.g., ThT (thioflavin T) or DG (dansylglycine), with HSA at two different values of [L]0/[HSA]0 under the constraint [HSA]0 &gt; [L]0 were collected. The van&#8217;t Hoff analysis on these association constants further resulted in the thermodynamic properties. Since only two samples at different [L]0/[HSA]0 are required without the need of [L]0/[HSA]0 at a wide range, the dual&#8208;concentration ratio method is an easy way to greatly reduce the amounts of fluorescent probes and proteins, as well as the acquisition time.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of a Synthetic Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired [4Fe4S]&#8208;Peptide Maquette as the Redox Partner for a [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8216;Bacterial&#8208;type&#8217; ferredoxins host a cubane [4Fe4S]2+/+ cluster that enables these proteins to mediate electron transfer and facilitate a broad range of biological processes. Peptide maquettes based on the conserved cluster&#8208;forming motif have previously been reported and used to model the ferredoxins. Herein we explore the integration of a [4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquette into a H2&#8208;powered electron transport chain. While routinely formed under anaerobic conditions, we illustrate by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis that these maquettes can be reconstituted under aerobic conditions by using photoactivated NADH to reduce the cluster at 240 K. Attempts to tune the redox properties of the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster by introducing an Fe&#8208;coordinating selenocysteine residue were also explored. To demonstrate the integration of these artificial metalloproteins into a semi&#8208;synthetic electron transport chain, we utilize a ferredoxin&#8208;inspired [4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquette as the redox partner in the hydrogenase&#8208;mediated oxidation of H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum and Palladium Compounds: Disrupting the Ergosterol Pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current treatment for Chagas&#8217; disease is based on two drugs, Nifurtimox and Benznidazol, which have limitations that reduce the effectiveness and continuity of treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new safe and effective drugs. In previous work, two new metal&#8208;based compounds with trypanocidal activity, Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo, were fully characterized. To unravel the mechanism of action of these two analogous metal&#8208;based drugs, high throughput omics studies were performed. A multimodal mechanism of action was postulated with several candidates as molecular targets. In this work, we validated the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway as a target for these compounds through the determination of sterol levels in treated parasites. Moving forward in the attempt to understand the molecular level at which these compounds participate, two enzymes that met eligibility criteria at different levels were selected for further studies: phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) and lanosterol 14&#8208;&#945; demethylase (CYP51). Molecular docking processes were carried out to search for potential sites of interaction for both enzymes. To validate these candidates, a gain&#8208;of&#8208;function strategy was used, through the generation of overexpressing PMK and CYP51 parasites. Results here presented confirm that the mechanism of action of Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo compounds involves the inhibition of both enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Highway Patrol for Ribosome Collisions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During translation, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are decoded by ribosomes which can stall for various reasons. These include chemical damage, codon composition, starvation, or translation inhibition. Trailing ribosomes can collide with stalled ribosomes, potentially leading to dysfunctional or toxic proteins. Such aberrant proteins can form aggregates and favor diseases, especially neurodegeneration. To prevent this, both eukaryotes and bacteria have evolved different pathways to remove faulty nascent peptides, mRNAs and defective ribosomes from the collided complex. In eukaryotes, ubiquitin ligases play central roles in triggering downstream responses and several complexes have been characterized that split affected ribosomes and facilitate degradation of the various components. As collided ribosomes signal translation stress to affected cells, in eukaryotes additional stress response pathways are triggered when collisions are sensed. These pathways inhibit translation and modulate cell survival and immune responses. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge about rescue and stress response pathways triggered by ribosome collisions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here, we describe a novel method for the on&#8208;DNA synthesis of cyclic imides, an important class of molecules that includes several well&#8208;known medications. Significantly, the new method enabled on&#8208;DNA synthesis under mild conditions with high conversions and a broad functional group tolerance, utilizing ubiquitous bifunctional amines and bis&#8208;carboxylic acid, or alkyl halides, and therefore served as the linchpin for DEL synthesis. The mechanism study of off&#8208;DNA and on&#8208;DNA chemical transformations revealed unique insights in contrast to conventional chemical transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Enzyme Cascade for Efficient Production of L&#8208;2&#8208;Aminobutyrate from L&#8208;Threonine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a pathway for the synthesis of L&#8208;ABA in a tri&#8208;enzymatic cascade in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using L&#8208;Thr, and the expression of three enzymes was optimized by vector design. We solved the crystal structure of the key enzyme LDH and proposed protein engineering strategies based on the structure to improve the catalytic activity of the enzyme.







Abstract
L&#8208;2&#8208;aminobutyrate (L&#8208;ABA) is an important chiral drug intermediate with a key role in modern medicinal chemistry. Here, we describe the development of an efficient method for the asymmetric synthesis of L&#8208;ABA in a tri&#8208;enzymatic cascade in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using a cost&#8208;effective L&#8208;Thr. Low activity of leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus thuringiensis (BtLDH) and unbalanced expression of enzymes in the cascade were major challenges. Mechanism&#8208;based protein engineering generated the optimal triple variant BtLDHM3(A262S/V296C/P150M) with 20.7&#8208;fold increased specific activity and 9.6&#8208;fold increased kcat/Km compared with the wild type. Optimizing plasmids with different copy numbers regulated enzymatic expression, thereby increasing the activity ratio (0.3&#8201;:&#8201;1:0.6) of these enzymes in&#8197;vivo close to the optimal ratio (0.4&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1) in&#8197;vitro. Importing the optimal triple mutant BtLDHM3 into our constructed pathway in&#8197;vivo and optimization of transformation conditions achieved one&#8208;pot conversion of L&#8208;Thr to 130.2&#8197;g/L L&#8208;ABA, with 95&#8201;% conversion, 99&#8201;% e.e. and 10.9&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 productivity (the highest to date) in 12&#8197;h on a 500&#8197;mL scale. These results describe a potential biosynthesis approach for the industrial production of L&#8208;ABA.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Modulation of Protein Lipidation: From Chemical Probes to Therapeutics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins can be covalently modified by different types of lipids. The deregulation of protein lipidation has been implicated in various human diseases. This paper reviews the recent progress in small&#8208;molecule targeting of protein lipidation and highlights its therapeutic opportunities.







Abstract
Protein lipidation is a widespread modification that regulates protein subcellular localization, structure and function. Dysregulation of protein lipidation has been implicated in various human diseases, including neurological disorders, infectious diseases and cancers. Thus lipid&#8208;modifying enzymes and their substrate proteins are emerging as attractive drug targets. The development of small&#8208;molecule modulators of protein lipidation has remarkably impacted our understanding of lipid&#8208;modification biology and potential therapeutics. In this review, we summarize recent progress in small&#8208;molecule targeting of protein lipidation and highlight therapeutic opportunities.

         <title>Recent Progress on Cyclic Peptides&#8217; Assembly and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review looks at how, as gelators, cyclic peptides can self&#8208;assemble to form nanotubes or even higher&#8208;order assemblies. They can also form cylindrical structures by conjugation with polymers. The assembled structures represent important platforms for drug delivery or function as nanomedicine themselves when triggered by certain stimuli.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are important building blocks for forming functional structures and have been applied in various fields. Considering the significant structural and functional roles of cyclic peptides in materials science and the attributed biophysical advantages, we provide an overview of cyclic peptide types that can self&#8208;assemble to form nanotubes, recent progress in stimuli&#8208;triggered cyclic peptide assembly, and methods to construct peptide and polymer conjugates based on cyclic peptides with alternative chirality. Specifically, we highlight the roles that stimuli&#8208;triggered cyclic peptides and their conjugates play in biomedical applications. Recent progress in other cyclic peptides acting as gelators in drug delivery and biomedicine are also summarized. These cyclic peptides with self&#8208;assembly properties are expected to act as adaptive systems for drug delivery and selective disease targeting.

Recent progress in other cyclic peptides acting as gelators in drug delivery and biomedicine are also summarized. These cyclic peptides with self-assembly properties are expected to act as adaptive systems for drug delivery and selective disease targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mitochondrial detection of hypochlorite using NIR emitting, water&#8208;soluble, cationic probe with distinct color demarcation







Abstract
Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is critical for maintaining immune system balance, but it can harm mitochondria by hindering enzyme activity, leading to decreased ATP and increased cell death. In this study, we have designed a fluorophore with a pyridinium scaffold for selective staining of the mitochondria and to detect hypochlorite. The fluorophore exhibits strong solvatochromic emission due to intramolecular charge transfer and excellent sub&#8208;cellular localization in the mitochondria. Additionally, it shows a rapid response to HOCl with high selectivity among different reactive oxygen/nitrogen compounds with a detection limit of 2.31&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, it is also utilized for the exogenous and endogenous detection of HOCl in live cells, which may help study the role of hypochlorite in organelles at the cellular level. DFT and TDDFT calculations have been carried out to understand the relationship between the structure and properties of the cationic probes with respect to the &#945;&#8208;cyano substitution and extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The selective detection of HOCl by C4 over other cationic probes has also been well&#8208;demonstrated, showing how the binding of HOCl affects the electronic properties of C4 through the analysis of non&#8208;bonding orbitals (NBO) population, electrostatic potential surface (ESP), and density of states (DOS) projected DOS investigations.

         <title>A Protonated Cytidine Stabilizes the Ligand&#8208;Binding Pocket in the PreQ1 Riboswitch in Thermophilic Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Riboswitches regulate the expression of bacterial genes in response to small molecular metabolites. In thermophilic bacteria these RNA structures have to withstand extreme temperatures. Here we show that a protonated cytidine nucleotide, as part of an intricate hydrogen bond network, is essential in maintaining the functional conformation of a preQ1&#8208;riboswitch from the thermophilic bacterium T. tencongensis.







Abstract
Riboswitches are bacterial mRNA structure elements regulating either transcription or translation of downstream genes in response to high&#8208;affinity binding of a low molecular weight ligand. Among this diverse group of RNA structures, the class&#8208;I preQ1 sensing riboswitches (QSW) stand out since they are the smallest known natural riboswitches. The preQ1 sensing riboswitches combine ligand sensing and functional control within a single structural domain that adopts a pseudoknot conformation encapsulating both the cognate ligand and the ribosome binding site. preQ1 sensing riboswitches also occur in thermophilic bacteria. In these cases, their tertiary structures have to be stable even at temperatures above 60&#8201;&#176;C to be functional at the organism's optimal growth temperatures. Despite the available high&#8208;resolution structures of these riboswitches, it is not yet understood which tertiary interactions are primarily responsible for their exceptional temperature stability. Here, we show that an intricate three&#8208;dimensional network of non&#8208;canonical interactions involving various non&#8208;neighboring nucleobases is the origin of the riboswitch's thermostability. An essential part of this network is a so far undetected stably protonated cytidine. It is characterized by an exceptional high pKA value of &gt;9.7 and could be unambiguously identified through the application of modern heteronuclear detected NMR experiments. Thus, the presence or absence of a single proton can modulate the formation of an RNA tertiary structure and ligand binding capacity under extreme environmental conditions.

         <title>Chemical Zymogens: Specificity and Steroidal Control of Reactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical zymogens are to proteins what prodrugs are to small molecule drugs. This notion is developed herein on the example of papain, a cysteine protease. A disulfide&#8208;based chemical zymogen for papain was protected from thiol poisons and could be reactivated on demand to initiate proteolysis. Specificity of reactivation is achieved through engineered affinity between the activator thiol and the zymogen.







Abstract
Activating and masking enzymatic activity on demand is of the highest importance in nature. It is achieved by chemical interconversion of enzymes and the corresponding zymogens through, for example, proteolytic processing or reversible phosphorylation, and affords on&#8208;demand activation of enzymes, controlled in space and/or time. In stark contrast, examples of chemical zymogens are very few, and in most cases these are based on disulfide chemistry, which is largely indiscriminate as to the nature of the activating thiol. In this work, we address an outstanding challenge of specificity of reactivation of chemical zymogens. We achieve this through engineering affinity between the chemical zymogen and the activator. Additional, higher&#8208;level control over zymogen reactivation is installed in a nature&#8208;mimicking approach using steroidal hormones. Taken together, the results of this study take a step towards establishing the specificity of reactivation of synthetic, chemical zymogens. We anticipate that the results of this study will contribute significantly to the development of chemical zymogens as tools for diverse use in chemical biology and biotechnology.

         <title>Refining the Dynamic Network of T2SS Endopilus Tip Heterocomplex Combining cw&#8208;EPR and Nitroxide&#8211;GdIII Distance Measurements</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We applied cw&#8208;EPR experiments and DEER measurements with orthogonally spin&#8208;labelled systems to probe dynamics processes in the assembly of the hetero&#8208;tetrameric complex located at the tip of the T2SS endopilus core. This spectroscopic approach appeared particularly appropriate to studying the structural movements and conformational changes occurring during the formation of such heteroprotein complexes.







Abstract
The type 2 secretion system (T2SS) is a bacterial nanomachine composed of an inner membrane assembly platform, an outer membrane pore and a dynamic endopilus. T2SS endopili are organized into a homo&#8208;multimeric body formed by the major pilin capped by a heterocomplex of four minor pilins. The first model of the T2SS endopilus was recently released, even if structural dynamics insights are still required to decipher the role of each protein in the full tetrameric complex. Here, we applied continuous&#8208;wave and pulse EPR spectroscopy using nitroxide&#8208;gadolinium orthogonal labelling strategies to investigate the hetero&#8208;oligomeric assembly of the minor pilins. Overall, our data are in line with the endopilus model even if they evidenced conformational flexibility and alternative orientations at local scale of specific regions of minor pilins. The integration of different labelling strategies and EPR experiments demonstrates the pertinence of this approach to investigate protein&#8211;protein interactions in such multiprotein heterocomplexes.

Towards mechanistic characterization: Chemoproteomic profiling of the electrophilic natural alkaloid dankastatin&#8197;B, which has antiproliferative effects against breast cancer cells, shows C65 of the mitochondrial pore&#8208;forming protein VDAC3 to be a target.







Abstract
Chlorinated gymnastatin and dankastatin alkaloids derived from the fungal strain Gymnascella dankaliensis have been reported to possess significant anticancer activity but their mode of action is unknown. These members possess electrophilic functional groups that can might undergo covalent bond formation with specific proteins to exert their biological activity. To better understand the mechanism of action of this class of natural products, we mapped the proteome&#8208;wide cysteine reactivity of the most potent of these alkaloids, dankastatin&#8197;B, by using activity&#8208;based protein profiling chemoproteomic approaches. We identified a primary target of dankastatin&#8197;B in breast cancer cells as cysteine C65 of the voltage&#8208;dependent anion&#8208;selective channel on the outer mitochondrial membrane VDAC3. We demonstrated direct and covalent interaction of dankastatin&#8197;B with VDAC3. VDAC3 knockdown conferred hypersensitivity to dankastatin&#8197;B&#8208;mediated antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cells, thus indicating that VDAC3 was at least partially involved in the anticancer effects of this natural product. Our study reveals a potential mode of action of dankastatin&#8197;B through covalent targeting of VDAC3 and highlights the utility of chemoproteomic approaches in gaining mechanistic understanding of electrophilic natural products.

         <title>Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel urushiol derivatives as potentclass I histone deacetylase inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present study, a novel series of 11 urushiol&#8208;based hydroxamic acid histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Compounds 1&#8208;11 exhibited good to excellent inhibitory activities against HDAC1/2/3 (IC50: 42.09&#8211;240.17 nM) and HDAC8 (IC50: 16.11&#8211;41.15 nM) in vitro, with negligible activity against HDAC6 (&gt;1409.59 nM). Considering HDAC8, docking experiments revealed some important features contributing to inhibitory activity. According to western blot analysis, select compounds could notably enhance the acetylation of histone H3 and SMC3 but not&#8208;tubulin, indicating their privileged structure is appropriate for targeting class I HDACs. Furthermore, antiproliferation assays revealed that six compounds exerted greater in vitro antiproliferative activity against four human cancer cell lines (A2780, HT&#8208;29, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, and HepG2, with IC50 values ranging from 2.31&#8211;5.13 &#181;M) than suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; administration of these compounds induced marked apoptosis in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Collectively, specific synthesized compounds could be further optimized and biologically explored as antitumor agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Immobilization of a Multi&#8208;Enzyme Cascade: (S)&#8208;Selective Amine Transaminases, L&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase and Catalase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enzyme cascade was established previously consisting of a recycling system with an l&#8208;amino acid oxidase (hcLAAO4) and a catalase (hCAT) for different &#945;&#8208;keto acid co&#8208;substrates of (S)&#8208;selective amine transaminases (ATAs) in kinetic resolutions of racemic amines. Only 1&#160;mol% of the co&#8208;substrate was required and l&#8208;amino acids instead of &#945;&#8208;keto acids could be applied. However, soluble enzymes cannot be reused easily. Immobilization of hcLAAO4, hCAT and the (S)&#8208;selective ATA from Vibrio fluvialis (ATA&#8208;Vfl) was addressed here. Immobilization of the enzymes together rather than on separate beads showed higher reaction rates most likely due to fast co&#8208;substrate channeling between ATA&#8208;Vfl and hcLAAO4 due to their close proximity. Co&#8208;immobilization allowed further reduction of the co&#8208;substrate amount to 0.1&#160;mol% most likely due to a more efficient H2O2&#8208;removal caused by the stabilized hCAT and its proximity to hcLAAO4. Finally, the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade was reused in 3 cycles of preparative kinetic resolutions to produce (R)&#8208;1&#8208;PEA with high enantiomeric purity (97.3%ee). Further recycling was inefficient due to the instability of ATA&#8208;Vfl, while hcLAAO4 and hCAT revealed a high stability. An engineered ATA&#8208;Vfl&#8208;8M was used in the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade to produce (R)&#8208;1&#8208;(3&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)ethanamine, an apremilast&#8208;intermediate, with a 1,000 fold lower input of the co&#8208;substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule AIEgens for Illuminating Sub&#8208;Cellular Endoplasmic Reticulum, Mitochondria and Lysosomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organelles are the working hubs of the cells. Hence, visualizing these organelles inside the cells is highly important for understanding their roles in pathological states and development of therapeutic strategies. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly substituted oxazoles with modular scaffolds (AIE&#8208;ER, AIE&#8208;Mito and AIE&#8208;Lyso) which can home into endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and lysosomes inside the cells. These oxazoles showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water and in solid state due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding which was confirmed by the pH and temperature dependent fluorescence studies followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Confocal laser scanning microscopy studies revealed that AIE&#8208;ER, AIE&#8208;Mito and AIE&#8208;Lyso efficiently homed into ER, mitochondria and lysosomes respectively in the HeLa cervical cancer cells and non&#8208;cancerous human retinal pigment epithelial RPE&#8208;1 cells within 3h without showing any toxicity to the cells with high sub&#8208;cellular photostability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of highly substituted oxazole&#8208;based small molecule AIEgens for organelle imaging. We anticipate these novel AIEgens have promise to image sub&#8208;cellular organelles in different diseased states as well as understanding the inter&#8208;organelle interactions towards the development of novel therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capmatinib is an FDA approved drug to treat metastatic non&#8208;small cell lung cancer with MET&#8208;exon 14 skipping. Herein, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group, which possesses nine chemically identical fluorine atoms, was introduced on Capmatinib to afford a targeted 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group&#8208;derived Capmatinib (9F&#8208;CAP). The 19F MRI concentration limit was found 25 mM in FLASH sequence. The molecular docking simulation, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (with a Kd of 40.7 &#956;M), half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (with a IC50 of 168 nM), Annexin V, and cytotoxicity assays jointly demonstrated that the 9F&#8208;CAP targeted cMET protein specifically. Therefore, the targeted imaging capability of 9F&#8208;CAP is of great significance for the preoperative diagnosis of specific cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Metal&#8208;Based Candidate Drugs as Modulators of the Cytoskeleton</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During recent years, accumulating evidence suggested that metal&#8208;based candidate drugs are promising modulators of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton&#8208;associated proteins. This was substantiated by the identification and validation of actin, vimentin and plectin as targets of distinct ruthenium(II)&#8211; and platinum(II)&#8208;based modulators. Despite this, structural information about the molecular interaction is scarcely available. Here, we compile the scattered reports about metal&#8208;based candidate molecules that influence the cytoskeleton, its associated proteins and explore their potential to interfere in cancer&#8208;related processes, including proliferation, invasion and the epithelial&#8208;to&#8208;mesenchymal transition. Advances in this field depend crucially on determining binding sites and on gaining comprehensive insight into the molecular drug&#8208;target interactions. These are key steps towards establishing yet elusive structure&#8208;activity relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Prodrug Chemistries for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs are pharmacologically inactive, chemically modified derivatives of active drugs, which, following in vivo administration, is converted to the parent drugs through chemical or enzymatic cleavage. The prodrug approach holds tremendous potential to create the enhanced version of an existing pharmacological agent and leverage those improvements to augment the drug molecules' bioavailability, targeting ability, therapeutic&#8208;efficacy, safety, and marketability. Especially in cancer therapy, prodrug application has received substantial attention. A prodrug can effectively broaden the therapeutic window of its parent drug by enhancing its release at targeted tumor&#8208;sites while reducing its access to healthy cells. The spatiotemporally controlled&#8208;release can be achieved by manipulating the chemical, physical, or biological stimuli present at the targeted tumor site. The critical strategy comprises of drug&#8208;carrier linkages that respond to physiological or biochemical stimuli in the tumor milieu to yield the active drug form. This review will focus on the recent advancements in development of various fluorophore&#8208;drug conjugates that are widely used for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery. The use of different stimuli&#8208;cleavable linkers and the mechanisms of linker cleavage will be discussed. Finally, the review will conclude with a critical discussion on the prospects and challenges that might impede the future development of such prodrugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surfaceome Profiling Identifies Basigin&#8208;Chaperoned Protein Clients</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfaceome proximity labeling method allowed for proteomic profiling of cell surface proteins. In Bsg but not in Nptn deficient cell lines, we detected the specific reduction of MCT1 and MCT4 at the cell surface, while the rest of the surfaceome remained relatively unchanged. This emphasizes Bsg's role as a specific chaperone for MCTs within the cell.







Abstract
The surface proteome or &#8220;surfaceome&#8221; is a critical mediator of cellular biology, facilitating cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell interactions and communication with extracellular biomolecules. Constituents of the surfaceome can serve as biomarkers for changing cell states and as targets for pharmacological intervention. While some pathways of cell surface trafficking are well characterized to allow prediction of surface localization, some non&#8208;canonical trafficking mechanisms do not. Basigin (Bsg), a cell surface glycoprotein, has been shown to chaperone protein clients to the cell surface. However, understanding which proteins are served by Bsg is not always straightforward. To accelerate such identification, we applied a surfaceome proximity labeling method that is integrated with quantitative mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics to discern changes in the surfaceome of hepatic stellate cells that occur in response to the genetic loss of Bsg. Using this strategy, we observed that the loss of Bsg leads to corresponding reductions in the cell surface expression of monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4. We also found that these relationships were unique to Bsg and not found in neuroplastin (Nptn), a related family member. These results establish the utility of the surfaceome proximity labeling method to determine clients of cell surface chaperone proteins.

         <title>A Clickable Photosystem I, Ferredoxin, and Ferredoxin NADP+ Reductase Fusion System for Light&#8208;Driven NADPH Regeneration
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clickable PSI. PSI&#8722;Im7 was used with free Fd and FNR (FPS system) or coupled to E7&#8722;Fd (bipartite system) and E7&#8722;Fd&#8722;FNR (tripartite system) via the E7&#8722;Im7 affinity system for continuous regeneration of NADPH.







Abstract
Photosynthetic organisms like plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use light for the regeneration of dihydronicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The process starts with the light&#8208;driven oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII) and the released electrons are transferred via the cytochrome b6f complex towards photosystem I (PSI). This membrane protein complex is responsible for the light&#8208;driven reduction of the soluble electron mediator ferredoxin (Fd), which passes the electrons to ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR). Finally, NADPH is regenerated by FNR at the end of the electron transfer chain. In this study, we established a clickable fusion system for in&#8197;vitro NADPH regeneration with PSI&#8722;Fd and PSI&#8722;Fd&#8722;FNR, respectively. For this, we fused immunity protein 7 (Im7) to the C&#8208;terminus of the PSI&#8722;PsaE subunit in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Furthermore, colicin DNase E7 (E7) fusion chimeras of Fd and FNR with varying linker domains were expressed in Escherichia coli. Isolated Im7&#8722;PSI was coupled with the E7&#8722;Fd or E7&#8722;Fd&#8722;FNR fusion proteins through high&#8208;affinity binding of the E7/Im7 protein pair. The corresponding complexes were tested for NADPH regeneration capacity in comparison to the free protein systems demonstrating the general applicability of the strategy.

         <title>Rieske Oxygenases and Other Ferredoxin&#8208;Dependent Enzymes: Electron Transfer Principles and Catalytic Capabilities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the spotlight! Ferredoxin&#8208;dependent enzymes often rely on a complicated electron&#8208;transfer chain to enable the catalysis of challenging chemical reactions. In this review, we showcase several Fd&#8208;dependent enzymes and their potential biocatalytic applications, while particularly focusing on Rieske oxygenases as a class of enzymes with huge application potential in synthetic organic chemistry that are nonetheless still not very well understood.







Abstract
Enzymes that depend on sophisticated electron transfer via ferredoxins (Fds) exhibit outstanding catalytic capabilities, but despite decades of research, many of them are still not well understood or exploited for synthetic applications. This review aims to provide a general overview of the most important Fd&#8208;dependent enzymes and the electron transfer processes involved. While several examples are discussed, we focus in particular on the family of Rieske non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent oxygenases (ROs). In addition to illustrating their electron transfer principles and catalytic potential, the current state of knowledge on structure&#8211;function relationships and the mode of interaction between the redox partner proteins is reviewed. Moreover, we highlight several key catalyzed transformations, but also take a deeper dive into their engineerability for biocatalytic applications. The overall findings from these case studies highlight the catalytic capabilities of these biocatalysts and could stimulate future interest in developing additional Fd&#8208;dependent enzyme classes for synthetic applications.

Abstract
Collimonas sp. (D&#8208;25), found in the soil of Akita Prefecture, is a gram&#8208;negative bacterium with the ability to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). During the synthesis of AuNPs, one specific protein (DP&#8208;1) was found to have disappeared in the sonicated solution of the bacterium. Recombinant DP&#8208;1 (rDP&#8208;1) from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was used to study the effect of DP&#8208;1 on the synthesis of AuNPs. AuNPs synthesized with rDP&#8208;1 result in small, stabilized nanoparticles. AuNPs synthesized by DP&#8208;1 retained the stability of both the dispersion and nano&#8208;size particles under high salt concentrations. Isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to investigate the bonding ratio of rDP&#8208;1 to AuNPs. Several thousand rDP&#8208;1 proteins are attached to the surface of an AuNP to form a protein corona containing multiple layers. These results suggest that DP&#8208;1 obtained from D&#8208;25 has a size and stability control function during AuNP synthesis.

         <title>In situ H2O2 Generation by Choline Oxidase and Its Application in Amino Polysaccharide Degradation by Coupling to Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study showing that a choline oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis may be used for fine&#8208;tuned in&#8197;situ generation of H2O2 to drive and control LPMO&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation of chitin.







Abstract
Chitin, the most abundant amino polysaccharide in Nature, has many applications in different fields. However, processing of this recalcitrant biopolymer in an environmentally friendly manner remains a major challenge. In this context, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are of interest, as they can act on the most recalcitrant parts of chitin and related insoluble biopolymers such as cellulose. Efficient LPMO catalysis can be achieved by feeding reactions with H2O2, but careful control of H2O2 is required to avoid autocatalytic enzyme inactivation. Herein, we present a coupled enzyme system in which a choline oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis is employed for controlled in&#8197;situ generation of H2O2 that fuels LPMO&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation of chitin. We show that the rate, stability and extent of the LPMO reaction can be manipulated by varying the amount of choline oxidase and/or its substrate, choline chloride, and that efficient peroxygenase reactions may be achieved using sub&#8208;&#956;M concentrations of the H2O2&#8208;generating enzyme. This coupled system requires only sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of the reductant that is needed to keep the LPMO in its active, reduced state. It is conceivable that this enzyme system may be used for bioprocessing of chitin in choline&#8208;based natural deep eutectic solvents.

         <title>Reflections on Navigating a Pandemic: Perspectives from the Chemical Biology Community</title>

Navigating a pandemic: In this perspective article for the ChemBioTalents collection, we capture personal stories and opinions about the challenges and opportunities that came with navigating career transitions during the turbulent past few years.







Abstract
The early&#8208;career researchers showcased in this ChemBioTalents special collection, and many others who have established their independent scientific careers over the last three years, have experienced a unique set of circumstances. The Covid&#8208;19 pandemic necessitated new forms of communication and interpersonal interactions: From online interviews and virtual networking to relocating and establishing labs during a pandemic, we faced many challenges, but also unexpected opportunities. In this perspective, we reflect on this unique and formative time through personal anecdotes and viewpoints, trying to capture diverse experiences from the Chemical Biology community and beyond. We have tried to get a broad and varied set of perspectives, however, the selection is biased towards researchers who were able to start their independent careers.
Almost every person who was interviewed mentioned that they were overall quite lucky. Many early career researchers were more negatively impacted in their career options by the pandemic, reasons for which are manifold &#8211; some had to take care of family members, while others were not able to cross borders, were unable to finish experiments for publications, or were negatively impacted by the low number of open faculty positions. Although we tried to include balanced views from various career stages and many parts of the world, we acknowledge that those stories are not captured in this editorial.

         <title>Characterization of an Unusual &#945;&#8208;Oxoamine Synthase Off&#8208;Loading Domain from a Cyanobacterial Type I Fatty Acid Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fatty acid synthase off&#8208;loading domain. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) usually releases its products by hydrolysis or transesterification. Here, an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase off&#8208;loading domain is identified in a cyanobacterial type I FAS. This domain releases the fatty acyl chain through a condensation with L&#8208;serine, offering a novel pathway to &#945;&#8208;amino&#160;ketones that share similarities with sphingolipid precursors. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. E. Fraley, S. Sasso et al.

This graphic illustrates the process of mining and deconstructing a database represented as a puzzling challenge. Our database includes structurally diverse membranolytic anticancer peptides associated with their biological inhibition of one or more cancer cell lines. Empty cells represent biological data scarcity.







Abstract
Current cancer treatments damage healthy cells and tissues, causing short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term side effects. New treatments are desired that show greater selectivity toward cancer cells and evade the common mechanisms of multidrug resistance. Membranolytic anticancer peptides (mACPs) hold promise against cancer and multidrug resistance. Amphipathicity, hydrophobicity, and net charge of mACPs participate in their respective interactions with cell membranes and their overall inhibition of cancer cells. To support the design of cell&#8208;line selective mACPs, we investigated the relationships that amino acid composition, physicochemical properties, sequence motifs, and sequence homology could have with their potency and selectivity towards several healthy and cancer cell lines. Sequence length and net charge are known to affect the selectivity of mACPs between cancer and healthy cell lines. Our study reveals that increasing the net charge or flexibility (i.&#8201;e., small and aliphatic residues) influences their selectivity between cancer cell lines with comparable lipid compositions.

         <title>The Effect of &#947; Phosphate Modified Deoxynucleotide Substrates on PCR Activity and Fidelity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleotide triphosphate analogues that possess modification on their &#947;&#8208;triphosphate were synthesized to improve PCR fidelity. Effects of the analogues on PCR activity and fidelity are dependent on polymerase, &#947;&#8208;modification, and base. One of the analogues, tetraphosphate, successfully achieved a two&#8208;fold improvement of the PCR fidelity using Taq DNA polymerase.







Abstract
Controlling PCR fidelity is an important issue for molecular biology and high&#8208;fidelity PCR is essential for gene cloning. In general, fidelity control is achieved by protein engineering of polymerases. In contrast, only a few studies have reported controlling fidelity using chemically modified nucleotide substrates. In this report, we synthesized nucleotide substrates possessing a modification on P&#947; and evaluated the effect of this modification on PCR fidelity. One of the substrates, nucleotide tetraphosphate, caused a modest decrease in Taq DNA polymerase activity and the effect on PCR fidelity was dependent on the type of mutation. The use of deoxyadenosine tetraphosphate enhanced the A&#8201;:&#8201;T&#8594;G&#8201;:&#8201;C mutation dramatically, which is common when using Taq polymerase. Conversely, deoxyguanosine tetraphosphate (dG4P) suppressed this mutation but increased the G&#8201;:&#8201;C&#8594;A&#8201;:&#8201;T mutation during PCR. Using an excess amount of dG4P suppressed both mutations successfully and total fidelity was improved.

     alt="The Effect of &#947; Phosphate Modified Deoxynucleotide Substrates on PCR Activity and Fidelity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleotide triphosphate analogues that possess modification on their &#947;-triphosphate were synthesized to improve PCR fidelity. Effects of the analogues on PCR activity and fidelity are dependent on polymerase, &#947;-modification, and base. One of the analogues, tetraphosphate, successfully achieved a two-fold improvement of the PCR fidelity using Taq DNA polymerase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling PCR fidelity is an important issue for molecular biology and high-fidelity PCR is essential for gene cloning. In general, fidelity control is achieved by protein engineering of polymerases. In contrast, only a few studies have reported controlling fidelity using chemically modified nucleotide substrates. In this report, we synthesized nucleotide substrates possessing a modification on P&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt; and evaluated the effect of this modification on PCR fidelity. One of the substrates, nucleotide tetraphosphate, caused a modest decrease in Taq DNA polymerase activity and the effect on PCR fidelity was dependent on the type of mutation. The use of deoxyadenosine tetraphosphate enhanced the A&#8201;:&#8201;T&#8594;G&#8201;:&#8201;C mutation dramatically, which is common when using Taq polymerase. Conversely, deoxyguanosine tetraphosphate (dG4P) suppressed this mutation but increased the G&#8201;:&#8201;C&#8594;A&#8201;:&#8201;T mutation during PCR. Using an excess amount of dG4P suppressed both mutations successfully and total fidelity was improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Dynamics of Iron is a Key Player in the Catalysis of Non&#8208;heme Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their flexible and variable coordination architecture, the non&#8208;heme enzymes are able to regulate their activity and selectivity by coordination change or switch of iron. The S/O coordination switch of sulfoxide radical specie in EgtB allows for the efficient and selective C&#8722;S bond formation, while in Fe/2OG oxygenases, the substrate coordination may enable the selective C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N coupling. Thus, the coordination change and dynamics of iron cofactor could be an important player in the catalysis of non&#8208;heme enzymes.







Abstract
Mononuclear nonheme iron enzymes catalyze a large variety of oxidative transformations responsible for various biosynthesis and metabolism processes. Unlike their P450 counterparts, non&#8208;heme enzymes generally possess flexible and variable coordination architecture, which can endow rich reactivity for non&#8208;heme enzymes. This Concept highlights that the coordination dynamics of iron can be a key player in controlling the activity and selectivity of non&#8208;heme enzymes. In ergothioneine synthase EgtB, the coordination switch of the sulfoxide radical species enables the efficient and selective C&#8722;S coupling reaction. In iron(II)&#8208; and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent (Fe/2OG) oxygenases, the conformational flip of ferryl&#8208;oxo intermediate can be extensively involved in selective oxidation reactions. Especially, the five&#8208;coordinate ferryl&#8208;oxo species may allow the substrate coordination via O or N atom, which may facilitate the C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N coupling reactions via stabilizing the transition states and inhibiting the unwanted hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>CYPArm2 is a CYP450 Monooxygenase with Protoilludene 13&#8208;Hydroxylase Activity Involved in the Biosynthesis of Armillyl Orsellinate&#8208;Type Sesquiterpenoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melleolides and armillyl orsellinates are protoilludane&#8208;type aryl esters. Several of these compounds show potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. Limited availability, however, hampers their pharmaceutical development. The elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway represents a prerequisite for the establishment of heterologous production systems. Here, we describe the identification of the protoilludene&#8208;13&#8208;hydroxylase.







Abstract
The melleolides are a family of structurally and functionally diverse sesquiterpenoids with potential applications as fungicides, antimicrobials, and cancer therapeutics. The initial and terminal steps of the biosynthesis pathway in Armillaria spp. have been characterized, but the intermediate steps are unclear. Biosynthetic gene clusters in A.&#8197;mellea and A.&#8197;gallica were shown to encode a terpene cyclase, a polyketide synthase, and four CYP450 monooxygenases. We have characterized CYPArm3, which is responsible for the hydroxylation of &#916;&#8208;6&#8208;protoilludene, but the functions of the other CYP450s remain to be determined. Here we describe CYPArm2, which accepts &#916;&#8208;6&#8208;protoilludene and 8&#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;protoilludene as substrates. To investigate the products in more detail, we generated recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains overexpressing CYPArm2 in combination with the previously characterized protoilludene synthase and 8&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase. Using this total biosynthesis approach, sufficient quantities of product were obtained for NMR spectroscopy. This allowed the identification of 8&#945;,13&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;protoilludene, confirming that CYPArm2 is a protoilludene 13&#8208;hydroxylase.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins holds significant promise for drug discovery and facilitates bioorthogonal chemistry. This selective functionalization leads to innovative advances in in vitro and in vivo biological research. It is a challenging endeavor to selectively target a certain amino acid or position in the presence of other residues containing reactive groups. Biocatalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for selective, efficient and economical modifications of molecules. Enzymes that have the ability to modify multiple complex substrates or selectively install nonnative handles have wide applications. Herein, we highlight enzymes with broad substrate tolerance that have been demonstrated to modify a specific amino acid residue in simple or complex peptides and/or proteins at late&#8208;stage. The different substrates accepted by these enzymes are mentioned together with the reported downstream bioorthogonal reactions that have benefited from the enzymatic selective modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1916 is an Acetyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis isocitrate lyase 2 is split into Rv1915 and Rv1916 in the laboratory strain H37Rv due to a frameshift mutation. Herein, we showed that Rv1916 is an acetyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;binding protein through NMR binding studies. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that Rv1916 possesses similar structure as the C&#8208;terminal domain of full&#8208;length ICL2.







Abstract
Isocitrate lyase (ICL) isoform 2 is an essential enzyme for some clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains during infection. In the laboratory Mtb strain H37Rv, the icl2 gene encodes two distinct gene products &#8211; Rv1915 and Rv1916 &#8211; due to a frameshift mutation. This study aims to characterise these two gene products to understand their structure and function. While we were unable to produce Rv1915 recombinantly, soluble Rv1916 was obtained with sufficient yield for characterisation. Kinetic studies using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometry and 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy showed that recombinant Rv1916 does not possess isocitrate lyase activity, while waterLOGSY binding experiments demonstrated that it could bind acetyl&#8208;CoA. Finally, X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed structural similarities between Rv1916 and the C&#8208;terminal domain of ICL2. Considering the probable differences between full&#8208;length ICL2 and the gene products Rv1915 and Rv1916, care must be taken when using Mtb H37Rv as a model organism to study central carbon metabolism.

         <title>Interrogation of an Enzyme Library Reveals the Catalytic Plasticity of Naturally Evolved [4+2] Cyclases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diels&#8208;Alderases perform an essential step in the biosynthesis of bioactive spirotetronates. To expand the understanding of such enzymes a cyclase library was created, which made it possible to identify a novel spirotetronate cyclase from a metagenome mining approach. Structural elucidation of both the enzyme by X&#8208;ray crystallography and the product by NMR helped us to gain further insights into the essential features of how these enzymes perform complex cyclisations.







Abstract
Stereoselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions are quintessential transformations in organic synthesis. One example is the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a dienophile to form cyclohexenes. The development of biocatalysts for this reaction is paramount for unlocking sustainable routes to a plethora of important molecules. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of naturally evolved [4+2] cyclases, and to identify hitherto uncharacterised biocatalysts for this reaction, we constructed a library comprising forty&#8208;five enzymes with reported or predicted [4+2] cycloaddition activity. Thirty&#8208;one library members were successfully produced in recombinant form. In vitro assays employing a synthetic substrate incorporating a diene and a dienophile revealed broad&#8208;ranging cycloaddition activity amongst these polypeptides. The hypothetical protein Cyc15 was found to catalyse an intramolecular cycloaddition to generate a novel spirotetronate. The crystal structure of this enzyme, along with docking studies, establishes the basis for stereoselectivity in Cyc15, as compared to other spirotetronate cyclases.

To expand the understanding of such enzymes a cyclase library was created, which made it possible to identify a novel spirotetronate cyclase from a metagenome mining approach. Structural elucidation of both the enzyme by X-ray crystallography and the product by NMR helped us to gain further insights into the essential features of how these enzymes perform complex cyclisations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereoselective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are quintessential transformations in organic synthesis. One example is the Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a dienophile to form cyclohexenes. The development of biocatalysts for this reaction is paramount for unlocking sustainable routes to a plethora of important molecules. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of naturally evolved [4+2] cyclases, and to identify hitherto uncharacterised biocatalysts for this reaction, we constructed a library comprising forty-five enzymes with reported or predicted [4+2] cycloaddition activity. Thirty-one library members were successfully produced in recombinant form. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays employing a synthetic substrate incorporating a diene and a dienophile revealed broad-ranging cycloaddition activity amongst these polypeptides. The hypothetical protein Cyc15 was found to catalyse an intramolecular cycloaddition to generate a novel spirotetronate. The crystal structure of this enzyme, along with docking studies, establishes the basis for stereoselectivity in Cyc15, as compared to other spirotetronate cyclases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Structural Tuning Yields Hydrazonyl Sultones for Faster Bioorthogonal Protein Modification
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust HS: Systematic studies of substituent effect yield hydrazonyl sultones (HS) that permit autonomous access of highly reactive nitrile imines through tautomerization to afford faster bioorthogonal modification of a nanobody carrying a strained alkyne, bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a series of hydrazonyl sultones (HS) containing an ortho&#8208;CF3 group, a five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered sultone ring, and a varying N&#8208;aryl substituent, and characterization of their aqueous stability and reactivity toward bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) in a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction. To avoid purification of highly polar intermediates, we employed two protecting groups in our synthetic schemes. Most HS were obtained in moderate to good yields under optimized reaction conditions. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of two HS revealed that the partially negative&#8208;charged fluorine atoms in CF3 electrostatically shield the electrophilic nitrile imine (NI) center from a nucleophilic attack, underpinning their extraordinary aqueous stability. In addition, the N&#8208;aryl substituents further modulate HS reactivity and stability, with the electron&#8208;rich six&#8208;membered HS displaying excellent aqueous stability and increased cycloaddition reactivity. The utility of these improved HS reagents was demonstrated through fast and selective modification of a BCNK&#8208;encoded nanobody with second&#8208;order rate constants as high as 1500&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline&#8208;ethanol (9&#8201;:&#8201;1), representing the fastest HS&#8211;BCN ligation reported in the literature.

         <title>Structural Basis for the Activation of the Cobalt&#8208;Carbon Bond and Control of the Adenosyl Radical in Coenzyme B12 Catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8722;C bond of coenzyme B12 is activated upon binding to apoenzyme. Structural evidence for the activation of this organometallic bond by steric distortions in B12 enzymes is reviewed. Substrate binding to holoenzyme causes further labilization of the bond to generate a catalytic adenosyl radical that triggers the reactions. Conformational stabilization of this radical is of crucial importance for preventing undesirable side&#8208;reactions.







Abstract
Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), or coenzyme B12, is a naturally occurring organometallic compound that serves as a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze intramolecular group&#8208;transfer reactions and ribonucleotide reduction in a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to animals. AdoCbl&#8208;dependent enzymes are radical enzymes that generate an adenosyl radical by homolysis of the coenzyme's cobalt&#8208;carbon (Co&#8722;C) bond for catalysis. How do the enzymes activate and cleave the Co&#8722;C bond to form the adenosyl radical? How do the enzymes utilize the high reactivity of the adenosyl radical for catalysis by suppressing undesirable side reactions? Our recent structural studies, which aimed to solve these problems with diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase, established the crucial importance of the steric strain of the Co&#8722;C bond and conformational stabilization of the adenosyl radical for coenzyme B12 catalysis. We outline here our results obtained with these eliminating isomerases and compare them with those obtained with other radical B12 enzymes.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Catalysis: Cooperativity Enables Opportunity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative chemoenzymatic catalysis has emerged as a uniquely powerful strategy for the synthesis of value&#8208;added small molecules and materials. This review will present a selection of recent notable accomplishments in this research area followed by a brief perspective on its promising future.







Abstract
The application of enzymes in synthetic organic chemistry has emerged as a powerful means to generate molecular complexity in a highly selective, efficient, and sustainable manner. While enzymes have increasingly been incorporated into synthetic sequences for numerous academic and industrial applications on their own and in sequential processes, their utility in cooperative catalysis with small molecule catalytic platforms has recently drawn increased attention across the field of organic synthesis. In this review, we present a selection of notable accomplishments in cooperative chemoenzymatic catalysis and provide a perspective on its future directions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Hybrid Peptide&#8722;DNA Nanostructures using Homotrimeric Coiled&#8208;Coil/Nucleic Acid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our work, we designed a programmable peptide&#8208;DNA tetrahedron nanostructure, which incorporated both DNA hybridization and a coiled&#8208;coil peptide assembly structure. A homotrimeric peptide was modified with DNA handles, and assembled with a triangular DNA &#8220;base&#8221; bearing complementary arms to yield the cage shown. This is the first cage to integrate both DNA and peptide self&#8208;assembly, and the peptide building block will enable applications like new targeted delivery vehicles (of encapsulated cargoes) or integration with functional proteins.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Aryl Diazonium Installation onto Protein Surfaces at Neutral pH using a Maleimide&#8208;Functionalized Triazabutadiene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl diazonium cations are versatile bioconjugation reagents due to their reactivity towards electron&#8208;rich aryl residues and secondary amines, but historically their usage has been hampered by both their short lifespan in aqueous solution and the harsh conditions required to generate them in situ. Triazabutadienes address many of these issues as they are stable enough to endure multiple&#8208;step chemical syntheses and can persist for several hours in aqueous solution, yet upon UV&#8208;exposure rapidly release aryl diazonium cations under biologically&#8208;relevant conditions. This paper describes the synthesis of a novel maleimide&#8208;functionalized triazabutadiene suitable for site&#8208;selectively installing aryl diazonium cations into proteins at neutral pH; we show reaction with this molecule and a surface&#8208;cysteine of a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase. Through photoactivation of the site&#8208;selectively installed triazabutadiene motifs, we generate aryl diazonium functionality, which we further derivatize via azo&#8208;bond formation to electron&#8208;rich aryl species, showcasing the potential utility of this strategy for the generation of photo switches or protein&#8208;drug conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Conserved Active Site Architecture Between Bacterial Cellulose and Chitin Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural analysis of bacterial and cellulose synthases revealed a highly conserved catalytic active site across evolutionarily distant species, despite the very high dissimilarities among the overall amino acid sequences and 3D structures, potentially reminiscent of a broad range substrate common ancestor.







Abstract
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large and diverse group of enzymes responsible for catalyzing the formation of a glycosidic bond between a donor molecule, usually a monosaccharide, and a wide range of acceptor molecules, thus, playing critical roles in various essential biological processes. Chitin and cellulose synthases are two inverting processive integral membrane GTs, belonging to the type&#8208;2 family involved in the biosynthesis of chitin and cellulose, respectively. Herein, we report that bacterial cellulose and chitin synthases share an E&#8208;D&#8208;D&#8208;ED&#8208;QRW&#8208;TK active site common motif that is spatially co&#8208;localized. This motif is conserved among distant bacterial evolutionary species despite their low amino acid sequence and structural similarities between them. This theoretical framework offers a new perspective to the current view that bacterial cellulose and chitin synthases are substrate specific and that chitin and cellulose are organism specific. It lays the ground for future in&#8197;vivo and in silico experimental assessment of cellulose synthase catalytic promiscuity against uridine diphosphate N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and chitin synthase against uridine diphosphate glucose, respectively.

         <title>Brief Guide for Preparing a Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugates (PDCs) have recently emerged as interesting hybrids constructs not only for targeted therapy, but also for the early diagnosis of different pathologies. In most cases, the crucial step in the PDCs synthesis is the final conjugation step, where a specific drug is bound to a particular peptide/peptidomimetic targeting unit. Thus, this concept paper aims to give a short guide for determining the finest conjugation reaction, by considering in particular the reaction conditions, the stability of the linker and the major pros and cons of each reaction. Based on the recent PDCs reported in literature, the most common and efficient conjugation methods will be systematically presented and compared, generating a short guide to consult while planning the synthesis of a novel peptide&#8208;drug conjugate.</dc:description>

         <title>The Wild&#8208;Type tRNA Adenosine Deaminase Enzyme TadA Is Capable of Sequence&#8208;Specific DNA Base Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The directed evolution of the adenosine deaminase enzyme TadA from an RNA&#8208;editing enzyme to an efficient DNA&#8208;editing enzyme was crucial for the development of the adenine base editor (ABE). Previous experiments showed no detectable DNA&#8208;editing activity by an ABE utilizing wild&#8208;type TadA (ABE0.1), but here we show ABE0.1 is able to edit DNA strictly within TACG motifs. This sequence requirement is partially governed by the C&#8208;terminal &#945;5 helix of TadA, which accumulated many mutations during the directed evolution of TadA. The evolution of TadA to better access adenines within a diverse range of sequences is reflective of the Galapagos finches, which evolved different beak shapes in order to better access the food that was available to them. This cover art shows the protein structures of ecTadA (PDB: 1Z3A) and the evolved TadA8e (PDB: 6VCA), along with two species of Galapagos finches using the different &#945;5 helix structures to access a target adenine within different sequence contexts. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. C. Komor et al.

         <title>Unique Crosslinking Properties of Psoralen&#8208;Conjugated Oligonucleotides Developed by Novel Psoralen N&#8208;Hydroxysuccinimide Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Psoralens and their derivatives have unique crosslinking features to DNA. With the development of psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides (Ps&#8208;Oligos), sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking with target DNA has become achievable. In this study, we developed novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters that allow the introduction of psoralens into any amino&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. We found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide via a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target DNA. We believe our findings are essential information for the development of Ps&#8208;Oligos as novel gene regulation tools. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Yamayoshi et al.

         <title>The evolutionary pattern of cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis provides strategies to produce tropane alkaloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cocaine and hyoscyamine are two tropane alkaloids (TA) from Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae, respectively. These famous compounds possess anticholinergic properties that can be used to treat neuromuscular disorders. While the hyoscyamine biosynthetic pathway has been fully elucidated allowing its de novo synthesis in yeast, the cocaine pathway remained partially elucidated. Recently, the Huang research group has completed the cocaine biosynthetic route by characterizing its two missing enzymes. This allowed transferring this whole pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to achieve cocaine production. In this spotlight, besides highlighting the impact of this discovery, we discuss how TA biosynthesis evolved via the recruitment of two distinct and convergent pathways in Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae. Finally, while enriching our knowledge on TA biosynthesis, this diversification of the molecular actors involved in cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis opens perspectives in metabolic engineering by exploring enzyme biochemical plasticity that can ease and shorten TA pathway reconstitution in heterologous organisms</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Amphiphilic Supramolecular Nanogel: Competent Host for Notably Efficient Lipase Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Water Insoluble Substrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work depicts the development of stable nanogels in aqueous medium that were exploited for efficient surface&#8208;active lipase catalyzed hydrolysis of water insoluble substrates. Surfactant coated gel nanoparticles (neutral NG1, anionic NG2 and cationic NG3) were prepared from peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator (G1, G2 and G3, respectively) at different hydrophilic and lipophilic balance (HLB). Chromobacterium viscosum (CV) lipase activity towards hydrolysis of water insoluble substrates (p&#8208;nitrophyenyl&#8208;n&#8208;alkanoates (C4&#8208;C10)) in presence of nanogels got remarkably improved by ~1.7&#8208;8.0 fold in comparison to that in aqueous buffer and other self&#8208;aggregates. Increase in hydrophobicity of substrate led to notable improvement in lipase activity in hydrophilic domain (HLB&gt;8.0) of nanogels. Micro&#8208;heterogeneous interface of small sized (10&#8208;65 nm) nanogel was found to be an appropriate scaffold for immobilizing surface&#8208;active lipase to exhibit superior catalytic efficiency. Concurrently, the flexible conformation of lipase immobilized in nanogels was reflected in its secondary structure having highest a&#8208;helix content from the circular dichroism spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoradical&#8211;mediated catalyst&#8211;independent protein cross&#8208;link with unusual fluorescence properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;activated modification of natural amino acids has served as lucrative probes for precise mapping of the dynamics, interaction networks, and turnover of cytosolic proteins both in vivo and ex vivo. In our attempts to extend the utility of photoreactive reporters to map the molecular characteristics of vital membrane proteins, we carried out site&#8208;selective incorporation of 7fluoro&#8208;indole in the human mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2 (voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel isoform 2), with the aim of generating Trp&#8211;Phe/Tyr cross&#8208;links. Prolonged irradiation at 282 nm provided us with a surprisingly unusual fluorophore that displayed sizably red&#8211;shifted excitation (&#955;ex&#8208;max=280nm&#8594;360nm) and emission (&#955;em&#8208;max=330nm&#8594;430nm) spectra that was reversible with organic solvents. By measuring the kinetics of the photoactivated cross&#8208;linking with a library of hVDAC2 variants, we demonstrate that formation of this unusual fluorophore is kinetically retarded, independent of tryptophan, and is site&#8208;specific.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photo-activated modification of natural amino acids has served as lucrative probes for precise mapping of the dynamics, interaction networks, and turnover of cytosolic proteins both in vivo and ex vivo. In our attempts to extend the utility of photoreactive reporters to map the molecular characteristics of vital membrane proteins, we carried out site-selective incorporation of 7fluoro-indole in the human mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2 (voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2), with the aim of generating Trp&#8211;Phe/Tyr cross-links. Prolonged irradiation at 282 nm provided us with a surprisingly unusual fluorophore that displayed sizably red&#8211;shifted excitation (&#955;ex-max=280nm&#8594;360nm) and emission (&#955;em-max=330nm&#8594;430nm) spectra that was reversible with organic solvents. By measuring the kinetics of the photoactivated cross-linking with a library of hVDAC2 variants, we demonstrate that formation of this unusual fluorophore is kinetically retarded, independent of tryptophan, and is site-specific. Using other membrane (Tom40 and Sam50) and cytosolic (MscR and DNA Pol I) proteins, we additionally show that formation of this fluorophore is protein&#8211;independent. Our findings reveal the photoradical&#8211;mediated accumulation of reversible tyrosine cross-links, with unusual fluorescent properties.

         <title>Characterization of an Unusual &#945;&#8208;Oxoamine Synthase Off&#8208;Loading Domain from a Cyanobacterial Type I Fatty Acid Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) usually releases its products by hydrolysis or transesterification. Here, an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase off&#8208;loading domain is identified in a cyanobacterial type I FAS. This domain releases the fatty acyl chain by condensing it with L&#8208;serine, thereby representing a novel route to &#945;&#8208;amino ketones.







Abstract
Type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) are known from higher eukaryotes and fungi. We report the discovery of FasT, a rare type I FAS from the cyanobacterium Chlorogloea sp. CCALA695. FasT possesses an unusual off&#8208;loading domain, which was heterologously expressed in E. coli and found to act as an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase (AOS) in&#8197;vitro. Similar to serine palmitoyltransferases from sphingolipid biosynthesis, the AOS off&#8208;loading domain catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen condensation between l&#8208;serine and a fatty acyl thioester. While the AOS domain was strictly specific for l&#8208;serine, thioesters with saturated fatty acyl chains of six carbon atoms and longer were tolerated, with the highest activity observed for stearoyl&#8722;coenzyme A (C18). Our findings suggest a novel route to &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the direct condensation of iteratively produced long&#8208;chain fatty acids with l&#8208;serine by a FAS with a cis&#8208;acting AOS off&#8208;loading domain.

         <title>The Wild&#8208;Type tRNA Adenosine Deaminase Enzyme TadA Is Capable of Sequence&#8208;Specific DNA Base Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenine base editors (ABEs) are genome editing tools that convert A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T base pairs to G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C by using an extensively evolved tRNA&#8208;adenosine deaminase enzyme, TadA. Here we show that wtTadA can perform DNA base editing, with a strict sequence motif requirement of TAC. We additionally investigate how the sequence recognition of TadA variants changes as they accumulate mutations to better edit DNA substrates.







Abstract
Base editors are genome editing tools that enable site&#8208;specific base conversions through the chemical modification of nucleobases in DNA. Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T to G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C base pairs in DNA by using an adenosine deaminase enzyme to modify target adenosines to inosine intermediates. Due to the lack of a naturally occurring adenosine deaminase that can modify DNA, ABEs were evolved from a tRNA&#8208;deaminating enzyme, TadA. Previous experiments with an ABE comprising a wild&#8208;type (wt) TadA showed no detectable activity on DNA, and directed evolution was therefore required to enable this enzyme to accept DNA as a substrate. Here we show that wtTadA can perform base editing in DNA in both bacterial and mammalian cells, with a strict sequence motif requirement of TAC. We leveraged this discovery to optimize a reporter assay to detect base editing levels as low as 0.01&#8201;%. Finally, we used this assay along with molecular dynamics simulations of full ABE:DNA complexes to better understand how the sequence recognition of mutant TadA variants change as they accumulate mutations to better edit DNA substrates.

         <title>Metal Complexes and Nanoparticles for Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imaging techniques are used to identify, localize, and monitor the growth or reduction of cancerous tumors. Among the emerging methods, much research effort has been devoted to photoacoustic imaging. This method effectively combines the benefits of ultrasound and fluorescence imaging while minimizing their respective drawbacks using a light&#8208;in and ultrasound&#8208;out approach. Herein, the fundamental concept, recent advancements, and strategies for contrast agents based on molecular metal complexes or nanoparticles for photoacoustic imaging are reviewed. More information can be found in the Review by Axel Steinbrueck, Johannes Karges.

         <title>Lipase&#8208;mediated conversion of protecting group silyl ethers: An unspecific side reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silyl ether protecting groups are important tools in organic synthesis, ensuring selective reactions of hydroxyl functional groups. Enantiospecific formation or cleavage could simultaneously enable the resolution of racemic mixtures and thus significantly increase the efficiency of complex synthetic pathways. Based on reports that lipases, which today are already particularly important tools in chemical synthesis, can catalyze the enantiospecific turnover of trimethylsilanol (TMS)&#8208;protected alcohols, the goal of this study was to determine the conditions under which such a catalysis occurs. Through detailed experimental and mechanistic investigation, we demonstrated that although lipases mediate the turnover of TMS&#8208;protected alcohols, this occurs independently of the known catalytic triad, as this is unable to stabilize a tetrahedral intermediate. The reaction is essentially non&#8208;specific and therefore most likely completely independent of the active site. This rules out lipases as catalysts for the resolution of racemic mixtures of alcohols through protection or deprotection with silyl groups.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Targeting the protein&#8211;RNA interaction of LIN28 and let&#8208;7 is a promising strategy for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. However, a limited number of small&#8208;molecule inhibitors disrupting the LIN28&#8211;let&#8208;7 interaction with potent efficacy are available. Herein, we developed a novel LIN28&#8208;inhibiting strategy by targeting selective hotspot amino acids at the LIN28&#8211;let&#8208;7 binding interface with small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based bifunctional conjugates. Starting from reported small&#8208;molecule LIN28 inhibitors, we identified a feasible linker&#8208;attachment position after performing a structure&#8208;activity relationship exploration based on LIN28&#8208;targeting chromenopyrazoles. In parallel, a virtual alanine scan identified hotspot residues at the protein&#8211;RNA binding interface, based on which we designed a set of peptides to enhance the interaction with the identified hotspot residues. Conjugation of the tailor&#8208;designed peptides with linker&#8208;attached chromenopyrazoles yielded a series of bifunctional small&#8208;molecule&#8211;peptide conjugates, represented by 83 (PH&#8208;223), as a new LIN28&#8208;targeting chemical modality. Our result demonstrated an unexplored rational design approach using bifunctional conjugates to target protein&#8211;RNA interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogels with reversible cross&#8208;links for improved localised stem cell retention: a review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>

However, the translation of stem cells to the clinic could be improved by challenges in stem cell transplantation and in vivo retention at the site of tissue damage.&#160; This review aims to provide the most recent insights into developing hydrogels that can deliver, retain, and accommodate stem cells for tissue repair. Hydrogels can be used for tissue engineering as their flexibility and water content makes them excellent substitutes for the native extracellular matrix. Moreover, the mechanical properties of hydrogels are highly tuneable, and recognition moieties to control cell behaviour and fate can quickly be introduced.

         <title>Unique Crosslinking Properties of Psoralen&#8208;Conjugated Oligonucleotides Developed by Novel Psoralen N&#8208;Hydroxysuccinimide Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides developed by novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters, we found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide via a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target double&#8208;stranded DNA.







Abstract
Psoralens and their derivatives, such as trioxsalen, have unique crosslinking features to DNA. However, psoralen monomers do not have sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking ability with the target DNA. With the development of psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides (Ps&#8208;Oligos), sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking with target DNA has become achievable, thereby expanding the application of psoralen&#8208;conjugated molecules in gene transcription inhibition, gene knockout, and targeted recombination by genome editing. In this study, we developed two novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters that allow the introduction of psoralens into any amino&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. Quantitative evaluation of the photo&#8208;crosslinking efficiencies of the Ps&#8208;Oligos to target single&#8208;stranded DNAs revealed that the crosslinking selectivity to 5&#8208;mC is the unique feature of trioxsalen. We found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide via a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target double&#8208;stranded DNA. We believe our findings are essential information for the development of Ps&#8208;Oligos as novel gene regulation tools.

Seek a cell anchorage galectin bridge: Transforming the wildtype Galectin (Gal)&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 to a tandem&#8208;repeat type variant via rational protein engineering enhanced cis&#8208;binding activity with O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptides of &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan (DG). Furthermore, the Gal&#8208;1 variants (but not Gal&#8208;3 variants) demonstrated trans&#8208;bridging activity with the prepared &#945;&#8208;DG core&#8208;M1 glycoconjugates and laminins in situ via the carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Thus, Gal&#8208;1 and its variants are exciting candidates for treating several forms of muscular dystrophy. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kaltner, H.

         <title>Serum&#8208;based detection of liver pathology using a fluorogenic alkaline phosphatase probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of &#8220;ultrahigh contrast&#8221; fluorogenic probes for trapping alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in human serum is highly desirable for clinical auxiliary diagnosis for hepatobiliary diseases. However, the intrinsic dilemma of incomplete ionization of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)&#8208;based ALP fluorophores and autofluorescence interference of serum result in low sensitivity and accuracy. Given that unique halogen effects could lead to a drastic decrease in the pKa value and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield, herein we report an enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared probe based on a difluoro&#8208;substituted dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;chromene for achieving fluorescent quantification of human serum ALP. Rational design strategy is demonstrated by altering the substituted halogen groups to well regulate the pKa for meeting the physiological precondition. Owing to the complete ionization at pH 7.4 with tremendous fluorescence enhancement, the difluoro&#8208;substituted DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP manifests a linear relationship between the emission intensity and ALP concentration in both solution and serum samples. Along with measuring 77 human serum samples, the DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP based fluorescence method not only exhibits significant correlations with clinical colorimetry, but also distinguishes ALP patients from healthy volunteers, as well as assessing the progress of liver disease, thus providing a potential toolbox for quantitatively detecting ALP and warning the stage of hepatopathy.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Secondary Structure Motifs through Photo&#8208;labile Peptide Staples</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are facilitated by the well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structure of bioactive peptides, interesting compounds for the development of new therapeutic agents. Their secondary structure and thus their propensity to engage in PPIs can be influenced by the introduction of peptide staples on the side chains. In particular, light&#8208;controlled staples based on azobenzene photoswitches and their structural influence on helical peptides have been studied extensively. In contrast, photolabile staples bearing photocages as a structural key motif, have mainly been used to block supramolecular interactions. Their influence on the secondary structure of the target peptide is under&#8208;investigated. Thus, in this study we use a combination of spectroscopic techniques and in silico simulations to systematically study a series of helical peptides with varying length of the photo&#8208;labile staple to obtain a detailed insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship in such photoresponsive biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we describe a novel catalyst&#8208;free 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition bioconjugation approach for chemical modification of proteins. The dehydroalanine (Dha)&#8208;containing protein reacts with nitrile oxides generated in situ through 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition in fully aqueous&#8208;buffered systems. This leads to the formation of a new isoxazoline ring at a pre&#8208;defined site (Dha) of the protein. Furthermore, the 1&#8208;pyrene isoxazoline&#8208;installed annexin V acts as a fluorescent probe, which successfully labels the outer cellular membranes of human cholangiocarcinoma (HuCCA&#8208;1) cells for detection of apoptosis.</dc:description>

As amyloid, curli production in the host has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. We report that the natural product nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is effective as a curlicide in E. coli. NDGA prevents CsgA polymerization in vitro in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. NDGA selectively inhibits cellassociated curli assembly in E. coli and inhibits biofilm formation among uropathogenic E. coli in a curli&#8208;specific manner. More broadly, our work emphasizes the ability to evaluate and identify bioactive amyloid assembly inhibitors using the powerful gene&#8208;directed amyloid biogenesis machinery in E. coli.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Production of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Factor LasB in E. coli for Structure&#8208;Based Drug Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a number of virulence factors at its disposal that play crucial roles in the progression of infection. LasB is one of the major virulence factors and exerts its effects through elastolytic and proteolytic activities aimed at dissolving connective tissue and inactivating host defense proteins. LasB is of great interest for the development of novel patho&#8208;blockers to temper the virulence, but access has thus far largely been limited to protein isolated from Pseudomonas cultures. Here, we describe a new protocol for high&#8208;level production of native LasB in E. coli. We demonstrate that this facile approach is suitable for the production of mutant, thus far inaccessible LasB variants, and characterize the proteins biochemically and structurally. We expect that easy access to LasB is going to accelerate the development of inhibitors for this important virulence factor.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes and Nanoparticles for Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imaging techniques are clinically used to identify, localize, and monitor the growth or reduction of cancerous tumors. Among the emerging methods, much research efforts have been devoted to photoacoustic imaging. Herein, the fundamental concept, recent advancements, and strategies for contrast agents based on molecular metal complexes or nanoparticles for photoacoustic imaging are reviewed.







Abstract
Clinical imaging techniques are widely used to detect, locate, and track the growth or shrinkage of cancerous tumors. Although these techniques have shown impressive results, they often come with health risks due to the use of toxic contrast agents or ionizing radiation. To address these limitations, research efforts have been focused on the development of new imaging techniques. Among the emerging medicinal methods, photoacoustic imaging is receiving much attention. This method effectively combines the most important benefits of both ultrasound and fluorescence imaging, while minimizing their respective drawbacks via a light&#8208;in and ultrasound&#8208;out approach. This review article focuses on the fundamental concept, recent advances, and strategies for novel contrast agents based on molecular metal complexes or metallic nanoparticles for use in photoacoustic imaging.

         <title>Altering the Modular Architecture of Galectins Affects its Binding with Synthetic &#945;&#8208;Dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated Core M1 Glycoconjugates In situ</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alteration of galectin modular architecture effectively revealed the design&#8208;functionality relationship of lectin binding towards &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptides in&#8197;situ. Altering galectin modular architecture via rational protein engineering revealed the design&#8208;functionality relationship within this lectin family towards its affinity to &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptides in&#8197;situ. Transforming galectin&#8208;1 and &#8722;3 into tandem&#8208;repeat&#8208; and proto&#8208;types, respectively, significantly enhanced cis&#8208;binding with the prepared ligands. Moreover, Gal&#8208;1 variants demonstrated higher trans&#8208;bridging capabilities between &#945;&#8208;dystoglycan glycoconjugates and laminins compared to Gal&#8208;1 wild&#8208;type.







Abstract
The multifunctionality of galectins helps regulate a broad range of fundamental cellular processes via cis&#8208;binding and trans&#8208;bridging activities and has gained widespread attention with respect to the importance of the natural specificity/selectivity of this lectin family to its glycoconjugate receptors. Combining galectin (Gal)&#8208;1, &#8722;3, &#8722;4, and &#8722;9 variant test panels, achieved via rational protein engineering, and a synthetic &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan (DG) O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptide library, a detailed comparative analysis was performed, utilizing microarray experiments to delineate the design&#8208;functionality relationships within this lectin family. Enhancement of prototype Gal&#8208;1 and chimera&#8208;type Gal&#8208;3 cis&#8208;binding toward the prepared ligands is possible by transforming these lectins into tandem&#8208;repeat type and prototypes, respectively. Furthermore, Gal&#8208;1 variants demonstrated improved trans&#8208;bridging capabilities between core M1 &#945;&#8208;DG glycopeptides and laminins in microarray, suggesting the possible translational applications of these galectin variants in the treatment of some forms of &#945;&#8208;dystroglycanopathy.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Anthrochelin, a Growth&#8208;Promoting Metallophore of the Human Pathogen Luteibacter anthropi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various human pathogens have emerged from environmental strains by adapting to higher growth temperatures and the ability to produce virulence factors. A remarkable example of pathoadapted bacteria is found in the genus Luteibacter, which typically comprises harmless soil microbes, yet Luteibacteranthropi was isolated from the blood of a diseased child. To date, nothing has been known about the specialized metabolism of this pathogen. By comparative genome analyses we found that L. anthropi has a markedly higher biosynthetic potential than other bacteria of this genus and uniquely bears an NRPS gene locus tentatively coding for the biosynthesis of a metallophore. By metabolic profiling, stable isotope labeling, and NMR investigation of a gallium complex, we identified a new family of salicylate&#8208;derived non&#8208;ribosomal peptides named anthrochelin A&#8211;D. Surprisingly, anthrochelins feature a C&#8208;terminal homocysteine tag, which may be introduced during peptide termination. Mutational analyses provided insight into the anthrochelin assembly and revealed the unexpected involvement of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in oxazole formation. Notably, this heterocycle plays a key role in metal binding, especially copper (II). Bioassays showed that anthrochelin significantly promotes the growth of L. anthropi in the presence of low and high copper concentrations, which occur during infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectrophotometric and fluorimetric high&#8208;throughput assays for phenolic acid decarboxylase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic decarboxylation of hydroxycinnamic acids yields phenolic styrenes, which are important precursors for antioxidants, epoxy coatings, adhesives and other polymeric materials. Bacillus subtilis decarboxylase (BsPAD) is a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of carbon dioxide from p&#8208;coumaric&#8208;, caffeic&#8208;, and ferulic acid with high catalytic efficiency. Real&#8208;time spectroscopic assays for decarboxylase reactions remove the necessity of extensive sample workup, which is required for HPLC, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, or NMR methods. This work presents two robust and sensitive assays based on photometry and fluorimetry that allow following decarboxylation reactions with high sensitivity while avoiding product extraction and long analysis times. Optimized assay procedures were used to measure BsPAD activity in cell lysates and to determine the kinetic constants (KM and Vmax) of the purified enzyme for p&#8208;coumaric&#8208;, caffeic&#8208; and ferulic acid. Substrate inhibition was shown for caffeic acid.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has been widely explored for the precise manipulation of target DNA and enabled efficient genomic editing in cells. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 has shown promising potential in biomedical applications, including disease treatment, transcriptional regulation and genome&#8208;wide screening. Despite these exciting achievements, the efficient and controlled delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 system remained a critical obstacle to the further application. Herein, we elaborated on the three delivery forms of CRISPR/Cas9 system, and discussed the compositions, advantages and limitations of these forms. Then we provided a comprehensive overview of the delivery carriers of CRISPR/Cas9 system, and focused on the non&#8208;viral nanocarriers in chemical methods that facilitated efficient and controlled delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 system. Finally, we deeply discussed the challenges and prospects of the delivery methods of CRISPR/Cas9 system, and proposed strategies to address the intracellular and extracellular barriers for delivery in clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Faradaic Fenton Pixel &#8211; Reactive Oxygen Species Delivery using Au/Cr Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an integral part of many anticancer therapies. Fenton&#8208;like processes involving reactions of peroxides with transition metal ions are a particularly potent and tunable subset of ROS approaches. Precise on&#8208;demand dosing of the Fenton reaction is an area of great interest. Herein, we present a concept of an electrochemical faradaic pixel which produces controlled amounts of ROS via a Fenton&#8208;like process. The pixel comprises a cathode and anode, where the cathode reduces dissolved oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The anode is made of chromium, which is electrochemically corroded to yield chromium ions. Peroxide and chromium interact to form a highly oxidizing mixture of hydroxyl radicals and hexavalent Cr&#8208;ions. After benchmarking the electrochemical properties of this type of device, we demonstrate how it can be used under in vitro conditions with a cancer cell line. The faradaic Fenton pixel is a general and scalable concept that can be used for on&#8208;demand delivery of redox&#8208;active products for controlling a physiological outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Binding of Full&#8208;Length Chemerin is Driven by Negative Charges in the CMKLR1 N&#8208;terminus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adipokine chemerin is the endogenous ligand of the chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), a member of the family of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR). This protein ligand plays an important role in obesity and inflammatory processes. Stable receptor&#8208;ligand interactions are highly relevant for its different physiological effects, e. g. the migration of immune cells towards sites of inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that negative charges in the CMKLR1 N&#8208;terminus are involved in the formation of strong contacts with a specific positively charged patch at the surface of full&#8208;length chemerin, which is absent in the short nonapeptide agonist chemerin&#8208;9 explaining its reduced affinity. Using receptor chimera of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and CMKLR1, we were able to identify the residues of this interaction and its relevance for stable full&#8208;length chemerin binding. This may help to develop more potent ligands for the treatment of inflammatory related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Tools for study of Phosphohistidine: Generation of &#160;Selective &#932;&#8208;phosphohistidine and &#928;&#8208;phosphohistidine Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;hydrolysable stable analogues of &#964;&#8208;phosphohistidine (&#964;&#8208;pHis) and &#960;&#8208;pHis have been designed aided by electrostatic surface potential calculations, and subsequently synthesized. The &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis analogues (phosphopyrazole 8 and pyridyl amino amide 13, respectively) were used as haptens to generate pHis polyclonal antibodies. Both &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis conjugates in the form of a BSA&#8208;glutaraldehyde&#8208;&#964;&#8208;pHis and BSA&#8208;glutaraldehyde&#8208;&#960;&#8208;pHis were synthesized and characterized by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Commercially available &#964;&#8208;pHis (SC56&#8208;2) and &#960;&#8208;pHis (SC1&#8208;1; SC50&#8208;3) monoclonal antibodies were used to show that the BSA&#8208;G&#8208;&#964;&#8208;pHis and BSA&#8208;G&#8208;&#960;&#8208;pHis conjugates could be used to assess the selectivity of pHis antibodies in a competitive ELISA. Subsequently, the selectivity of the generated pHis antibodies generated using phosphopyrazole 8 and pyridyl amino amide 13 as haptens was assessed by competitive ELISA against His, pSer, pThr, pTyr, &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis. Antibodies generated using the phosphopyrazole 8 as a hapten were found to be selective for &#964;&#8208;pHis, and antibodies generated using the pyridyl amino amide 13 were found to be selective for &#960;&#8208;pHis. Both &#964;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;pHis antibodies were shown to be effective in immunological experiments, including ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence. The &#964;&#8208;pHis antibody was also shown to be useful in the immunoprecipitation of proteins containing pHis.</dc:description>

         <title>Examination of Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis in Apicomplexa</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural product discovery has traditionally relied on the isolation of small molecules from producing species, but genome sequencing technology and advances in molecular biology techniques have expanded efforts to a wider array of organisms. Protists represent an underexplored kingdom for specialized metabolite searches despite bioinformatic analysis that suggests they harbor distinct biologically active small molecules. Specifically, pathogenic apicomplexan parasites, responsible for billions of global infections, have been found to possess multiple biosynthetic gene clusters, which hints at their capacity to produce polyketide metabolites. Biochemical studies have revealed unique features of apicomplexan polyketide synthases, but to date, the identity and function of polyketides synthesized by these megaenzymes remains unknown. Herein, we discuss the potential for specialized metabolite production in protists and the possible evolution of polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters in apicomplexan parasites. We then focus on a polyketide synthase from the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii to discuss the unique domain architecture and properties of these proteins when compared to previously characterized systems, and further speculate on the possible functions for polyketides in these pathogenic parasites.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying E3 ligase substrates with quantitative degradation proteomics.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled protein degradation by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway is critical for almost all cellular processes. E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for targeting proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation with spatial and temporal precision. While studies have revealed various E3&#8208;substrate pairs involved in distinct biological processes, the complete substrate profiles of individual E3 ligases are largely unknown. Here we report a new approach to identify substrates of an E3 ligase for proteasomal degradation using unnatural amino acid incorporation pulse&#8208;chase proteomics (degradomics). Applying this approach, we determine the steadystate substrates of the  C &#8208; t erminal to  L is H  (CTLH) E3 ligase, a multicomponent complex with poorly defined substrates. By comparing the proteome degradation profiles of active and inactive CTLH&#8208;expressing cells, we successfully identify previously known and new potential substrates of CTLH ligase. Altogether, degradomics can comprehensively identify degradation substrates of an E3 ligase, which can be adapted for other E3 ligases in various cellular contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended scope and understanding of zinc&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenases for reduction of cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) are important tools for generating chiral a&#8208;hydroxyketones. Previously, only the ADH of Thauera aromatica was known to convert cyclic a&#8208;diketones with appropriate preference. Here, we extend the spectrum of suitable enzymes by three alcohol dehydrogenases from Citrifermentans bemidjiense (CibADH), Deferrisoma camini (DecADH), and Thauera phenylacetica (ThpADH). Of these, DecADH is characterized by very high thermostability; CibADH and ThpADH convert a&#8208;halogenated cyclohexanones with increased activity. Otherwise, however, the substrate spectrum of all four ADHs is highly conserved. Structural considerations led to the conclusion that conversion of diketones requires not only the expansion of the active site into a large binding pocket, but also the circumferential modification of almost all amino acid residues that form the first shell of the binding pocket. The constellation appears to be overall highly specific for the relative positioning of the carbonyl functions and the size of the C&#8208;ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Hybrid Peptide&#8722;DNA Nanostructures using Homotrimeric Coiled&#8208;Coil/Nucleic Acid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modified a peptide that forms a homotrimeric coiled&#8208;coil with DNA handles, leading to a three&#8208;way peptide&#8722;DNA junction. This hybrid assembly could organize DNA tiles into trimeric species, or close up a triangular DNA base into a hybrid peptide&#8722;DNA tetrahedron. This new peptide&#8722;DNA building block could enable new functional nanomaterials.







Abstract
Peptides and DNA are two of the most commonly used self&#8208;assembling biological molecules for the construction of nanomaterials. However, there are only a few examples that combine these two self&#8208;assembly motifs as key structural elements in a nanostructure. We report on the synthesis of a peptide&#8722;DNA conjugate that self&#8208;assembles into a stable homotrimer based on the coiled&#8208;coil motif. The hybrid peptide&#8722;DNA trimer was then used as a novel three&#8208;way junction to link together either small DNA tile nanostructures, or to close up a triangular wireframe DNA structure. The resulting nanostructures were characterized by atomic force microscopy, and compared with a scrambled, non&#8208;assembling peptide as a control. These hybrid nanostructures enable the integration of peptide motifs and potentially bio&#8208;functionality with DNA nanostructures, and open the door to novel nano&#8208;materials that have the advantages of both molecules.

         <title>Unfolding under pressure: an NMR perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review aims at analysing the role of solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in pressure&#8208;induced in vitro studies of protein unfolding. Although this transition has for many years been neglected because of technical difficulties, it provides important information about the forces that keep together protein structure. We first analyse what is pressure unfolding. We then provide a critical overview of how NMR has contributed to the field and evaluate the observables used in these studies. Finally, we discuss the commonalities and differences between pressure&#8208;, cold&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced unfolding. We conclude that, while within specific peculiarities, cold and pressure denaturation both rely on the important contribution of the state of hydration of non&#8208;polar side&#8208;chains as a major factor that determines the pressure dependence of the conformational stability of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the selectivity of light active anti&#8208;microbial agents &#8211; or how to get a photosensitizer to the desired target?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitizers combine the inherent reactivity of reactive oxygen species with the sophisticated reaction control of light. Through selective targeting these light&#8208;active molecules have the potential to overcome certain limitations in drug discovery. Ongoing advances in the synthesis and evaluation of photosensitizer conjugates with biomolecules such as antibodies, peptides or small molecule drugs are leading to increasingly powerful agents for the eradication of a growing number of microbial species. This review article therefore summarizes challenges and opportunities in the development of selective photosensitizers and their conjugates described in recent literature. This provides adequate insight for newcomers and those interested in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Mechanistic Investigations of Biocatalytic Nitrenoid C&#8208;H Functionalizations via Engineered Heme Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineered heme proteins were developed to possess numerous excellent biocatalytic nitrenoid C&#8208;H functionalizations. Computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT), hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were employed to help understand some important mechanistic aspects of these heme nitrene transfer reactions. This review summarizes advances of computational reaction pathway results of these biocatalytic intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8208;H aminations/amidations, focusing on mechanistic origins of reactivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity as well as effects of substrate substituent, axial ligand, metal center, and protein environment. Some important common and distinctive mechanistic features of these reactions were also described with brief outlook of future development.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of the RNA&#8208;binding and regulating protein LIN28 have the potential to be developed as chemical probes for biological perturbation and as therapeutic candidates. Reported small molecules disrupting the interaction between LIN28 and let&#8208;7 miRNA suffer from moderate to weak inhibitory activity and flat structure&#8208;activity relationship, which hindered the development of next&#8208;generation LIN28 inhibitors that warrant further evaluations. We report herein the identification of new LIN28 inhibitors utilizing a spirocyclization strategy based on a chromenopyrazole scaffold. Representative compounds 2&#8208;5 showed potent in vitro inhibitory activity against LIN28&#8211;let&#8208;7 interaction and single&#8208;digit micromolar potency in inhibiting the proliferation of LIN28&#8208;expressed JAR cancer cells. The spirocyclic compound 5 incorporated a position that is amenable for functional group appendage and further structural modifications. The binding mode of compound 5 with the LIN28 cold shock domain was rationalized via a molecular docking analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic approaches of epoxysuccinate chemical probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic chemical probes are powerful tools for investigation of biological processes. They are particularly useful for proteomic studies such as Activity Based Protein Profiling (ABPP). These chemical methods initially used mimics of natural substrates. As the techniques gained prominence, more and more elaborated chemical probes with increased specificity towards given enzyme/protein families and amenability to various reaction conditions have been used. Among chemical probes, peptidyl&#8208;epoxysuccinates represent one of the first type of compounds used to investigate activity of cysteine proteases papain&#8208;like family of enzymes. Structurally derived from the natural substrate to date exists a wide body of inhibitors and activity&#8208; or affinity&#8208;based probes bearing the electrophilic oxirane unit for covalent labelling of active enzymes. Herein we review the literature regarding the synthetic approaches to epoxysuccinate&#8208;based chemical probes together with the reported applications, from biological chemistry and inhibition studies to supramolecular chemistry and formation of protein arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>SNAP&#8208;targeted MRI&#8208;Fluorescent agents for multimodal imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging modality, highly employed in research and clinical settings. However, MRI images suffers from low signals and lack of target specificity. We aimed to develop a multimodal imaging probe to detect targeted&#8208;cells by MRI and fluorescence microscopy. We synthesized a tri&#8208;functional imaging probe consisting of a SNAP&#8208;tag substrate for irreversible and specific labeling of cells, cyanine dyes for bright fluorescence, and a chelated Gd(III) molecule for enhancing MRI&#8208;contrast. Our probes exhibit specific and efficient labelling of genetically&#8208;defined cells (expressing SNAP at their membrane), bright fluorescence and MRI signal. Our synthetic approach provides a versatile platform for production of multimodal imaging probes, particularly for light microscopy and MRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and characterization of selective FAK inhibitors and PROTACs with in vivo activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an attractive drug target due to its overexpression in cancer. FAK functions as a non&#8208;receptor tyrosine kinase and scaffolding protein, coordinating several downstream signaling effectors and cellular processes. While drug discovery efforts have largely focused on targeting FAK kinase activity, FAK inhibitors have failed to show efficacy as single agents in clinical trials. Here, using structure&#8208;guided design, we report the development of a selective FAK inhibitor (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;175) and degrader (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146) to evaluate the consequences and advantages of abolishing all FAK activity in cancer models. BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 achieves rapid and potent FAK degradation with high proteome&#8208;wide specificity in cancer cells and induces durable degradation in mice. Compared to kinase inhibition, targeted degradation of FAK exhibits pronounced improved activity on downstream signaling and cancer cell viability and migration. Together, BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;175 and BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 are valuable chemical tools to dissect the specific consequences of targeting FAK through small molecule inhibition or degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Ubiquitin and Histone Tools for Studying Post&#8208;translational Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) regulate nearly all biological processes in eukaryotic cells, and synthetic PTM protein tools are widely used to detect the activity of the related enzymes and identify the interacting proteins in cell lysates. Recently, the study of these enzymes and the interacting proteome has been accomplished in live cells using cell&#8208;permeable PTM protein tools. In this concept, we will introduce cell penetrating techniques, the syntheses of cell&#8208;permeable PTM protein tools, and offer some future perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Metal Complexes for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global problem with more than 1 million deaths due to AMR infection in 2019 alone. New and innovative therapeutics are required to overcome this challenge. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a rapidly growing area of research poised to provide much needed help in the fight against AMR. aPDT works by administering a photosensitizer (PS), which is activated only when irradiated with light, allowing high spatiotemporal control and selectivity. The PS typically generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage a variety of key biological targets, potentially circumventing existing resistance mechanisms. Metal complexes are well known to display excellent optoelectronic properties and recent focus has begun to shift towards their application in tackling microbial infections. We herein review the last 5 years of progress in the emerging field of small molecule metal complex PSs for aPDT.</dc:description>
