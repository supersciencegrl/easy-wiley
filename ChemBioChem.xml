         <title>Immobilization and Application of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its discovery in 2017, the fatty acid decarboxylase (FAP) photoenzyme has been the focus of extensive research, given its ability to convert fatty acids into alka(e)nes using merely visible blue light. Unfortunately, there are still some drawbacks that limit the applicability of this biocatalyst, such as poor solubility of the substrates in aqueous media, poor photostability, and the impossibility of reusing the catalyst for several cycles. In this work, we demonstrated the use of FAP in non&#8208;conventional media as a free enzyme and an immobilized preparation. Namely, its applicability in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and a  proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept  immobilization using a commercial His&#8208;tag selective carrier, performing a thorough study of reaction and immobilization conditions in each case, as well as reusability studies were shown. We observed an almost complete selectivity of the enzyme towards C18 decarboxylation over C16 when used in a DES, with a product analytical yield up to 81% when using whole cells. Furthermore, when applying the immobilized enzyme in DES, we obtained yields &gt;10&#8208;fold higher than the ones obtained in aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of Selenoprotein F Binding to UDP&#8208;glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) by a Photoreactive Crosslinker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein quality control system, UDP&#8208;glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) functions as a folding sensor. Although it is known to form a heterodimer with selenoprotein F (SelenoF), the details of the complex formation remain obscure. A pulldown assay using co&#8208;transfected SelenoF and truncated mutants of human UGGT1 (HUGT1) revealed that SelenoF binds to the TRXL2 domain of HUGT1. Additionally, a newly developed photoaffinity crosslinker was selectively introduced into cysteine residues of recombinant SelenoF to determine the spatial orientation of SelenoF to HUGT1. The crosslinking experiments showed that SelenoF formed a covalent bond with amino acids in the TRXL3 region and the interdomain between &#946;S2 and GT24 of HUGT1 via the synthetic crosslinker. SelenoF might play a role in assessing and refining the disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins in the hydrophobic cavity of HUGT1 as it binds to the highly flexible region of HUGT1 to reach its long hydrophobic cavity. Clarification of the SelenoF&#8208;binding domain of UGGT and its relative position will help predict and reveal the function of SelenoF from a structural perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Human Neuroglobin into a Cytochrome c&#8208;like Protein with a Single Thioether Bond in Non&#8208;native State</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A double mutant of human H64M/V71C neuroglobin (Ngb) was engineered, which formed a single thioether bond as that in atypical cytochrome c, whereas the heme distal Met64 was oxidized to both sulfoxide (SO&#8208;Met) and sulfone (SO2&#8208;Met). By contrast, no Cys&#8208;heme cross&#8208;link was formed in V71C Ngb with His64/His96 coordination, as shown by the X&#8208;ray crystal structure, which indicates that an open distal site facilitates the activation of heme iron for structural modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Reveals Protein Tyrosination Extends Beyond the Alpha&#8208;Tubulins in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tubulin detyrosination&#8208;tyrosination cycle regulates the stability of microtubules. Thus far described on &#160; &#945;&#8208;tubulins, the tyrosination level is maintained by a single tubulin&#8208;tyrosine ligase (TTL). However, the precise dynamics and tubulin isoforms which undergo (de)tyrosination in neurons are unknown. Here, we exploit the substrate promiscuity of the TTL to introduce an&#160;  O  &#8208;propargyl&#8208; l &#8208;tyrosine&#160; in neuroblastoma cells and neurons. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemical proteomics in neuroblastoma cells using the&#160;  O  &#8208;propargyl&#8208; l &#8208;tyrosine probe&#160; revealed previously discussed tyrosination of TUBA4A, MAPRE1, and other non&#8208;tubulin proteins. This finding was further corroborated in differentiating neurons. Together we present the method for tubulin tyrosination profiling in living cells. Our results show that detyrosination&#8208;tyrosination is not restricted to &#945;&#8208;tubulins with coded C&#8208;terminal tyrosine and is thus involved in fine&#8208;tuning of the&#160; tubulin&#160; and non&#8208;tubulin proteins during neuronal differentiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
As exemplified with TZM&#8208;E9, a foldable detergent with an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance is able to form stable micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors. Detergent foldability is favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability and represents a new concept that can be utilized for novel detergent development for membrane protein structural study.







Abstract
Detergents are widely used for membrane protein structural study. Many recently developed detergents contain multiple tail and head groups, which are typically connected via a small and branched linker. Due to their inherent compact structures, with small inter&#8208;alkyl chain distances, these detergents form micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors, a feature favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability. A recent study on tandem triazine maltosides (TZMs) revealed a distinct trend; despite possession of an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance, the TZM&#8722;Es were highly effective at stabilizing membrane proteins. Thanks to the incorporation of a flexible spacer between the two triazine rings in the linker region, these detergents are prone to folding into a compact architecture in micellar environments instead of adopting an extended conformation. Detergent foldability represents a new concept of novel detergent design with significant potential for future detergent development.

         <title>NMR Observation of Sulfhydryl Signals in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Aids Structural Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfhydryl signals were shown to be readily observable in nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra of perdeuterated proteins, even for partially solvent&#8208;accessible thiol groups. For dimeric SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, these signals proved invaluable both for achieving nearly complete NMR backbone assignment in both apo&#8208; and substrate&#8208;bound states and for validating structural features.







Abstract
The 68&#8208;kDa homodimeric 3C&#8208;like protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, Mpro (3CLpro/Nsp5), is a key antiviral drug target. NMR spectroscopy of this large system proved challenging and resonance assignments have remained incomplete. Here we present the near&#8208;complete (&gt;97&#8201;%) backbone assignments of a C145A variant of Mpro (MproC145A) both with, and without, the N&#8208;terminal auto&#8208;cleavage substrate sequence, in its native homodimeric state. We also present SILLY (Selective Inversion of thioL and Ligand for NOESY), a simple yet effective pseudo&#8208;3D NMR experiment that utilizes NOEs to identify interactions between Cys&#8208;thiol or aliphatic protons, and their spatially proximate backbone amides in a perdeuterated protein background. High protection against hydrogen exchange is observed for 10 of the 11 thiol groups in MproC145A, even those that are partially accessible to solvent. A combination of SILLY methods and high&#8208;resolution triple&#8208;resonance NMR experiments reveals site&#8208;specific interactions between Mpro, its substrate peptides, and other ligands, which present opportunities for competitive binding studies in future drug design efforts.

         <title>Incorporation of an Asymmetric Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S Cluster as an Artificial Cofactor into Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a synthetic asymmetric Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S cluster, [Cp*MoFe5S9(SH)]3&#8722;, into the active site of the cofactor&#8208;free nitrogenase scaffold results a semi&#8208;artificial enzyme that catalytically reduces C2H2 to C2H4, and CN&#8722; into short&#8208;chain hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Nitrogenase employs a sophisticated electron transfer system and a Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S&#8722;C cofactor, designated the M&#8208;cluster [(cit)MoFe7S9C]), to reduce atmospheric N2 to bioaccessible NH3. Previously, we have shown that the cofactor&#8208;free form of nitrogenase can be repurposed as a protein scaffold for the incorporation of a synthetic Fe&#8722;S cluster [Fe6S9(SEt)2]4&#8722;. Here, we demonstrate the utility of an asymmetric Mo&#8722;Fe&#8722;S cluster [Cp*MoFe5S9(SH)]3&#8722; as an alternative artificial cofactor upon incorporation into the cofactor&#8208;free nitrogenase scaffold. The resultant semi&#8208;artificial enzyme catalytically reduces C2H2 to C2H4, and CN&#8722; into short&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, yet it is clearly distinct in activity from its [Fe6S9(SEt)2]4&#8722;&#8208;reconstituted counterpart, pointing to the possibility to employ molecular design and cluster synthesis strategies to further develop semi&#8208;artificial or artificial systems with desired catalytic activities.

         <title>Selective Exoenzymatic Labeling of Lipooligosaccharides of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with &#945;2,6&#8208;Sialoside Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective exoenzymatic labeling (SEEL) can be applied as a glycoengineering technique for the modification of cell surface glycans on live bacteria; in this case the recombinant glycosyltransferase ST6Gal1 installed synthetic &#945;2,6&#8208;sialoside derivatives with a reporter group on the lipooligosaccharides of the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae.







Abstract
The interactions between bacteria and their host often rely on recognition processes that involve host or bacterial glycans. Glycoengineering techniques make it possible to modify and study the glycans on the host's eukaryotic cells, but only a few are available for the study of bacterial glycans. Here, we have adapted selective exoenzymatic labeling (SEEL), a chemical reporter strategy, to label the lipooligosaccharides of the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae, using the recombinant glycosyltransferase ST6Gal1, and three synthetic CMP&#8208;sialic acid derivatives. We show that SEEL treatment does not affect cell viability and can introduce an &#945;2,6&#8208;linked sialic acid with a reporter group on the lipooligosaccharides by Western blot, flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. This new bacterial glycoengineering technique allows for the precise modification, here with &#945;2,6&#8208;sialoside derivatives, and direct detection of specific surface glycans on live bacteria, which will aid in further unravelling the precise biological functions of bacterial glycans.

         <title>Lectin Drug Conjugates Targeting High Mannose N&#8208;Glycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A toxin delivery system that targets the aberrant presentation of high mannose N&#8208;glycans on cancer cells is described. This delivery system leverages lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that were prepared using a high mannose N&#8208;glycan binding lectin that is site specifically functionalized at the C&#8208;terminus with peptide toxin via a sortase ligation. In vitro studies demonstrate that the described LDCs potently and preferentially induce apoptosis in high mannose N&#8208;glycans presenting cancer cells.







Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated alterations to glycosylation have been shown to aid cancer development and progression. An increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been observed in several cancers. Here, we describe the preparation of lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that permit toxin delivery to cancer cells presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Additionally, we demonstrate that cancer cells presenting low levels of high mannose N&#8208;glycans can be rendered sensitive to the LDCs by co&#8208;treatment with a type I mannosidase inhibitor. Our findings establish that an increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans in the glycocalyx of cancer cells can be leveraged to enable toxin delivery.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A toxin delivery system&lt;/b&gt; that targets the aberrant presentation of high mannose N-glycans on cancer cells is described. This delivery system leverages lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that were prepared using a high mannose N-glycan binding lectin that is site specifically functionalized at the C-terminus with peptide toxin via a sortase ligation. In vitro studies demonstrate that the described LDCs potently and preferentially induce apoptosis in high mannose N-glycans presenting cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer-associated alterations to glycosylation have been shown to aid cancer development and progression. An increased abundance of high mannose N-glycans has been observed in several cancers. Here, we describe the preparation of lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that permit toxin delivery to cancer cells presenting high mannose N-glycans. Additionally, we demonstrate that cancer cells presenting low levels of high mannose N-glycans can be rendered sensitive to the LDCs by co-treatment with a type I mannosidase inhibitor.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Containing Simple Dioxo Ligands: a Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study Shows the Importance of the Charge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;activity relationship study on two self&#8208;consistent series of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes with anionic dioxo ligands showed the importance of combining the positive charge of the complex with a highly lipophilic diimine ligand for obtaining good cellular uptake and cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Platinum complexes (i.&#8201;e., cisplatin, carboplatin, and others) are currently heavily used for the treatment of different types of cancer, but unwanted effects occur. Ruthenium complexes have been shown to be potential promising alternatives to these metal&#8208;based drugs. In this work, we performed a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study on two small series of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes of the type [Ru(L1)2(O^O)]Cln (3&#8211;8), where L1 is 4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline (DIP) or 1,10&#8208;phenantroline (phen), and O^O is a symmetrical anionic dioxo ligand: oxalate (ox, n=0), malonate (mal, n=0), or acetylacetonate (acac, n=1). These two self&#8208;consistent series of compounds allowed us to perform a systematic investigation for establishing how the nature of the ligands and the charge affect the anticancer properties of the complexes. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines demonstrated that some of the six compounds 3&#8211;8 have a promising anticancer activity. More specifically, the cationic complex [Ru(DIP)2(&#951;2&#8208;acac)]Cl (4) has IC50 values in the mid&#8208;nanomolar concentration range, lower than those of cisplatin on the same cell lines. Interestingly, [Ru(DIP)2(&#951;2&#8208;acac)]Cl was found to localize mainly in the mitochondria, whereas a smaller fraction was detected in the nucleus. Overall, our SAR investigation demonstrates the importance of combining the positive charge of the complex with the highly lipophilic diimine ligand DIP.

         <title>The Fluorescent Enzyme Cascade Detects Low Abundance Protein Modifications Suitable for the Assembly of Functionally Annotated Modificatome Databases</title>

Deciphering the &#8216;modificatome&#8217;: We introduce fluorescent enzyme cascades which sensitively detect protein modifications and allow their functional assignment using digital pattern libraries.







Abstract
Pathophysiological functions of proteins critically depend on both their chemical composition, including post&#8208;translational modifications, and their three&#8208;dimensional structure, commonly referred to as structure&#8208;activity relationship. Current analytical methods, like capillary electrophoresis or mass spectrometry, suffer from limitations, such as the detection of unexpected modifications at low abundance and their insensitivity to conformational changes. Building on previous enzyme&#8208;based analytical methods, we here introduce a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme cascade (fEC), which can detect diverse chemical and conformational variations in protein samples and assemble them into digital databases. Together with complementary analytical methods an automated fEC analysis established unique modification&#8208;function relationships, which can be expanded to a proteome&#8208;wide scale, i.&#8201;e. a functionally annotated modificatome. The fEC offers diverse applications, including hypersensitive biomarker detection in complex samples.

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of a Functionalized GFP Nanobody</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of a full&#8208;length nanobody against GFP ready for selective on&#8208;demand functionalization is described. The folded synthetic nanobody is obtained via a native chemical ligation&#8208;desulfurization strategy and converted into probes by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The probes bind their target with high affinity which was validated in pulldown&#8208; and confocal microscopy experiments.







Abstract
Chemical protein synthesis has proven to be a powerful tool to access homogenously modified proteins. The chemical synthesis of nanobodies (Nb) would create possibilities to design tailored Nbs with a range of chemical modifications such as tags, linkers, reporter groups, and subsequently, Nb&#8208;drug conjugates. Herein, we describe the total chemical synthesis of a 123 amino&#8208;acid Nb against GFP. A native chemical ligation&#8208; desulfurization strategy was successfully applied for the synthesis of this GFP Nb, modified with a propargyl (PA) moiety for on&#8208;demand functionalization. Biophysical characterization indicated that the synthetic GFP Nb&#8208;PA was correctly folded after internal disulfide bond formation. The synthetic Nb&#8208;PA was functionalized with a biotin or a sulfo&#8208;cyanine5 dye by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), resulting in two distinct probes used for functional in&#8197;vitro validation in pull&#8208;down and confocal microscopy settings.

         <title>Photochemical and Molecular Dynamics Studies of Halide Binding in Flavoenzyme Glucose Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the halide&#8208;free GOX, Cl&#8722; binding results in disappearance of fluorescence. By contrast, F&#8722; binding leads to less efficient, and kinetically more homogeneous, fluorescence quenching. Such contrasting effects are rationalized by the differences in the binding behavior of F&#8722; and Cl&#8722; to the protein active site.







Abstract
Glucose oxidase (GOX), a characteristic flavoprotein oxidase with widespread industrial applications, binds fluoride (F&#8722;) and chloride (Cl&#8722;). We investigated binding properties of halide inhibitors of GOX through time&#8208;resolved spectral characterization of flavin&#8208;related photochemical processes and molecular dynamic simulations. Cl&#8722; and F&#8722; bind differently to the protein active site and have substantial but opposite effects on the population and decay of the flavin excited state. Cl&#8722; binds closer to the flavin, whose excited&#8208;state decays in &lt;100&#8197;fs due to anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such interactions appear absent in F&#8722; binding, which, however, significantly increases the active&#8208;site rigidity leading to more homogeneous, picosecond fluorescence decay kinetics. These findings are discussed in relation to the mechanism of halide inhibition of GOX by occupying the accommodation site of catalytic intermediates and increasing the active&#8208;site rigidity.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Based Design of the First GlnA4&#8208;Specific Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
GlnA4 catalyses ATP&#8208;dependent glutamylation of ethanolamine and is essential for ethanolamine metabolization in Streptomyces coelicolor. We rationally developed a GlnA4&#8208;specific inhibitor derived from methionine sulfoximine, the gold standard inhibitor for glutamine synthetase. The novel inhibitor shows no inhibition of glutamine synthetase but blocks GlnA4 activity in&#8197;vitro and intracellularly.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Glutamylamine synthetases are an important class of enzymes that play a key role in glutamate&#8208;based metabolism. Methionine sulfoximine (MSO) is a well&#8208;established inhibitor for the archetypal glutamine synthetase (GS) but inhibitors for most GS&#8208;like enzymes are unknown. Assuming a conserved catalytic mechanism for GS and GS&#8208;like enzymes, we explored if subtype&#8208;selective inhibitors can be obtained by merging MSO with the cognate substrates of the respective GS&#8208;like enzymes. Using GlnA4Sc from Streptomyces coelicolor, an enzyme recently shown to produce &#947;&#8208;glutamylethanolamine, we demonstrate that MSO can be reengineered in a straightforward fashion into potent and selective GlnA4Sc inhibitors. Linkage chemistry as well as linker length between the MSO moiety and the terminal hydroxyl group derived from ethanolamine were in agreement with the postulated phosphorylated catalytic intermediate. The best GlnA4 inhibitor 7&#8201;b potently blocked S. coelicolor growth in the presence of ethanolamine as the sole nitrogen source. Our results provide the first GlnA4Sc&#8208;specific inhibitors and suggest a general strategy to develop mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors for GS&#8208;like enzymes.

         <title>A Photochemoenzymatic Hunsdiecker&#8208;Borodin&#8208;Type Halodecarboxylation of Ferulic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halodecarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ferulic acid was achieved by combining photo&#8208;, bio&#8208; and phase transfer catalysis in a biphasic system. Reactive hypobromite was formed in&#8197;situ by combining Blue&#8208;LED and vanadium chloroperoxidase, and efficiently transferred from the aqueous to the organic layer by a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst, improving overall performance and selectivity.







Abstract
A photochemoenzymatic halodecarboxylation of ferulic acid was achieved using vanadate&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase as (bio)catalyst and oxygen and organic solvent as sole stoichiometric reagents in a biphasic system. Performance and selectivity were improved through a phase transfer catalyst, reaching a turnover number of 660.000 for the enzyme.

         <title>FRET&#8208;Based Cathepsin Probes for Simultaneous Detection of Cathepsin B and D Activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA conjugated FRET&#8208;based probes for cathepsin B and cathepsin D were designed to simultaneously detect the activity of both cathepsins.







Abstract
Fluorescent cathepsin probes were prepared by modification of peptidic substrates for cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin D (CTSD) with FRET pairs. Fluorophores with distinguishable emission characteristics were applied to CTSB and CTSD probes with their appropriate quenchers to simultaneously monitor the activity of CTSB and/or CTSD. Conjugation of both the CTSB and CTSD probes with short single&#8208;stranded DNA drastically increased their reactivity to cathepsins over the parent probes possibly by improving their solubility. The activity of CTSB and CTSD were simultaneously detected by using these orthogonal FRET&#8208;based cathepsin probes.

         <title>Chemical Conjugation to Less Targeted Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective conjugation to the multitude of functional groups at the surface of proteins is challenging. Most commonly lysine, cysteine or tyrosine are targeted, however in recent years a range of innovative methods have been developed to selectively target other amino acids at proteins and these methods are the focus of this review.







Abstract
Protein bioconjugates are in high demand for applications in biomedicine, diagnostics, chemical biology and bionanotechnology. Proteins are large and sensitive molecules containing multiple different functional groups and in particular nucleophilic groups. In bioconjugation reactions it can therefore be challenging to obtain a homogeneous product in high yield. Numerous strategies for protein conjugation have been developed, of which a vast majority target lysine, cysteine and to a lesser extend tyrosine. Likewise, several methods that involve recombinantly engineered protein tags have been reported. In recent years a number of methods have emerged for chemical bioconjugation to other amino acids and in this review, we present the progress in this area.

         <title>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Papain&#8208;Like Protease: Structure, Function and Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 19, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viral mutations highlight the importance of exploring a broad range of antiviral drug targets. The involvement of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease in the viral replication cycle and the host immune response offers a unique possibility for drug development. In our review, we focus on the structure and function of PLpro and discuss prospects of current inhibitors.







Abstract
Emerging variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and potential novel epidemic coronaviruses underline the importance of investigating various viral proteins as potential drug targets. The papain&#8208;like protease of coronaviruses has been less explored than other viral proteins; however, its substantive role in viral replication and impact on the host immune response make it a suitable target to study. This review article focuses on the structure and function of the papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, including variants of concern, and compares it to those of other coronaviruses, such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;1 and MERS&#8208;CoV. The protease's recognition motif is mirrored in ubiquitin and ISG15, which are involved in the antiviral immune response.

     alt="SARS-CoV-2 Papain-Like Protease: Structure, Function and Inhibition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Viral mutations&lt;/b&gt; highlight the importance of exploring a broad range of antiviral drug targets. The involvement of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease in the viral replication cycle and the host immune response offers a unique possibility for drug development. In our review, we focus on the structure and function of PL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; and discuss prospects of current inhibitors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 and potential novel epidemic coronaviruses underline the importance of investigating various viral proteins as potential drug targets. The papain-like protease of coronaviruses has been less explored than other viral proteins; however, its substantive role in viral replication and impact on the host immune response make it a suitable target to study. This review article focuses on the structure and function of the papain-like protease (PL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and compares it to those of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. The protease's recognition motif is mirrored in ubiquitin and ISG15, which are involved in the antiviral immune response. Inhibitors, including GRL0617 derivatives, and their prospects as potential future antiviral agents are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bicyclic Caged Morpholino Oligonucleotides for Optical Gene Silencing
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caged morpholino oligonucleotides allow light&#8208;dependent gene silencing in whole organisms. In this study, a new type of caged morpholino with a bicyclic geometry was developed. Ultraviolet light linearizes the bicyclic structure through self&#8208;immolative linker cleavage, leading to targeted RNA silencing in zebrafish embryos.







Abstract
Caged morpholino oligonucleotides (cMOs) are synthetic tools that allow light&#8208;inducible gene silencing in live organisms. Previously reported cMOs have utilized hairpin, duplex, and cyclic structures, as well as caged nucleobases. While these antisense technologies enable efficient optical control of RNA splicing and translation, they can have limited dynamic range. A new caging strategy was developed where the two MO termini are conjugated to an internal position through a self&#8208;immolative trifunctional linker, thereby generating a bicyclic cMO that is conformationally resistant to RNA binding. The efficacy of this alternative cMO design has been demonstrated in zebrafish embryos and compared to linear MOs and monocyclic constructs.

         <title>Investigation of the Transporting Behavior of Framework DNA Nano&#8208;Devices Across the Artificial Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier (BBB)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three framework DNA origami structures with equal molecular weight but different shape, size and rigidity were compared in parallel to investigate their penetration behaviors cross an artificial blood&#8208;brain barrier and potential mechanisms.







Abstract
This study focused on exploring the ability of self&#8208;assembled DNA frameworks to cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). We designed and assembled a series of DNA origami structures with equal quantity of nucleic acid materials but different morphologies and rigidities, such as barrel, soccer ball, icosahedron, and compared their transport efficiency in an in&#8197;vitro BBB model. It was observed that the relatively large and soft structures could better penetrate the BBB through a lysosome irrelative transcytosis process, while the smallest and most rigid structure was blocked severally accompanied with an obvious lysosome digestion once internalized by the endothelial cells.

         <title>New Transmission&#8208;Selective Antimalarial Agents through Hit&#8208;to&#8208;Lead Optimization of 2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamido)benzoic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel derivatives of 2&#8208;(arylcarboxamido)benzoic acid, 2&#8208;(arylsulfonamido)benzoic acid and N&#8208;(2&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;arylcarboxamide, synthesised with the intent to inhibit mammalian KDM4B, were tested against different life cycle stages of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The most potent of these compounds, a 2&#8208;(arylcarboxamido)benzoic acid derivative, showed potent transmission&#8208;blocking activity possibly through epigenetic mechanisms.







Abstract
Malaria elimination requires multipronged approaches, including the application of antimalarial drugs able to block human&#8208;to&#8208;mosquito transmission of malaria parasites. The transmissible gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum seem to be highly sensitive towards epidrugs, particularly those targeting demethylation of histone post&#8208;translational marks. Here, we report exploration of compounds from a chemical library generated during hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead optimization of inhibitors of the human histone lysine demethylase, KDM4B. Derivatives of 2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamido) benzoic acid, around either the amide or a sulfonamide linker backbone (2&#8208;(arylcarboxamido)benzoic acid, 2&#8208;carboxamide (arylsulfonamido)benzoic acid and N&#8208;(2&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;arylcarboxamide), showed potent activity towards late&#8208;stage gametocytes (stage IV/V) of P. falciparum, with the most potent compound reaching single digit nanomolar activity. Structure&#8208;activity relationship trends were evident and frontrunner compounds also displayed microsomal stability and favourable solubility profiles. Simplified synthetic routes support further derivatization of these compounds for further development of these series as malaria transmission&#8208;blocking agents.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Labeling to Visualize Intercellular Contacts Using Lipidated SortaseA
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and versatile strategy is introduced for the selective fluorescent labeling of intercellular contacting cells. A transpeptidase sortase A and its substrate triglycine peptide (GGGYC sequence) were chemically conjugated with a lipidated polymer and then anchored onto the membranes of different cells. The triglycine modified cells (displayed in red) were labeled with a fluorescent dye by contacting with the sortase A&#8208;modified cells based on proximity&#8208;dependent transpeptidation with a dye&#8208;modified labeling peptide (DLPETGG sequence). More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Yamaguchi, A. Okamoto et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>DNA programmable structures of various morphologies have attracted extensive attention due to their potential for materials science and biomedical applications. &#160;Here, we report the formation of micro&#8208;sized hexagons via assembly of only one pair of short double&#8208;stranded DNA in buffer&#8208;salt poly(ethylene glycol) solution. &#160;Each DNA strand had complementary bases with a two&#8208;base overhang. &#160;The procedure of heating and subsequent cooling of blunt&#8208;ended double&#8208;stranded DNA resulted in different assemblies. &#160;These results indicated that end&#8208;to&#8208;end adhesion at the terminals induced by complementary overhangs were required to construct the hexagonal DNA assemblies. &#160;The stable formation of the hexagons was highly dependent on heating temperature. In addition, concentration adjustments of DNA and poly(ethylene glycol) were essential. &#160;The circular dichroism spectral measurements and polarization microscopy observations indicated a parallel alignment of double&#8208;stranded DNA in the hexagonal platelet. &#160;Self&#8208;assembled micro&#8208;sized hexagons composed of simple building blocks may have great potential for future biomedical device development.</dc:description>

         <title>Genomics&#8208;Guided Efficient Identification of 2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazine Derivatives from Actinobacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining combined with heterologous expression has been demonstrated to be an efficient way to identify novel 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine derivatives from actinobacteria. Meanwhile, their biosynthetic pathways and new enzymes embedded inside have been functionally characterized. It is expected that more biologically active diketopiperazines can be obtained by exploring the genetic potentials of microorganism in the future.







Abstract
Secondary metabolites derived from microorganism constitute an important part of natural products. Mining of the microbial genomes revealed a large number of uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters, indicating their greater potential to synthetize specialized or secondary metabolites (SMs) than identified by classic fermentation and isolation approaches. Various bioinformatics tools have been developed to analyze and identify such gene clusters, thus accelerating significantly the mining process. Heterologous expression of an individual biosynthetic gene cluster has been proven as an efficient way to activate the genes and identify the encoded metabolites that cannot be detected under normal laboratory cultivation conditions. Herein, we describe a concept of genomics&#8208;guided approach by performing genome mining and heterologous expression to uncover novel CDPS&#8208;derived DKPs and functionally characterize novel tailoring enzymes embedded in the biosynthetic pathways. Recent works focused on the identification of the nucleobase&#8208;related and dimeric DKPs are also presented.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A wide array of optogenetic tools is available that allow for precise spatiotemporal control over many cellular processes. These tools have been especially popular among zebrafish researchers who take advantage of the embryo's transparency. However, photocleavable optogenetic proteins have not been utilized in zebrafish. We demonstrate successful optical control of protein cleavage in embryos using PhoCl, a photocleavable fluorescent protein. This optogenetic tool offers temporal and spatial control over protein cleavage events, which we demonstrate in light&#8208;triggered protein translocation and apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Grid&#8208;type Quaternary Metallosupramolecular Compounds Inhibit Human Cholinesterases through Dynamic Multivalent Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the implementation of coordination complexes containing two types of cationic moieties, i.e. pyridinium and ammonium quaternary salt, as potential inhibitors of human cholinesterase enzymes. Utilization of ligands containing&#160;NNO&#8208;coordination site&#160;and binding zinc metal ion allowed obtaining mono&#8208; and tetra&#8208;nuclear complexes with corner and grid structural type respectively, thus affecting the overall charge of the compounds (from +1 to +8).&#160;It enabled for the first time to examine the multivalency effect of metallosupramolecular species on their inhibitory abilities towards&#160;acetylcholinesterase&#160;(AChE) and&#160;butyrylcholinesterase&#160;(BChE).&#160;Importantly, resolution of the crystal structures of the obtained enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes provided a&#160;better understanding of the inhibition process at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nanocarbon&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (NC&#8208;FET) biosensors are at the forefront of future diagnostic technology. By integrating biological molecules with electrically conducting carbon&#8208;based platforms, high sensitivity real&#8208;time multiplexed sensing is possible. Combined with their small footprint, portability, ease of use, and label&#8208;free sensing mechanisms, NC&#8208;FETs are prime candidates for the rapidly expanding areas of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing, environmental monitoring and biosensing as a whole.

         <title>Harnessing Split&#8208;Inteins as a Tool for the Selective Modification of Surface Receptors in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical studies of integral membrane proteins are often hampered by low purification yields and technical limitations such as aggregation causing  in vitro  manipulations to be challenging. The ability of controlling proteins in live cells bypasses these limitations while broadening the scope of accessible questions owing to the proteins being in their native environment. Here we take advantage of the intein biorthogonality to mammalian systems, site specificity, fast kinetics, and auto processing nature as an attractive option for modifying surface proteins. Using EGFR as a model, we demonstrate that the split&#8208;intein pair Ava  N  / Npu  C  can be used to efficiently and specifically modify target membrane proteins with a synthetic adduct for downstream live cell application.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many pathogens blunt immune responses by lacking immunogenic structural features, which typically results in disease. Here, we show evidence suggesting that pathogen immunogenicity can be chemically enhanced. Using supramolecular host&#8208;guest chemistry, we complexed onto the surface of a poorly immunogenic bacterium (  Staphylococcus aureus  ) a TLR7 agonist&#8208;based adjuvant. &#8220;Adjuvanted&#8221; bacteria were still readily recognized by macrophages and induced a more pro&#8208;inflammatory immunophenotype. Future applications of this concept could yield treatment modalities that bolster the immune system&#8217;s response to pathogenic microbes.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Peptide Hydrogel for accelerated wound healing: Impact of N&#8208;terminal and C&#8208;terminal modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, peptide&#8208;based hydrogels have emerged as efficient biomaterials. The ability to mimic extracellular matrix environments broadens their biomedical applications, including 3D cell culturing, drug delivery, tissue engineering, and wound healing. While extensive research efforts are inclined to decipher the effect of amino acid switching or shuffling on the self&#8208;assembly of peptides, the action of the terminal protecting group requires prime attention and is still in its infancy. Keeping this in mind, herein, we report the comparative study of the effect of Fmoc (N&#8208;fluorenyl&#8208;9&#8208;methoxycarbonyl) and acetyl group as N&#8208;terminal protecting group in the ultra&#8208;short peptide (LIVAGD) undergoing self&#8208;assembly to form hydrogel. Additionally, C&#8208;terminal amino acid substitution in the self&#8208;assemblies of Fmoc LIVAGD and Fmoc LIVAGK was also explored. To examine the efficacy and potency of the hydrogels; MTT, antimicrobial, antihaemolytic, and anti&#8208;inflammatory assays were performed.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, peptide-based hydrogels have emerged as efficient biomaterials. The ability to mimic extracellular matrix environments broadens their biomedical applications, including 3D cell culturing, drug delivery, tissue engineering, and wound healing. While extensive research efforts are inclined to decipher the effect of amino acid switching or shuffling on the self-assembly of peptides, the action of the terminal protecting group requires prime attention and is still in its infancy. Keeping this in mind, herein, we report the comparative study of the effect of Fmoc (N-fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) and acetyl group as N-terminal protecting group in the ultra-short peptide (LIVAGD) undergoing self-assembly to form hydrogel. Additionally, C-terminal amino acid substitution in the self-assemblies of Fmoc LIVAGD and Fmoc LIVAGK was also explored. To examine the efficacy and potency of the hydrogels; MTT, antimicrobial, antihaemolytic, and anti-inflammatory assays were performed. Fmoc enhanced the biocompatibility and support towards cultured cells while lysine provided antibacterial effect to the hydrogel. &#160;In vivo efficacy was examined and Fmoc protected peptides showed better wound healing. RT-PCR and docking studies validated the fact that Fmoc peptides-based hydrogels display anti-inflammatory action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pi&#8208;Class Glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GSTP1)&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probes for Multicolour Imaging with Various Cancer&#8208;Associated Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic GSTP1 substrates relying on an orange or red fluorophore were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. Ps&#8208;CF, one of the synthesized probes, was found to be optimal for detecting intracellular GSTP1 activity and was shown to be applicable to the simultaneous imaging of other cancer&#8208;associated enzymes.







Abstract
Pi&#8208;class glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GSTP1) is highly expressed in a wide variety of human cancer tissues compared to the corresponding normal counterpart. Therefore, GSTP1 is a potential target enzyme for overcoming resistance to chemotherapeutic agents or visualizing specific lesions such as cancer. Here, we present orange and red fluorescence&#8208;emitting probes selective for GSTP1. Carbofluorescein and TokyoMagenta fluorophores were modified with a previously described GSTP1&#8208;selective chromogenic compound to generate orange and red fluorescence probes, respectively. Of these probes, Ps&#8208;CF, the orange fluorescence&#8208;emitting probe, was confirmed to be highly specific for detecting GSTP1 exogenously or endogenously expressed in various cancer cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated that Ps&#8208;CF is applicable for the simultaneous detection of GSTP1 and another cancer&#8208;associated enzyme by using a green fluorescence emitting &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) probe. In conclusion, the fluorescent probes developed in this study enable the simultaneous detection of multiple tumour markers such as GSTP1 with other cancer&#8208;associated enzymes by concurrently using spectrally distinguished fluorescent probes, potentially broadening the scope of cancer detection.

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase 1 Folding Stability as a Target for Molecular Tweezers in SOD1&#8208;Related Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular tweezer CLR01 binds specifically to lysine residues of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and thereby increases its folding stability.







Abstract
Protein misfolding and aggregation are hallmarks of many severe neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. As a supramolecular ligand that binds to lysine and arginine residues, the molecular tweezer CLR01 was found to modify the aggregation pathway of disease&#8208;relevant proteins in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo with beneficial effects on toxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms of how tweezers exert these effects remain mainly unknown, hampering further drug development. Here, we investigate the modulation mechanism of unfolding and aggregation pathways of SOD1, which are involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by CLR01. Using a truncated version of the wildtype SOD1 protein, SOD1bar, we show that CLR01 acts on the first step of the aggregation pathway, the unfolding of the SOD1 monomer. CLR01 increases, by &#8764;10&#8201;&#176;C, the melting temperatures of the A4V and G41D SOD1 mutants, which are commonly observed mutations in familial ALS. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations as well as native mass spectrometry and mutational studies allowed us to identify K61 and K92 as binding sites for the tweezers to mediate the stability increase. The data suggest that the modulation of SOD1 conformational stability is a promising target for future developments of supramolecular ligands against neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Multi&#8208;Functionalization of the Carrier Protein CRM197 by Disulfide Rebridging for Conjugate Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the controlled multi&#8208;functionalization of the widely employed carrier protein CRM197 with a carbohydrate&#8208;based antigen and an immune potentiator has been developed based on the selective reduction of one of the disulfides of CRM197 followed by disulfide rebridging employing an appropriately functionalized dibromopyridazinedione.







Abstract
Conjugation of an antigen to a carrier protein is widely used for vaccine development. To develop the next generation of conjugate vaccines, we describe here a method for the controlled multi&#8208;functionalization of the widely employed carrier protein CRM197 with a carbohydrate&#8208;based antigen and an immune potentiator. The approach is based on the selective reduction of one of the disulfides of CRM197 followed by disulfide rebridging employing an appropriately functionalized dibromopyridazinedione. Efficient protein modification required that the reduction and functionalization with a dibromopyridazinedione was performed as a one&#8208;step procedure with control over the reaction temperature. Furthermore, ligations were most successful when dibromopyridazinediones were employed having a functional entity such as a TLR7/8 agonist and a cyclooctyne for further modification. Site&#8208;specific conjugation avoids modification of T&#8208;epitopes of the carrier protein and covalent attachment of an immune potentiator will ensure that cytokines are produced where the vaccine interacts with relevant immune cells resulting in efficient immune potentiation.

         <title>Thiotemplated Biosynthesis of Bacterial Polyyne Fatty Acids by a Designated Desaturase Triad</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bacterial biosynthesis of polyyne fatty acids such as protegencin proceeds in a thiotemplated manner and involves a designated fatty acyl&#8208;AMP ligase (PgnD), acyl carrier proteins (ACP, PgnG), and a thioesterase (PgnH). While anchored to the ACP, fatty acids undergo polyunsaturation by means of a specialized desaturase triad (PgnEFH) and a redox donor (PgnI). These findings have implications for bioengineering and genome mining.







Abstract
Various bacterial species are capable of producing highly modified fatty acid derivatives with conjugated triple bonds, which play important ecological roles as antifungals and toxins in mutualistic and pathogenic interactions. Furthermore, the terminal polyyne moiety is of interest as pharmacophore and as tag in bioorthogonal chemistry and live imaging. To gain insight into the assembly of these highly reactive natural products, we investigated tetrayne (caryoynencin and protegencin) biosynthesis genes (cay and pgn) from Trinickia caryophylli and Pseudomonas protegens. Pathway dissection and reconstitution in the heterologous host Burkholderia graminis revealed the genes minimally required for polyyne formation. Mutational analyses and biochemical assays demonstrated that polyyne biosynthesis is thiotemplated, involving a fatty acyl&#8208;AMP ligase, a designated acyl carrier protein, and a thioesterase. Heterologous expression of point&#8208;mutated desaturase genes showed that three desaturases work synergistically to introduce four triple bonds. These findings point to an intricate desaturase complex and provide important information for future bioengineering experiments.

         <title>Intracellular protein photoactivation using sterically bulky caging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for intracellular protein photoactivation have been studied to elucidate the spatial and temporal roles of proteins of interest. In this study, an intracellular protein photoactivation method was developed using sterically bulky caging. The protein of interest was modified with biotin via a photocleavable linker, and then conjugated with streptavidin to sterically block the protein surface for inactivation. The caged protein was transduced into cells and reactivated by light&#8208;induced degradation of the conjugates. A cytotoxic protein, saporin, was caged and photoactivated both in vitro and in living cells with this method. This method achieved control of the cytotoxic activity in an off&#8211;on manner, introducing cell death selectively at the designed location using light. This simple and versatile photoactivation method is a promising tool for studying spatio&#8211;temporal cellular events that are related to intracellular proteins of interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Modification of Bromodomain Proteins by Peptides Containing a DNA Damage&#8208;Induced, Histone Post&#8208;Translational Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrophilic 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolone modification (KMP) is produced at lysine residues of histone proteins in nucleosome core particles upon reaction with a commonly formed DNA lesion (C4&#8208;AP). The nonenzymatic KMP modification is also generated in the histones of HeLa cells treated with the antitumor agent, bleomycin that oxidizes DNA and forms C4&#8208;AP. This nonenzymatic covalent histone modification has the same charge as the N&#8208;acetyllysine (KAc) modification but is more electrophilic. In this manuscript we show that KMP&#8208;containing histone peptides are recognized by, and covalently modify bromodomain proteins that are KAc readers. Distinct selectivity preferences for covalent bromodomain modification are observed following incubation with KMP&#8208;containing peptides of different sequence. MS/MS analysis of 3 covalently modified bromodomain proteins confirmed that Cys adduction was selective. The modified Cys was not always proximal to the KAc binding site, indicating that KMP&#8208;containing peptide interaction with bromodomain protein is distinct from the former. Analysis of protein adduction yields as a function of bromodomain pH at which the protein charge is zero (pI) or cysteine solvent accessible surface area are also consistent with non&#8208;promiscuous interaction between the proteins and electrophilic peptides. These data suggest that intracellular formation of KMP could affect cellular function and viability by modifying proteins that regulate genetic expression.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipase&#8208;Catalysed Enzymatic Kinetic Resolution of Aromatic Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Derivatives by Hydrolysis and Transesterification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetate and butyrate esters of aromatic Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts have been resolved by enzymatic hydrolysis using a range of lipases: P. fluorescens lipase, P. cepacea lipase (PCL), CAL&#8722;A, CAL&#8722;B and Novozyme 435. The best enantiomeric ratio was observed for the butyrate derivative of the p&#8208;cyanophenyl MBH adduct. Transesterification of aromatic MBH adducts in organic solvent in the presence of an acyl donor has been demonstrated for the first time.







Abstract
Acylated Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) adducts were synthesised and subjected to enzymatic kinetic resolution (EKR) by hydrolysis employing various lipase enzymes: from P. fluorescens, P. cepacia (PCL), C. antarctica A (CAL&#8722;A), C. antarctica B (CAL&#8722;B) and Novozyme 435. In a number of instances enantiopure Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman acetates or butyrates and their corresponding hydrolysed MBH adducts were obtained with ee values of &gt;90&#8201;%, at ca. 50&#8201;% conversion, corresponding to enantiomeric ratio (E) values of &gt;200. Enantioselective transesterification reactions on MBH adducts was achieved using acyl anhydrides in THF or the greener organic solvent 2&#8208;MeTHF in the presence of CAL&#8722;A. This is the first report of successful lipase&#8208;catalysed EKR of aromatic MBH adducts by transesterification in organic medium.

         <title>Fusion of Formate Dehydrogenase and Alanine Dehydrogenase as an Amino Donor Regenerating System Coupled to Transaminases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fusion protein combining alanine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase has been successfully produced as a bifunctional enzyme. Two different genetic designs by swapping the position of both protein domains were developed, but one construct showed up to 2.5&#8208;fold higher enzymatic activity than the other one. The fusion protein was successfully applied as amino donor recycling system coupled to enzymatic transamination reactions.







Abstract
Fusion enzymes are attractive tools for facilitating the assembly of biocatalytic cascades for chemical synthesis. This approach can offer great advantages for cooperative redox cascades that need the constant supply of a donor molecule. In this work, we have developed a self&#8208;sufficient bifunctional enzyme that can be coupled to transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reactions for the efficient recycling of the amino donor (L&#8208;alanine). By genetic fusion of an alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH) and a formate dehydrogenase (FDH), a redox&#8208;complementary system was applied to recycle the amino donor and the cofactor (NADH), respectively. AlaDH and FDH were assembled in both combinations (FDH&#8208;AlaDH and AlaDH&#8208;FDH), with a 2.5&#8208;fold higher enzymatic activity of the latter system. Then, AlaDH&#8208;FDH was coupled to two different S&#8208;selective transaminases for the synthesis of vanillyl amine (10&#8197;mM) reaching up to 99&#8201;% conversion in 24&#8197;h in both cases. Finally, the multienzyme system was reused for at least 3&#8197;consecutive cycles when implemented in dialysis&#8208;assisted biotransformations.

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Triggered Bioorthogonal Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene&#8208;Caged Phenols Using a Minimal Self&#8208;Immolative Linker Strategy

Bioorthogonal prodrug activation: The cover feature illustrates the release of a phenolic drug triggered by the reaction of a trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) conjugate with a tetrazine molecule (Tz). Key to the structural design is the incorporation of a self&#8208;immolative linker (SIL) that &#8216;dissolves&#8217; upon TCO/Tz click, enabling the development of bis(carbamate)&#8208;linked conjugates with substantially improved stability under physiological conditions. Applying this strategy, we demonstrate the bioorthogonal cleavage of a TCO&#8208;SIL&#8208;caged prodrug via in situ reaction with Tz. Thereby, we achieved controlled release of an antimitotic drug that induces depolymerization of microtubules, leading to a &gt;200&#8208;fold &#8216;turn&#8208;on&#8217; in cytotoxicity.

         <title>Heterocyclic and Alkyne Terpenoids by Terpene Synthase&#8208;Mediated Biotransformation of Non&#8208;Natural Prenyl Diphosphates: Access to New Fragrances and Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpene synthase&#8208;mediated biotransformation of eleven synthetic sulfur&#8208; or oxygen&#8208;containing non&#8208;natural prenyl diphosphates resulted in the formation of five novel terpenoids and analogues. Uniquely, they trap intermediate steps and form heterocycles or compounds with alkyne side chains. Computational modelling differentiates convertible from inconvertible substrates and thereby provides an understanding of the detailed molecular mechanism of terpene cyclases.







Abstract
Two terpene cyclases were used as biocatalytic tool, namely, limonene synthase from Cannabis sativa (CLS) and 5&#8208;epi&#8208;aristolochene synthase (TEAS) from Nicotiana tabacum. They showed significant substrate flexibility towards non&#8208;natural prenyl diphosphates to form novel terpenoids, including core oxa&#8208; and thia&#8208;heterocycles and alkyne&#8208;modified terpenoids. We elucidated the structures of five novel monoterpene&#8208;analogues and a known sesquiterpene&#8208;analogue. These results reflected the terpene synthases&#8242; ability and promiscuity to broaden the pool of terpenoids with structurally complex analogues. Docking studies highlight an on&#8208;off conversion of the unnatural substrates.

         <title>Continuous flow biocatalytic reductive amination by co&#8208;entrapping dehydrogenases with agarose gel in a 3D&#8208;printed mould reactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we show how the merge of biocatalysis with flow chemistry aided by 3D&#8208;printing technologies can facilitate organic synthesis. This concept was exemplified for the reductive amination of benzaldehyde catalysed by co&#8208;immobilised amine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase in a continuous flow micro&#8208;reactor. For this purpose, we investigated enzyme co&#8208;immobilisation by covalent binding, or ion&#8208;affinity binding, or entrapment. Entrapment in an agarose hydrogel turned out to be the most promising solution for this biocatalytic reaction. Therefore, we developed a scalable and customisable approach whereby an agarose hydrogel containing the co&#8208;entrapped dehydrogenases was cast in a 3D&#8208;printed mould. The reactor was applied to the reductive amination of benzaldehyde in continuous flow over 120 h and afforded 47% analytical yield and a space&#8208;time yield of 7.4 g L h  &#8208;1  using 0.03 mol% biocatalysts loading. This work also exemplifies how rapid prototyping of enzymatic reactions in flow can be achieved through 3D&#8208;printing technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting the Innate Plasticity of the Programmed Cell Death&#8208;1 (PD1) Receptor to Design Pembrolizumab H3 Loop Mimics
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Bent to bind: Pembrolizumab is the flagship of PD1 blockers used in immuno&#8208;oncology. A blueprint of the PD&#8208;1&#8901;pembrolizumab binding revealed that &#8764;40&#8201;% of the total interface resides at the rigid CDR&#8208;H3 loop periphery through the formation of a dynamic groove on PD1. This was exploited to rationally mimic the pembrolizumab H3&#8208;loop into smaller &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffolds as PD1/PDL1 blockers.







Abstract
Checkpoint blockade of the immunoreceptor programmed cell death&#8208;1 (PD1) with its ligand&#8208;1 (PDL1) by monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab provided compelling clinical results in various cancer types, yet the molecular mechanism by which this drug blocks the PD1/PDL1 interface remains unclear. To address this question, we examined the conformational motion of PD1 associated with the binding of pembrolizumab. Our results revealed that the innate plasticity of both C'D and FG loops is crucial to form a deep binding groove (371&#8197;&#197;3) across several distant epitopes of PD1. This analysis ultimately provided a rational&#8208;design to create pembrolizumab H3 loop mimics [RDYRFDMGFD] into &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffolds. As a result, a 20&#8208;residue long &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide 1&#8201;e was identified as a first&#8208;in&#8208;class potent PD1&#8208;inhibitor (EC50 of 0.29&#8197;&#956;M; Ki of 41&#8197;nM).

         <title>The Potential Application of Branch&#8208;PCR Assembled PTEN Gene Nanovector in Lung Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PTEN gene nanovector with biocompatible size was constructed through branch&#8208;PCR, which could efficiently express PTEN protein in NSCLC cancer cells to restore PTEN functions to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis, indicating the promising therapeutic potential in lung cancer gene therapy.







Abstract
Gene therapy offers an alternative and promising avenue to lung cancer treatment. Here, we used dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;branched primers to construct a PTEN gene nanovector (NP&#8208;PTEN) through branch&#8208;PCR. NP&#8208;PTEN showed the nanoscale structure with biocompatible size (84.7&#177;11.2&#8197;nm) and retained the improved serum stability compared to linear DNA. When transfected into NCI&#8208;H1299 cancer cells, NP&#8208;PTEN could overexpress PTEN protein to restore PTEN functions through the deactivation of PI3K&#8208;AKT&#8208;mTOR signaling pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis. The apoptosis rate of NCI&#8208;H1299 cancer cells could reach up to 54.5&#8201;%&#177;4.6&#8201;% when the transfection concentration of NP&#8208;PTEN was 4.0&#8197;&#956;g/mL. In mice bearing NCI&#8208;H1299 tumor xenograft intratumorally administrated with NP&#8208;PTEN, the average tumor volume and tumor weight was separately reduced by 61.7&#8201;% and 63.9&#8201;%, respectively, compared with the PBS group on the 18th&#8197;day of administration. The anticancer efficacy of NP&#8208;PTEN in NCI&#8208;H1299 tumor xenograft suggests the promising therapeutic potential of branch&#8208;PCR assembled PTEN gene nanovectors in lung cancer gene therapy and also provided more opportunities to introduce two or more tumor suppressor genes as an all&#8208;in&#8208;one gene nanovector for multiple gene&#8208;based cancer gene therapy.

         <title>3&#8208;Chloro&#8208;5&#8208;Substituted&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Thiadiazoles (TDZs) as Selective and Efficient Protein Thiol Modifiers</title>

         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Sulfonyl and 5&#8208;sulfinyl substituted 1,2,4&#8208;thiadiazoles (TDZ) are very rapid and selective modifiers of solvent&#8208;accessible free&#8208;thiol groups on proteins. TDZs can be used in ESI&#8208;MS/MS studies or conventional biotin&#8208;switch assays to analyze fast oxidation processes of distinct cysteines in a protein.







Abstract
The study of cysteine modifications has gained much attention in recent years. This includes detailed investigations in the field of redox biology with focus on numerous redox derivatives like nitrosothiols, sulfenic acids, sulfinic acids and sulfonic acids resulting from increasing oxidation, S&#8208;lipidation, and perthiols. For these studies selective and rapid blocking of free protein thiols is required to prevent disulfide rearrangement. In our attempt to find new inhibitors of human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) we discovered 5&#8208;sulfonyl and 5&#8208;sulfinyl substituted 1,2,4&#8208;thiadiazoles (TDZ), which surprisingly show an outstanding reactivity against thiols in aqueous solution. Encouraged by these observations we investigated the mechanism of action in detail and show that these compounds react more specifically and faster than commonly used N&#8208;ethyl maleimide, making them superior alternatives for efficient blocking of free thiols in proteins. We show that 5&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;TDZ can be readily applied in commonly used biotin switch assays. Using the example of human HDAC8, we demonstrate that cysteine modification by a 5&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;TDZ is easily measurable using quantitative HPLC/ESI&#8208;QTOF&#8208;MS/MS, and allows for the simultaneous measurement of the modification kinetics of seven solvent&#8208;accessible cysteines in HDAC8.

         <title>Chemoselective labeling and immobilization of phosphopeptides with phosphorimidazolide reagents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein phosphorylation is one of the most ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modifications, regulating numerous essential processes in cells. Accordingly, the large&#8208;scale annotation of phosphorylation sites continues to provide central insight into the regulation of signaling networks. The global analysis of the phosphoproteome typically relies on mass spectrometry analysis of phosphopeptides, with an enrichment step necessary due to the sub&#8208;stoichiometric nature of phosphorylation. Several affinity&#8208;based methods and chemical modification strategies have been developed to date, but the choice of enrichment method can have a considerable impact on the results. Here, we show that a biotinylated, photo&#8208;cleavable phosphorimidazolide reagent permits the immobilization and subsequent cleavage of phosphopeptides. The method is capable of the capture and release of phosphopeptides of varying characteristics, and this mild and selective strategy expands the current repertoire for phosphopeptide chemical modification with the potential to enrich and identify new phosphorylation sites in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Sticking the Landing: Enhancing Liposomal Cell Delivery using Reversible Covalent Chemistry and Caged Targeting Groups</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes are highly effective nanocarriers for encapsulating and delivering a wide range of therapeutic cargo. While advancements in liposome design have improved several pharmacological characteristics, an important area that would benefit from further progress involves cellular targeting and entry. In this concept article, we will focus on recent advancements utilizing strategies including reversible covalent bonding and caging groups to activate liposomal cell entry. We begin with the use of boronic acid lipids for enhancing cellular delivery through binding interactions involving cell&#8208;surface carbohydrates. We then discuss cyclic disulfide lipids designed to chemically react with thiol moieties displayed on cell surfaces to enhance cell infiltration. Finally, we present liposomes containing caged guanidine lipids for which cell entry is activated only upon encountering reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a trigger exploited to enhance selectivity. These approaches provide promising new avenues for controlling cell delivery in the development of next&#8208;generation liposomal therapeutic nanocarriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Strategies for Imaging Detection and Intervention of Cellular Senescence</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest state that can be triggered by a wide range of intrinsic or extrinsic stresses. Increased burden of senescent cells in various tissues is thought to contribute to aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Thus, the detection and interventions of senescent cells are critical for longevity and treatment of diseases. However,  the highly heterogeneous feature of senescence makes it challenging  for precise detection and selective clearance of senescent cells in different age&#8208;related diseases. To address this issue, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing senescence&#8208;targeting molecular theranostic strategies, based on the potential biomarkers of cellular senescence. Herein, we overview recent advances in the field of anti&#8208;senescence research with highlights of the specific visualization and elimination of senescent cells. Additionally, the challenges in this emerging field are further outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>A Type III Polyketide Synthase Specific for Sporulating Negativicutes is Responsible for Alkylpyrone Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterologous expression of a cryptic type III polyketide synthase (PKS) gene of the oak&#8208;associated anaerobe Dendrosporobacter quercicolus in E. coli revealed long&#8208;chain alkylpyrones as products. The PKS gene is highly specific for sporulating Negativicutes, thus suggesting a physiological role.







Abstract
Genomic analyses indicate that anaerobic bacteria represent a neglected source of natural products. Whereas a limited number of polyketides have been reported from anaerobes, products of type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) have remained unknown. We found a highly conserved biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) comprising genes putatively encoding a type III PKS and a methyltransferase in genomes of the Negativicutes, strictly anaerobic, diderm bacteria. By in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro expression of a type III PKS gene, dquA from the oak&#8208;associated Dendrosporobacter quercicolus in E. coli we show production of long&#8208;chain alkylpyrones. Intriguingly, this BGC is specific for sporulating Sporomusaceae but absent in related Negativicutes that do not sporulate, thus suggesting a physiological role.

         <title>Initial Recognition and Attachment of the Zika Virus to Host Cells: A Molecular Dynamics and Quantum Interaction Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ten strong salt bridges between the envelope protein and Dermatan Sulfate (DS) determine the marked preference for this GAG over Chondroitin Sulfate A (CSA) which only has six strong salt bridges and two charge assisted hydrogen bonds with the E protein in the initial molecular recognition and attachment of the Zika virus to cell receptors.







Abstract
The zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted to humans from the bites of Aedes Aegypti and Aedes Albopictus mosquitoes produces Zika fever and neurodegenerative disorders that despite affecting millions of people, most recently in Africa and the Americas, has been declared a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. In this work, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations followed by rigorous analysis of the intermolecular interactions reveal crucial aspects of the initial virus&#8943;cell molecular recognition and attachment, events that trigger the infectious cycle. Previous experimental studies have shown that Dermatan Sulfate (DS) and Chondroitin Sulfate A (CSA), two glycosaminoglycans which are actually epimers to each other and that are structural constituents of receptors expressed in cell membranes, are the preferred anchorage sites, with a marked preference for DS. Our calculations rationalize this preference from a molecular perspective as follows: when free of the virus, DS has one sulfate group that does not participate in intramolecular strong hydrogen bonds, thus, it is readily available to interact with the envelope protein of the virus (Zika&#8722;E), then, after formation of the complexes, Zika&#8722;E&#8943;DS exhibits ten strong salt brides connecting the two fragments against only six salt bridges and two hydrogen bonds in Zika&#8722;E&#8943;CSA. Our results complement the current view of the interaction between the virus and the receptor glycosoaminoglycans revealing that the negatively charged carboxylate groups in CSA and DS are just as important as the sulfates because of the formation of equally strong salt bridges with the positively charged Arginine and Lysine aminoacids in the envelope protein of the virus.

         <title>Illuminating Sub&#8208;Cellular Organelles by Small Molecule AIEgens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;cellular organelles play a critical role in myriads of biological phenomena. Consequently, organelle structures and functions are invariably highjacked in diverse diseases including metabolic disorders, aging, and cancer. Hence, illuminating the organelle dynamics is extremely crucial in understanding the diseased states as well as developing organelle&#8208;targeted next generation therapeutics. In this review, we outline the novel small molecules which show remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties due to the restriction in the intramolecular motion (RIM). We outlined the examples of small molecules developed to image organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, lysosomes, nucleus, cell membrane and lipid droplets. These AIEgens have a tremendous potential towards next&#8208;generation phototherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enaminone formation drives the coupling of biosynthetic pathways to generate cyclic lipopeptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel cyclic lipopeptides named tasikamides A&#8208;H (Tsk A&#8208;H) were discovered recently from&#160;Streptomyces tasikensis&#160;P46. Aside from the unique cyclic pentapeptide scaffold shared by the tasikamides, Tsk A&#8211;C contain a hydrazone bridge that connects the cyclic pentapeptide to the lipophilic alkyl 5&#8208;hydroxylanthranilate (AHA) moiety.&#160;Here we report the production of tasikamides I&#8208;K (Tsk I&#8208;K) by a mutant strain of&#160;S. tasikensis&#160;P46 that overexpresses two pathway&#8208;specific transcription regulators.&#160;&#160;Unlike Tsk A&#8208;C, Tsk I&#8208;K feature a&#160;rare&#160;enaminone&#8208;bridge that links the cyclic peptide scaffold to the AHA moiety. Our experimental data suggest that&#160;Tsk I&#8208;K are generated by the coupling of two biosynthetic pathways via a non&#8208;enzymatic condensation reaction between an arylamine and a&#160;&#946;&#8208;keto aldehyde&#8208;containing precursor.&#160;The results underscore&#160;the nucleophilic and electrophilic reactivity of the&#160;&#946;&#8208;keto aldehyde moiety and its ability in promoting fragment coupling reactions in live microbial cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;peptide networks (MPNs), which are assembled from short peptides and metal ions, are considered one of the most fascinating metal&#8211;organic coordinated architectures because of their unique and complicated structures. Although MPNs have considerable potential for developing versatile materials, they have not been developed for practical applications because of several underlying limitations, such as designability, stability, and modifiability. In this review, we recapitulate several important milestones in the development of crystalline MPNs and thoroughly analyse their structural features, such as peptide sequence designs, coordination geometries, cross&#8208;linking types, and network topologies. In addition, potential applications such as gas adsorption, guest encapsulation, and chiral recognition are introduced. We believe that this review is a useful survey that can provide insights into the development of new MPNs with more sophisticated structures and novel functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thin&#8208;plate superstructures of the immunogenic 33&#8208;mer gliadin peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gluten related&#8208;disorders have a prevalence of 1&#8208;5% worldwide triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins in wheat, rye, barley, and some oats. In wheat gluten, the most studied protein is gliadin, whose immunodominant 33&#8208;mer amino acid fragment remains after digestive proteolysis and accumulates in the gut mucosa. Here, we report the formation of 33&#8208;mer thin&#8208;plate superstructures using intrinsic tyrosine (Tyr) steady&#8208;state fluorescence anisotropy and cryo&#8208;TEM in combination with water tension measurements. Furthermore, we showed that fluorescence decay measurements of 33&#8208;mer intrinsic fluorophore Tyr provided information on the early stages of the formation of the thin&#8208;plate structures. Finally, conformational analysis of Tyr residues using minimalist models by molecular dynamic simulations (MD) demonstrated that changes in Tyr rotamer states depend on the oligomerization stage. Our findings further advance the understanding of the formation of the 33&#8208;mer gliadin peptide superstructures and their relation to health and disease.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Colorimetric Assay of Bleomycin&#8208;Mediated DNA Cleavage Utilizing Double&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A colorimetric assay of DNA cleavage by bleomycin (BLM) derivatives was developed utilizing high colloidal stability on double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles (dsDNA&#8211; AuNPs) possessing a cleavage site. The assay was performed using dsDNA&#8211;AuNPs treated with inactive BLM or activated BLM (Fe(II)&#8226;BLM). A 10&#8208;min exposure in dsDNA&#8211;AuNPs with inactive BLM treatment resulted in a rapid color change from red to purple because of salt&#8208;induced noncrosslinking aggregation of dsDNA&#8211;AuNPs. In contrast, the addition of active Fe(II)&#8226;BLM retained the red color, probably because of the formation of protruding structures at the outermost phase of dsDNA&#8208;AuNPs caused by BLM&#8208;mediated DNA cleavage. Furthermore, the results of our model experiments indicated that oxidative base release and DNA&#8208;cleavage pathways were visually distinguished as color change. The present methodology was also applicable to model screening assay using several drugs with different mechanisms related to antitumor activity. All these results strongly suggest that this assay with a rapid color change could lead to simple and efficient screening of potent antitumor agents.</dc:description>

         <title>A selenium&#8208;substituted heptamethine cyanine photosensitizer for near&#8208;infrared photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively safe approach to cancer treatment without significant systemic side effects or drug resistance. However, the current PDT efficiency is unsatisfactory due to the lack of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers. Heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) dyes are well&#8208;known NIR fluorophores and are also used as photosensitizers. But their singlet oxygen quantum yields (&#934;  &#916;  ) are not ideal. Herein, we developed a NIR photosensitizer with a long&#8208;lived excited triplet state (t = 4.3 ms) by introducing a selenium atom into the structure of a Cy7 dye. The new NIR photosensitizer exhibits a significantly high singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;  &#916;  = 0.11). Its good PDT effect was demonstrated in the living cells. Considering that the selenium&#8208;substituted photosensitizer has a very low dark cytotoxicity and good chemical stability, we firmly believe that it will have a promising future in biomedical and clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Therapeutic Potential and Biological Activity of Antiviral Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides provide safe, potentially potent, and chemically diverse prospects in the development of antiviral therapeutics. As viruses continue to evolve, new antiviral drugs are intrinsic to preventing future global pandemics. Peptides discovered from natural sources, as well as those laboratory&#8208;developed and modified with other biomolecules, have shown promising results in mitigating viral infections.







Abstract
Peptides are ideal candidates for the development of antiviral therapeutics due to their specificity, chemical diversity and potential for highly potent, safe, molecular interventions. By restricting conformational freedom and flexibility, cyclic peptides frequently increase peptide stability. Viral targets are often very challenging as their evasive strategies for infectivity can preclude standard therapies. In recent years, several peptides from natural sources mitigated an array of viral infections. In parallel, short peptides derived from key viral proteins, modified with chemical groups such as lipids and cell&#8208;penetrating sequences, led to highly effective antiviral inhibitor designs. These strategies have been further developed during the recent COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Several anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 peptides are gaining ground in pre&#8208;clinical development. Overall, peptides are strong contenders for lead compounds against many life&#8208;threatening viruses and may prove to be the key to future efforts revealing viral mechanisms of action and alleviating their effects.

         <title>An Organic Chemist's Guide to Mediated Laccase Oxidations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laccases are oxidases that only require O  2  as a terminal oxidant. Thus, they provide an attractive green alternative to established alcohol oxidation protocols. However, laccases typically require catalytic amounts of mediator molecules to serve as electron shuttles between enzyme and desired substrate. Consequently, laccase&#8208;mediator systems are defined by a multitude of parameters such as, e.g., the choice of laccase and mediator, the respective concentrations, pH, and the oxygen source. This complexity and a perceived lack of comparable data throughout literature represent an entry burden into this field. To provide a solid starting point, particularly for organic chemists, we herein provide a time&#8208;resolved, quantitative laccase and mediator screening based on the oxidation of anis alcohol as model reaction. We measured the redox potentials of mediators under the reaction conditions to relate them to their performance. Lastly, for particularly efficient laccase&#8208;mediator pairs, we screened important reaction parameters, resulting in an optimized setup for mediator&#8208;assisted laccase catalyzed oxidations.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Mediated Control of Protein Function in Semi&#8208;Synthetic Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various strategies for interfacing DNA with proteins to control protein function in engineered semi&#8208;synthetic systems are discussed in this review. We highlight the main advances in the field, delineate the current limitations, and identify the areas that are in need of future development.







Abstract
The development of strategies for controlling protein function in a precise and predictable manner has the potential to revolutionize catalysis, diagnostics, and medicine. In this regard, the use of DNA has emerged as a powerful approach for modulating protein activity. The programmable nature of DNA allows for constructing sophisticated architectures wherein proteins can be placed with control over position, orientation, and stoichiometry. This ability is especially useful considering that the properties of proteins can be influenced by their local environment or their proximity to other functional molecules. Here, we chronicle the different strategies that have been developed to interface DNA with proteins in semi&#8208;synthetic systems. We further delineate the unique applications unlocked by the unprecedented level of structural control that DNA affords. We end by outlining outstanding challenges in the area and discuss future research directions towards potential solutions.

         <title>Towards Non&#8208;stick Silk: Tuning the Hydrophobicity of Silk Fibroin Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk fibroin protein is used in myriad biomaterial applications. We showcase covalent decoration of silk with long&#8208;chain fluorocarbons, thereby converting it into a material more hydrophobic than Teflon! &#8242;Non&#8208;stick&#8242; silk bars fabricated in this fashion maintain structural integrity and show dramatically reduced water uptake and will be useful in directing bioorthogonal non&#8208;covalent interactions.







Abstract
Silk fibroin protein is a biomaterial with excellent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity. These properties have catapulted the material as a leader for extensive use in stents, catheters, and wound dressings. Modulation of hydrophobicity of silk fibroin protein to further expand the scope and utility however has been elusive. We report that installing perfluorocarbon chains on the surface of silk fibroin transforms this water&#8208;soluble protein into a remarkably hydrophobic polymer that can be solvent&#8208;cast. A clear relationship emerged between fluorine content of the modified silk and film hydrophobicity. Water contact angles of the most decorated silk fibroin protein exceeded that of Teflon&#174;. We further show that water uptake in prefabricated silk bars is dramatically reduced, extending their lifetimes, and maintaining mechanical integrity. These results highlight the power of chemistry under moderate conditions to install unnatural groups onto the silk fibroin surface and will enable further exploration into applications of this versatile biomaterial.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of the Unnatural Nucleotide 2&#8217;&#8208;Deoxyisoguanosine 5&#8217;&#8208;Monophosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic conversion of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dXMP) into deoxyisoguanosine monophosphate (dBMP), a precursor of the unnatural isoguanine&#8208;isocytosine base pair is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by the bacteriophage enzyme PurZ and bacterial PurB, and is a key addition to the toolbox for de novo biosynthesis of unnatural DNA.







Abstract
Naturally occurring DNA contains four canonical bases, forming two Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs (adenine&#8208;thymine, guanine&#8208;cytosine). Efforts over the past decades have led to the development of several unnatural base pairs, enabling the synthesis of unnatural DNA with an expanded genetic alphabet. The engineering of organisms capable of de novo biosynthesis of unnatural DNA would have significant technological and philosophical implications, but remains a challenge. Here we report the enzymatic conversion of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dXMP) into deoxyisoguanosine monophosphate (dBMP), a precursor of the unnatural isoguanine&#8208;isocytosine base pair.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Isocoumarin Derivatives Fusamarins Is Mediated by the PKS8 Gene Cluster in Fusarium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusarium mangiferae  causes the mango malformation disease (MMD) on young mango trees and seedlings resulting in economically significant crop losses. Next to this,  F.&#160;mangiferae  produces a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs), including mycotoxins that may contaminate the harvest. Their production is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. Here, we show that lack of the H3K9&#8208;specific histone methyltransferase, FmKmt1, influences the expression of the  F. mangiferae  polyketide synthase (PKS) 8 (  FmPKS8  ), a so far cryptic PKS. By a combination of reverse genetics, untargeted metabolomics, bioinformatics and chemical analyses including structural elucidation, we determined the FmPKS8 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and linked its activity to the production of fusamarins (FMN), which can be structurally classified as dihydroisocoumarins. Functional characterization of the four  FMN  cluster genes shed light on the biosynthetic pathway. Cytotoxicity assays revealed moderate toxicities with IC  50  values between 1 and 50 &#181;M depending on the compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase Inhibitors using the Cell Painting Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Profiling approaches have been increasingly employed for the characterization of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes or compound perturbation as they provide a broad, unbiased view on impaired cellular states. We report that morphological profiling using the Cell painting assay (CPA) can detect modulators of  de novo  pyrimidine biosynthesis and of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in particular. The CPA can differentiate between impairment of pyrimidine and folate metabolism, which both affect cellular nucleotide pools. The identified morphological signature is shared by inhibitors of DHODH and the functionally tightly coupled complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as by UMP synthase, which is downstream of DHODH. The CPA appears to be particularly suited for the detection of DHODH inhibitors at the site of their action in cells. As DHODH is a validated therapeutic target, the CPA will enable unbiased identification of DHODH inhibitors and inhibitors of  de novo  pyrimidine biosynthesis for biological research and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Boronic Acid Liposomes for Carbohydrate Recognition and Cellular Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liposomes containing bis&#8208;boronic acid lipids (BBALs) to advance cellular delivery through the binding of cell&#8208;surface carbohydrates are reported. Multiple BBAL structures containing variable linker units were designed, synthesized, and shown to exhibit differential carbohydrate binding properties using a competitive glycan displacement assay. Fluorescence microscopy experiments showed enhanced cellular delivery using this carbohydrate&#8208;targeting liposomal platform.







Abstract
Liposomes are effective therapeutic nanocarriers due to their ability to encapsulate and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of a wide range of drugs and diagnostic agents. A primary area in which improvement is needed for liposomal drug delivery is to maximize the delivery of these nanocarriers to cells. Cell membrane glycans provide exciting targets for liposomal delivery since they are often densely clustered on cell membranes and glycan overabundance and aberrant glycosylation patterns are a common feature of diseased cells. Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating bis&#8208;boronic acid lipids (BBALs) to increase valency in order to achieve selective saccharide sensing and enhance cell surface recognition based on carbohydrate binding interactions. In order to vary properties, multiple BBALs (1&#8201;a&#8211;d) with variable linkers in between the binding units were designed and synthesized. Fluorescence&#8208;based microplate screening of carbohydrate binding showed that these compounds exhibit varying binding properties depending on their structures. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated enhancements in cellular association when BBALs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multivalent BBALs serve as an exciting glycan binding liposome system for targeted delivery.

         <title>Proline C&#8211;H bonds as loci for proline assembly via C&#8211;H/O interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proline residues within proteins lack a traditional hydrogen bond donor. However, the hydrogens of proline are all sterically accessible, with polarized C&#8211;H bonds that can be sites for molecular recognition. C&#8211;H/O interactions, between proline C&#8211;H bonds and oxygen lone pairs, have been previously identified as modes of recognition in proteins. A series of proline derivatives was synthesized, including 4R&#8208;hydroxyproline nitrobenzoate methyl ester, acylated on the proline nitrogen with bromoacetyl and glycolyl groups, and Boc&#8208;4S&#8208;(4&#8208;iodophenyl)hydroxyproline methyl amide. All three derivatives exhibited multiple close intermolecular C&#8211;H/O interactions in the crystallographic state, with H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O distances as close as 2.3 &#197;. These observed distances are well below the 2.72 &#197; sum of the van der Waals radii of H and O. We further analyzed the role of C&#8211;H/O interactions in all previously crystallized derivatives of these amino acids, and found that all 26 structures exhibited close intermolecular C&#8211;H/O interactions. Finally, we analyzed all proline residues in the Cambridge Structural Database. The majority of these structures exhibited intermolecular C&#8211;H/O interactions at proline C&#8211;H bonds, suggesting that C&#8211;H/O interactions are an inherent and important mode for recognition of and higher&#8208;order assembly at proline residues. Due to steric accessibility and multiple polarized C&#8211;H bonds, proline residues are uniquely positioned as sites for binding and recognition via C&#8211;H/O interactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proline residues within proteins lack a traditional hydrogen bond donor. However, the hydrogens of proline are all sterically accessible, with polarized C&#8211;H bonds that can be sites for molecular recognition. C&#8211;H/O interactions, between proline C&#8211;H bonds and oxygen lone pairs, have been previously identified as modes of recognition in proteins. A series of proline derivatives was synthesized, including 4R-hydroxyproline nitrobenzoate methyl ester, acylated on the proline nitrogen with bromoacetyl and glycolyl groups, and Boc-4S-(4-iodophenyl)hydroxyproline methyl amide. All three derivatives exhibited multiple close intermolecular C&#8211;H/O interactions in the crystallographic state, with H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O distances as close as 2.3 &#197;. These observed distances are well below the 2.72 &#197; sum of the van der Waals radii of H and O. We further analyzed the role of C&#8211;H/O interactions in all previously crystallized derivatives of these amino acids, and found that all 26 structures exhibited close intermolecular C&#8211;H/O interactions.

         <title>Native Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Guided Screening Identifies Hit Fragments for HOP&#8208;HSP90 PPI Inhibition
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We sought to demonstrate the combined utility of native mass spectrometry (MS), and fragment&#8208;based drug discovery as a viable means for identifying protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. Here we identified a small cohort of molecular fragments, who's binding to the TPR2AB region of our target, HOP, translated into inhibition of the PPI between the TPR2A domain of HOP and the HSP90 C&#8208;terminus.







Abstract
Contemporary medicinal chemistry considers fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) and inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) as important means of expanding the volume of druggable chemical space. However, the ability to robustly identify valid fragments and PPI inhibitors is an enormous challenge, requiring the application of sensitive biophysical methodology. Accordingly, in this study, we exploited the speed and sensitivity of nanoelectrospray (nano&#8208;ESI) native mass spectrometry to identify a small collection of fragments which bind to the TPR2AB domain of HOP. Follow&#8208;up biophysical assessment of a small selection of binding fragments confirmed binding to the single TPR2A domain, and that this binding translated into PPI inhibitory activity between TPR2A and the HSP90 C&#8208;terminal domain. An in&#8208;silico assessment of binding fragments at the PPI interfacial region, provided valuable structural insight for future fragment elaboration strategies, including the identification of losartan as a weak, albeit dose&#8208;dependent inhibitor of the target PPI.

         <title>Tellurophene&#8208;Tagging of Teniposide Facilitates Monitoring by Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tellurophene substitution on teniposide delivers an analogue with similar biochemistry in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo from the parent and allows the monitoring of cell uptake by mass cytometry.







Abstract
Target engagement and the biodistribution of exogenously administered small molecules is rarely homogenous. Methods to determine the biodistribution at the cellular level are limited by the ability to detect the small molecule and simultaneously identify the cell types or tissue structures with which it is associated. The highly multiplexed nature of mass cytometry could facilitate these studies provided a heavy isotope label was available in the molecule of interest. Here we show it is possible to append a tellurophene to a known chemotherapeutic, teniposide, to follow this molecule in&#8197;vivo. A semi&#8208;synthetic approach offers an efficient route to the teniposide analogue which is found to have similar characteristics when compared with the parent teniposide in&#8197;vitro. Using mass cytometry we find the teniposide analogue has significant nonspecific binding to cells. In vivo the tellurium bearing teniposide produces the expected DNA damage in a PANC&#8208;1 xenograft model. The distribution of Te in the tissue is near the limits of detection and further work will be required to characterize the localization of this analogue with respect to cell type distributions.

         <title>Potential G&#8208;quadruplexes within the Promoter Nuclease Hypersensitive Sites of the Heat&#8208;Responsive Genes in Rice</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequences are prevalent in the promoter nuclease hypersensitive sites of rice heat&#8208;responsive genes. These sequences can adopt a G4 conformation to stall DNA polymerase, but become increasingly unwound by the polymerase with a rise in temperature, implying a potential for these sequences to function as &#8220;thermosensors&#8221; in response to heat.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been shown to be involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. Exploring putative G4&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in heat&#8208;responsive genes of rice and their folding structures under different conditions will help to understand the mechanism in response to heat stress. In this work, we discovered a prevalence of PQSs in nuclease hypersensitive sites within the promoters of heat&#8208;responsive genes. Moreover, 50&#8201;% of the searched G3 PQSs ((G3+L1&#8208;7)3+G3+) locate in heat shock transcription factors. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, thermal difference spectroscopy, and UV melting analysis demonstrated the representative PQSs could adopt stable G4s at physiological temperature and potassium concentration. These PQSs were able to stall Klenow fragment (KF) DNA polymerase by the formation of G4s. However, the G4s with Tm values around 50&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C could be increasingly unwound by KF with the increase of temperatures from 25 to 50&#8201;&#176;C, implying that these G4s could sense the changes in temperature by structural switch. This work offers fresh clues to understanding the potential of G4&#8208;involved functions of PQSs and the molecular events in plants in response to heat stress.

         <title>Structure Activity Relationship of the Stem Peptide in Sortase A Mediated Ligation from Staphylococcus aureus
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Staphylococcus aureus, sortase A is the principal enzyme responsible for covalently anchoring proteins. Using a combination of two unique assays, we showed that there is broad tolerability of substrate variations that are effectively processed by sortase A. These results suggest that sortase A could process both lipid II and mature peptidoglycan near the membrane as acyl&#8208;acceptor strands, which has not been previously described.







Abstract
The surfaces of most Gram&#8208;positive bacterial cells, including that of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), are heavily decorated with proteins that coordinate cellular interactions with the extracellular space. In S. aureus, sortase A is the principal enzyme responsible for covalently anchoring proteins, which display the sorting signal LPXTG, onto the peptidoglycan (PG) matrix. Considerable efforts have been made to understand the role of this signal peptide in the sortase&#8208;mediated reaction. In contrast, much less is known about how the primary structure of the other substrate involved in the reaction (PG stem peptide) could impact sortase activity. To assess the sortase activity, a library of synthetic analogs of the stem peptide that mimic naturally existing variations found in the S. aureus PG primary sequence were evaluated. Using a combination of two unique assays, we showed that there is broad tolerability of substrate variations that are effectively processed by sortase A. While some of these stem peptide derivatives are naturally found in mature PG, they are not known to be present in the PG precursor, lipid II. These results suggest that sortase A could process both lipid II and mature PG as acyl&#8208;acceptor strands that might reside near the membrane, which has not been previously described.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell DNA&#8208;Cholesterol Nanoparticles Exert Lysosomolytic Activity in African Trypanosomes
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioengineering of synthetic nanoparticles with therapeutic potential for the treatment of African sleeping sickness is reported. The molecules are DNA&#8208;cholesterol amphiphiles, which self&#8208;assemble into micelle&#8208;type nanoparticles with an exterior DNA shell and a lipid core. The particles are constructed to attack two parasite&#8208;specific targets thereby reducing the risk of developing drug resistance.







Abstract
Trypanosoma brucei is the causal infectious agent of African trypanosomiasis in humans and Nagana in livestock. Both diseases are currently treated with a small number of chemotherapeutics, which are hampered by a variety of limitations reaching from efficacy and toxicity complications to drug&#8208;resistance problems. Here, we explore the forward design of a new class of synthetic trypanocides based on nanostructured, core&#8208;shell DNA&#8208;lipid particles. In aqueous solution, the particles self&#8208;assemble into micelle&#8208;type structures consisting of a solvent&#8208;exposed, hydrophilic DNA shell and a hydrophobic lipid core. DNA&#8208;lipid nanoparticles have membrane&#8208;adhesive qualities and can permeabilize lipid membranes. We report the synthesis of DNA&#8208;cholesterol nanoparticles, which specifically subvert the membrane integrity of the T. brucei lysosome, killing the parasite with nanomolar potencies. Furthermore, we provide an example of the programmability of the nanoparticles. By functionalizing the DNA shell with a spliced leader (SL)&#8208;RNA&#8208;specific DNAzyme, we target a second trypanosome&#8208;specific pathway (dual&#8208;target approach). The DNAzyme provides a backup to counteract the recovery of compromised parasites, which reduces the risk of developing drug resistance.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bioengineering&lt;/b&gt; of synthetic nanoparticles with therapeutic potential for the treatment of African sleeping sickness is reported. The molecules are DNA-cholesterol amphiphiles, which self-assemble into micelle-type nanoparticles with an exterior DNA shell and a lipid core. The particles are constructed to attack two parasite-specific targets thereby reducing the risk of developing drug resistance.

         <title>Tunable toxicity of bufadienolides is regulated through a configuration inversion catalyzed by a short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bufadienolides are toxic components widely found in amphibious toads that exhibit a wide range of biological activities.  Guided by  UPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;MS  analysis, several 3&#8208;  epi  &#8208;bufadienolides with unique structures have been isolated from the  bile of the Asiatic toad,  Bufo gargarizans  . However, the enzymatic machinery of this epimerization in toads and its significance in chemical ecology remain poorly understood. Herein, we firstly compared the toxicities of two typical bufadienolides, bufalin (featuring a 14b&#8208;hydroxyl) and resibufogenin (characterizing a 14, 15&#8208;epoxy group with their corresponding 3&#8208;  epi  isomers), on a zebrafish model. The results of toxicology assays showed that the ratio of maximum non&#8208;toxic concentrations of these two pairs of compounds are 256 and 96 times, respectively, thereby indicating that the 3&#8208;hydroxyl epimerization can cause a significant decrease in toxicity. Aiming to investigate the biotransformation of 3&#8208;  epi  bufadienolides in toads, we applied liver lysate to transform bufalin, and found that it could stereoselectively catalyze the conversion of bufalin into its 3&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl epimer. Following this, we cloned and characterized a short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase, HSE&#8208;1, from the toad liver cDNA library and verified its 3(&#946;&#8594;&#945;)&#8208;hydroxysteroid epimerization activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hydroxyl epimerase identified from amphibians that regulates the toxicity of animal&#8208;derived natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Inactivation Mechanism of the Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Inhibitor BIA 10&#8208;2474</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM studies are presented for the target&#8208;specific covalent inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) by BIA 10&#8208;2474. The results reveal the important role played by FAAH Thr236 in the reaction with BIA 10&#8208;2474, which is specific to FAAH and is not present in other serine hydrolases.







Abstract
BIA 10&#8208;2474 is a time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that was under clinical development for the treatment of neurological conditions when the program was terminated after one subject died and four were hospitalized with neurological symptoms during a first&#8208;in&#8208;human clinical study. The present work describes the mechanism of FAAH inhibition by BIA 10&#8208;2474 as a target&#8208;specific covalent inhibition, supported by quantum mechanics and molecular modelling studies. The inhibitor incorporates a weakly reactive electrophile which, upon specific binding to the enzyme&#8216;s active site, is positioned to react readily with the catalytic residues. The reactivity is enhanced on&#8208;site by the increased molarity at the reaction site and by specific inductive interactions with FAAH. In the second stage, the inhibitor reacts with the enzyme&#8216;s catalytic nucleophile to form a covalent enzyme&#8208;inhibitor adduct. The hydrolysis of this adduct is shown to be unlikely under physiological conditions, therefore leading to irreversible inactivation of FAAH. The results also reveal the important role played by FAAH Thr236 in the reaction with BIA 10&#8208;2474, which is specific to FAAH and is not present in other serine hydrolases. It forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole nitrogen of the inhibitor and helps lowering the activation free energy of the first step of the reaction, by pre&#8208;orienting and stabilizing the inhibitor in a near&#8208;reactive configuration. In the second step, Thr236 can also serve as a mechanistic alternative to protonate the leaving group.

         <title>N  &#8208;acyl amides from Neisseria meningitidis and their role in sphingosine receptor signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neisseria meningitidis  is a Gram&#8208;negative opportunistic pathogen that is responsible for causing human diseases with high mortality, such as septicemia and meningitis. The molecular mechanisms  N. meningitidis  employ to manipulate the immune system, translocate the mucosal and blood&#8208;brain barriers, and exert virulence are largely unknown. Human&#8208;associated bacteria encode a variety of bioactive small molecules with growing evidence for  N  &#8208;acyl amides as being important signaling molecules. However, only a small fraction of these metabolites has been identified from the human microbiota thus far. Here, we heterologously expressed an  N  &#8208;acyltransferase encoded in the obligate human pathogen  N. meningitidis  and identified 30  N  &#8208;acyl amides with representative members serving as agonists of the G&#8208;protein coupled receptor (GPCR) S1PR4. During this process, we also characterized two mammalian  N  &#8208;acyl amides derived from the bovine medium. Both groups of metabolites suppress anti&#8208;inflammatory interleukin&#8208;10 signaling in human macrophage cell types, but they also suppress the pro&#8208;inflammatory interleukin&#8208;17A+ population in T  H  17&#8208;differentiated CD4  +  T cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Disorazole C1: Exchanging the Oxazole Ring by Thiazole and Influence of Chiral Centers within the Disorazole Core on Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of novel disorazole C1 analogues is described and their biological activity as cytotoxic compounds is reported. Two regions of the molecules were examined for structural modification: 1. Replacement of the heterocyclic moiety by an exchange of the oxazole ring by a thiazole; and 2. Evaluation of the influence of the absolute configuration.







Abstract
The synthesis of novel disorazole C1 analogues is described and their biological activity as cytotoxic compounds is reported. Based on our convergent entry to the disorazole core we present a flexible and robust strategy to construct a variety of interesting new analogues. In particular, two regions of the molecules were examined for structural modification: 1. Replacement of the heterocyclic moiety by an exchange of the oxazole ring by a thiazole; and 2. Evaluation of the influence of the absolute configuration of the chiral centers of the molecule. Predicated on our flexible strategy we were able to construct all analogues in an efficient way and could perform an exciting SAR (structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship) study to obtain insight in the cytotoxic activity influenced by the chiral centers of the disorazole core.

         <title>Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of Protein Cages by Ubc9&#8208;Mediated Lysine Acylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;directed post&#8208;assembly modification of protein cages holds promise for the development of new delivery and vaccine platforms. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Ubc9&#8208;mediated lysine acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE) for the on&#8208;demand decoration of two proteinaceous compartments with small molecules, peptides, and proteins.







Abstract
Although viruses have been successfully repurposed as vaccines, antibiotics, and anticancer therapeutics, they also raise concerns regarding genome integration and immunogenicity. Virus&#8208;like particles and non&#8208;viral protein cages represent a potentially safer alternative but often lack desired functionality. Here, we investigated the utility of a new enzymatic bioconjugation method, called lysine acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE), to chemoenzymatically modify protein cages. We equipped two structurally distinct protein capsules with a LACE&#8208;reactive peptide tag and demonstrated their modification with diverse ligands. This modular approach combines the advantages of chemical conjugation and genetic fusion and allows for site&#8208;specific modification with recombinant proteins as well as synthetic peptides with facile control of the extent of labeling. This strategy has the potential to fine&#8208;tune protein containers of different shape and size by providing them with new properties that go beyond their biologically native functions.

         <title>Epipolythiodioxopiperazine&#8208;Based Natural Products: Building Blocks, Biosynthesis and Biological Activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Housing sulfur: Certain fungi produce diketopiperazine compounds with a transannular sulfur bridge. These so&#8208;called epipolythiodioxopiperzines are toxic by non&#8208;specifically interacting with intracellular proteins and contribute to fungal pathogenicity. Producer strains serve as bio&#8208;pesticides but also question safety of food fermentation. Thus, understanding the structure and biosynthesis of these intriguing natural sulfur products is of utmost interest.







Abstract
Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are fungal secondary metabolites that share a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffold built from two amino acids and bridged by a sulfide moiety. Modifications of the core and the amino acid side chains, for example by methylations, acetylations, hydroxylations, prenylations, halogenations, cyclizations, and truncations create the structural diversity of ETPs and contribute to their biological activity. However, the key feature responsible for the bioactivities of ETPs is their sulfide moiety. Over the last years, combinations of genome mining, reverse genetics, metabolomics, biochemistry, and structural biology deciphered principles of ETP production. Sulfurization via glutathione and uncovering of the thiols followed by either oxidation or methylation crystallized as fundamental steps that impact expression of the biosynthesis cluster, toxicity and secretion of the metabolite as well as self&#8208;tolerance of the producer. This article showcases structure and activity of prototype ETPs such as gliotoxin and discusses the current knowledge on the biosynthesis routes of these exceptional natural products.

         <title>DNA Stability in Biodosimetry, Pharmacy and DNA Based Data&#8208;Storage: Optimal Storage and Handling Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA stability is fundamental for many applications that often involve freeze&#8208;thaw cycles, which can cause damage. It was hypothesized that the damage is related to mechanical stress, to acidic pH, or to metal ions. These hypotheses were tested. The results show that only the presence of metal ions leads to DNA damage by production of radical species during freeze&#8208;thaw cycles.







Abstract
DNA long&#8208;term stability and integrity is of importance for applications in DNA based bio&#8208;dosimetry, data&#8208;storage, pharmaceutical quality&#8208;control, donor insemination and DNA based functional nanomaterials. Standard protocols for these applications involve repeated freeze&#8208;thaw cycles of the DNA, which can cause detrimental damage to the nucleobases, as well as the sugar&#8208;phosphate backbone and therefore the whole molecule. Throughout the literature three hypotheses can be found about the underlying mechanisms occurring during freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. It is hypothesized that DNA single&#8208;strand breaks during freezing can be induced by mechanical stress leading to shearing of the DNA molecule, by acidic pH causing damage through depurination and beta elimination or by the presence of metal ions catalyzing oxidative damage via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we test these hypotheses under well defined conditions with plasmid DNA pUC19 in high&#8208;purity buffer (1xPBS) at physiological salt and pH&#8197;7.4 conditions, under pH 6 and in the presence of metal ions in combination with the radical scavengers DMSO and Ectoine. The results show for the 2686 bp long plasmid DNA, that neither mechanical stress, nor pH 6 lead to degradation during repeated freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. In contrast, the presence of metal ions (Fe2+) leads to degradation of DNA via the production of radical species.

         <title>An in Vitro Cytomimetic of In&#8208;Cell RNA Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular environments can be reproduced by a combination of crowding and sticking agents: PEG10k and M&#8208;PERTM in buffer solution. We investigated folding dynamics of the fourU thermometer, an RNA hairpin, in&#8197;vitro and in cells. The best mimic of the cytoplasmic matrix for RNA is a mixture of 150&#8197;g/L PEGK10k and 20&#8201;% M&#8208;PERTM.







Abstract
To discover the cytomimetic that accounts for cytoplasmic crowding and sticking on RNA stability, we conducted a two&#8208;dimensional scan of mixtures of artificial crowding and sticking agents, PEG10k and M&#8208;PERTM. As our model RNA, we investigate the fourU RNA thermometer motif of Salmonella, a hairpin&#8208;structured RNA that regulates translation by unfolding and exposing its ribosome binding site (RBS) in response to temperature perturbations. We found that the addition of artificial crowding and sticking agents leads to a stabilization and destabilization of RNA folding, respectively, through the excluded volume effect and surface interactions. FRET&#8208;labels were added to the fourU RNA and Fast Relaxation Imaging (FReI), fluorescence microscopy coupled to temperature&#8208;jump spectroscopy, probed differences between folding stability of RNA inside single living cells and in&#8197;vitro. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic environment affecting RNA folding is comparable to a combination of 20&#8201;% v/v M&#8208;PERTM and 150&#8197;g/L PEG10k.

         <title>Selective Acylation of Proteins at Gly and Lys in His Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective, autocatalytic acylation of Gly and Lys amines in poly&#8208;His sequences in peptides and proteins using new reagents based on phenyl esters provide stable conjugates. We have demonstrated the robustness of these methods by attaching different moieties such as azides, fluorophores, and biotin to different proteins, including antibodies.







Abstract
The chemical modification of proteins is of great importance in chemical biology, biotechnology, and for the production of modified biopharmaceuticals, as it enables introduction of fluorophores, biotin, half&#8208;life extending moieties, and more. We have developed two methods that use poly&#8208;His sequences to direct the highly selective acylation of proteins, either at the N&#8208;terminus or at a specific Lys residue. For the former, we used an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His6 segment (Gly&#8208;His tag) that directed acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N&#945;&#8208;amine with 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl esters, resulting in stable conjugates. Next, we developed the peptide sequences Hisn&#8208;Lys&#8208;Hism (Lys&#8208;His tags) that direct the acylation of the designated Lys N&#1013;&#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. Both the Gly&#8208;His and Lys&#8208;His tags maintain the capacity for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. We have demonstrated the robustness of these methods by attaching different moieties such as azides, fluorophores, and biotin to different proteins, including antibodies.

Abstract
The design of novel aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), has generally been facilitated by disrupting the possibility of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The recent literature describes a novel strategy to design AIEgens by introducing anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions to prevent the detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. This new strategy provides access to intrinsically charged AIEgens whose photophysical properties can be tuned either by incorporating different substituents on the &#960;&#8208;molecular scaffold to modulate the acidity for tuning the interaction energy between a &#960;&#8208;acceptor and counter&#8208;anions. This concept article provides a brief overview of the field, focusing on the synthesis of AIEgens, their photophysical properties, crystallography studies and their applications in live cell fluorescence imaging.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Microviridin Analogs Containing Functional Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tag it easy: A chemoenzymatic strategy enabled the synthesis of microviridins with various functional tags from synthetic core peptides. This versatile and straightforward approach opens the toolbox of microviridin chemical probes to explore the still elusive ecological functions and targets of this remarkable class of compounds and to advance applications based on protease inhibition.







Abstract
Microviridins are a prominent family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) featuring characteristic lactone and lactam rings. Their unusual cage&#8208;like architecture renders them highly potent serine protease inhibitors of which individual variants specifically inhibit different types of proteases of pharmacological interest. While posttranslational modifications are key for the stability and bioactivity of RiPPs, additional attractive properties can be introduced by functional tags. To date &#8211; although highly desirable &#8211; no method has been reported to incorporate functional tags in microviridin scaffolds or the overarching class of graspetides. In this study, a chemoenzymatic in&#8197;vitro platform is used to introduce functional tags in various microviridin variants yielding biotinylated, dansylated or propargylated congeners. This straightforward approach paves the way for customized protease inhibitors with built&#8208;in functionalities that can help to unravel the still elusive ecological roles and targets of this remarkable class of compounds and to foster applications based on protease inhibition.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembled Compartments as Tuneable Model Protocellular Membrane Systems
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly behaviour and membrane physicochemical properties of mono&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl phosphate (DDP) were studied under different conditions. DDP formed vesicles in low concentration, over a wide range of pH. Physicochemical properties of DDP based membranes changed as a function of pH. Its tuneable nature and unique membrane properties, make it a very enticing model protocell membrane candidate.







Abstract
Prebiotically plausible single&#8208;chain amphiphiles are enticing as model protocellular compartments to study the emergence of cellular life, owing to their self&#8208;assembling properties. Here, we investigated the self&#8208;assembly behaviour of mono&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl phosphate (DDP) and mixed systems of DDP with 1&#8208;dodecanol (DDOH) at varying pH conditions. Membranes composed of DDP showed pH&#8208;responsive vesicle formation in a wide range of pH with a low critical bilayer concentration (CBC). Further, the addition of DDOH to DDP membrane system enhanced vesicle formation and stability in alkaline pH regimes. We also compared the high&#8208;temperature behaviour of DDP and DDP:DDOH membranes with conventional fatty acid membranes. Both, DDP and DDP:DDOH mixed membranes possess packing that is similar to decanoic acid membrane. However, the micropolarity of these systems is similar to phospholipid membranes. Finally, the pH&#8208;dependent modulation of different phospholipid membranes doped with DDP was also demonstrated to engineer tuneable membranes with potential translational implications.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Break the Chemical Shift Degeneracy of Glycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy is the leading technique for structural characterization of glycans and elucidation of their interactions with proteins. Synthetic probes carrying isotopes or lanthanide tags represent elegant strategies to simplify the NMR analysis of the unlabeled analogues, contributing to the fundamental understanding of glycans.







Abstract
NMR spectroscopy is the leading technique for determining glycans&#8217; three&#8208;dimensional structure and dynamic in solution as well as a fundamental tool to study protein&#8208;glycan interactions. To overcome the severe chemical shift degeneracy of these compounds, synthetic probes carrying NMR&#8208;active nuclei (e.&#8201;g., 13C or 19F) or lanthanide tags have been proposed. These elegant strategies permitted to simplify the complex NMR analysis of unlabeled analogues, shining light on glycans&#8217; conformational aspects and interaction with proteins. Here, we highlight some key achievements in the synthesis of specifically labeled glycan probes and their contribution towards the fundamental understanding of glycans.

         <title>A Hybrid Structural Method for Investigating Low Molecular Weight Oligomeric Structures of Amyloid Beta</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concept for a new hybrid characterization assay: Inline fluorescence collection can be used immediately prior to X&#8208;ray exposure to simultaneously characterize the evolution of residue&#8208;specific interactions and the evolution of global conformation along the amyloid aggregation timeline.







Abstract
Spurred in part by the failure of recent therapeutics targeting amyloid &#946; plaques in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), attention is increasingly turning to the oligomeric forms of this peptide that form early in the aggregation process. However, while numerous amyloid &#946; fibril structures have been characterized, primarily by NMR spectroscopy and cryo&#8208;EM, obtaining structural information on the low molecular weight forms of amyloid &#946; that presumably precede and/or seed fibril formation has proved challenging. These transient forms are heterogeneous, and depend heavily on experimental conditions such as buffer, temperature, concentration, and degree of quiescence during measurement. Here, we present the concept for a new approach to delineating structural features of early&#8208;stage low molecular weight amyloid &#946; oligomers, using a solvent accessibility assay in conjunction with simultaneous fluorescence measurements.

         <title>Sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides as Protein Helical Domain Mimetics to Manipulate the Angiogenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and application of homogenous sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides for modulating different protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is briefly introduced in this concept article. Most importantly, we describe in detail how sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides mimic the critical binding domain on VEGRA (helix&#8208;&#945;1) to modulate VEGF/VEGFR PPI. We have identified two active mimetics V2 and V3 that potently activate and inhibit angiogenesis and are highly resistant to proteolytic degradation. This demonstrates the versatility of sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides to mimic the protein helical domain to manipulate various PPIs.







Abstract
Sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides recently developed in our group have been proven to be a new class of unnatural foldamer with well&#8208;defined helical structure and have been demonstrated to mimic protein helical domains and disrupt biomedically relevant protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Based on our design concept in a recent report, we discovered two similar sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides V2 and V3 which were designed to mimic the VEGF N&#8208;terminal helix &#945;1 known to directly interact with VEGFRs. Interestingly, V2 was shown to possess the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect, whereas V3 was proved to be a potent inhibitor for angiogenesis. We speculate that the distinct angiogenesis signaling was due to the selective binding of the two molecules to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, respectively. Together with their remarkable resistance to proteolytic degradation, relatively small sizes, and amenability to modification with diverse functional groups, V2 and V3 could serve as lead molecules for the development of potential therapeutic agents and molecular probes. These findings highlight sulfono&#8208;&#947;&#8208;AApeptides as an alternative paradigm to mimic the &#945;&#8208;helical domain to modulate a wide variety of PPIs in the future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The structure&lt;/b&gt; and application of homogenous sulfono-&#947;-AApeptides for modulating different protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is briefly introduced in this concept article. Most importantly, we describe in detail how sulfono-&#947;-AApeptides mimic the critical binding domain on VEGRA (helix-&#945;1) to modulate VEGF/VEGFR PPI. We have identified two active mimetics &lt;b&gt;V2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;V3&lt;/b&gt; that potently activate and inhibit angiogenesis and are highly resistant to proteolytic degradation. This demonstrates the versatility of sulfono-&#947;-AApeptides to mimic the protein helical domain to manipulate various PPIs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfono-&#947;-AApeptides recently developed in our group have been proven to be a new class of unnatural foldamer with well-defined helical structure and have been demonstrated to mimic protein helical domains and disrupt biomedically relevant protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Based on our design concept in a recent report, we discovered two similar sulfono-&#947;-AApeptides &lt;b&gt;V2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;V3&lt;/b&gt; which were designed to mimic the VEGF N-terminal helix &#945;1 known to directly interact with VEGFRs. Interestingly, &lt;b&gt;V2&lt;/b&gt; was shown to possess the pro-angiogenic effect, whereas &lt;b&gt;V3&lt;/b&gt; was proved to be a potent inhibitor for angiogenesis. We speculate that the distinct angiogenesis signaling was due to the selective binding of the two molecules to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, respectively. Together with their remarkable resistance to proteolytic degradation, relatively small sizes, and amenability to modification with diverse functional groups, &lt;b&gt;V2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;V3&lt;/b&gt; could serve as lead molecules for the development of potential therapeutic agents and molecular probes. These findings highlight sulfono-&#947;-AApeptides as an alternative paradigm to mimic the &#945;-helical domain to modulate a wide variety of PPIs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epitope Fine Mapping by Mass Spectrometry: Investigations of Immune Complexes Consisting of Monoclonal Anti&#8208;HpTGEKP Antibody and Zinc Finger Protein Linker Phospho&#8208;Hexapeptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometric binding strength characterization of paratope &#8211; epitope interactions with amino acid residue resolution enables the deciphering of molecular &#8220;recognition codes&#8221;. The naturally existing zinc finger protein linker amino acid variability is exploited as a test case for deciphering the importance of individual amino acid residues for binding of a monoclonal antibody and distinguishes orthodox from unorthodox binding motives.







Abstract
Accurate formation of antibody&#8208;antigen complexes has been relied on in both, multitudes of scientific projects and ample therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Mass spectrometrically determined dissociation behavior of immune complexes with the anti&#8208;HpTGEKP antibody revealed that the ten most frequently occurring phospho&#8208;hexapeptide linker sequences from C2H2 zinc finger proteins could be divided into two classes: orthodox binders, where strong noncovalent interactions developed as anticipated, and unorthodox binders with deviating structures and weaker binding. Phosphorylation of threonine was compulsory for antibody binding in an orthodox manner. Gas phase dissociation energy determinations of seven C2H2 zinc finger protein linker phospho&#8208;hexapeptides with orthodox binding properties revealed a bipolar binding motif of the antibody paratope. Epitope peptides, which in addition to the negatively charged phospho&#8208;threonine residue were C&#8208;terminally flanked by positively charged residues provided stronger binding, i.&#8201;e. dissociation was endothermic, than peptides with acidic amino acid residues at these positions, for which dissociation was exothermic.

         <title>Phosphoenolpyruvate Mutase&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;P Bond Formation: Mechanistic Ambiguities and Opportunities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphoenolpyruvate mutase (Ppm) catalyzes the formation of a carbon&#8208;phosphorus bond and serves as the entry point to almost all known biogenic phosphonates. Here we review our current understanding of this mechanistically unusual enzyme, which defies the current in&#8208;line paradigm for enzymatic phosphoryl transfer.







Abstract
Phosphonates are produced across all domains of life and used widely in medicine and agriculture. Biosynthesis almost universally originates from the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate mutase (Ppm), EC 5.4.2.9, which catalyzes O&#8722;P bond cleavage in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and forms a high energy C&#8722;P bond in phosphonopyruvate (PnPy). Mechanistic scrutiny of this unusual intramolecular O&#8208;to&#8208;C phosphoryl transfer began with the discovery of Ppm in 1988 and concluded in 2008 with computational evidence supporting a concerted phosphoryl transfer via a dissociative metaphosphate&#8208;like transition state. This mechanism deviates from the standard &#8216;in&#8208;line attack&#8217; paradigm for enzymatic phosphoryl transfer that typically involves a phosphoryl&#8208;enzyme intermediate, but definitive evidence is sparse. Here we review the experimental evidence leading to our current mechanistic understanding and highlight the roles of previously underappreciated conserved active site residues. We then identify remaining opportunities to evaluate overlooked residues and unexamined substrates/inhibitors.

         <title>Supramolecular Host&#8208;Guest Interaction&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Recognition for Pyrophosphate and Alkaline Phosphatase Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical biosensor based on the supramolecular host&#8208;guest recognition between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and L&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;Cu(II) complex is reported for pyrophosphate (PPi) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) analysis.







Abstract
We report an electrochemical biosensor based on the supramolecular host&#8208;guest recognition between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and L&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;Cu(II) complex for pyrophosphate (PPi) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) analysis. First, L&#8208;Phe&#8208;Cu(II) complex is simply synthesized by the complexation of Cu(II) (metal node) with L&#8208;Phe (bioorganic ligand), which can be immobilized onto CB[7] modified electrode via host&#8208;guest interaction of CB[7] and L&#8208;Phe. In this process, the signal of the complex&#8208;triggered electro&#8208;catalytic reduction of H2O2 can be captured. Next, due to the strong chelation between PPi and Cu(II), a biosensing system of the model &#8220;PPi and Cu(II) premixing, then adding L&#8208;Phe&#8221; was designed and the platform was applied to PPi analysis by hampering the formation of L&#8208;Phe&#8208;Cu(II) complex. Along with ALP introduction, PPi can be hydrolyzed to orthophosphate (Pi), where abundant Cu(II) ions are released to form L&#8208;Phe&#8208;Cu(II) complex, which gives rise to the catalytic reaction of complex to H2O2 reduction. The quantitative analysis of H2O2, PPi and ALP activity was achieved successfully and the detection of limits are 0.067&#8197;&#956;M, 0.42&#8197;&#956;M and 0.09 mU/mL (S/N=3), respectively. With its high sensitivity and selectivity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and simplicity, our analytical system has great potential to for use in diagnosis and treatment of ALP&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Synthesis, Derivatization and Photochemical Control of an ortho&#8208;Functionalized Tetrafluorinated Azobenzene&#8208;Modified siRNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNAi activity is controlled by a modified tetrafluorinated azobenzene derivative embedded within a short interfering RNA. In mammalian cells, we can inactive the siRNA duplex for green light for up to 72&#8197;hours, and no RNA interference activity occurs. When the blue light is administered, the complex isomerizes back to an active form, and RNA interference activity resumes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of an ortho&#8208;functionalized tetrafluorinated azobenzene phosphoramidite for its site&#8208;specific incorporation into RNA. The tetrafluorinated azobenzene is embedded within the antisense strand of an siRNA duplex to form an ortho&#8208;functionalized tetrafluorinated azobenzene&#8208;containing siRNA (F&#8208;siRNAzo). The F&#8208;siRNAzo is inactivated via trans to cis conversion with green light (530&#8197;nm), and reactivated with blue light (470&#8197;nm) via cis to trans conversion in cell culture. The long half&#8208;life and stability of the tetrafluorinated azobenzene unit allows for reversible control of the F&#8208;siRNAzo in cell culture for up 72&#8197;hours.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Labeling to Visualize Intercellular Contacts Using Lipidated SortaseA
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and versatile strategy toward selective fluorescent labeling of intercellular contacting cells is reported. A transpeptidase sortase A and its substrate triglycine peptide were conjugated with a lipidated polymer, leading to anchoring onto cell membranes. The triglycine&#8208;modified cells were labeled with a fluorescent dye by contacting with the sortase A&#8208;modified cells based on proximity&#8208;dependent transpeptidation.







Abstract
Methods to label intercellular contact have attracted attention because of their potential in cell biological and medical applications for the analysis of intercellular communications. In this study, a simple and versatile method for chemoenzymatic labeling of intercellularly contacting cells is demonstrated using a cell&#8208;surface anchoring reagent of a poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid conjugate. The surface of each cell in the cell pairs of interest were decorated with sortase A (SrtA) and triglycine peptide that were lipidated with PEG&#8208;lipid. In the mixture of the two&#8208;cell populations, the triglycine&#8208;modified cells were enzymatically labeled with a fluorescent labeling reagent when in contact with SrtA&#8208;modified cells on a substrate. The selective labeling of the contacting cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy. The method is a promising tool for selective visualization of intercellularly contacting cells in cell mixtures for cell&#8208;cell communication analysis.

         <title>N&#8208;Glycan Engineering: Constructing the N&#8722;GlcNAc Stump</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single N&#8208;GlcNAc residue on proteins can be converted to various homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylated forms by endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation. This represents a very powerful strategy for N&#8208;glycan engineering. In this concept article, methods that allow the generation of N&#8208;GlcNAc and its close analogues on proteins and peptides are summarized and discussed.







Abstract
N&#8208;Glycosylation is often essential for the structure and function of proteins. However, N&#8208;glycosylated proteins from natural sources exhibit considerable heterogeneity in the appended oligosaccharides, bringing daunting challenges to corresponding basic research and therapeutic applications. To address this issue, various synthetic, enzymatic, and chemoenzymatic approaches have been elegantly designed. Utilizing the endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation method, a single N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (N&#8208;GlcNAc, analogous to a tree stump) on proteins can be converted to various homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylated forms, thereby becoming the focus of research efforts. In this concept article, we briefly introduce the methods that allow the generation of N&#8208;GlcNAc and its close analogues on proteins and peptides and highlight the current challenges and opportunities the scientific community is facing.

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Triggered Bioorthogonal Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene&#8208;Caged Phenols Using a Minimal Self&#8208;Immolative Linker Strategy
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal activation of caged phenols enables strategies to control the function of (bio)molecules in biological environments. While previous methods have been limited by slow click kinetics or insufficient stability, we show that introduction of a self&#8208;immolative linker affords stable trans&#8208;cyclooctene conjugates, as demonstrated by the design of a prodrug that upon bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines leads to &gt;200&#8208;fold cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Bond&#8208;cleavage reactions triggered by bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation have emerged as strategies to chemically control the function of (bio)molecules and achieve activation of prodrugs in living systems. While most of these approaches make use of caged amines, current methods for the release of phenols are limited by unfavorable reaction kinetics or insufficient stability of the Tz&#8208;responsive reactants. To address this issue, we have implemented a self&#8208;immolative linker that enables the connection of cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and phenols via carbamate linkages. Based on detailed investigation of the reaction mechanism with several Tz, revealing up to 96&#8201;% elimination after 2&#8197;hours, we have developed a TCO&#8208;caged prodrug with 750&#8208;fold reduced cytotoxicity compared to the parent drug and achieved in&#8197;situ activation upon Tz/TCO click&#8208;to&#8208;release.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Detection of Telomerase and Correlated Biomolecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular detection of telomerase is essential for diagnostics and therapeutics. This concept article introduces recent progress of DNA&#8208;based nanoprobes for simultaneous detection of telomerase activity and related molecules, with a focus on circuit&#8208;based multiplexed imaging of telomerase and other biomolecules in living cells and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Telomerase (TE), a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase, is enzymatically activated in most tumor cells and is responsible for promoting tumor progression and malignancy by enabling replicative immortality of cancer cells. TE has become an important hallmark for cancer diagnosis and a potential therapy target. Therefore, accurate in&#8197;situ detection of TE activity, especially the simultaneous imaging of TE activity and its correlated biomolecules, is essential to medical diagnostics and therapeutics. DNA&#8208;based nanoprobes, with their effective cell penetration capability and programmability, are the most advantageous for detection of intracellular TE activity. This concept article introduces the recent strategies for in&#8197;situ sensing and imaging of TE activity, with a focus on simultaneous detection of TE and related biomolecules, and provides challenges and perspectives for the development of new strategies for such correlated imaging.

         <dc:description>
Precise enzyme activity regulation brings biocatalysis significantly closer to mimicking the physiological control mechanisms for treating diseases. This review provides a discussion and understanding of the mechanisms and approaches of on&#8208;demand enzyme activity control (including reversible and irreversible regulation) and prospective biomedical applications.







Abstract
Enzymes are important macromolecular biocatalysts that accelerate chemical and biochemical reactions in living organisms. Most human diseases are related to alterations in enzyme activity. Moreover, enzymes are potential therapeutic tools for treating different diseases, such as cancer, infections, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Precise remote enzyme activity regulation provides new opportunities to combat diseases. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of enzyme activity regulation, including reversible and irreversible regulation. It also discusses the mechanisms and approaches for on&#8208;demand control of these activities. Furthermore, a range of stimulus&#8208;responsive inhibitors, polymers, and nanoparticles for regulating enzyme activity and their prospective biomedical applications are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives on enzyme activity regulation are discussed.

         <title>Endogenous Proteins Modulation in Live Cells with Small Molecules and Light</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinctive small&#8208;molecule strategies for spatiotemporal modulation of endogenous proteins in live cells are discussed, including decaging of small molecules by photolysis, visible&#8208;light photocatalytic releasing of small molecules, and small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging, which together provide powerful chemical biology tool kits with potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Protein modulation by light illumination enables the investigation of biological function in high spatiotemporal precision. Compared to genetic methods, the small molecule approach is uniquely suited for modulating endogenous proteins. Endogenous protein modulation in live cells with small molecules and light has recently advanced on three distinctive frontiers: i) the infrared&#8208;light&#8208;induced or localized decaging of small molecules by photolysis, ii) the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic releasing of small molecules, and iii) the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging for photomodulation of proteins. Together, these methods provide powerful chemical biology tool kits for spatiotemporal modulation of endogenous proteins with potential therapeutic applications. This Concept article aims to inspire organic chemists and chemical biologists to delve into this burgeoning endogenous protein modulation field for new biological discoveries.

         <title>Feruloyl Esterases Protein Engineering to Enhance Their Performance as Biocatalysts: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to enhance enzymes performance is presented in this review. Analyses of the current protein engineering strategies that have been used to improve feruloyl esterases in terms of thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and selectivity are discussed. The result is a framework that suggests the direction of feruloyl esterases protein engineering to generate robust industrial biocatalysts.







Abstract
Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) are versatile enzymes able to release hydroxycinnamic acids or synthesize their ester derivatives, both molecules with interesting biological activities such as: antioxidants, antifungals, antivirals, antifibrotic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, among others. The importance of these molecules in medicine, food or cosmetic industries provides FAEs with several biotechnological applications as key industrial biocatalysts. However, FAEs have some operational limitations that must be overcome, which can be addressed through different protein engineering approaches to enhance their thermal stability, catalytic efficiencies, and selectivity. This review aims to present a brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to improve enzymes performance and analyze the current protein engineering strategies applied to FAEs as interesting biocatalysts. Finally, an outlook of the future of FAEs protein engineering approaches to achieve successful industrial biocatalysts is given.

         <title>Intramolecular Covalent Bonds in Gram&#8208;Positive Bacterial Surface Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;positive bacteria have evolved a variety of intramolecular covalent bonds that are found to play important mechanical roles for stabilizing host infection. Studying the proteins containing these unusual covalent bond yields rich information about the mechanical design of these proteins and inspires the design of novel antibiotics and bioengineering tools.







Abstract
Gram&#8208;positive bacteria experience considerable mechanical perturbation when adhering to host surfaces during colonization and infection. They have evolved various adhesion proteins that are mechanically robust to ensure strong surface adhesion. Recently, it was discovered that these adhesion proteins contain rare, extra intramolecular covalent bonds that stabilize protein structures and participate in surface bonding. These intramolecular covalent bonds include isopeptides, thioesters, and ester bonds, which often form spontaneously without the need for additional enzymes. With the development of single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy techniques, the detailed mechanical roles of these intramolecular covalent bonds have been revealed. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in this area of research, focusing on the link between the mechanical stability and function of these covalent bonds in Gram&#8208;positive bacterial surface proteins. We also highlight the potential impact of these discoveries on the development of novel antibiotics and chemical biology tools.

         <title>STAT Protein Thermal Shift Assays to Monitor Protein&#8208;Inhibitor Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STAT proteins are a family of multifaceted transcription factors whose deregulated activity is linked to diseases like cancer and arthritis. To interrogate a selection of STAT inhibitors, we have developed a protein thermal shift assay which serves as a steppingstone between biochemical thermal stability assays and cellular thermal shift assays.







Abstract
STAT3 protein is a sought&#8208;after drug target as it plays a key role in the progression of cancer. Many STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i) have been reported, but accumulating evidence suggests many of these act as off&#8208;target/indirect inhibitors of STAT signaling. Herein, we describe the STAT protein thermal shift assay (PTSA) as a novel target engagement tool, which we used to test the binding of known STAT3i to STAT3 and STAT1. This revealed STATTIC, BP&#8208;1&#8208;102, and Cpd188 destabilized both STATs and produced unique migratory patterns on SDS&#8208;PAGE gels, suggesting covalent protein modifications. Mass spectrometry experiments confirmed that these compounds are nonspecifically alkylating STATs, as well as an unrelated protein, NUDT5. These experiments have highlighted the benefits of PTSA to investigate interactions with STAT proteins and have helped reveal the novel reactivity of Cpd188. The described PTSA represents a promising chemical biology tool that could be applied to an array of other protein targets.
