      <title>Evaluation of i&#8208;Motif Formation in the Serotonin Transporter&#8208;Linked Polymorphic Region</title>
      <dc:description>Neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) arise from a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of synaptic serotonin (5&#8208;HT) and its inhibition is an important pharmacological target for treating MDD. The serotonin transporter&#8208;linked polymorphic region (5&#8208;HTTLPR) contains two major variants (short and long) which have been implicated in modulating the susceptibility to MDD by altering the level of expression of SERT. Both variants contain C&#8208;rich repeats that conform to consensus i&#8208;motif folding sequences. i&#8208;Motifs are quadruplex DNA structures that have been proposed to have a role in transcriptional regulation. With spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that both alleles are able to form i&#8208;motifs at acidic pH, and at neutral pH under conditions of molecular crowding. This highlights the potential for i&#8208;motif formation to contribute to transcriptional regulation of the serotonin transporter, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulating CRISPR/Cas9 Function through Conditional Guide RNA Control</title>
      <dc:description>Conditional control of CRISPR/Cas9 has been developed using a variety of different approaches, many focusing on manipulation of the Cas9 protein itself. However, more recent strategies for governing CRISPR/Cas9 function are based on guide RNA (gRNA) modifications. They include control of gRNAs by light, small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides. These designs have unique advantages compared to other approaches and have allowed for precise regulation of gene editing and transcription. Here, we discuss strategies for conditional control of gRNA function and compare effectiveness of these methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalently Mercurated Molecular Beacon for Discriminating the Canonical Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>A highly nucleobase discriminating metalated nucleoside analog, 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;methylaniline, was incorporated into an oligonucleotide molecular beacon. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured after the addition of four different complementary strands, where the nucleobase opposite of the metalated analog varies. The fluorescence results showed a clear binding selectivity at room temperature, in the order G&gt;T&gt;C&gt;A. The selectivity is based on the different affinities between the metalated nucleoside analog and the canonical nucleobases. The synthesized probe is capable of robust discrimination between the two purine as well as the two pyrimidine bases by fluorescence at room temperature, and more sophisticated temperature analysis allows clear separation of every canonical nucleobase. The probe would, hence, be a suitable method for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms.</dc:description>

Importantly, we observed multiple nonenzymatic interconversions of these analogues in aqueous solutions and organic solvents. Furthermore, the same biosynthetic origin of these compounds was supported by one mined gene cluster. The dominant analogue (  1  ) demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to androgen&#8208;sensitive prostate cancer cells and HIF&#8208;depleted colorectal cells and mild antiaging activities, linking the bioactivity to oxidative stress.

      <title>Exploring epigenetic marks by analysis of non&#8208;covalent interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Epigenetic marks are modest chemical modifications on DNA and histone proteins that regulate the activation or silencing of genes, through modulation of the intermolecular interactions between the DNA strands and the protein machinery. The process is complex and not always well understood. One of the systems studied in greater detail is the epigenetic mark on H3K9: the lysine 9 of the histone 3. The degree of methylation or acetylation of this histone is linked to silencing or activation of the corresponding gene, but it is not clear which effect each mark has in gene expression. We shed light on this particular methylation process using density functional theory calculations (DFT) First, we built a model consisting of a DNA double strand containing three base pairs and a sequence of three amino acids of the histone&#8217;s tail. Then, we computed the modulation introduced in the intermolecular interactions by each epigenetic modification: from mono to tri&#8208;methylation and acetylation. The calculations show that while acetylation and tri&#8208;methylation results in a reduction of the DNA&#8208;peptide interaction; non&#8208;, mono&#8208;, and di&#8208;methylation increase the intermolecular interactions. Such observations compare well with the findings reported in the literature, highlighting the correlation between the balance of intermolecular forces and biological properties and advancing quantum mechanical studies of large biochemical systems at molecular level through the use of DFT methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Incorporation of halogenated amino acids into antibody fragments at multiple specific sites enhances antigen binding</title>
      <dc:description>The expansion of the amino&#8208;acid repertoire with synthetic derivatives introduces novel structures and functionalities into proteins. In the present study, we improved the antigen binding of antibodies by incorporating halogenated tyrosines at multiple selective sites. Tyrosines in the Fab fragment of an anti&#8208;EGF&#8208;receptor antibody 059&#8208;152 were systematically replaced with 3&#8208;bromo&#8208; and 3&#8208;chlorotyrosines, and simultaneous replacements at 4 specific sites were thus found to cause a 10&#8208;fold increase in the affinity toward the antigen. Structure modeling suggested that this effect was due to enhanced shape complementarity between the antigen and antibody molecules. On the other hand, we showed that chlorination in the constant domain, far from the binding interface, of Rituximab Fab also increased the affinity significantly (up to 17&#8208;fold). Our results showed that antigen binding is tunable with the halogenation&#160;in and out of the binding motifs.</dc:description>

      <title>Spectral Unmixing&#8208;Based Reaction Monitoring of Transformations between Nucleosides and Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>
Nucleosides and their nucleobases have slightly different UV absorption spectra. This can be employed for analysis and reaction monitoring by spectral unmixing, which delivers robust and fast results through the deconvolution of highly overlapping spectra. The approach is particularly useful for enzymatic reactions and incredibly versatile as it can be applied to a wealth of natural and modified nucleosides. See the communication by F. Kaspar, A. Wagner, et al. for more details, tips and software. Cover illustration by BotsAndBrainz (Anne Voigt).

      <title>Synergistic Interactions Are Prevalent in Catalytic Amyloids</title>
      <dc:description>
Just like a limited set of playing cards can provide many combinations, mixtures of peptides with different amino acids can form various functional materials. Even simple binary mixtures of heptapeptides can synergistically form catalytic amyloids with high (using arginine and glutamine), moderate (using lysine and glutamate), or low (using histidine and tyrosine) hydrolytic activities. More information can be found in the communication by I.&#8197;V. Korendovych et&#8197;al.

      <dc:description>
Making partying safer. &#947;&#8208;Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has gained attention as a drug that is frequently misused in social settings to induce euphoria and to facilitate sexual assault. A simple approach for selective sensing of GHB has been developed for drug screening and forensic investigation. Such a strategy, based on a specific enzymatic reaction, allows GHB to be analyzed in a complicated sample matrix, including biological specimens. The results can be readily acquired by either spectral assay or observation with the naked&#8208;eye. More information can be found in the full paper by B.&#8208;G. Xing et&#8197;al.

      <title>Site&#8208;specific phosphorylation of Huntingtin exon 1 recombinant proteins enabled by the discovery of novel kinases</title>
      <dc:description>Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) within the first 17 amino acids (Nt17) of exon1 of the Huntingtin protein (Httex1) play important roles in modulating its cellular properties and functions in health and disease. In particular, phosphorylation of threonine and serine residues (T3, S13, and/or S16) has been shown to inhibit Htt aggregation  in vitro  and inclusion formation in cellular and animal models of Huntington&#8217;s disease (HD). In this manuscript, we describe a new and simple methodology for producing milligram quantities of highly pure wild type or mutant Httex1 proteins that are site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated at T3 or at both S13 and S16. This advance was enabled by 1) the discovery and validation of novel kinases that efficiently phosphorylate Httex1 at S13 and S16 (TBK1), at T3 (GCK) or T3 and S13 (TNIK and HGK); and, 2) the development of an efficient methodology for producing recombinant native Httex1 proteins using a SUMO&#8208;fusion expression and purification strategy. As proof of concept, we demonstrate how this method can be applied to produce Httex1 proteins that are both site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated and fluorescently labeled or isotopically labeled. Together, these advances should increase access to these valuable tools and expand the range of methods and experimental approaches that can be used to elucidate the mechanisms by which phosphorylation influences Httex1 structure, aggregation, interactome and function(s) in health and disease.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of Six Ramoplanin Family Gene Clusters and the Lipoglycodepsipeptide Chersinamycin</title>
      <dc:description>Ramoplanins and enduracidins are peptidoglycan lipid intermediate II&#8208;binding lipodepsipeptides with broad&#8208;spectrum activity against methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Targeted genome mining using probes from conserved sequences within the ramoplanin/enduracidin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) was used to identify six microorganisms with BGCs predicted to produce unique lipodepsipeptide congeners of ramoplanin and enduracidin. Fermentation of&#160;  Micromonospora chersina  &#160;yielded a novel lipoglycodepsipeptide, called chersinamycin, which exhibited good antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria (1&#8208;2 &#181;g/mL) similar to the ramoplanins and enduracidins. The covalent structure of chersinamycin was determined by NMR and tandem mass spectrometry methods in conjunction with chemical degradation studies. These six new BGCs and isolation of a new antimicrobial peptide provide much&#8208;needed tools to investigate the fundamental aspects of lipodepsipeptide biosynthesis and to facilitate efforts to produce novel antibiotics capable of combating antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections.</dc:description>

      <title>Site Selective Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclized peptides have seen a rise in popularity in the pharmaceutical industry as drug molecules. As such, new macrocyclization methodologies have become abundant in the last several decades. However, efficient methods of cyclization without the formation of side products have still remained a great challenge. Herein, we review the cyclization approaches that focus on site selective chemistry. Site selectivity in macrocyclization decreases the generation of side products, lending to a greater yield of desired peptide macrocycles. We will also take an in&#8208;depth look at the new exclusively intramolecular N&#8208;terminal site selective CyClick strategy for synthesis of cyclic peptides. The CyClick method utilizes imine formation between an aldehyde and the N&#8208;terminus.

      <title>Photoswitchable Lipids</title>
      <dc:description>Photoswitchable lipids are emerging tools for the precise manipulation and study of lipid function.

      <title>Effect of Regiochemistry and Methylation on the Anticancer Activity of a Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Organometallic Nucleoside Analogue</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron works: A ferrocene derivative, one of a series of ferronucleosides designed by the Tucker group, shows micromolar toxicity in a range of cancer cell lines. Their latest research shows the importance to activity of having arms in adjacent positions, with the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;regioisomer much less active in bone cancer cell lines. On the other hand, N&#8208; or O&#8208;methylation has much less of an effect; this rules out a conventional mechanism of action for a nucleoside, giving further weight to one that involves the iron centre. More information can be found in the full paper by N.&#8197;J. Hodges, J.&#8197;H.&#8197;R. Tucker et&#8197;al.

      <title>Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenases NotI and NotI&#8242; Mediate Spiro&#8208;Oxindole Formation in Biosynthesis of the Notoamides</title>
      <dc:description>
The notoamides are a fascinating class of anticancer natural products where two phylogenetically related fungal strains have evolved to generate enantiomeric (mirror image) terminal products. A study of the enzymes (NotI/NotI&#8242;) responsible for spirocycle formation revealed their differential flexibility in accepting the opposite substrate and catalyzing formation of the respective spiro&#8208;oxindole product.

      <title>Using Mutability Landscapes to Guide Enzyme Thermostabilization</title>
      <dc:description>The thermostabilization of enzymes while retaining their activity and enantioselectivity for applied biocatalysis is an important topic in protein engineering. Rational and computational design strategies as well as directed evolution have been used successfully to thermostabilize enzymes. Here, we describe an alternative mutability&#8208;landscape approach that identified three single mutations (R11Y, R11I and A33D) within the enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), which has potential as a biocatalyst for pharmaceutical synthesis, that gave rise to significant increases in apparent melting temperature  T  m  (up to 20 &#176;C) and in half&#8208;life at 80 &#176;C (up to 111&#8208;fold). Introduction of these beneficial mutations in an enantioselective but thermolabile 4&#8208;OT variant (M45Y/F50A) afforded improved triple&#8208;mutant enzyme variants showing an up to 39 &#176;C increase in  T  m  value, with no reduction in catalytic activity or enantioselectivity.

      <title>Selective Covalent Targeting of Anti&#8208;Apoptotic BFL&#8208;1 by a Sulfonium Tethered Peptide</title>
      <dc:description>Anti&#8208;apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL&#8208;2) family proteins were proven targets for human cancers. Targeting the BH3&#8208;binding pockets of these anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins could reactivate apoptosis in BCL&#8208;2&#8208;depedent cancers. BFL&#8208;1 is a BCL&#8208;2 family protein overexpressed in various chemoresistant cancers. A unique cysteine at the binding interface of the BH3 and BFL&#8208;1 was previously proven as an intriguing targeting site to irreversibly inhibit BFL&#8208;1 functions with stabilized cyclic peptide bearing a covalent warhead. Recently, we developed a sulfonium tethered peptide cyclization strategy to construct peptide ligands which could selectively and efficiently react with cysteine(s) of target proteins nearby the interacting interface. Utilizing this method, we constructed a BFL&#8208;1 peptide inhibitor B4&#8208;MC, which could selectively conjugate with BFL&#8208;1 both in vitro and in cell. B4&#8208;MC showed good cellular uptake, colocalized with BFL&#8208;1 on mitochondria, and showed obvious growth inhibition of BFL&#8208;1 over&#8208;expressed cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

      <title>Epigenetic Chemical Biology: Opportunities Beyond the Advances and Opportunities in Epigenetic Chemical Biology</title>
      <dc:description>The study of epigenetics has greatly benefited from the development and application of various chemical biology approaches. In this review, we highlight the key targets for modulation and recent methods developed to enact such modulation. We discuss various chemical biology techniques to study DNA methylation and posttranslational modification of histones and their effect on gene expression. Additionally, we address the wealth of protein synthesis approaches to yield histones and nucleosomes bearing epigenetic modifications. Throughout we highlight targets which present opportunities for the chemical biology community, as well as exciting new approaches which will provide additional insight into the roles of epigenetic marks.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights into protein stability in cell lysate by 19F NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>In living organisms, protein folding and function take place in an inhomogeneous, highly crowded environment possessing a concentration of diverse macromolecules of up to 400&#160;g/L. It has been shown that the intracellular environment has a pronounced effect on the stability, dynamics and function of the protein under study and has for this reason to be considered. However, most protein studies are neglecting the presence of these macromolecules. Consequently, we probe here the overall thermodynamic stability of cold shock protein B from&#160;  Bacillus subtilis  &#160;(  Bs  CspB) in cell lysate. We found that an increase in cell lysate concentration causes a monotonic increase in thermodynamic stability of&#160;  Bs  CspB. This result strongly underlines the importance of considering the biological environment when inherent protein parameters shall be quantitatively determined. Moreover, we demonstrate that the targeted application of&#160;  19  F NMR spectroscopy operates as an ideal tool utilized to protein studies performed in complex cellular surroundings.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Se&#8208;benzyl selenoimidazolium salts are characterized by remarkable alkyl transfer potential under physiological conditions. Structure&#8208;activity correlation studies show that selective monoalkylation of primary amines depends on supramolecular interactions between the selenoimidazole leaving group and the target nucleophile.

      <title>An Enzyme Containing the Conserved Domain of Unknown Function DUF62 Acts as a Stereoselective (Rs,Sc)&#8208;S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine Hydrolase</title>
      <dc:description>Homochirality is a signature of biological systems. The essential and ubiquitous cofactor  S  &#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) is synthesized in cells from adenosine triphosphate and l&#8208;methionine to yield exclusively the (  S,S  )&#8208;SAM diastereomer.

However, (  S,S  )&#8208;SAM slowly racemizes at the sulfonium center to yield the inactive (  R,S  )&#8208;SAM, which can inhibit methyltransferases. Control of SAM homochirality has been shown to involve homocysteine  S  &#8208;methyltransferases in plants, insects, worms, yeast, and in ~18% of bacteria. Here we show that a recombinant protein containing a domain of unknown function (DUF62) from the actinomycete bacterium  Salinispora tropica  functions as a stereoselective (  R,S  )&#8208;SAM hydrolase (adenosine&#8208;forming). DUF62 proteins are encoded in the genomes of 21% of bacteria and 42% of archaea and potentially represent a novel mechanism to remediate SAM damage.</dc:description>

      <title>Prebiotic origin of pre&#8208;RNA building blocks in a urea &#8220;warm little pond&#8221; scenario.</title>
      <dc:description>Urea appears to be a key intermediate of important prebiotic synthetic pathways. Concentrated pools of urea likely existed on the surface of the early Earth, as urea is synthesized in significant quantities from hydrogen cyanide or cyanamide (widely accepted prebiotic molecules), it has extremely high water solubility, and it can concentrate to form eutectics from aqueous solutions. The dual nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic character of urea makes it an ideal precursor for the formation of nitrogenous bases. We propose a model for the origin of a variety of canonical and non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, including some known to form supramolecular assemblies that contain Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;like base pairs. These reactions involve urea condensation with other prebiotic molecules (e.g., malonic acid) that could be driven by environmental cycles (e.g., freezing/thawing, drying/wetting). The resulting heterocycle assemblies are compatible with the formation of nucleosides and, possibly, the chemical evolution of molecular precursors to RNA. We show that urea eutectics at moderate temperature represent a robust prebiotic source of nitrogenous heterocycles. The simplicity of these pathways, and their independence from specific or rare geological events, support the idea of urea being of fundamental importance to the prebiotic chemistry that gave rise to life on Earth.</dc:description>

      <title>Simple analysis of primary and secondary bile salt hydrolysis in mouse and human gut microbiome samples using fluorogenic substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Animals produce bile to maximize absorption of lipophilic nutrients in the gut. The physical properties of bile are largely dictated by amphipathic bile salt molecules, which also participate in signalling pathways by modulating physiological processes upon binding host receptors. Upon excretion of bile salts from the gall bladder into the intestine, the gut microbiome can create metabolites with modified signaling capabilities. The category and magnitude of bile salt metabolism can have positive or negative effects on the host. A key modification is bile salt hydrolysis, which is a prerequisite for all additional microbial transformations. We have synthesized five different fluorogenic bile salts for simple and continuous reporting of hydrolysis in both murine and human fecal samples. Our data demonstrate that most gut microbiomes have the highest capacity for hydrolysis of host&#8208;produced primary bile salts, but some microbially modified secondary bile salts also display significant turnover.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;active photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;based cancer treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a challenge. While several NIR&#8208;Ru(II) scaffolds have been reported, this approach has not been proven in cells. This is the first report of NIR&#8208;Ru(II) PSs that are phototoxic to cancer cells, including highly pigmented B16F10 melanoma cells. The PS family incorporated a bis(1,8&#8208;naphthyridine)&#8208;based ligand (tpbn), a bidentate thiophene&#8208;based ligand (nT; n=0&#8211;4), and a monodentate 4&#8208;picoline ligand (4&#8208;pic). All compounds absorbed light &gt;800 nm with maxima near 730 nm. Transient absorption (TA) measurements indicated that n&#8805;4 thiophene rings (4T) positioned the PDT&#8208;active triplet intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT) excited state in energetic proximity to the lowest lying triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT). 4T had low micromolar phototoxicity with PIvis and PI733nm values as large as 90 and 12, respectively. Spectroscopic studies suggested that the long&#8208;lived (&#964;TA=3&#8211;6 &#181;s) 3ILCT was accessible from the 3MLCT state, but energetically uphill in the overall photophysics. The study highlights that phototoxic effects can be achieved with NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) PSs as long as the reactive 3ILCT states are energetically accessible from the low&#8208;energy 3MLCT states. It also demonstrates that tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR light can be used to activate the PSs in highly pigmented cells where melanin attenuates shorter wavelengths of light.</dc:description>

      <title>2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles inhibit virulence gene expression and block polymyxin resistance in Salmonella enterica</title>
      <dc:description>One promising strategy to combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria is to develop compounds that block bacterial defenses against antibacterial conditions produced by the innate immune system. Salmonella enterica , which causes food&#8208;borne gastroenteritis and typhoid fever, requires histidine kinases to resist innate immune defenses such as cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). Here, we report that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles block histidine kinase&#8208;dependent phenotypes in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. We found that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles inhibited growth in low Mg  2+  , a stressful condition that requires histidine kinase&#8208;mediated responses, and decreased expression of the virulence genes pagC and pagK . Furthermore, we discovered that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles weaken Salmonella &#8217;s resistance to polymyxin B and polymyxin E, which are last&#8208;line antibiotics and models for host defense CAMPs. These findings raise the possibilities that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles can block HK&#8208;mediated bacterial defenses and can be used in combination with polymyxins to treat infections caused by Salmonella .</dc:description>

      <title>The Impact of Halogenated Phenylalanine Derivatives on NFGAIL Amyloid Formation</title>
      <dc:description>The hexapeptide hIAPP  22&#8208;27  (NFGAIL) is known as a crucial amyloid core sequence of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) whose aggregates can be used to better understand the wild&#8208;type hIAPP's toxicity to &#946;&#8208;cell death. In amyloid research, the role of hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions as potential driving forces during the aggregation process is controversially discussed not only in case of NFGAIL, but also for amyloidogenic peptides in general. Here, we used halogenation of the aromatic residue as a strategy to modulate hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions and prepared a library of NFGAIL variants containing fluorinated and iodinated phenylalanine analogues. We used thioflavin T staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) to study the impact of side&#8208;chain halogenation on NFGAIL amyloid formation kinetics. Our data revealed a synergy between aggregation behavior and hydrophobicity of the phenylalanine residue. This study introduces systematic fluorination as a toolbox to further investigate the nature of the amyloid self&#8208;assembly process.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress in the Synthesis of Homogeneous Erythropoietin (EPO) Glycoforms</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting just what you want: The FDA&#8208;approved glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) is an important therapeutic agent and is manufactured by using recombinant protein synthesis, generating a mixture of glycoforms.

Erythropoietin (EPO) has been regarded as a therapeutic glycoprotein for the clinical treatment of anaemia since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Commercial production of the 165&#8208;residue glycoprotein is by recombinant protein expression using mammalian cell lines that renders a complex mixture of glycoforms that have an identical amino acid sequence but variations in the structures of the pendant glycans. This heterogeneous nature of human recombinant EPO restricts structural and bioactivity studies in medicinal chemistry. Consequently, chemical synthesis provides an elegant approach for the preparation of complex homogeneous glycoproteins from a readily accessible pool of amino acids and sugars. In addition, the combination of chemical and biosynthesis enables robust and large&#8208;scale production of homogeneous EPO. The scope of this minireview is to summarise the recent advances in the chemical and semisyntheses of homogeneous EPO glycoforms, highlighting the versatile approaches to the preparation and structural manipulations of the carbohydrate chains incorporated into synthetic EPO glycoproteins.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting just what you want&lt;/b&gt;: The FDA&#8208;approved glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) is an important therapeutic agent and is manufactured by using recombinant protein synthesis, generating a mixture of glycoforms. We highlight recent alternative approaches employing chemical protein synthesis or semisynthesis that produce a single EPO glycoform, thus allowing the roles of the glycans to be more fully understood.

      <title>Peptidyl Acyloxymethyl Ketones as Activity&#8208;Based Probes for the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
      <dc:description>The global pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 calls for a fast development of antiviral drugs against this particular coronavirus. Chemical tools to facilitate inhibitor discovery as well as detection of target engagement by hit or lead compounds from high throughput screens are therefore in urgent need. We here report novel, selective activity&#8208;based probes that enable detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease. The probes are based on acyloxymethyl ketone reactive electrophiles combined with a peptide sequence including non&#8208;natural amino acids that targets the non&#8208;primed site of the main protease substrate binding cleft. They are the first activity&#8208;based probes for the main protease of coronaviruses and display target labeling within a human proteome without background. We expect that these reagents will be useful in the drug development pipeline, not only for the current SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but also for other coronaviruses.</dc:description>

      <title>Comparison of multiple factors that impact the efficiency of non&#8208;enzymatic DNA ligation: Key parameters for maximizing ligation rates and yields with carbodiimide activation</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical ligation is an important tool for the generation of synthetic DNA structures, which are used for a wide range of applications. Surprisingly, reported chemical ligation yields can range from 30% to 95% for the same chemical activating agent and comparable DNA structures.

Ligation rates are also shown to be sensitive to the identity of base pairs flanking a nick site, with as much as three&#8208;fold variation.

      <title>Synthesis of modified galacto&#8208; or fuco&#8208;clusters exploiting siderophore pathway to inhibit LecA or LecB associated virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
      <dc:description>Galacto and fuco&#8208;clusters conjugated with one to three catechol or hydroxamate motifs were synthesized to target LecA and LecB lectins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) localized in the outer membrane and in the bacterium. The resulting glycocluster pseudosiderophore conjugates were evaluated as Trojan horse to cross the outer membrane of (PA) thanks to iron transport. The data suggests that glycoclusters with catechol moieties were able to hijack the iron transport while those with hydroxamates showed strong non&#8208;specific interactions. Mono&#8208; and tri&#8208;catechol galactoclusters ( G1C and G3C ) were evaluated as inhibitors of the infection by PA in comparison with the free galactocluster ( G0 ). All of them exhibited an inhibitory effect between 46 to 75% at 100 mM with a higher potency than G0 .

      <title>Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids with Extended Backbones</title>
      <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) forms a triple helix with double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) stabilized by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding zipper formed by PNA&#8217;s backbone amides (N&#8208;H) interacting with RNA phosphate oxygens. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern is enabled by the matching ~5.7 &#197; spacing (typical for A&#8208;form dsRNA) between PNA&#8217;s backbone amides and RNA phosphate oxygens. We hypothesized that extending the PNA&#8217;s backbone by one &#8208;CH2&#8208; group may bring the distance between PNA amide N&#8208;H closer to 7 &#197;, favourable for hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the B&#8208;form dsDNA phosphate oxygens. Extension of PNA backbone was expected to selectively stabilize PNA&#8208;DNA triplexes compared to PNA&#8208;RNA. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized triplex&#8208;forming PNAs that had the pseudopeptide backbones extended by an additional &#8208;CH2&#8208; group in three different positions. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of the binding affinity of these extended PNA analogues for the matched dsDNA and dsRNA showed that, contrary to our structural reasoning, extending the PNA backbone at any position had a strong negative effect on triplex stability. Our results suggest that PNA may have an inherent preference for A&#8208;form&#8208;like conformations when binding double&#8208;stranded nucleic acids. It appears that the original six atoms long PNA backbone is an almost perfect fit for binding to A&#8208;form nucleic acids.</dc:description>

      <title>Photo&#8208;Biohydrogen Production by Photosensitization with Biologically Precipitated Cadmium Sulfide in Hydrogen&#8208;Forming Recombinant Escherichia coli</title>
      <dc:description>An inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system, which integrates features of both stable and efficient semiconductors and selective and efficient enzymes, is attractive for facilitating the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen. In this study, we aimed to develop a new photocatalytic hydrogen production system, based on  Escherichia coli  whole&#8208;cell genetically engineered for the highly active hydrogen formation as a biocatalysis part. The photocatalysis part was obtained by bacterial precipitation of cadmium sulfide (CdS), which is a visible light responsive semiconductor. The recombinant  E. coli  cells were sequentially subjected to CdS precipitation and heterologous [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase synthesis, to yield a CdS@  E. coli  hybrid capable of light energy conversion and hydrogen formation in a single cell. The CdS@  E. coli  hybrid achieved photocatalytic hydrogen production with a sacrificial electron donor, demonstrating the feasibility of our system and expanding the current knowledge of photosensitization using a whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst with a bacterially precipitated semiconductor.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system, which integrates features of both stable and efficient semiconductors and selective and efficient enzymes, is attractive for facilitating the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen. In this study, we aimed to develop a new photocatalytic hydrogen production system, based on  Escherichia coli  whole&#8208;cell genetically engineered for the highly active hydrogen formation as a biocatalysis part. The photocatalysis part was obtained by bacterial precipitation of cadmium sulfide (CdS), which is a visible light responsive semiconductor. The recombinant  E. coli  cells were sequentially subjected to CdS precipitation and heterologous [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase synthesis, to yield a CdS@  E. coli  hybrid capable of light energy conversion and hydrogen formation in a single cell. The CdS@  E. coli  hybrid achieved photocatalytic hydrogen production with a sacrificial electron donor, demonstrating the feasibility of our system and expanding the current knowledge of photosensitization using a whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst with a bacterially precipitated semiconductor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Methyltransferase contingencies in the pathway of everninomicin D antibiotics and analogs</title>
      <dc:description>Everninomicins are orthoester oligosaccharide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. Everninomicins act via disruption of ribosomal assembly in a distinct region in comparison to clinically prescribed drugs.

Analyses of gene&#8208;replacement and genetic complementation mutants established the mutability of the everninomicin scaffold through the generation of twelve previously unreported analogs and, together with previous results, permitted assignment of the ten methyltransferases required for everninomicin biosynthesis. The in vitro activity of A1  &#8208; and H&#8208;ring modifying methyltransferases demonstrated the ability to catalyze late&#8208;stage modification of the scaffold on an A  1  &#8208;ring phenol and H&#8208;ring C&#8208;4&#8217; hydroxyl moiety.

      <title>A Hydroxyquinoline&#8208;Based Unnatural Amino Acid for the Design of Novel Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Expanding biotransformations: Several metal&#8208;binding noncanonical amino acids have been incorporated into protein scaffolds to create artificial metalloenzymes. We introduced 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)propanoic acid (HQAla) into lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) and complexed it with several transition metal ions such as CuII, ZnII and RhIII to showcase its catalytic potential in a variety of different reactions.







Abstract
We have examined the potential of the noncanonical amino acid (8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)alanine (HQAla) for the design of artificial metalloenzymes. HQAla, a versatile chelator of late transition metals, was introduced into the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) by stop codon suppression methodology. LmrR_HQAla was shown to complex efficiently with three different metal ions, CuII, ZnII and RhIII to form unique artificial metalloenzymes. The catalytic potential of the CuII&#8208;bound LmrR_HQAla enzyme was shown through its ability to catalyse asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Craft alkylation and water addition, whereas the ZnII&#8208;coupled enzyme was shown to mimic natural Zn hydrolase activity.

      <title>Probing the Compatibility of an Enzyme&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay toward the Reprogramming of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Adenylation Domains</title>
      <dc:description>
A reprogramming platform: An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of aryl acid adenylation (A) domains. Combined with a directed&#8208;evolution approach, the ELISA technology can be used to isolate aryl acid A&#8208;domains with the desired activity.







Abstract
An important challenge in natural product biosynthesis is the biosynthetic design and production of artificial peptides. One of the most promising strategies is reprogramming adenylation (A) domains to expand the substrate repertoire of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, the precise detection of subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of A domains might accelerate their reprogramming. Here we show that an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect the effects of substrate binding pocket residue substitutions in A&#8208;domains. When coupled with a set of aryl acid A&#8208;domain variants (total of nine variants), the ELISA can analyze the subtle differences in their active&#8208;site architectures. Furthermore, the ELISA&#8208;based screening was able to identify the variants with substrate binding pockets that accepted a non&#8208;cognate substrate from an original pool of 45. These studies demonstrate that ELISA is a reliable platform for providing insights into the active&#8208;site properties of A&#8208;domains and can be applied for the reprogramming of NRPS A&#8208;domains.

      <title>Trimethylation of the R5 Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptide Increases Silica Particle Size by Redirecting Orthosilicate Binding</title>
      <dc:description>
Unexpected direction: The silaffin R5 peptide precipitates silica from solutions of orthosilicic acid. Post&#8208;translational modifications in R5 modulate silica morphology. We studied the effect of lysine trimethylation, which installs a positive charge, on silica particle formation. Surprisingly, trimethylation led to larger particle sizes by reducing the maximum activity of R5 and redirecting orthosilicate binding to the R5N terminus.







Abstract
The unmodified R5 peptide from silaffin in the diatom Cylindrotheca fusiformis rapidly precipitates silica particles from neutral aqueous solutions of orthosilicic acid. A range of post&#8208;translational modifications found in R5 contribute toward tailoring silica morphologies in a species&#8208;specific manner. We investigated the specific effect of R5 lysine side&#8208;chain trimethylation, which adds permanent positive charges, on silica particle formation. Our studies revealed that a doubly trimethylated R5K3,4me3 peptide has reduced maximum activity yet, surprisingly, generates larger silica particles. Molecular dynamics simulations of R5K3,4me3 binding by the precursor orthosilicate anion revealed that orthosilicate preferentially associates with unmodified lysine side&#8208;chain amines and the peptide N terminus. Thus, larger silica particles arise from reduced orthosilicate association with trimethylated lysine side chains and their redirection to the N terminus of the R5 peptide.

      <title>Effect of metal shielding on the enzymatic construction of artificial base pairs</title>
      <dc:description>Formation of metal base pairs is a versatile method for the introduction of metal cations into nucleic acids that has been applied in numerous applications including the construction of metal nanowires, development of energy, charge transfer devices and expansion of the genetic alphabet. As an alternative, enzymatic construction of metal base pairs represents an alluring strategy that grants access to longer sequences and offers the possibility of using such unnatural base pairs (UBPs) in SELEX experiments for the identification of functional nucleic acids. This method remains rather underexplored and a better understanding of the key parameters in the design of efficient nucleotides is required. Herein, we have investigated the effect of methylation of the imidazole nucleoside (dImnMe&#160;  TP) on the efficiency of the enzymatic construction of metal base pairs. The presence of methyl substituents on&#160;dImTP&#160;facilitates the polymerase&#8208;driven formation of  dIm4Me  &#8208;Ag  I  &#8208;dIm  and  dIm2Me  TP&#8208;  Cr  III  &#8208;  dIm  base pairs. Steric factors rather than basicity of the imidazole nucleobase appear to govern the enzymatic formation of such metal base pairs. We also demonstrate the compatibility of other metal cations rarely considered in the construction of artificial metal base pairs with enzymatic DNA synthesis under both primer extension reaction and PCR conditions.

      <title>Probing the Interaction between HIV&#8208;1 Protease and the Homodimeric p66/p66&#8217; Reverse Transcriptase Precursor by Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance EPR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Opening up p66: Q&#8208;band pulsed double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy shows that binding of HIV&#8208;1 protease to the asymmetric p66/p66&#8242; homodimer precursor of HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase favours an open conformation of the p66&#8242; subunit allowing the linker connecting the RNaseH and connection domains to bind to the active site of protease in an extended conformation.







Abstract
Following excision from the Gag&#8208;Pol polyprotein, HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase is released as an asymmetric homodimer comprising two p66 subunits that are structurally dissimilar but identical in amino acid sequence. Subsequent cleavage of the RNase H domain from only one of the subunits, denoted p66&#8242;, results in the formation of the mature p66/p51 enzyme in which catalytic activity resides in the p66 subunit, and the p51 subunit (derived from p66&#8242;) provides a supporting structural scaffold. Here, we probe the interaction of the p66/p66&#8242; asymmetric reverse transcriptase precursor with HIV&#8208;1 protease by pulsed Q&#8208;band double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy to measure distances between nitroxide labels introduced at surface&#8208;engineered cysteine residues. The data suggest that the flexible, exposed linker between the RNaseH and connection domains in the open state of the p66&#8242; subunit binds to the active site of protease in a configuration that is similar to that of extended peptide substrates.

      <title>Convergent Evolution of Fungal Cysteine Dioxygenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Synchronicity: Numerous agaricomycetes contain an unusual cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) that emerged by gene duplication and adaptation from an ergothioneine biosynthetic sulfoxide synthase. It is unrelated to the thiol dioxygenases that occur in animals, plants, and bacteria. The activity of type II CDOs depends on the presence of TMH, thus synchronizing cellular cysteine oxidation with ergothioneine production. OK!







Abstract
Cupin&#8208;type cysteine dioxygenases (CDOs) are non&#8208;heme iron enzymes that occur in animals, plants, bacteria and in filamentous fungi. In this report, we show that agaricomycetes contain an entirely unrelated type of CDO that emerged by convergent evolution from enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine. The activity of this CDO type is dependent on the ergothioneine precursor N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine. The metabolic link between ergothioneine production and cysteine oxidation suggests that the two processes might be part of the same chemical response in fungi, for example against oxidative stress.

      <title>Analysis of Modified Nucleotide Aptamer Library Generated by Thermophilic DNA Polymerases</title>
      <dc:description>
To select aptamers with modified nucleotides, the appropriate DNA polymerase must be designated. We studied eight polymerases and demonstrated that incorporating a tryptophan&#8208;like nucleotide into aptamer libraries by emulsion PCR and KOD XL had an insignificant effect on the PCR bias and did not distort the sequence space, thus making this approach the method of choice.







Abstract
One of the pivotal steps in aptamer selection is the amplification of target&#8208;specific oligonucleotides by thermophilic DNA polymerases; it can be a challenging task if nucleic acids possessing modified nucleotides are to be amplified. Hence, the identification of compatible DNA polymerase and modified nucleotide pairs is necessary for effective selection of aptamers with unnatural nucleotides. We present an in&#8208;depth study of using 5&#8208;indolyl&#8208;AA&#8208;dUTP (TAdUTP) to generate oligonucleotide libraries for aptamer selection. We found that, among the eight studied DNA polymerases, only Vent(exo&#8208;) and KOD XL are capable of adapting TAdUTP, and that replacing dTTP did not have a significant effect on the productivity of KOD XL. We demonstrated that water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion PCR is suitable for the generation of aptamer libraries of modified nucleotides. Finally, high&#8208;throughput sequence analysis showed that neither the error rate nor the PCR bias was significantly affected by using TAdUTP. In summary, we propose that KOD XL and TAdUTP could be effectively used for aptamer selection without distorting the sequence space of random oligonucleotide libraries.

      <title>The Rieske Oxygenase SnoT Catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxylation of l&#8208;Rhodosamine in Nogalamycin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Order! The binding of nogalamycin to DNA is facilitated by its carbohydrate units. The 2&#8220;&#8208; and 4&#8221;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine are particularly important for the bioactivity due to hydrogen bonding interactions. We have elucidated the biosynthetic steps for l&#8208;nogalamine formation and show that SnoT installs the 2&#8220;&#8208;hydroxy group, followed by 2&#8211;5&#8221;&#8208;carbocyclization and 4&#8220;&#8208;epimerization by SnoK and SnoN, respectively.







Abstract
Nogalamycin is an anthracycline anti&#8208;cancer agent that intercalates into the DNA double helix. The binding is facilitated by two carbohydrate units, l&#8208;nogalose and l&#8208;nogalamine, that interact with the minor and major grooves of DNA, respectively. However, recent investigations have shown that nogalamycin biosynthesis proceeds through the attachment of l&#8208;rhodosamine (2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;l&#8208;nogalamine) to the aglycone. Herein, we demonstrate that the Rieske enzyme SnoT catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation of l&#8208;rhodosamine as an initial post&#8208;glycosylation step. Furthermore, we establish that the reaction order continues with 2&#8211;5&#8242;&#8242; carbocyclization and 4&#8242;&#8242; epimerization by the non&#8208;heme iron and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent enzymes SnoK and SnoN, respectively. These late&#8208;stage tailoring steps are important for the bioactivity of nogalamycin due to involvement of the 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine in hydrogen bonding interactions with DNA.

      <title>Insight into Isoprenoid Biosynthesis by Functional Analysis of Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthases from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
      <dc:description>
Analysis of E&#8208;IDSs from Mycobacterium species has clarified their functions: Mv0992 and Mv1577 would be E&#8208;C45 and E&#8208;C20 synthases, respectively; Mv3536 (an E&#8208;C10&#8211;20 synthase) released an E&#8208;C10 intermediate during continuous condensation; Rv0562 and Rv2173 had similar functions to Mv0992 and Mv3536, respectively; and reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as a substrate for Z&#8208;IDS (Mv3822).







Abstract
Comprehensive functional analyses of E&#8208;isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (E&#8208;IDSs) from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium vanbaalenii have been performed. Mv0992 and Mv1577 represent a nonaprenyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C45) synthase and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C20) synthase, respectively. Although Mv3536 was identified as an E&#8208;C20 synthase using a single enzyme, co&#8208;incubation of Mv3536 and Z&#8208;IDSs (Mv4662 and Mv3822) strongly suggested it releases an intermediate geranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C10) during a continuous condensation reaction. Mv0992 and Mv3536 functions differed from those of the previously reported pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis homologues Rv0562 and Rv2173, respectively. Re&#8208;analysis of Rv0562 and Rv2173 demonstrated that their functions were similar to those of Mv0992 and Mv3536 (Rv0562: E&#8208;C45 synthase; Rv2173: E&#8208;C10&#8211;15 synthase). The newly proposed functions of Rv0562 and Rv2173 would be in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and glycosyl carrier lipids essential for growth. Furthermore, a reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as the Z&#8208;IDS of the Mv3822 substrate, thereby introducing a potentially novel pathway of cyclic sesquarterpene biosynthesis.

Mv0992 and Mv1577 represent a nonaprenyl diphosphate (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;45&lt;/sub&gt;) synthase and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) synthase, respectively. Although Mv3536 was identified as an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; synthase using a single enzyme, co&#8208;incubation of Mv3536 and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;IDSs (Mv4662 and Mv3822) strongly suggested it releases an intermediate geranyl diphosphate (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) during a continuous condensation reaction. Mv0992 and Mv3536 functions differed from those of the previously reported pathogenic &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; homologues Rv0562 and Rv2173, respectively. Re&#8208;analysis of Rv0562 and Rv2173 demonstrated that their functions were similar to those of Mv0992 and Mv3536 (Rv0562: &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;45&lt;/sub&gt; synthase; Rv2173: &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;10&#8211;15&lt;/sub&gt; synthase). The newly proposed functions of Rv0562 and Rv2173 would be in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and glycosyl carrier lipids essential for growth. Furthermore, a reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;IDS of the Mv3822 substrate, thereby introducing a potentially novel pathway of cyclic sesquarterpene biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photochemical RNA Editing of C to U by Using Ultrafast Reversible RNA Photo&#8208;crosslinking in DNA/RNA Duplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Pinpoint C to U conversion: We evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The most hydrophilic photo&#8208;crosslinker induced the fastest deamination of cytosine. Inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing.







Abstract
RNA editing, which is used to edit nucleobases in RNA strands; is more feasible for use in medical applications than DNA editing. We previously reported the photochemical conversion of cytosine to uracil, which required photo&#8208;crosslinking, deamination, and photo&#8208;splitting. Here, we evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The photo&#8208;crosslinker 3&#8208;carboxyvinylcarbazole(OHVK), which is more hydrophilic than 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole(CNVK), 3&#8208;carboxyamidevinylcarbazole(NH2VK), and 3&#8208;methoxy carbonylvinylcarbazole(OMeVK), induced faster deamination of cytosine. Furthermore, inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing. Upon evaluation of the conversion from cytosine to uracil in RNA, the use of oligodeoxynucleotides containing OHVK and inosine and the polarity of the bases surrounding the target cytosine were found to be crucial.

      <title>Cofactors as Molecular Fossils To Trace the Origin and Evolution of Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Mutual support: Cofactors play important roles in the origin and evolution of proteins. Nucleotide&#8208;containing cofactors might have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from random amino acid sequences. Metallic cofactors also link protein evolution with geochemical variations; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry.







Abstract
Due to their early origin and extreme conservation, cofactors are valuable molecular fossils for tracing the origin and evolution of proteins. First, as the order of protein folds binding with cofactors roughly coincides with protein&#8208;fold chronology, cofactors are considered to have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from pools of random amino acid sequences. Second, in the subsequent evolution of proteins, cofactors still played an important role. More interestingly, as metallic cofactors evolved with geochemical variations, some geochemical events left imprints in the chronology of protein architecture; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry. In this paper, we attempt to review the molecular fossils used in tracing the origin and evolution of proteins, with a special focus on cofactors.

      <title>Towards Zwitterionic Oligonucleotides with Improved Properties: the NAA/LNA&#8208;Gapmer Approach</title>
      <dc:description>Oligonucleotides (ON) are promising therapeutic candidates, for instance by blocking endogenous mRNA (antisense mechanism). However, ON usually require structural modifications of the native nucleic acid backbone to ensure satisfying pharmacokinetic properties. One such strategy to design novel antisense oligonucleotides is the replacement of native phosphate diester units by positively charged artificial linkages, thus leading to (partially) zwitterionic backbone structures. Herein, we report a gapmer architecture comprised of one zwitterionic central segment ('gap') containing nucleosyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;modifications and two outer segments of locked nucleic acid (LNA). This NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach furnished a partially zwitterionic ON with optimised properties: (i) the formation of stable ON&#8208;RNA duplexes with base&#8208;pairing fidelity and superior target selectivity at 37 &#176;C; and (ii) excellent stability in complex biological media. Overall, the NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach is thus established as a strategy to design partially zwitterionic ON for the future development of novel antisense agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Macrocyclization of a ligand targeting a toxic RNA dramatically improves potency</title>
      <dc:description>RNA molecules both contribute to and are causative of many human diseases. One method to perturb RNA function is to target its structure with small molecules. However, discovering bioactive ligands for RNA targets is challenging. Here, we show that the bioactivity of a linear dimeric ligand that inactivates the RNA trinucleotide repeat expansion that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 [DM1; r(CUG)exp] can be improved by macrocyclization. Indeed, the macrocyclic compound is 10&#8208;fold more potent than the linear compound for improving DM1&#8208;associated defects in cells, including in patient&#8208;derived myotubes (muscle cells). This enhancement in potency is due to the macrocycle&#8217;s increased affinity and selectivity for the target, thereby inhibiting r(CUG)exp&#8217;s toxic interaction with muscleblind&#8208;like 1 (MBNL1), and its superior cell permeability. Macrocyclization may prove an effective way to enhance the bioactivity of modularly assembled ligands targeting RNA.</dc:description>

      <title>Multivalent Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Macromolecules: Linking Increased Binding Affinity with Enhanced Innate Immune Killing</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the line of fire: Macromolecular antibody recruiting molecules can bind though multivalent interaction with endogenous antibodies and draw these to the surface of target cells or pathogen, thereby marking the latter for innate immune destruction.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) are a novel class of immunotherapeutics. They are capable of introducing antibodies onto disease&#8208;relevant targets such as cancer cells, bacterial cells or viruses. This can induce antibody&#8208;mediated immune responses such as antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody&#8208;dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), which can kill the pathogen. In contrast to the classic ARMs, multivalent ARMs could offer the advantage of increasing the efficiency of antibody recruitment and subsequent innate immune killing. Such compounds consist of multiple target&#8208;binding termini (TBT) and/or antibody&#8208;binding termini (ABT). Those multivalent interactions are able to convert low binding affinities into increased binding avidities. This minireview summarizes the current status of multivalent ARMs and gives insight into possible benefits, hurdles still to be overcome and future perspectives.

      <title>Exploring the Chemoselectivity towards Cysteine Arylation by Cyclometallated AuIII Compounds: New Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting your gold right: Cyclometallated AuIII complexes with bidentate C^N&#8208;donor ligands enable chemoselective cysteine modification of peptides by C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination.

To gain more insight into the factors controlling efficient cysteine arylation by cyclometallated AuIII complexes, the reaction between selected gold compounds and different peptides was investigated by high&#8208;resolution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR&#8208;LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS). The deduced mechanisms of C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling, also supported by density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, evidenced the key role of secondary peptidic gold binding sites in favouring the process of reductive elimination.

      <title>Increased Lipophilicity of Halogenated Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Leads to Decreased Phototoxicity in&#8197;vitro when Used as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
One up, one down: RuII polypyridyl complexes are prime candidates for the development of new photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. Increasing their lipophilicity could result in improved pharmacological properties. The relationship between lipophilicity and in&#8197;vitro phototoxicity of halogenated RuII complexes was investigated.







Abstract
In the fight against cancer, photodynamic therapy is generating great interest thanks to its ability to selectively kill cancer cells without harming healthy tissues. In this field, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, and more specifically, complexes with dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz) as a ligand are of particular interest due to their DNA&#8208;binding and photocleaving properties. However, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes can sometimes suffer from low lipophilicity, which hampers cellular internalisation through passive diffusion. In this study, four new [Ru(dppz&#8208;X2)3]2+ complexes (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I) were synthesized and their lipophilicity (logP), cytotoxicity and phototoxicity on cancerous and noncancerous cell lines were assessed. This study shows that, counterintuitively, the phototoxicity of these complexes decreases as their lipophilicity increases; this could be due solely to the atomic radius of the halogen substituents.

      <title>Chemical Knockdown of MicroRNA with Small&#8208;Molecule Chimeras</title>
      <dc:description>
Targeting &#8220;undruggable&#8221; RNA: In this concept article, we introduce the development and application of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) to the targeted degradation of microRNAs. Due to their high specificity and potency, SMCs present an unprecedented chemical approach to knock down endogenous miRNAs, and thus should contribute to both biological discovery and therapeutic development.







Abstract
This concept article introduces the emerging area of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) for knocking down microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous gene silencers involved in diverse pathological processes. Compared with agents for genetic knockdown, small&#8208;molecules hold significant promise in this field due to their ideal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The SMCs introduced here are hetero&#8208;bifunctional molecules comprising small&#8208;molecule binders (SMBs) of miRNAs and chemical functionalities that either directly cleave RNAs or recruit ribonucleases to destroy RNAs. Binding of SMBs to miRNAs brings SMCs&#8217; chemical functionalities close to the miRNA, eventually causing miRNA degradation. Compared with parent SMBs, SMCs exhibit remarkably enhanced potency and specificity in miRNA inhibition. The development and application of SMCs for miRNAs will be discussed.

      <title>Nonhydrolyzable Heptose Bis&#8208; and Monophosphate Analogues Modulate Pro&#8208;inflammatory TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Small change, big difference: A series of nonhydrolyzable analogues of bacterial heptosides has been synthesized and assayed on whole cells. Interestingly, depending on the functional groups at the 7&#8208;position of the heptose scaffold and in the vicinity of the anomeric position, some molecules could trigger an inflammatory response whereas others were antagonists of heptose&#8208;1,7&#8208;bisphosphate.







Abstract
d&#8208;Glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;,7&#8208;bisphosphate (HBP) and d&#8208;glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;&#8208;phosphate (H1P) are bacterial metabolites that were recently shown to stimulate inflammatory responses in host cells through the activation of the TIFA&#8208;dependent NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway. To better understand structure&#8208;based activity in relation to this process, a family of nonhydrolyzable phosphonate analogues of HBP and H1P was synthesized. The inflammation modulation by which these molecules induce the TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signal axis was evaluated in&#8197;vivo at a low&#8208;nanomolar concentration (6&#8197;nM) and compared to that of the natural metabolites. Our data showed that three phosphonate analogues had similar stimulatory activity to HBP, whereas two phosphonates antagonized HBP&#8208;induced TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. These results open new horizons for the design of pro&#8208;inflammatory and innate immune modulators that could be used as vaccine adjuvant.

      <title>Crossing the Border: From Keto&#8208; to Imine Reduction in Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases</title>
      <dc:description>
Willing to learn: In the context of enzymatic asymmetric reduction SDRs are mainly known for their ability to reduce ketones, rather than imines. However, both activities are based on the same catalytic triad. Using a rational approach inspired by two imine&#8208;reducing SDRs, the keto&#8208;reducing M77_SDR was equipped with imine&#8208;reducing capability.







Abstract
The family of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent short&#8208;chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) comprises numerous biocatalysts capable of C=O or C=C reduction. The highly homologous noroxomaritidine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus and Zt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae, however, are SDRs with an extended imine substrate scope. Comparison with a similar SDR from Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR) exhibiting keto&#8208;reducing activity, yet negligible imine&#8208;reducing capability, and mining the Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Engineering Database indicated that NR and Zt_SDR possess a unique active&#8208;site composition among SDRs. Adapting the active site of Ao_SDR accordingly improved its imine&#8208;reducing capability. By applying the same strategy, an unrelated SDR from Methylobacterium sp. 77 (M77_SDR) with distinct keto&#8208;reducing activity was engineered into a promiscuous enzyme with imine&#8208;reducing activity, thereby confirming that the ability to reduce imines can be rationally introduced into members of the &#8220;classical&#8221; SDR enzyme family. Thus, members of the SDR family could be a promising starting point for protein approaches to generate new imine&#8208;reducing enzymes.
