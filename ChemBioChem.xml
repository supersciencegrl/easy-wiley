         <title>Harnessing from Nature &#8211; Evolving Potential of Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are recognized as one of the most ancient components of innate immunity, playing a pivotal role as the first line of host defense systems. These evolutionarily conserved molecules have been identified in various organisms, from prokaryotes to humans. AMPs establish a delicate balanced relationship between host and microbes, by simultaneously regulating the biological activities of pathogens and commensal microbes. Given the escalating global concern over antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to explore alternative strategies to combat challenging infectious diseases. AMPs have emerged as promising candidates employed in clinical practice due to their sustainable bactericidal properties. Witnessed by deep understanding of AMPs actions toward host and bacteria, the potential applications of AMPs extend far beyond infection control. Emerging developments harnessed natural capabilities of AMPs to optimize their roles in modulating host signaling, treating diverse diseases, advancing biosensing and bioimaging technologies. In this Concept paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the diversity and properties of AMPs. Additionally, we elaborate on the mechanisms underlying AMP activity and bacterial responses counteracting AMP's&#160;functions. Most importantly, we discuss potential biomedical applications of AMPs and offer perspectives on their future development.</dc:description>

         <title>The History of Studies on Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is no doubt that breakthroughs in the enzyme&#8208;mediated formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis constitute significant milestones in the biosynthesis of complex natural products. In this review, we summarize the understanding of the biosynthesis of the oxetane ring of paclitaxel from different viewpoints. Generally, it covers five aspects, (1) a different understanding of the mechanistic formation of the oxetane ring on the basis of sound chemical reasoning, (2) a reasonable speculation of the biosynthetic pathways and suitable surrogate substrates for oxetane ring formation based on the natural and chemical logical analysis, (3)&#160;Taxus genome&#8208;enabled enzymes identification, (4) the discovery of different enzymes that mediate oxetane ring formation, and (5) a mechanistic investigation involving the use of isotopic labelling experiments and quantum chemical calculations. This review provides a detailed overview of the history of the studies on the oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis, which may be useful for a better understanding this process in combined view of nature, chemistry and biology logics, also for efficient heterologous reconstruction of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic characterization of bacillibactin in thermophilic Bacillaceae and its potential for&#160;in vitro mutational synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacillibactin (BB) is a microbial siderophore produced by Bacillus species. BB is biosynthesized from 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3&#8208;DHB), Gly, and L&#8208;Thr by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes DhbE, DhbB, and DhbF. The biosynthetic gene cluster (dhb) is also conserved in some strains of thermophilic genera, Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus and Parageobacillus. However, the production of BB from these thermophilic bacteria has not been characterized. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro characterization of BB biosynthesis in Parageobacillus sp. KH3&#8208;4 which grows at 65&#176;C. We confirmed BB production in this thermophilic bacterium and the gene cluster active. In vitro enzymatic analysis revealed that 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) encoded in the same gene cluster is responsible for the post&#8208;translational maturation of carrier proteins. DhbE and DhbF showed substrate preference to 2,3&#8208;DHB and Gly and L&#8208;Thr, respectively, consistent with the chemical structure of BB. With the purified enzymes, we successfully reconstituted the NRPS assembly line in vitro. In addition, using chemically synthesized acyl&#8208;N&#8208;acetylcysteamine substrate analogues, BB analogues possessing methylbenzoyl groups instead of 2,3&#8208;DHB were detected. This study provides a new insight into secondary metabolism in thermophiles, and it expands the temperature limitation of NRPS enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A ratiometric fluorescent probe for sensitively tracking peroxynitrite during drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the essential components of reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) plays an indispensable role in redox homeostasis and signal transduction processes, and its deviant levels are associated with numerous clinical diseases. Therefore, accurate and rapid detection of intracellular ONOO&#8208; levels is crucial for revealing its role in physiological and pathological processes. Herein, we constructed a ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect ONOO&#8208; levels in biological systems. The probe represents fast reaction rate (within 15 min), outstanding selectivity, good sensitivity (LOD = 13.32 nM) and stability to ONOO&#8208;, and it was successfully used for visualizing endogenous ONOO&#8208; in living cells. More importantly, it has also been used for tracking the changes of intracellular ONOO&#8208; during drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity with ratiometric fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Laccase Functional Analysis: Substrates, Activity Assays, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme functional analysis is a multifaceted process that can be used for various purposes, such as screening for specific activities, as well as developing, optimising, and validating processes or final products. Functional analysis methods are crucial for assessing enzyme performance and catalytic properties. Laccase, a well&#8208;known blue multi&#8208;copper oxidase, holds immense potential in diverse industries such as pharmaceuticals, paper and pulp, food and beverages, textiles, and biorefineries due to its clean oxidation process and versatility in handling a wide range of substrates. Despite its prominence, the use of laccase encounters challenges in selecting appropriate functional analysis substrates and methods. This review delves into the substrates utilised in qualitative and quantitative techniques for laccase activity analysis. Although laccase catalyses mono&#8208;electron oxidation of aromatic hydroxyl, amine, and thiol compounds efficiently, using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor, the review identifies limitations in the specificity of the commonly employed substrates, concerns regarding the stability of certain compounds and highlights potential strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging&#8208;guided Photothermal Activated Pyroptosis For Precision Therapy Of Glioma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer therapy faces challenges with apoptosis resistance, steering focus towards alternative pathways like pyroptosis. Photothermal therapy (PTT) offers a precise, non&#8208;invasive method to reduce pyroptosis&#8208;related side effects by using NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging for glioma targeting. A polymer semiconductor PTT agent, coated by mesoporous silica, showed potential in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo pyroptosis induction, offering a promising method for glioma therapy.







Abstract
The resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis poses a significant challenge in cancer therapy, driving the exploration of alternative cell death pathways such as pyroptosis, known for its rapid and potent effects. While initial efforts focused on chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis, concerns about systemic inflammation highlight the need for precise activation strategies. Photothermal therapy emerges as a promising non&#8208;invasive technique, minimizing pyroptosis&#8208;related side effects by targeting tumors spatially and temporally. However, accurately pinpointing tumors to avoid collateral damage remains a challenge. Thus, we utilize NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging to achieve precise PTT&#8208;induced pyroptosis activation in glioma. A polymer semiconductor&#8208;based PTT agent was developed with high optical stability, integrated with mesoporous silica to enhance its biocompatibility. These nanoparticles, stabilized through PEG modification and targeted with cRGD peptides, effectively induced pyroptosis in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, this design facilitated precise tumor imaging guidance and subsequent pyroptosis activation in&#8197;vivo, presenting a promising strategy for glioma therapy with minimized adverse effects.

         <title>Target Identification of Marine Natural Product Odoamide:Odoamide Induces Apoptotic Cell Death by Targeting ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Alpha 1 (ATP1A1)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odoamide, a member of the aurilide&#8208;family, exhibits highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. This study clarifies the target protein and MOA of odoamide by an affinity&#8208;based methodology, followed by analyses of the binding protein and odoamide&#8208;resistant cells. We discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of odoamide for drug development.







Abstract
Marine natural products show a large variety of unique chemical structures and potent biological activities. Elucidating the target molecule and the mechanism of action is an essential and challenging step in drug development starting with a natural product. Odoamide, a member of aurilide&#8208;family isolated from Okinawan marine cyanobacterium, has been known to exhibit highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the target protein and the cytotoxic mechanism of odoamide. Compared to existing anticancer agents, odoamide showed a unique fingerprint in the JFCR39 cancer cell panel and a characteristic pattern in gene expression profiling. Affinity chromatography utilizing a biologically active odoamide probe identified ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) as a specific binding protein. Additionally, cells resistant to odoamide were found to have mutations at Gly98 and Gly99 of the ATP1A1 protein. The apparently attenuated cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of odoamide in odoamide&#8208;resistant cells suggests that the induction of these activities by odoamide is critically dependent on its interaction with ATP1A1. We conclude that odoamide induces apoptotic cell death by targeting ATP1A1, and we discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of ATP1A1 inhibitors for drug discovery.

         <title>Revealing the Monooxygenase Mechanism for Selective Ring Cleavage of Anthraquinone by BTG13 through Multiscale Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzyme, BTG13, with a unique coordination of four histidines and a carboxylated&#8208;lysine, was reported to catalyze the C4a&#8208;C10 bond cleavage in anthraquinone. Our calculations demonstrated that it functions as a monooxygenase, inserting oxygen atom into the C10&#8208;C4a bond to form a lactone species, which then undergoes hydrolysis to yield a ring&#8208;opened product.







Abstract
BTG13, a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzyme with a distinctive coordination environment of four histidines and a carboxylated lysine, has been found to catalyze the cleavage of the C4a&#8208;C10 bond in anthraquinone. Contrary to typical dioxygenase mechanisms, our quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations reveal that BTG13 functions more like a monooxygenase. It selectively inserts an oxygen atom into the C10&#8208;C4a bond, creating a lactone species that subsequently undergoes hydrolysis, leading to the formation of a ring&#8208;opened product. This discovery highlights the unique catalytic properties of BTG13 and expands our understanding of non&#8208;heme iron enzyme mechanisms.

         <title>Recent advances in biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic synthesis of oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to synthetic oligonucleotides is crucial for applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology. Traditional solid phase synthesis is limited by sequence length and complexities, low yields, high costs and poor sustainability. Similarly, polymerase&#8208;based approaches such as in vitro transcription and primer extension reactions do not permit any control on the positioning of modifications and display poor substrate tolerance. In response, biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategies have emerged as promising alternatives, offering selective and efficient pathways for oligonucleotide synthesis. These methods leverage the precision and efficiency of enzymes to construct oligonucleotides with high fidelity. Recent advancements have focused on optimized systems and/or engineered enzymes enabling the incorporation of chemically modified nucleotides. Biocatalytic approaches, particularly those using DNA/RNA polymerases provide advantages in milder reaction conditions and enhanced sustainability. Chemoenzymatic methods, combining chemical synthesis and enzymes, have proven to be effective in overcoming limitations of traditional solid phase synthesis. This review summarizes recent developments in biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategies to construct oligonucleotides, highlighting innovations in enzyme engineering, substrate and reaction condition optimization for various applications. We address crucial details of the methods, their advantages, and limitations as well as important insights for future research directions in oligonucleotide production.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay between C&#945; Methylation and C&#945; Stereochemistry in the Folding Energetics of a Helix&#8208;Rich Miniprotein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparison of the achiral residue 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and chiral &#945;&#8208;methylated analogues as modifications in a helix&#8208;rich miniprotein reveals a synergistic thermodynamic benefit from C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter. These results help inform the use of these monomers in design of helical peptide mimetics and yield new fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;helix is an abundant and functionally important element of protein secondary structure, which has motivated intensive efforts toward chemical strategies to stabilize helical folds. One such method is the incorporation of non&#8208;canonical backbone composition through an additional methyl substituent at the C&#945; atom. Examples of monomers include the achiral 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) with geminal dimethyl substitution and chiral analogues with one methyl and one non&#8208;methyl substituent. While Aib and chiral C&#945;&#8208;Me residues are both established helix promoting moieties, their comparative ability in this regard has not been quantitatively investigated. Addressing this gap would help to inform the use of these building blocks in the construction of peptide and protein mimetics as well as provide fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding. Here, we report a quantitative comparison of the impacts of Aib and chiral &#945;Me residues on the high&#8208;resolution folded structure and folding thermodynamics of a small helical protein. These results reveal a synergistic stabilizing effect arising from the presence of C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the most recent progress of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures based on the scaffolds of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA for biological applications, including gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription, due to their excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Nucleic acid, as a carrier of genetic information, has been widely employed as a building block for the construction of versatile nanostructures with pre&#8208;designed sizes and shapes through complementary base pairing. With excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility, nucleic acid nanostructures are extensively applied in biomedical researches, such as bio&#8208;imaging, bio&#8208;sensing, and drug delivery. Notably, the original gene&#8208;encoding capability of the nucleic acids themselves has been utilized in these structurally well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress in the design of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA&#8208;encoded nanostructures for various biological applications, such as gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription. Furthermore, the challenges and future opportunities of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures in biomedical applications will be discussed.

         <title>Activation of Caged Functional RNAs by An Oxidative Transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sUrd) in place of uridine (Urd) can exhibit loss of function. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide can convert 2sUrd to Urd. We show that a 2sUrd&#8208;containing aptamer and ribozyme can exhibit recovery of function upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, allowing for redox&#8208;switched functional behavior.







Abstract
RNA exhibits remarkable capacity as a functional polymer, with broader catalytic and ligand&#8208;binding capability than previously thought. Despite this, the low side chain diversity present in nucleic acids (two purines and two pyrimidines) relative to proteins (20+ side chains of varied charge, polarity, and chemical functionality) limits the capacity of functional RNAs to act as environmentally responsive polymers, as is possible for peptide&#8208;based receptors and catalysts. Here we show that incorporation of the modified nucleobase 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sU) into functional (aptamer and ribozyme) RNAs produces functionally inactivated polymers that can be activated by oxidative treatment. 2&#8208;thiouridine lacksthe 2&#8208;position oxygen found in uridine, altering its hydrogen bonding pattern. This limits critical interactions (e.&#8201;g., G&#8722;U wobble pairs) that allow for proper folding. Oxidative desulfurization of the incorporated 2&#8208;thiouridine moieties to uridine relieves this inability to fold properly, enabling recovery of function. This demonstration of expanded roles for RNA as environmentally responsive functional polymers challenges the notion that they are not known to be redox&#8208;sensitive. Harnessing redox switchability in RNA could regulate cellular activities such as translation, or allow switching RNA between a &#8220;template&#8221; and a &#8220;catalytic&#8221; state in &#8220;RNA World&#8221; scenarios or in synthetic biology.

&lt;p&gt;RNAs containing 2-thiouridine (&lt;b&gt;2sUrd&lt;/b&gt;) in place of uridine (&lt;b&gt;Urd&lt;/b&gt;) can exhibit loss of function. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide can convert &lt;b&gt;2sUrd&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;Urd&lt;/b&gt;. We show that a &lt;b&gt;2sUrd-&lt;/b&gt;containing aptamer and ribozyme can exhibit recovery of function upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, allowing for redox-switched functional behavior.

         <title>Protein Fusion of Biosynthetic Enzymes and a Thermo&#8208;Responsive Polypeptide Expedites Facile Access to Biocatalysts for Nucleotide Sugars</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green preparation and recycle avenue to biocatalysts for nucleotide sugars was established by protein fusion and a thermo&#8208;responsive tag. Using this strategy, five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64 and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) were successfully constructed and applied as biocatalysts. In addition, the ELP&#8208;tagged bifunctional enzymes may also be recycled from reaction solution by simple ITC process.







Abstract
Nucleotide sugars (NSs) are essential building blocks for the enzymatic assembly of glycans. In this study, we established a preparation and recycling avenue to the biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs. This approach involves fusing two enzymes into a bifunctional chimera and using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ET64) as a purification tag, which allows for easy recovery of these biocatalysts without the need for chromatography. We successfully constructed and obtained five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) for the synthesis of five common NSs (UDP&#8208;Gal, UDP&#8208;GlcNAc, GDP&#8208;Man, GDP&#8208;Fuc, and CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac). These enzymes were obtained using the Inverse Transition Cycling (ITC) process in yields ranging from 60 to 124&#8197;mg per liter of fermentation. The enzymatic synthesis of NSs was carried out on a scale from hundreds of milligrams to multiple grams using these biocatalysts. Furthermore, we investigated the reusability of these biocatalysts by recycling them from the reaction solution using the ITC process. The recycling of GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64 was effectively achieved for 15, 13, 3, and 4 times, respectively. These biocatalysts could be used not only for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs but also for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycan biomolecules when coupled with glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Proteomic Profiling of Potential E6AP Substrates via Ubiquitin&#8208;based Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Assisted Affinity Enrichment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable E6AP&#8208;Ub conjugate equipped with diazirine moieties (Ub&#8208;DEA), which mimics an essential intermediate in HECT ligase catalyzed ubiquitination and allows covalent substrate trapping by photo&#8208;crosslinking (PCL). We validate our approach in PCL&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (PCL&#8208;AE&#8208;MS) experiments and argue for its general applicability.







Abstract
The ubiquitin (Ub) ligase E6AP, encoded by the UBE3A gene, has been causally associated with human diseases including cervical cancer and Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Yet, our knowledge about disease&#8208;relevant substrates of E6AP is still limited, presumably because at least some of these interactions are rather transient, a phenomenon observed for many enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions. Here, we introduce a novel approach to trap such potential transient interactions by combining a stable E6AP&#8208;Ub conjugate mimicking the active state of this enzyme with photo&#8208;crosslinking (PCL) followed by affinity enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry (AE&#8208;MS). To enable PCL, we equipped Ub with diazirine moieties at distinct positions. We validated our PCL assisted AE&#8208;MS approach by identification of known (e.&#8201;g. PSMD4, UCHL5) and potential new (e.&#8201;g. MSH2) substrates of E6AP. Our findings suggest that PCL assisted AE&#8208;MS is indeed suited to identify substrates of E6AP, thereby providing insights into E6AP&#8208;associated pathologies, and, potentially, of other enzymes of the Ub&#8208;conjugating system.

         <title>Functional Proteins/Peptides Targeting to Clear Amyloid&#8208;&#946; for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clearance of toxic amyloid &#946;&#8208;protein (A&#946;) proteins from the brain has become the preferred therapeutic approach for reversing the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and delaying its clinical course. Anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs have been developed through various mechanisms. This article discussed the current development of anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs and their clinical progress, and then introduced potential drug development targets from both central and peripheral perspectives to develop safer and more effective anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting individuals over the age of 65. It is characterized by impairments in memory, thinking, analytical judgment, visuospatial recognition, and mood. In recent years, the development of protein and peptide drugs targeting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) has gained momentum, with several therapies entering clinical trials and even receiving marketing approval. Novel functional protein and peptide drugs, as the first&#8208;generation immunotherapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases, have pioneered cellular immunotherapy for AD. However, the currently available drugs are associated with toxicity issues, which can lead to serious complications such as cerebral hemorrhage or edema. Consequently, this study examines the potential for a new generation of A&#946;&#8208;targeting drugs to mitigate the side effects of existing treatments and offers innovative perspectives for the advancement of therapies for AD.

Conversion and characterization of the broccoli fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer into a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor for the detection of a small non&#8208;coding RNA, by destabilization of the fluorophore&#8208;binding G&#8208;quadruplex with a micro RNA&#8208;200c&#8208;dependent strand displacement and stabilization approach.







Abstract
In the last decade the important role of small non&#8208;coding RNAs such as micro RNAs (miRs) in gene regulation in healthy and disease states became more and more evident. The miR&#8208;200&#8208;family of miRs has been shown to play a critical role in many diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and could be potentially important for diagnosis and treatment. However, the size of miRs of about ~21&#8211;23&#8197;nt provide challenges for their investigation. Here we report the conversion and optimization of the Broccoli fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA&#8208;aptamer into a specific sensor for miR&#8208;200c using a strand&#8208;displacement design principle. This aptamer can differentiate miR&#8208;200c from its family members whose sequence differ by more than one nucleotide. By adding this in&#8197;vitro transcribed aptamer to RNA extracts from human cells, we can detect miR&#8208;200c in&#8197;vitro in a plate reader assay.

         <title>Evaluation of Multispecific Drugs Based on Patient&#8208;Derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept explores the use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids (PDITOs) as advanced models for evaluating multispecific drugs in cancer research. It highlights PDITOs&#8242; ability to simulate tumor&#8208;immune interactions and discusses their potential for preclinical drug testing, personalized medicine, and overcoming traditional model limitations.







Abstract
The evolution of antitumor drug development has transitioned from single&#8208;agent chemotherapy to targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and more recently, multispecific drugs. These innovative drugs target multiple cellular or molecular pathways simultaneously, offering a more comprehensive anticancer approach and addressing some of the limitations inherent in traditional monotherapies. However, preclinical assessment of multispecific drugs remains challenging, as conventional tumor models often lack the necessary complexity to accurately reflect the interactions between various cell types and targets. Patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids (PDITOs), which incorporate both tumor cells and immune cells, present a promising platform for the evaluation of these drugs. Beyond their use in drug evaluation, PDITOs can also be utilized in personalized drug screening and predicting patient&#8208;specific treatment outcomes, thus advancing both multispecific drug development and precision medicine. This perspective discusses the current landscape of multispecific drug development and the methodologies for constructing PDITOs. It also addresses the associated challenges and introduces the concept of employing these organoids to optimize the evaluation and rational design of multispecific drug therapies.

         <title>Review on the o&#8208;aminoaniline Moiety in Peptide and Protein Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and proteins are important functional biomolecules both inside and outside of living organisms. The ability to prepare various types of functionalized peptides and proteins is essential for understanding fundamental biological processes, such as protein folding and post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), and for developing new therapeutics for many diseases, such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. The o&#8208;aminoaniline moiety was first proposed for activation to a thioester precursor and used for native chemical ligation to prepare large peptides and proteins. In the past decade, the function of o&#8208;aminoaniline has been greatly expanded to facilitate the preparation of homogeneously modified peptide and protein samples, where the modifications can include cyclization, C&#8208;terminus diversification, etc. Many o&#8208;aminoaniline derivatives have also been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of previous versions. In this review, we attempt to summarize the recent developments of different o&#8208;aminoaniline derivatives, focusing&#160;on their application to the preparation of functional peptide and protein molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Broad&#8208;Range Polyphosphate Kinase&#160;2&#8209;II Enzymes Applicable for Pyrimidine Nucleoside Diphosphate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyphosphate kinases (PPK) play crucial roles in various biological processes, including energy storage and stress responses, through their interaction with inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) and the intracellular nucleotide pool. Members of the PPK family 2 (PPK2s) catalyse polyP&#8209;consuming phosphorylation of nucleotides. In this study, we characterised two PPK2 enzymes from Bacillus cereus (BcPPK2) and Lysinibacillus fusiformis (LfPPK2) to investigate their substrate specificity and potential for selective nucleotide synthesis. Both enzymes exhibited a broad substrate scope, selectively converting over 85% of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) to nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs), while nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) formation was observed only with purine NMPs. Preparative enzymatic synthesis of cytidine diphosphate (CDP) was applied to achieve an yield of 49%. Finally, structural analysis of five crystal structures of BcPPK2 and LfPPK2 provided insights into their active sites and substrate interactions. This study highlights PPK2&#8208;II enzymes as promising biocatalysts for the efficient and selective synthesis of pyrimidine NDPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an environmentally responsive fluorescent ligand for vitamin D receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a critical role in regulating multiple biological processes, including bone metabolism and cell differentiation, by mediating transcriptional activation in response to ligand binding. We have constructed an environmentally fluorescent probe 2 for VDR to facilitate real&#8208;time observation of its ligand&#8208;dependent conformational changes in living cells. This probe 2 was synthesized by introducing a dansyl fluorophore via an ethynyl group at the C11 position of 1&#945;,25(OH)2D3. Probe 2 exhibited strong environmentally responsive fluorescence, showing increased intensity and a blue shift of the peak wavelength upon binding to VDR due to the increased hydrophobicity of the environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic G&#8208;Quadruplexes in the Rous Sarcoma Virus Genome: Scaffolds for Protein Interaction and Potential Anti&#8208;Viral Targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is an onco&#8208;retrovirus that infects avian species such as the chicken (Gallus gallus). RSV is the first oncovirus to be described, and the oncogenic activity of this virus is related to the expression of a tyrosine kinase that induces carcinogenic transformation. Interestingly, we have noted that the RSV genome contains various potential G4&#8208;forming sequences. Among these, two sequences in the GAG and POL genes show high G4&#8208;forming potential. Additionally, the SRC oncogene also harbours a putative G4 forming sequence. In this study, we have characterised the G4 formation and topology in these three loci in the RSV&#8208;DNA. We have found that these sequences form dynamic G4 structures in physiological conditions, and such dynamicity may be associated with their cellular functions. Further, we have also established that these G4s are recognised by G4 interacting small&#8208;molecule ligands and the G4&#8208;stabilising protein nucleolin. The binding of these ligands induces structural shifts in the G4s, leading to changes in structure and stability. Thus, the RSV&#8208;DNA G4s may be further studied as targets to control its infection and oncogenic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Immobilizing Fluorogenic Probe for In Situ Labeling of Granzyme B Activity in Host Immune Response to Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, represent a pressing global health challenge. During the interaction between pathogen infection and host defense, bacterial infections initiate the host's immune response, which involves the activation of proteases that play a critical role in antibacterial defense. Granzyme B (GzmB), a key immune&#8208;related biomarker associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), plays a pivotal role in this process. Therefore, detecting the activity of GzmB is crucial for understanding the host immune response to bacterial infections and for developing therapeutic strategies to overcome bacterial virulence. In this study, we designed and synthesized three granzyme B&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe HCy&#8208;F demonstrates in situ imaging capability, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This development offers a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing DNA G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;Motif Structures via a Fluorescent Nucleoside Analogue: 4&#8208;Cyanoindole&#8208;2'&#8208;Deoxyribonucleoside</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the building blocks of DNA are nonfluorescent, various external fluorescence reporters have been employed to investigate the structure, dynamics, and function of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs), which play an important role in gene regulation and expression. However, most of those fluorescence reporters lack the ability to provide site&#8208;specific structural information of interest. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fluorescent nucleoside analogues that can be covalently inserted into oligonucleotides, which not only serve this purpose, but minimize any potential perturbation towards the native structure of the DNA systems in question. Herein, we characterize the spectroscopic utility of a high quantum yield fluorescent nucleoside analogue, 4&#8208;cyanoindole&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI&#8208;NS). We show that (1) incorporation of 4CNI&#8208;NS into various oligonucleotides does not alter their ability to fold into their respective native structures, nor does it affect the overall stability of those structures and (2) the fluorescence property of 4CNI&#8208;NS is sensitive to its local environment, and the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of the 4CNI&#8208;NS&#8208;containing oligonucleotides exhibit a clear dependence on their secondary structure formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 4CNI&#8208;NS can be used as a sensitive, isomorphic probe in the study of noncanonical DNA structures.</dc:description>

Herein, we characterize the spectroscopic utility of a high quantum yield fluorescent nucleoside analogue, 4-cyanoindole-2'-deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI-NS). We show that (1) incorporation of 4CNI-NS into various oligonucleotides does not alter their ability to fold into their respective native structures, nor does it affect the overall stability of those structures and (2) the fluorescence property of 4CNI-NS is sensitive to its local environment, and the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of the 4CNI-NS-containing oligonucleotides exhibit a clear dependence on their secondary structure formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 4CNI-NS can be used as a sensitive, isomorphic probe in the study of noncanonical DNA structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Modification of Lysine Mitigates Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides, which aggregate into toxic structures such as oligomers, fibrils, and plaques. The presence of these A&#946; aggregates in the brain plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Understanding how physiological factors affect A&#946; aggregation is essential, and therefore, exploring their influence in vitro will likely provide insights into their role in AD pathology. In this study, we investigated the effects of physiological, free amino acids on A&#946; aggregation dynamics. We focused on positively charged amino acids, particularly lysine, and employed a chemical modification, methylation, to neutralize its charge. Our analyses revealed that modified lysine significantly reduced A&#946; aggregation, indicating that charge distribution of amino acids plays a crucial role in modulating A&#946; aggregation behavior. These findings enhance our understanding of the regulatory factors influencing A&#946; aggregation and highlight important considerations for future research on A&#946;.</dc:description>

         <title>From Antibacterial Activity to Molecular Mechanism: Case Study of Hexapeptide RWWRWW and Its Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a potent weapon against the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Among AMPs, the ones containing tryptophan (W) and arginine (R) exhibit enhanced antimicrobial properties, benefiting from the unique physicochemical features of the two amino acids. Herein, we designed three hexapeptides, including WR, DWR (D&#8208;isomer), and RF, derived from the original sequence, RWWRWW&#8208;NH2 (RW). By combining sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG&#8208;VS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we examined AMPs&#8217; interactions with model bacterial membrane at the molecular level. Our findings revealed the innate different structural features associated with molecular aggregation and membrane activity between L&#8208;(WR, RF and RW) and D&#8208;isomer. The D&#8208;isomer was demonstrated to aggregate via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which reduced its membrane adsorption quantity and consequently weakened its disruptive effect on the model membrane; while L&#8208;isomers rarely aggregated and thus could fully interact with the model membrane. D&#8208;isomer was proven to lack a stable helical structure, while L&#8208;isomers adopted helical structures, which was believed to be the reason for DWR&#8217;s tendency to aggregate easily. This study should contribute to designing novel short&#8208;chain AMPs with high efficiency, especially in the case that D&#8208;isomers will be used.</dc:description>

         <title>A powerful organic photosensitizer for effective treatment of malignant tumor via activating antitumor immune response</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an innovative approach in cancer treatment, effectively inducing tumor cell death through light&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Additionally, PDT can also trigger antitumor immune responses, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative tumor recurrence. However, the development of highly efficient photosensitizers aimed at activating immune responses for comprehensive tumor eradication remains at an early stage. In this study, we developed a new organic photosensitizer, ThC, which exhibits excellent mitochondrial&#8208;targeting effect and significantly enhanced ROS production compared to traditional photosensitizers, such as Chlorin e6 (Ce6). Our findings demonstrate that ThC robustly induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) process in hepatic cancer cells, which could effectively transform immunologically "cold" tumors into "hot" tumors. Through in situ injection and subsequent white light irradiation, ThC achieved superior efficacy in eliminating subcutaneous hepatic tumors compared to Ce6 treatment. Immunological analyses revealed that ThC treatment led to elevated levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, along with a reduction in immunosuppressive cell populations (Tregs and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages) within the tumor microenvironment. This study provides a novel therapeutic agent with significant potential for clinical translation in the treatment of malignant tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Molecular Basis for G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binders to ALS/FTD&#8208;Associated G4C2 Repeats of the C9orf72 Gene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some neurodegenerative disorders can be driven by recurrent mutations in the C9orf72 gene. These sequences can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex secondary structures. Here, by performing in silico investigations coupled with FRET DNA melting assays, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of organic and organometallic C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders.







Abstract
The most recurrent familial cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the presence of an abnormal number of intronic GGGGCC (G4C2) repetitions in the C9orf72 gene, which has been proposed to drive ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that such G4C2 repetitions can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary structures. These G4s have been selectively stabilized by small&#8208;molecule binders, furnishing proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that targeting these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid sequences represents a novel and effective therapeutic strategy to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. However, precise information on the mechanism of action of these compounds is still lacking. Here, by performing in silico investigations, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of known structurally related C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders. Moreover, we investigated the binding properties of a strong and selective metal&#8208;based G4 stabilizer, the AuI bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex &#8211; Au(TMX)2 &#8211; showing that it moderately stabilizes G4C2 G4 RNA by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) DNA melting assays. Using metadynamics (metaD) simulations, the Au(TMX)2 binding mode and the associated free&#8208;energy landscape were also evaluated. This information paves the way for developing improved compounds to tackle ALS/FTD neurodegenerative disorders.

         <title>Methionine&#8208;Derived Fluorescent Probes Targeting Mitochondria: A Tool for Real&#8208;Time Oxidative Stress Monitoring in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed two pyridinium&#8208;based fluorophores, and among these, the methyl derivative PSSM shows strong turn&#8208;on emission via a PeT mechanism. PSSM demonstrates excellent mitochondrial localization and high selectivity among different Reactive Oxygen Species. It detects exogenous and endogenous HOCl in live cells, supported by structural analysis and imaging studies, making it a valuable tool for investigating oxidative stress at the organelle level.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in both cell signaling and defense mechanisms. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidant, aids the immune response by damaging pathogens. In this study, we developed two pyridinium&#8208;based fluorophores PSSM and PSSE for selective hypochlorite detection. Out of these two fluorescent probes, PSSM shows a strong turn&#8208;on emission via a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) mechanism, excellent mitochondrial localization, and rapid response to HOCl with high selectivity among reactive oxygen species by achieving a detection limit of 2.41&#8197;&#956;M. It successfully detects both exogenous and endogenous HOCl in live cells, enabling the study of HOCl's role at the organelle level. Structural analysis of PSSM via thioether oxidation confirmed by HPLC, NMR and HRMS further supports its specificity. Confocal imaging and flow cytometry studies further highlights its utility in investigating oxidative stress, positioning this fluorophore as a valuable tool for monitoring HOCl imbalances in biological systems.

         <title>Click Hydrogels to Assess Stiffness&#8208;Induced Activation of Pancreatic Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts and Its Impact on Cancer Cell Spreading</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) and migration of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC). Results show that substrate stiffness affects the nuclear localization dynamics of Yes&#8208;associated protein and verify the role of CAFs in promoting PCC migration under an elevated substrate stiffness.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is marked by significant desmoplastic reactions, or the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrices. PDAC stroma has abnormally high stiffness, which alters cancer cell behaviors and creates a barrier for effective drug delivery. Unfortunately, clinical trials using a combination of chemotherapy and matrix&#8208;degrading enzyme have led to disappointing results, as the degradation of stromal tissue likely accelerated the dissemination of cancer cells. High matrix stiffness has been shown to activate cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs), increasing their interaction with pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) through promoting proliferation, migration, and resistance to chemotherapy. With the advance of biomaterials science and engineering, it is now possible to design chemically defined matrices to understand the role of stiffness in activating pancreatic CAFs and how this may alter cancer cell migration. Here, we developed a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of CAFs and migration of PCCs. Our results show that matrix stiffness did not alter matrix deposition from CAFs but affected nuclear localization of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP). Our results also verify the role of CAFs on promoting PCC migration and an elevated substrate stiffness further increased PCC motility.

         <title>4&#8208;O&#8208;Methylglucaric Acid Production from Xylan with Uronic Acid Oxidase and Comparison to Glucaric Acid from Glucose</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beechwood glucuronoxylan was enzymatically hydrolyzed and the resulting 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid by uronic acid oxidase with a yield of 95&#8201;%. High purity (98&#8201;% w/w) 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated from the reaction mixture and was demonstrated to perform similarly to commercial glucaric acid in detergent builder applications.







Abstract
This study describes an enzymatic pathway to produce high purity 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid from xylan, an underutilized fraction of lignocellulosic biomass. Beechwood xylan was enzymatically hydrolysed using a commercial xylanase and an &#945;&#8208;glucuronidase from Amphibacillus xylanus to form 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid, which was then purified by anion exchange chromatography and subsequently oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid using a recombinantly produced uronic acid oxidase from Citrus sinensis. Enzymatic oxidation with uronic acid oxidase afforded 95&#8201;% yield in 72&#8197;hours which is considerably higher than yields previously achieved using a glucooligosaccharide oxidase from Sarocladium strictum. 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated by precipitation and purified by recrystallization. Characterization by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed product identity and high purity (97.8&#8201;% w/w). 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid's performance as a detergent builder was compared to commercial glucaric acid. At 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratios of detergent builder to calcium, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid provided similar calcium sequestration performance to glucaric acid (less than 5&#8201;% difference) at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;10 in the presence of surfactants, including sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate. Given their similar calcium sequestration performance, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid could effectively substitute for glucaric acid in detergent formulations.

         <title>Molecular Insights into the Heme&#8208;Binding Potential of Plant NCR247&#8208;Derived Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme&#8208;binding to Cys&#8208;rich, plant&#8208;derived NCR247 peptides was investigated using biochemical and bioanalytical approaches including UV/Vis and rRaman spectroscopy. The interaction of these disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides plays a critical role in the binding mode with heme. The observations were further substantiated by in silico studies. This investigation redefines perceptions of the heme&#8208;binding capacity of NCR247 peptides.







Abstract
Heme is involved in many critical processes in pathogenic bacteria as iron acquisition by these microorganisms is achieved by either direct uptake of heme or use of heme&#8208;binding proteins called hemophores. Exploring the underlying mechanisms on a molecular level can open new avenues in understanding the host&#8208;pathogen interactions. Any imbalance of the heme concentration has a direct impact on the bacterial growth and survival. Thus, heme&#8208;regulated proteins that are involved in heme homeostasis poise to be promising targets for research. Similarly, naturally occurring compounds, including cysteine&#8208;rich peptides from either plant secondary metabolites or venom toxins from vertebrates and invertebrates, have been studied for their therapeutic potential. NCR247 is such a cysteine&#8208;rich peptide, known to be crucial for nitrogenase activity in M. truncatula and its symbiotic relation with S. meliloti. NCR247&#8208;derived peptides were suggested to serve as high&#8208;affinity heme&#8208;binding molecules with remarkable heme&#8208;capturing properties. A comprehensive biochemical and computational analysis of NCR247&#8208;derived peptides, however, redefines their heme&#8208;binding capacity and consequently their potential therapeutic role.

         <title>Modulation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Cleavage with an Oligo&#8208;Ribonucleoprotein Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic sgRNA structure could be modified by adding oligo DNA. The assembly of oligo&#8208;sgRNA with Cas9 protein (oligo&#8208;RNP) could modulate the Cas9 cleavage on on&#8208;target and off&#8208;target DNA. The oligo&#8208;RNP could be further delivered into mammalian cells for improving genome editing specificity.







Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated protein Cas9 system has been widely used for genome editing. However, the editing or cleavage specificity of CRISPR Cas9 remains a major concern due to the off&#8208;target effects. The existing approaches to control or modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage include engineering Cas9 protein and development of anti&#8208;CRISPR proteins. There are also attempts on direct modification of sgRNA, for example, structural modification via truncation or hairpin design, or chemical modification on sgRNA such as partially replacing RNA with DNA. The above&#8208;mentioned strategies rely on extensive protein engineering and direct chemical or structural modification of sgRNA. In this study, we proposed an indirect method to modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage without modification on Cas9 protein or sgRNA. An oligonucleotide was used to form an RNA&#8208;DNA hybrid structure with the sgRNA spacer, creating steric hindrance during the Cas9 mediated DNA cleavage process. We first introduced a simple and robust method to assemble the oligo&#8208;ribonucleoprotein (oligo&#8208;RNP). Next, the cleavage efficiency of the assembled oligo&#8208;RNP was examined using different oligo lengths in&#8197;vitro. Lastly, we showed that the oligo&#8208;RNP directly delivered into cells could also modulate Cas9 activity inside cells using three model gene targets with reduced off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Construction of Escherichia coli cell factory for efficient synthesis of indigo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigo is widely used in dyes, medicines and semiconductors materials due to its excellent dyeing efficiency, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, anti&#8208;corrosion, and thermostability properties. Here, a biosynthetic pathway for indigo was designed, integrating two enzymes (EcTnaA, MaFMO) into a higher L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;producing the strain Escherichia coli TRP. However, the lower catalytic activity of MaFMO was a bottleneck for increasing indigo titers. To overcome this limitation, the enzyme activity of MaFMO was enhanced through mechanism&#8208;guided rational design. The optimal mutant obtained in this study, MaFMOD197E, whose kcat/Km was 1.34 times that of the wild type, and its specific activity was 2.36 times that of the wild type. In addition, the expression levels of EcTnaA and MaFMOD197E were regulated by optimizing the promoters and increasing the copy number to generate the strain E. coli IND&#8208;13. Finally, in the optimal fermentation conditions (220 rpm, 0.05% Tween&#8208;80), the strain E. coli IND&#8208;13 achieved the indigo titer of 568.52 mg/L in a 5&#8208;L bioreactor, with the yield and productivity of 2.62 mg/g and 12.96 mg/L/h (the highest to date), respectively. The results presented here can lay a foundation for further construction of cell factories for indigo and its derivatives with industrial application potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Native CB2 Receptor Mobility in Plasma Membranes of Living Cells by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we employed a novel fluorescent probe, RO7304924&#8212;which selectively targets cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R)&#8212;to assess the lateral mobility of CB2R within the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing a functional, untagged receptor variant. Utilizing confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we quantified the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of CB2R, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of RO7304924 as an innovative tool for elucidating the dynamics of this major endocannabinoid&#8208;binding G protein&#8208;coupled receptor. Our present findings highlight the potential of combining advanced ligand&#8208;based fluorescent probes with FRAP for future investigations into the biochemical details of CB2R mobility in living cells, and its impact on receptor&#8208;dependent cellular processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled palmitic acid&#8208;modified thymopentin functions as a delivery system of nanovaccine for cancer immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In clinical practice, thymopentin (TP&#8208;5) is a commonly utilized immunomodulatory peptide drug. The relatively short half&#8208;life of TP&#8208;5, however, significantly limits its applicability in immunotherapy. Inspired by the structure of the TLR2 ligand lipopeptide Pam3CSK4, fatty acid&#8208;modified TP&#8208;5 peptides were designed and synthesized in this study. Utilizing its amphiphilicity, they were sonicated to assemble into nanoparticles with the diameters of approximately 100 nm. Compared with TP&#8208;5, TP&#8208;5 monopalmitate&#8208;modified nanoparticle has immune&#8208;activating properties both in vivo and in vitro. It markedly increased TNF&#8208;&#945; secretion from RAW264.7 cells and aided in the maturation of DCs. The immunogenicity of OVA model antigen was increased in vivo when capsulated by TP&#8208;5 lipopeptide nanoparticle, which considerably slowed the growth of B16&#8208;OVA melanoma. This fatty acid&#8208;modified TP&#8208;5 assembled nanoparticle offers a straightforward and useful delivery system for the design of innovative nanovaccine for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Double&#8208;layered DNA Tiles and Arrays from Double Crossover Motifs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;layered DNA tiles have been constructed from DAE motifs using small circular 42&#8208; or 64&#8208;nt oligonucleotides as scaffolds. 3D DNA planar arrays and porous nanotubes have been further achieved via solution assembly. The chiral index theory was applied to analyze DNA nanotubes for tube perimeter, lateral tube and tile curvature, frame&#8208;rolling structure, etc.







Abstract
DNA double crossover (DX) motifs including DAE (double crossover, antiparallel, even spacing) and DAO (double crossover, antiparallel, odd spacing) are well&#8208;known monolayered DNA building blocks for construction of 2D DNA arrays and tubes in nanoscale and microscale. Compared to the 3D architectures of DNA origami and single&#8208;stranded DNA bricks to build nanoscale 3D bundles, tessellations, gears, castles, etc., designs of double&#8208; and multi&#8208;layers of DX motifs for 3D architectures are still limited. Herein, we report two types of double&#8208;layered tiles derived from DAE motifs with single&#8208;stranded circular 42&#8208; and 64&#8208;nt oligonucleotides as scaffold strands. Further tiling of the tiles generated planar 3D crystalline domains and curved tubes, correspondingly. Finally, we applied the chiral index theory to derive the unit tube parameters of six E&#8208;tiling (inter&#8208;tile distance of even spacing) tubes and analyzed the causation of difference between these tubes.

         <title>Recent Advance in Sensitive Detection of Demethylase FTO</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO) facilitates the demethylation of m6A in RNA, and its abnormal expression is closely linked to the development of several diseases. This review provides an overview of the progress in FTO detection methods, ranging from traditional approaches to innovative techniques, with a particular emphasis on recently reported advancements.







Abstract
Methylation modification is a critical regulatory mechanism in epigenetics and plays a significant role in various biological processes. N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common modification found in RNA. The fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO) facilitate the demethylation of m6A in RNA, and its abnormal expression is closely linked to the development of several diseases. As a result, FTO has the potential to serve as an important biomarker for clinical disease diagnosis. Despite its significance, there has been a lack of comprehensive reviews addressing advancements in detection methods for the demethylase FTO. This review provides an overview of the progress in FTO detection methods, ranging from traditional approaches to innovative techniques, with a particular emphasis on recently reported advancements. These novel detection methods can be categorized into strategies based on enzymes, functional nucleic acids (FNA), and conformational changes. We summarize the principles and applications of these detection methods and discuss the current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Application of Cas9&#8208;Based Gene Editing to Engineering of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based gene editing facilitates the engineering of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), even in larger biosynthetic gene clusters close to 100 kb. Recently, examples of engineering of NRPSs using evolution&#8208;guided fusion sites have been increasing. The experimentally evaluation of these fusion sites will be accelerated by gene editing technology.







Abstract
Engineering of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) could transform the production of bioactive natural product derivatives. A number of recent reports have described the engineering of NRPSs without marked reductions in yield. Comparative analysis of evolutionarily related NRPSs can provide insights regarding permissive fusion sites for engineering where recombination may occur during evolutionary processes. Studies involving engineering of NRPSs using these recombination sites showed that they have great potential. Moreover, we highlight recent advances in engineering of NRPSs using CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based gene editing technology. The use of Cas9 facilitates the editing of even larger biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) close to or over 100 kb in size by precisely targeting and digesting DNA sequences at specific sites. This technology combined with growing understanding of potential fusion sites from large&#8208;scale informatics analyses will accelerate the scalable exploration of engineered NRPS assembly lines to obtain bioactive natural product derivatives in high yields.

         <title>Advances in Drug Delivery Systems for Atopic Dermatitis Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. AD is incurable and prone to recurrence, and the treatment options are limited, we systematically summarize the current common drug delivery systems (DDS) such as liposomes, hydrogels, and nanoparticles, as well as the design of these drug delivery systems for the treatment of AD, the mechanism of the treatment process, and the advantages compared to traditional therapies.







Abstract
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus and impaired skin barrier function. Advances in drug delivery systems have transformed AD treatment by enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Drug delivery systems such as liposomes, hydrogels, and microneedles enable deeper skin penetration, prolonged drug retention, and controlled release, reducing side effects and treatment frequency. Liposomes improve drug absorption and stability, while hydrogels offer high water content and responsive drug release. Microneedles facilitate painless, localized drug delivery, enhancing patient compliance. These systems address the limitations of traditional therapies like topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants, which are associated with adverse effects and poor patient adherence. Recent innovations include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics targeting immune pathways, demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing inflammation and symptoms. Drug delivery systems offer a safer, more efficient alternative for delivering these advanced therapies. By improving therapeutic outcomes and patient experience, drug delivery systems represent a crucial advancement in AD management.

Drug delivery systems such as liposomes, hydrogels, and microneedles enable deeper skin penetration, prolonged drug retention, and controlled release, reducing side effects and treatment frequency. Liposomes improve drug absorption and stability, while hydrogels offer high water content and responsive drug release. Microneedles facilitate painless, localized drug delivery, enhancing patient compliance. These systems address the limitations of traditional therapies like topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants, which are associated with adverse effects and poor patient adherence. Recent innovations include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics targeting immune pathways, demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing inflammation and symptoms. Drug delivery systems offer a safer, more efficient alternative for delivering these advanced therapies. By improving therapeutic outcomes and patient experience, drug delivery systems represent a crucial advancement in AD management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quadruplex DNA Hybrid Catalysts for Enantioselective Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts are constructed by anchoring metal species into the chiral scaffolds of G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif. Three metal&#8208;DNA interaction modes are classified as supramolecular, covalent and coordinative for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts and the coordinative i&#8208;motif DNA hybrid catalyst is reported. The quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts exhibit potent enantioselective catalytic performance and chiral inversion by changing DNA conformations.







Abstract
Beyond the pivotal genetic roles of DNA, its duplex structures as chiral scaffolds interacting with metal complexes give rise to DNA hybrid catalysts for a set of aqueous&#8208;phase enantioselective reactions. Besides DNA duplex, DNA quadruplexes including G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif show tunable structures with variable non&#8208;canonical base pairs. In this concept, based on the interaction between metal species and DNA, we classify the construction strategies of quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts into supramolecular, covalent and coordinative modes. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between DNA quadruplexes and their enantioselective catalytic performance. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and look forward to the future directions in DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis.

         <title>Development of Uniform Ribosome Display Technology Enabling Easy and Efficient Identification of Full&#8208;Length Proteins that Interact with Bioactive Small and Large Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a uniform ribosome display technology using equal&#8208;length mRNAs and DNAs. The equalized nucleic acids enabled the formation of larger full&#8208;length protein&#8208;displaying ribosomal complexes and efficient identification of target proteins that interact with bioactive molecules, such as low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight drug, enzyme substrate, and antibody, with simplified operations.







Abstract
Identifying target proteins that interact with bioactive molecules is indispensable for understanding their mechanisms of action. In this study, we developed a uniform ribosome display technology using equal&#8208;length DNAs and mRNAs to improve molecular display principle for target identification. The equal&#8208;length DNAs were designed to contain various coding sequences for full&#8208;length proteins with molecular weights of up to 130&#8197;kDa and were used to synthesize equal&#8208;length mRNAs, which allowed the formation of full&#8208;length protein&#8208;ribosome&#8208;equal&#8208;length mRNA complexes. Uniform ribosome display selections of dihydrofolate reductase and haloalkane dehalogenase mutant were performed against methotrexate and chlorohexane, respectively. Quantitative changes of proteins after each selection indicated that the target protein&#8208;displaying ribosomal complexes were specifically selected through non&#8208;covalent or covalent interactions with the corresponding bioactive molecules. Furthermore, selection of full&#8208;length proteins interacting with methotrexate or anti&#8208;DDX46 antibody from protein pools showed that only the target proteins could be precisely identified even though the molar amounts of equal&#8208;length mRNAs encoding them were adjusted to 1/20,000 of the total equal&#8208;length mRNAs. Thus, the uniform ribosome display technology enabled efficient identification of target proteins that interact with bioactive small and large molecules through simplified operations without deep sequencing.

         <title>Aqueous Compatible Post&#8208;Synthetic On&#8208;Column Conjugation of Nucleic Acids Using Amino&#8208;Modifiers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous compatible conjugation methodology for nucleic acids that feature amino&#8208;modifiers, enabling the synthesis of phosphoramidate&#8208; or amide&#8208;containing oligonucleotide conjugates. Various ligand handles, including those containing azides and metal chelators, are suitable for the conjugation strategy. Our approach offers a streamlined, efficient and robust strategy for ligand conjugation to nucleic acid strands in mild aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Nucleic acid conjugation methodologies involve linking the nucleic acid sequence to other (bio)molecules covalently. This typically allows for nucleic acid property enhancement whether it be for therapeutic purposes, biosensing, etc. Here, we report a streamlined, aqueous compatible, on&#8208;column conjugation methodology using nucleic acids containing a site&#8208;specific amino&#8208;modifier. Both monophosphates and carboxylates were amenable to the conjugation strategy, allowing for the introduction of a variety of useful handles including azide, aryl, and hydrophobic groups in DNA. We find that an on&#8208;column approach is superior to post&#8208;synthetic template&#8208;directed synthesis, mainly with respect to product purification and recovery.

         <title>Synthesis of a 13C/2H Labeled Building Block to Probe the Phosphotyrosine Interactome Using Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protected 13C/2H&#8208;labeled phosphotyrosine (pTyr) building block was synthesized from commercially available isotope sources for use in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The resulting isolated &#1013;&#8208;aromatic 13C&#8208;1H correlations provide valuable data for studying interactions with pTyr&#8208;binding proteins at atomic resolution using NMR spectroscopy techniques. As an initial demonstration, intermolecular NOE and chemical shift perturbation data were recorded to visualize the binding of a pTyr&#8208;containing peptide, derived from the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor to the PLC&#947;&#8208;1 SH2 domain.







Abstract
Phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition coordinates the assembly of protein complexes, thus controlling key events of cell cycle, cell development and programmed cell death. Although many aspects of membrane receptor function and intracellular signal transduction have been deciphered in the last decades, the details of how phosphorylation alters protein&#8208;protein interaction and creates regulating switches of protein activity and localization often remains unclear. We developed a synthetic route to a protected phophotyrosine building block with isolated 13C&#8208;1H spins in the aromatic ring. The compound can be used for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and readily applied to study affinity, dynamics and interactions on an atomic level using NMR spectroscopy. As a first example, we prepared an isotopologue of a pTyr containing 12mer peptide (pY1021) as part of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor to analyze the binding to the phospholipase C&#8208;&#947; (PLC&#947;&#8208;1) SH2 domain.

         <dc:description>
The efficiency and selectivity of base&#8208;filling of a (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol scaffold to give N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;Oxazinane (MOANA) and N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidine glycol (MOGNA) nucleotides is strongly dependent on the secondary structure of the surrounding oligonucleotide. The highest yields and strictest adherence to the rules of Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing were observed within the rigid base stack of an A&#8208;type double helix.







Abstract

         <title>Determinants of Product Outcome in Two Sesquiterpene Synthases from the Thermotolerant Bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nerolidol synthase (NerS) and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene synthase (BerS) from the thermotolerant bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans were characterised using a combined computational and experimental approach. An isomerisation step early in the reaction cascade was found to be a key determinant of product outcome, and NerS was found to possess catalytic activity up to 55&#8201;&#176;C. Mutagenesis of BerS yielded two variants with improved product titres and altered reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Rubrobacter radiotolerans nerolidol synthase (NerS) and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene synthase (BerS) are among the first terpene synthases (TPSs) discovered from thermotolerant bacteria, and, despite sharing the same substrate, make terpenoid products with different carbon scaffolds. Here, the potential thermostability of NerS and BerS was investigated, and NerS was found to retain activity up to 55&#8201;&#176;C. A library of 22 NerS and BerS variants was designed to probe the differing reaction mechanisms of NerS and BerS, including residues putatively involved in substrate sequestration, cation&#8208;&#960; stabilisation of reactive intermediates, and shaping of the active site contour. Two BerS variants showed improved in&#8197;vivo titres vs the WT enzyme, and also yielded different ratios of the related sesquiterpenoids (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;farnesene and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene. BerS&#8722;L86F was proposed to encourage substrate isomerisation by cation&#8208;&#960; stabilisation of the first cationic intermediate, resulting in a greater proportion of trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene. By contrast, BerS&#8722;S82L significantly preferred (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;farnesene formation, attributed to steric blocking of the isomerisation step, consistent with what has been observed in several plant TPSs. Our work highlights the importance of isomerisation as a key determinant of product outcome in TPSs, and shows how a combined computational and experimental approach can characterise TPSs and variants with improved and altered functionality.

         <title>Photodynamic Inactivation of Bacteria Using Nickel(II) Complexes with Catecholate and Phenanthroline Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;ligand Ni(II) complexes, incorporating phenanthroline and naturally occurring coumarin (esculetin) ligands, exhibit significant singlet oxygen&#8208;mediated photodynamic inactivation (antibacterial) activity against both Gram&#8208;(+) and Gram&#8208;(&#8722;) bacteria under visible light, paving the way for Ni(II)&#8208;based non&#8208;macrocyclic photosensitizers for treating bacterial infections.







Abstract
Metal complexes activated by light can combat infections by triggering the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. Herein, we report six mixed&#8208;ligand nickel(II) complexes with the formulation [Ni(NN)2(L)] (1&#8211;6), where NN represents an N,N&#8208;donor phenanthroline ligand, specifically 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen in 1, 2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq in 3, 4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz in 5, 6), while L is an O,O donor bidentate ligand derived from catechol (cat2&#8722;, in 1, 3, 5) or esculetin (esc2&#8722;, in 2, 4, 6). The paramagnetic d8 octahedral complexes demonstrated good dark and photostability in the solution phase and exhibited significant light absorption in the visible (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) region. When exposed to low&#8208;energy visible light, these complexes demonstrated significant photodynamic inactivation activity against both Gram&#8208;(+) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram&#8208;(&#8722;) Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. This resulted in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.31&#8211;9.49&#8197;&#956;M. The activity was caused by the cell&#8208;damaging singlet oxygen species produced by the complexes under light exposure. Notably, the complexes showed no bacterial inhibition activity under dark conditions. This study marks the first examples of Ni(II) complexes designed for light&#8208;triggered antibacterial activity, illuminating the path for Ni(II)&#8208;based non&#8208;macrocyclic complexes for antibacterial PDT applications.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Multiplexed Assessment of Aromatic Prenyltransferase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate promiscuity of a panel of diverse aromatic prenyltransferases is assessed through a rapid substrate&#8208;multiplexed screen. PriB is identified as a remarkably promiscuous enzyme relative to other well&#8208;studied prenyltransferases. We further identify a new thermostable prenyltransferase with high activity that is suitable for future biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
An increasingly effective strategy to identify synthetically useful enzymes is to sample the diversity already present in Nature. Here, we construct and assay a panel of phylogenetically diverse aromatic prenyltransferases (PTs). These enzymes catalyze a variety of C&#8722;C bond forming reactions in natural product biosynthesis and are emerging as tools for synthetic chemistry and biology. Homolog screening was further empowered through substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening, which provides direct information on enzyme specificity. We perform a head&#8208;to&#8208;head assessment of the model members of the PT family and further identify homologs with divergent sequences that rival these superb enzymes. This effort revealed the first bacterial O&#8722;Tyr PT and, together, provide valuable benchmarking for future synthetic applications of PTs.

         <title>Effect of O&#8208;Acetylation on the Antigenicity and Glycoconjugate Immunogenicity of the Streptococcus Pneumoniae Serotype 7F Capsular Polysaccharide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
How much does the acetate group matter in pneumococcal serotype 7F? Capsular polysaccharides of this bacterial serotype were modified to have different levels of O&#8208;acetylation and then conjugated to tetanus toxoid to produce antibacterial glycoconjugates. Antigenicity and immunological studies shed light on the importance of this moiety in the quality of the immune response.







Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterial pathogen causing diseases as severe as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Most commercial pneumococcal conjugate vaccines contain the 7F serotype, which is epidemiologically relevant and highly invasive. This serotype contains an O&#8208;acetyl group at the internal L&#8208;rhamnose of its polysaccharide repeating unit. Herein we report on the role of the O&#8208;acetyl moiety of 7F polysaccharide in both antigen recognition and the induction of a protective antibody response against 7F. Fully and partially de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 7F polysaccharides were chemically prepared and compared with the O&#8208;acetylated counterpart in their antigenicity and immunogenicity of their tetanus toxoid glycoconjugates. These comparative studies showed a slight but consistent decrease in the antigenicity for the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharide, but not for the partly de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated variant. The glycoconjugates derived from the O&#8208;acetylated and the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharides had similar sizes and polysaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;protein ratio, and all proved both to be immunogenic and induce opsonophagocytic responses in mice. Nevertheless, the immune response elicited by the O&#8208;acetylated glycoconjugate was better in both quantity and quality, proving that the O&#8208;acetyl group is not strictly necessary but also not irrelevant for the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the 7F serotype polysaccharide and its glycoconjugates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much does the acetate group matter in pneumococcal serotype 7F&lt;/b&gt;? Capsular polysaccharides of this bacterial serotype were modified to have different levels of O-acetylation and then conjugated to tetanus toxoid to produce antibacterial glycoconjugates. Antigenicity and immunological studies shed light on the importance of this moiety in the quality of the immune response.

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Peptide Inhibitors Targeting the Dimerization of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study designs and synthesizes a series of peptides targeting the dimerization of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. Several peptides display potential inhibitory activities. Specifically, N8&#8208;A24 shows most efficient suppression of the Mpro activity via inhibiting its dimerization.







Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) seriously impacted public health. The evolutionarily conserved viral chymotrypsin&#8208;like main protease (Mpro) is an important target for anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 drug development. Previous studies have shown that the eight N&#8208;terminal amino acids (N8) of SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro are essential for its dimerization, and are used to design inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro dimerization. Here, we established a simple readout assay using SDS&#8208;PAGE and Coomassie blue staining to measure inhibitory activity of N8 peptide derived from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. To optimize its inhibitory effect, we then modified the side&#8208;chain length, charge, and hydrophilicity of the N8 peptide, and introduced a mutated Mpro recognition sequence. As a result, we obtained a series of potent peptide inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro, with N8&#8208;A24 being the most efficient with an IC50 value of 1.44&#8197;mM. We observed that N8&#8208;A24 reduced Mpro dimerization with an IC50 value of 0.86&#8197;mM. Molecular docking revealed that N8&#8208;A24 formed hydrogen bond interactions with critical dimeric interface residues, thus inhibiting its dimerization and activity. In conclusion, our study not only discovers a series of peptide inhibitors targeting the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro dimerization, but also provides a promising strategy for the rational design of new inhibitors against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Precursor&#8208;Directed Biosynthesis of Panepoxydone Derivatives with Nitric Oxide Production Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourteen new panepoxydone derivatives were obtained via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses, including HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR. Biological evaluation indicated panepoxydone and some of its derivatives displayed significant suppressive effects on LPS&#8208;induced NO production with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 to 30.1&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
Panepoxydone is a natural NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibitor isolated from basidiomycetes belonging to the genus Panus and Lentinus. It is biosynthesized from prenylhydroquinone through successive hydroxylation, epoxidation, and reduction reactions. In this study, we establish an efficient precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis strategy for the structural expansion of panepoxydone based on its biosynthetic pathway. Supplementation of the panepoxydone&#8208;producing strain, Panus rudis, with various prenylhydroquinone analogues enabled the production of fourteen previously undescribed panepoxydone derivatives, panepoxyquinoid A&#8722;N (2&#8211;14). The obtained panepoxydone derivatives together with their parental molecules were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on LPS&#8208;induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds 1, 5&#8211;6, 10&#8211;11, and 14&#8211;15 displayed significant suppressive effects on LPS&#8208;induced NO production with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 to 30.1&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Design of a Bioluminescent Assay Platform for Quantitative Measurement of Histone Acetyltransferase Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive novel bioluminescent system was developed that can accurately quantify the kinetics of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) catalyzed acylation reactions. This system utilizes acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 and firefly luciferase for a coupled reaction that generates luminescence proportional to acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA) concentrations allowing for determination of AcCoA consumption by a HAT catalyzed reaction. This system can be used in high throughput for inhibition studies.







Abstract
Protein acetylation and acylation are widespread post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Histone acetyltransferase (HATs) enzymes catalyze the addition of short&#8208;chain acyl moieties to lysine residues on cellular proteins. Many HAT members are found to be dysregulated in human diseases, especially oncological processes. Screening potent and selective HAT inhibitors has promising application for therapeutic innovation. A biochemical assay for quantification of HAT activity utilizing luminescent output is highly desirable to improve upon limitations associated with the classic radiometric assay formats. Here we report the design of a bioluminescent technological platform for robust and sensitive quantification of HAT activity. This platform utilizes the metabolic enzyme acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) for a coupled reaction with firefly luciferase to generate luminescent signal relative to the HAT&#8208;catalyzed acetylation reaction. The biochemical assay was implemented in microtiter plate format and our results showed this assay sensitively detected catalytic activity of HAT enzyme p300, accurately measured its steady&#8208;state kinetic parameters of histone acetylation and measured the inhibitory potency of HAT inhibitor. This platform demonstrated excellent robustness, reproducibility, and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, with a screening window Z&#8217;=0.79. Our new bioluminescent design provides an alternative means for HAT enzymatic activity quantitation and HAT inhibitor screening.

         <title>Binding Mode of Cyclic Chemerin&#8208;9 Peptide and ChemerinS157 Protein at CMKLR1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigated the binding and activation of chemerin&#8208;9, a stabilized cyclic chemerin&#8208;9, and the ChemS157 protein to CMKLR1 variants due to previously observed differences in G protein activation. ChemS157 tolerates most mutations within the orthosteric binding site. Therefore, we used computational modeling to generate a binding model that support the existence of a second binding site.







Abstract
The chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is activated by the adipokine and chemoattractant protein chemerin. Cryo&#8208;EM structures of chemerin&#8208;9&#8208;CMKLR1&#8208;Gi have been published, where chemerin&#8208;9 is the nonapeptide of the C terminus of chemerinS157. Chemerin&#8208;9 is as active as the full&#8208;length protein in Ca2+&#8208;release but shows differences in equilibrium read&#8208;outs. An equally potent cyclic chemerin&#8208;9 variant (cC9) was reported previously. Now, we have built a computational model of CMKLR1 to investigate the binding mode of cC9 and chemerinS157 in comparison to chemerin&#8208;9. Differences were investigated using CMKLR1 variants. Double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis identified CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 as the relevant position for Phe8&#8208;binding of cC9. Energy contribution revealed slight differences in Phe8&#8208;binding to CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 and space for larger residues. This was confirmed as the chemerin&#8208;9 variant with 1&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;L&#8208;alanine at position 8 showed a 4&#8208;fold increased potency of 2&#8197;nM (pEC50=8.6&#177;0.15). While chemerin&#8208;9 and cC9 share their interactions at the CMKLR1, chemerinS157 tolerates most mutations of CMKLR1 in the deep binding site. The computational model of chemerinS157 suggests a &#946;&#8208;sheet interaction between the N&#8208;terminal CMKLR1&#8208;segment I25VVL28 and the &#946;&#8208;sheet D108KVLGRLVH116 of ChemS157, which was confirmed experimentally. Our data add to the knowledge by identifying the binding mode of chemerinS157 and cC9 at CMKLR1, facilitating the future structure&#8208;based drug design.

     alt="Binding Mode of Cyclic Chemerin-9 Peptide and ChemerinS157 Protein at CMKLR1"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we investigated the binding and activation of chemerin-9, a stabilized cyclic chemerin-9, and the ChemS157 protein to CMKLR1 variants due to previously observed differences in G protein activation. ChemS157 tolerates most mutations within the orthosteric binding site. Therefore, we used computational modeling to generate a binding model that support the existence of a second binding site.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is activated by the adipokine and chemoattractant protein chemerin. Cryo-EM structures of chemerin-9-CMKLR1-Gi have been published, where chemerin-9 is the nonapeptide of the C terminus of chemerinS157. Chemerin-9 is as active as the full-length protein in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-release but shows differences in equilibrium read-outs. An equally potent cyclic chemerin-9 variant (cC9) was reported previously. Now, we have built a computational model of CMKLR1 to investigate the binding mode of cC9 and chemerinS157 in comparison to chemerin-9. Differences were investigated using CMKLR1 variants. Double-mutant cycle analysis identified CMKLR1-F2.53 as the relevant position for Phe8-binding of cC9. Energy contribution revealed slight differences in Phe8-binding to CMKLR1-F2.53 and space for larger residues. This was confirmed as the chemerin-9 variant with 1-naphthyl-L-alanine at position 8 showed a 4-fold increased potency of 2&#8197;nM (pEC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=8.6&#177;0.15). While chemerin-9 and cC9 share their interactions at the CMKLR1, chemerinS157 tolerates most mutations of CMKLR1 in the deep binding site. The computational model of chemerinS157 suggests a &#946;-sheet interaction between the N-terminal CMKLR1-segment I25VVL28 and the &#946;-sheet D108KVLGRLVH116 of ChemS157, which was confirmed experimentally.

         <title>Photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Library Enables Covalent Chemical Capture of Solvent&#8208;Exposed TPR Domain Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the unnatural amino acid, p&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Bpa), we developed a photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) library to covalently capture protein&#8208;protein interactions along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. This library explicitly targets the less&#8208;studied TPR binding surface, over the lumenal substrate&#8208;binding surface, and expands the toolbox for both targeted discovery of new interactors and characterization of OGT's TPR interactome.







Abstract
O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is an essential, stress&#8208;sensing enzyme responsible for adding the O&#8208;GlcNAc monosaccharide to thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins to regulate cellular homeostasis. OGT substrates are found in almost all intracellular processes, and perturbations in protein O&#8208;GlcNAc levels have been implicated in proteostatic diseases, such as cancers, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration. This broad disease activity makes OGT an attractive therapeutic target; however, the substrate diversity makes pan&#8208;inhibition as a therapeutic strategy unfeasible. Rather, a substrate&#8208;specific approach to targeting is more advantageous, but how OGT chooses its substrates remains poorly understood. Substrate specificity is controlled by the interactions between OGT's non&#8208;catalytic tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, rather than its glycosyltransferase domain. OGT's TPR domain forms a 100&#8197;&#197; superhelical structure, containing a lumenal surface, known as the substrate&#8208;binding surface, and a solvent&#8208;exposed surface. To date, there are no tools to site&#8208;selectively target regions of the domain and differentiate between the two binding surfaces. Here, we developed a library of recombinant OGT constructs containing site&#8208;specifically incorporated photoactivatable unnatural amino acids (UAAs) along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the TPR domain to covalently capture and map OGT's interactome.

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Guided Engineering of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase for Aliphatic Ester Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, aliphatic esters are produced by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) from ketone substrates. Through an artificial enzyme cascade, esters are converted into aldehydes, which are detected by a bacterial luciferase. This set&#8208;up presents the first genetically encoded biosensor system monitoring BVMO activity and greatly accelerated the bioluminescence&#8208;based selection of active enzyme variants, omitting initial low&#8208;throughput chromatographic analysis.







Abstract
Esters are valuable aroma compounds and can be produced enzymatically by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) from (aliphatic) ketone precursors. However, a genetically encoded biosensor system for the assessment of BVMO activity and the detection of reaction products is missing. In this work, we assembled a synthetic enzyme cascade &#8211; featuring an esterase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, and LuxAB &#8211; in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Target esters are produced by a BVMO, subsequently cleaved, and the corresponding alcohol oxidized through the artificial pathway. Ultimately, aldehyde products are detected in&#8197;vivo by LuxAB, a luciferase from Photorhabdus luminescens that emits bioluminescence upon the oxidation of aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylates. This biosensor system greatly accelerated the screening and selection of active BVMO variants from a focused library, omitting commonly used low&#8208;throughput chromatographic analysis. Engineered enzymes accepted linear aliphatic ketones such as 2&#8208;undecanone and 2&#8208;dodecanone and exhibited improved ester formation.

         <title>A Universal Support for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Peptidyl&#8208;tRNA Mimics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of 21 solid supports, only one is needed to synthesize hydrolysis&#8208;resistant 3&#8217;&#8208;peptidyl&#8208;tRNA mimics without sequence limitations. This is made possible by a novel photocleavable support that provides a free ribose 3&#8217;&#8208;amino group instead of the established supports that already contain the C&#8208;terminal amino acid, making synthetic access to this class of RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates more efficient than previous routes.







Abstract
Hydrolysis&#8208;resistant RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates that mimic peptidyl&#8208;tRNAs are often required for structural and functional studies of protein synthesis at the ribosome. These conjugates can be synthesized by solid&#8208;phase chemical synthesis, which allows maximum flexibility in both the peptide and RNA sequence. The commonly used strategy is based on (3&#8217;&#8208;N&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine solid supports, which already contain the first C&#8208;terminal amino acid of the target peptidyl chain. This is a limitation in the sense that different individual supports must be synthesized for different C&#8208;terminal amino acids. In this study, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by introducing a novel universal support. The key is a free ribose 3&#8217;&#8208;NH2 group that can be coupled to any amino acid. This is made possible by a photocleavable ether moiety that links the ribose 2&#8217;&#8208;O to the support, thus avoiding the typical O&#8208;to&#8208;N migration that occurs when using 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;acyl linked solid supports. Once assembled, the conjugate is readily cleaved by UV irradiation. The structural integrity of the obtained peptidyl&#8208;RNA conjugates was verified by mass spectrometry analysis. In conclusion, the new photocleavable solid support makes the synthesis of 3&#8217;&#8208;peptidyl tRNA mimics of different peptidyl chains significantly more efficient compared to the commonly used approaches.

         <title>Close Proximity of Cholesterol Anchors in Membrane Induces the Dissociation of Amphiphilic DNA Strand from Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular base paring in the terminal base pair of amphiphilic DNA strand labelled with cholesterol anchors was modulated by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction. The close proximity of cholesterol anchors within the membrane could result in the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA strand from the membrane surface.







Abstract
Dynamic DNA nanotechnology is appealing for membrane surface engineering due to their versatility and programmability. To modulate the dynamic interactions between the DNA functional units immobilized on membrane surface, membrane&#8208;anchored DNA functional units often come into close proximity each other due to DNA base pairing, which also leads to the close contact of the hydrophobic anchors in membrane. However, whether the close contact of hydrophobic anchors induces the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA structures from membrane surface is not concerned. Herein, we utilized cholesterol&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a simplified amphiphilic DNA structure to investigate the stability of membrane anchored DNA strands upon the closely contact of cholesterol anchors. The close contact of cholesterol&#8208;labelled ssDNA molecules driven by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction leads to approximately 41&#8201;% membrane anchored ssDNA dissociation from membrane surface, indicating the proximal cholesterol anchors in membrane could reduce the anchoring stability of cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands. This work enhances our understanding of the interactions between amphiphilic DNA and membranes, and provides valuable insights for the design of future DNA constructs intended for applications involving dynamic DNA reactions on membrane surface.

&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular base paring in the terminal base pair of amphiphilic DNA strand labelled with cholesterol anchors was modulated by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction. The close proximity of cholesterol anchors within the membrane could result in the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA strand from the membrane surface.

         <title>Impact of Antioxidants on Mechanical Properties and ROS Levels of Neuronal Cells Exposed to &#946;&#8208;Amyloid Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effects of antioxidants on oxidative stress and mechanical properties of neuronal cells exposed to &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregates. Using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy and electrochemical methods, it was highlighted how NAC and SOD1 reduce ROS&#8208;induced cellular stiffness, revealing a link between oxidative stress and cytoskeletal dynamics relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
This study aims to investigate the potential role of antioxidants in oxidative stress and its consequent impact on the mechanical properties of neuronal cells, particularly the stress induced by amyloid&#8208;beta (1&#8211;42) (A&#946;42) aggregates. A key aspect of our research involved using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy (SICM) to assess the mechanical properties (Young's modulus) of neuronal cells under oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured in single&#8208;cell using the electrochemical method by low&#8208;invasive Pt nanoelectrode. We investigated the effects of the low molecular weight antioxidant N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) on the physiological and mechanical properties of neuronal cells using SICM. Using electrochemical method and SICM, NAC effectively reduces oxidative stress and restores Young's Modulus in SH&#8208;SY5Y cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide and A&#946;42 oligomers. Our study first examined the influence of SOD1 on intracellular ROS levels in the presence of A&#946; oligomers. The investigation into the effects of SOD1 and its nanoparticle form SOD1 on SH&#8208;SY5Y cells reveals impacts on mechanical properties and oxidative stress. The combined use of SICM and electrochemical measurements provided a comprehensive understanding of how oxidative stress, including that triggered by the A&#946; oligomers affects the mechanical properties of cells.

Abstract
In this study, we have successfully synthesized bis (cholesterol&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether)&#8208;pillar[5]arene compound 1 through a click reaction, which could spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers to form ion channel due to the membrane anchor cholesterol group and show significant transport activity of K+ superior to Na+, with a permeability ratio of K+/Na+ equal to 4.58. Compound 1 two crown ether modules act as selective filters similar to natural K+ channel, which are determined to 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 binding stoichiometry to K+ by Job's plot and NMR titration. This structurally unambiguously unimolecule artificial channel provides ideas for constructing highly K+/Na+ selective molecular filters.

         <title>Antigen Presentation in an Artificial and Cell Membrane: Blood Group A Glycan Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space filling models of the synthesized blood group A related glycolipid constructs, which were inserted into an artificial membrane and into erythrocytes, and then compared with each other for their interaction with anti&#8208;A antibodies. 3D structure of A(type&#8197;2) tetrasaccharide was calculated on the website https://glycam.org/ [glycam.org]; other fragments of these molecules were calculated in a HyperChem using MM+ in a vacuum. The same figure magnified is given in Supplementary Material.







Abstract
Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are functionally important components of the cell membrane and recognition of their glycan &#8220;head&#8221; by the immune system is a key part of normal and pathological processes. Recognition of glycolipid antigens on a living cell, their structure, &#8220;context&#8221; (microenvironment and clustering), presentation including orientation and distance from the plasma membrane, as well as molecular dynamics are important. GSL antigens are targets for the development of anticancer vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, therefore, control of the presentation of their glycans by synthetic methods opens up new possibilities in medicine. In this work, we synthesized 13 GSL analogues as function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipids (FSLs) with the same head (blood group A tetrasaccharide, ABO system) but each either differing in the structure of the lipid tail, or the length of the region between the head and the tail, or cluster organization of the head (from 2 to 4 tetrasaccharides in a cluster). The insertion of these FSLs into an artificial and erythrocyte membranes was compared, and their interaction with antibodies was studied, including erythrocyte agglutination. The results give further insight into knowledge of the membrane presentation of GSLs (some results can be extrapolated to glycoproteins) and factors involved in their interaction with antibodies.

         <title>Towards Bacterial Resistance via the Membrane Strategy: Enzymatic, Biophysical and Biomimetic Studies of the Lipid cis&#8208;trans Isomerase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti), a heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, induces a swift membrane rigidification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under stress conditions that impede bacterial growth. This study provides understanding of the enzyme's heme coordination and redox state as well as some insights into the catalytic mechanism and reveals that phospholipids, alongside fatty acids, serve as substrate for this metalloenzyme.







Abstract
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti) is a periplasmic heme&#8208;c enzyme found in several bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen known for causing nosocomial infections. This metalloenzyme catalyzes the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids in order to rapidly modulate membrane fluidity in response to stresses that impede bacterial growth. As a consequence, breakthrough in the elucidation of the mechanism of this metalloenzyme might lead to new strategies to combat bacterial antibiotic resistance. We report the first comprehensive biochemical, electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Cti enzyme. This has been possible by the successful purification of Cti from P. aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;Cti) in favorable yields with enzyme activity of 0.41&#8197;&#956;mol/min/mg when tested with palmitoleic acid. Through a synergistic approach involving enzymology, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, Raman spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electrochemistry, we identified the heme coordination and redox state, pinpointing Met163 as the sixth ligand of the FeII of heme&#8208;c in Pa&#8208;Cti. Significantly, the development of an innovative assay based on liposomes demonstrated for the first time that Cti catalyzes cis&#8208;trans isomerization directly using phospholipids as substrates without the need of protein partners, answering the important question about the substrate of Cti within the bacterial membrane.

Significantly, the development of an innovative assay based on liposomes demonstrated for the first time that Cti catalyzes &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerization directly using phospholipids as substrates without the need of protein partners, answering the important question about the substrate of Cti within the bacterial membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction and Conformational Change in the Alpha&#8208;Helical Membrane Transporter BtuCD&#8208;F in the Native Cellular Envelope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, the &#945;&#8208;helical membrane proteins are located in the inner membrane (IM) and further nanoconfined into the complex cellular envelope, which additionally consists of the periplasm and the outer membrane (OM). Here, we show that the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair combined with pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy can be used to observe the conformational change of a membrane transporter in the cellular envelope.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins perform numerous critical functions essential for the survival of living organisms. Traditionally, these proteins are extracted from membranes using detergent solubilization and reconstitution into liposomes or nanodiscs. However, these processes often obscure the effects of nanoconfinement and the native environment on the structure and conformational heterogeneity of the target protein. We demonstrate that pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy, combined with the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair, enables the selective observation of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD&#8722;F in its native cellular envelope. Despite the high levels of non&#8208;specific labeling in the envelope, this orthogonal approach combined with the long phase&#8208;memory time for the Gd3+ spin enables the observation of the target protein complex at a few micromolar concentrations with high resolution. In the native envelope, vitamin B12 induces a distinct conformational shift at the BtuCD&#8208;BtuF interface, which is not observed in the micelles. This approach offers a general strategy for investigating protein&#8208;protein and protein&#8208;ligand/drug interactions and conformational changes of the alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins in their native envelope context.

         <title>Exploring Fluorinase Substrate Tolerance at C&#8208;2 of SAM</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate tolerance of the fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) is explored by introducing untested substituents at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring. The most active analogues were N&#8208;alkylated amines and as a class these were much better than O&#8208; or S&#8208; ethers. The outcomes are supported by in silico analysis. This tolerance broadens the utility of the fluorinase as a tool for introducing the fluorine&#8208;18 isotope into ligands for positron emission tomography applications.







Abstract
The fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) utilises fluoride ion and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) as substrates for conversion to 5&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;adenosine (5&#8242;&#8208;FDA) and L&#8208;methionine (L&#8208;Met). The enzyme has a very strict substrate specificity, however it has been shown to tolerate acetylenes and NH2 replacements for H at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring of SAM. This substrate tolerance is explored further here with &#8722;NHR, &#8722;N3, &#8722;OR and &#8722;SR substituents attached to C&#8208;2. New activities are demonstrated, for example with NH&#8208;methyl, NH&#8208;propyl,NH&#8208;butyl and O&#8208;butyl substrates at C&#8208;2, however azide and thioethers were not tolerated. Outcomes are supported by in silico analysis, revealing favourable H&#8208;bonding interactions involving NH and O substituents at the adenine C&#8208;2 position with N278 and the backbone amide of A279 at the active site respectively. The study informs on the selectivity of the fluorinase as a tool for radiolabelling candidate ligands with fluorine&#8208;18 for positron emission tomography programmes.

         <title>Position&#8208;Regulated Electrostatic Interactions for Single Amino Acid Revealed by Aspartic Acid&#8208;Scanning Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, peptide&#8208;peptide binding properties were analyzed through aspartate scanning mutagenesis. Significant position&#8208; and composition&#8208;dependent electrostatic interactions involving arginine and aspartate were identified. The findings provide an estimate of the electrostatic side chain&#8208;side chain interactions between arginine and aspartic acid, indicating that the optimal separation distance ranges from 2 to 4 amino acid residues.







Abstract
We have examined in this contribution the electrostatic interactions between single arginine and aspartic acid by analyzing the peptide&#8208;peptide binding characteristics involving arginine&#8208;aspartic acid, arginine&#8208;glycine, arginine&#8208;tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;glycine interactions. The results of aspartic acid mutagenesis revealed that the interactions between arginine and aspartic acid have significant dependence on the position and composition of amino acids. While the primary interaction can be attributed to arginine&#8208;tryptophan contacts originated from the indole moieties with the main chains of 14&#8208;mers containing N&#8722;H and C=O moieties, pronounced enhancement could be identified in association with the electrostatic side&#8208;chain&#8208;side&#8208;chain interactions between arginine and aspartic acid. An optimal separation of 2~4 amino acids between two adjacent aspartic acid and tryptophan binding sites can be identified to achieve maximal enhancement of binding interactions. Such observed separation dependence may be utilized to unravel cooperative effects in heterogeneous interactions between single pair of amino acids.

         <title>Visual and Quantitative Analysis of Dietary Fiber&#8208;Microbiota Interactions via Metabolic Labeling In Vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the dietary fibers&#8217; (DFs) interactions with bacteria in the gut is important in guiding the DF&#8208;based interventions towards the goal of establishing a health&#8208;promoting gut microbiota. However, directly investigating DFs&#8217; interactions with bacteria in the gut remains very difficult. Here, we develop an in&#8197;vivo metabolic labeling&#8208;based strategy to visually investigate and identify the DF&#8208;binding bacteria in the gut and quantitatively analyze their affected metabolic status caused by specific DF.







Abstract
Dietary fiber (DF)&#8208;based interventions are crucial in establishing a health&#8208;promoting gut microbiota. However, directly investigating DFs&#8217; in&#8197;vivo interactions with intestinal bacteria remains challenging due to the lack of suitable tools. Here, we develop an in&#8197;vivo metabolic labeling&#8208;based strategy, which enables not only imaging and identifying the bacteria that bind with specific DF in the intestines, but also quantifying DF's impact on their metabolic status. Four DFs, including galactan, rhamnogalacturonan and two inulins, are fluorescently derivatized and used for in&#8197;vivo labeling to visually record DFs&#8217; interactions with gut bacteria. The subsequent cell&#8208;sorting, 16S rDNA sequencing, and fluorescence in&#8197;situ hybridization identify the taxa that bind each DF. We then select a DF&#8208;binding species newly identified herein and verify its DF&#8208;catabolizing capability in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, we find that the indigenous metabolic status of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whether inulin&#8208;binders or not, is significantly enhanced by the inulin supplement. This trend is not observed in Gram&#8208;negative microbiota, even for the inulin&#8208;binders, demonstrating the ability of our methods in differentiating the primary, secondary DF&#8208;degraders from cross&#8208;feeders, a question that is difficult to answer by using other methods. Our strategy provides a novel chemical biology tool for deciphering the complex DF&#8208;bacteria interactions in the gut.

         <title>Effect of Linker Length on the Function of Biotinylated OSW&#8208;1 Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of linker length of biotinylated OSW&#8208;1 probes on their functions was evaluated using known target proteins, OSBP and ORP4. The biotinylated probe 3 with PEG5 linker enabled most effective enrichment of target proteins in an affinity pulldown assay, suggesting that the cytotoxicity and pulldown efficiency did not correlate among the probes studied.







Abstract
The biotinylated probes based on anticancer saponin OSW&#8208;1 with varied linker lengths were synthesized and their cell growth inhibitory activity and affinity pulldown efficiency were evaluated. All probes demonstrated comparable cytotoxicity to the parent natural product, highlighting that the linker moiety had a minimal impact on cell uptake or target engagement. In contrast, when evaluated against the known target proteins, OSBP and ORP4, the biotinylated probe 3 with PEG5 linker enabled most effective enrichment of target proteins in the affinity pulldown assay, suggesting that the cytotoxicity and pulldown efficiency did not correlate among the probes studied. Our data provided the first evidence that OSW&#8208;1 specifically binds to endogenously expressed OSBP and ORP4. The selectivity of affinity pulldown using probe 3 was also validated by facile identification of the enriched protein by silver staining and LC/MS analysis. Therefore, probe 3 with PEG5 linker comprising of 25&#8197;atoms (28&#8197;&#197;) was found as an optimal biotinylated probe for isolating OSW&#8208;1 binding proteins from cell lysate.

         <title>Formation of Poly&#8208;L&#8211;Lysine&#8208;Porphyrin Derivative Complex Exhibiting Diminished Dark Toxicity in Aqueous Solutions and High Photodynamic Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dark toxicity of the poly&#8208;L&#8211;lysine (PLL)&#8211;porphyrin complex was significantly reduced by the reduction or elimination of free PLL, as evidenced by the higher dark toxicity of PLL compared with that of the PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex. In contrast, the PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex exhibited a high photodynamic activity under photoirradiation at 610&#8211;740&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;L&#8211;lysine (PLL) displays a high solubilizing ability for hydrophobic guest molecules, and when in complexes with guest molecules, it exhibits a high intracellular uptake. However, its high cytotoxicity, originating from its cationic character, significantly limits its applications in biological and medicinal chemistry. In this study, the amount of free PLL in an aqueous solution of a PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex was immensely reduced, resulting in considerably lower dark toxicity than that of the free PLL. Furthermore, the PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex exhibited high photodynamic activity under photoirradiation at 610&#8211;740&#8197;nm.

         <title>An Upgraded Solid&#8208;Phase Assembly of Chelators (DOTA and NOTA) Enabled Bacterial Uptake Studies of Radiolabeled Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical approach to installing clinically prevalent chelator DOTA and NOTA in solid phase peptide was delineated by exploring various solvent scopes. This upgraded method enabled clean and operationally simple installation of DOTA and NOTA in various bioactive peptides. Strikingly, we revealed that a radiolabeled antimicrobial peptide (Combi) could be an excellent lead for developing bacterial infection imaging agents.







Abstract
Among popular radio metal chelators, DOTA and NOTA have been remarkably considered in radionuclide therapy and imaging studies due to several advantages in pharmacology. Here, we developed a practical and general method for assembling DOTA and NOTA in the solid phase peptide (pseudo&#8208;dilute conditions) using a wide range of solvents with easily accessible and economical feedstocks, which mitigated unprecedented challenges associated with previously reported methods. This upgraded approach enabled an efficient installation of these two chelators on various bioactive peptide sequences. Finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of the DOTA&#8208; and NOTA&#8208;attached Combi peptides to B. subtilis, which was intact. The authenticity of the assembled DOTA framework was assessed by labeling 177Lu and in&#8197;vitro bacterial uptake in E. coli and S. aureus. 177Lu&#8208;labeled DOTA&#8208;Combi peptide exhibited promising uptake for developing a bacterial infection imaging agent while negligible hemolysis activity even at &gt;200&#8197;&#956;M. This contribution will be valued for developing peptide radiopharmaceuticals with operational simplicity and economic approaches.

         <title>Production of Phenyldiazene Derivatives Using the Biosynthetic Pathway of an Aromatic Diazo Group&#8208;Containing Natural Product from an Actinomycete</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Diazoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;DAA) is potentially produced by several actinomycete species. Here, we constructed a production system for phenyldiazene derivatives by adding several active methylene compounds to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing recombinant actinomycete. Also, we established a one&#8208;pot in&#8197;vitro enzymatic production system for the same phenyldiazene derivatives using a diazotase, CmaA6.







Abstract
The diazo group is an important functional group in organic synthesis because it confers high reactivity to the compounds and has been applied in various chemical reactions, such as the Sandmeyer reaction, Wolff rearrangement, cyclopropanation, and C&#8722;N bond formation with active methylene compounds. Previously, we revealed that 3&#8208;diazoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;DAA), which is potentially produced by several actinomycete species and contains an aromatic diazo group, is a biosynthetic intermediate of avenalumic acid. In this study, we aimed to construct a production system for phenyldiazene derivatives by adding several active methylene compounds to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing recombinant actinomycete. First, acetoacetanilide and its derivatives, which have an active methylene and are raw materials for arylide yellow dyes, were individually added to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing actinomycete. When their metabolites were analyzed, each expected compound with a phenyldiazenyl moiety was detected in the culture extract. Moreover, we established a one&#8208;pot in&#8197;vitro enzymatic production system for the same phenyldiazene derivatives using a highly reactive diazotase, CmaA6. These results showed that the diazo group of natural products is an attractive tool for expanding the structural diversity of natural products both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Front Cover: Development of Uniform Ribosome Display Technology Enabling Easy and Efficient Identification of Full&#8208;Length Proteins that Interact with Bioactive Small and Large Molecules (ChemBioChem 1/2025)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the fields of chemical biology and drug discovery, identifying target proteins that interact with bioactive molecules is essential to elucidate their mechanisms of action. As described in the cover, various full&#8208;length proteins can be displayed on ribosomes idling at the 3&#8217; termini of equal&#8208;length mRNAs. The uniform ribosome display technology using the ternary complexes allows easy and efficient identification of target proteins bound to bioactive molecules, such as drug, enzyme substrate, and antibody. More details can be found in the article 10.1002/cbic.202400352 by Akira Wada and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Cover Feature: Synthesis of a 13C/2H Labeled Building Block to Probe the Phosphotyrosine Interactome Using Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy (ChemBioChem 1/2025)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for exploring the structure, dynamics, and interactions of proteins, often requiring the incorporation of well&#8208;defined 13C, 15N, and 2H patterns. While selective labeling is not yet as simple as introducing heavy isotopes by using different colors to highlight specific atomic positions, as depicted on this cover image, ongoing advancements are being made to customize isotope patterns for NMR experiments. In article 10.1002/cbic.202400663, Roman J. Lichtenecker and co&#8208;workers combine organic synthesis, SPPS, E. coli protein expression, and NMR to investigate the interaction between a phosphotyrosine peptide and its protein binding&#8208;partner.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;based Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, as favorable molecular tools, offer novel insights into immune checkpoint research. Here, we aim to provide a review for the potential of aptamers in developing immune therapeutic strategies and investigating molecular mechanisms.







Abstract
Cancer has long been a significant threat to human life and health. The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, which possess the same specificity and affinity as antibodies, are advantageous due to their synthetic accessibility and ease of modification, providing novel insights for immune checkpoint research. In this review, we outline the key aptamers currently developed for immune checkpoints such as CTLA&#8208;4, PD&#8208;1, PD&#8722;L1 and Siglec&#8208;15. We explore their potential in therapeutic strategies, including functionalizing or engineering aptamers for covalent binding, valency control, and nanostructure assembly, as well as investigating molecular mechanisms such as glycosylated protein functions and cell&#8208;cell interactions. Finally, the future applications of aptamers in immunotherapy are discussed.

         <title>Multidrug Resistance Reversed by Maleimide Interactions. A Biological and Synthetic Overview for an Emerging Field</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidrug resistance is the new big menace of the century and must be tackled, but in order to do so, we must understand how it works and what has been done about it. Herein we explore the main molecular mechanism focusing on cancer, and in the big future prospect for its treatment, maleimide, the chemical building block that could.







Abstract
Multidrug Resistance (MDR) can be considered one of the most frightening adaptation types in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and eukaryotic cells. It allows the organisms to survive the attack of many drugs used in the daily basis. This forces the development of new and more complex, highly specific drugs to fight diseases. Given the high usage of medicaments, poor variation in active chemical cores, and self&#8208;medication, the appearance of MDR is more frequent each time, and has been established as a serious medical and social problem. Over the years it has been possible the identification of several genes and proteins responsible for MDR and with that the development of blockers of them to reach MDR reversion and try to avoid a global problem. These mechanisms also have been observed in cancer cells, and several calcium channel blockers have been successful in MDR reversion, and the maleimide can be found included in them. In this review, we explore particularly the tree main proteins involved in cancer chemoresistance, MRP1 (encoded by ABCC1), BCRP (encoded by ABCG2) and P&#8208;gp (encoded by ABCB1). The participation of P&#8208;gp is remarkably important, and several aspects of its regulations are discussed. Additionally, we address the history, mechanisms, reversion efforts, and we specifically focused on the maleimide synthesis as MDR&#8208;reversers in co&#8208;administration, as well as on how their biological applications are imperative to expand the available information and explore a very plausible MDR reversion source.

         <title>Drug Discovery Approaches to Target E3 Ligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive review presenting the different drug discovery approaches that until now have been employed in academic and pharmaceutical settings to identify new E3 ligase small molecules ligands and contributing to the expansion of the targeted protein degradation field.







Abstract
Targeting E3 ligases is a challenging area in drug discovery. Despite the human genome encoding for more than 600 E3 ubiquitin ligases, only a handful of E3 ligases have been pharmacologically modulated or exploited for targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies. The main obstacle for hijacking these E3 ligases is the lack of small&#8208;molecule ligands. As research into this field advances, the identification of new small molecules capable of binding to E3 ligases has become an essential pursuit. These ligases not only expand the repertoire of druggable targets but also offer the potential for increased specificity and selectivity in protein degradation. The synergy between academia and industry is key, as it combines academic expertise in fundamental research with the industrial capabilities of translating these findings into novel therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of the different strategies employed in academia and industry to the discovery of new E3 ligases ligands, showing them with illustrative cases.

         <title>Chemical Tools for Probing the Ub/Ubl Conjugation Cascades</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (Ubl) regulate a diverse array of cellular pathways. Ub/Ubl conjugation is orchestrated by a cascade of specialized E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Here, we review chemical tools and methods implemented to probe enzymatic activities and to capture and characterize fleeting chemical and conformational states within Ub and Ubl conjugation cascades.







Abstract
Conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) and structurally related ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (Ubls), essential for many cellular processes, employs multi&#8208;step reactions orchestrated by specific E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. The E1 enzyme activates the Ub/Ubl C&#8208;terminus in an ATP&#8208;dependent process that results in the formation of a thioester linkage with the E1 active site cysteine. The thioester&#8208;activated Ub/Ubl is transferred to the active site of an E2 enzyme which then interacts with an E3 enzyme to promote conjugation to the target substrate. The E1&#8208;E2&#8208;E3 enzymatic cascades utilize labile intermediates, extensive conformational changes, and vast combinatorial diversity of short&#8208;lived protein&#8208;protein complexes to conjugate Ub/Ubl to various substrates in a regulated manner. In this review, we discuss various chemical tools and methods used to study the consecutive steps of Ub/Ubl activation and conjugation, which are often too elusive for direct studies. We focus on methods developed to probe enzymatic activities and capture and characterize stable mimics of the transient intermediates and transition states, thereby providing insights into fundamental mechanisms in the Ub/Ubl conjugation pathways.

         <title>Nanozymes as Antibacterial Agents: New Concerns in Design and Enhancement Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work enumerates new research concerns in designing antibacterial nanozymes with additional functionality or enhanced biosafety, presents non&#8208;redox nanozymes independent of highly toxic ROS and the nanozymes that combat non&#8208;common pathogenic bacteria, and reviews new enhancement strategies of using external physical (light, ultrasound) stimulation, extrinsic small molecule introduction, and various H2O2 self&#8208;supply strategies to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes.







Abstract
Nanozymes exhibiting natural enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities as antibacterial agents present several advantages, including high stability, low cost, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity, ease of preparation and storage, and minimal bacterial resistance. Consequently, they have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the rapid expansion of antimicrobial nanozyme research has resulted in pioneering reviews that do not comprehensively address emerging concerns and enhancement strategies within this field. This paper first summarizes the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of nanozymes; subsequently, we outline new research considerations for designing antibacterial nanozymes with enhanced functionality and biosafety features such as degradable, imageable, targeted, and bacterial&#8208;binding nanozymes as well as those capable of selectively targeting pathogenic bacteria while sparing normal cells and probiotics. Furthermore, we review novel enhancement strategies involving external physical stimuli (light or ultrasound), the introduction of extrinsic small molecules, and self&#8208;supplying H2O2 to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes under physiological conditions characterized by low concentrations of H2O2 and O2. Additionally, we present non&#8208;redox nanozymes that operate independently of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) alongside those designed to combat less common pathogenic bacteria. Finally, we discuss current issues, challenges faced in the field, and future prospects for antibacterial nanozymes.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Protein Degradation by Smart PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart PROTACs can be activated at the site of diseased tissue in response to specific stimuli, such as GSH, ROS, hypoxia, light, and X&#8208;ray radiation. This enables controllable PROTAC function for precision therapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic modality in drug discovery. PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that effectively bridge proteins of interest (POIs) with E3 ubiquitin ligases, such that, the target proteins are tagged with ubiquitin and subsequently degraded via the proteasome. Despite significant progress in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), the application of conventional PROTAC degraders still faces significant challenges, including systemic toxicity induced by non&#8208;tissue&#8208;specific targeting. To address this issue, a variety of smart PROTACs that can be activated by specific stimuli, have been developed for achieving conditional and spatiotemporal modulation of protein levels. Here, on the basis of our contributions, we overview recent advances of smart PROTACs, including tumor microenvironment&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;responsive PROTACs, that enable controllable TPD. The design strategy, case studies, potential applications and challenges will be focused on.

         <title>Development of Nanomaterials&#8208;Based Agents for Selective Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents emerge as promising solutions to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of specific bacteria remains crucial. This review examines nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents and their mechanisms, including hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, protein and nucleic acid leakage, selective labelling and killing, extracellular and intracellular ROS generation, and damage to inner and outer membranes, all contributing to selective antibacterial activity.







Abstract
Bacterial infections continue to threaten public health due to limitations in rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques. While broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics offer empirical treatment, their overuse has fuelled the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens, posing a critical global public health challenge. In this critical scenario, nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents emerge as a promising solution to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of pathogenic bacteria is paramount. This review highlights recent advancements in developing nanomaterials for selective antibacterial activity. We categorize these agents based on their mode of action, exploring how they selectively interact with bacteria and their potential antibacterial mechanisms. This review offers crucial insights for researchers exploring the potential of nanotechnology to address the growing threat of AMR.

Abstract
Cellular activities are predominantly carried out by proteins that can dynamically adopt different structural conformations and differentially interact with other biomolecules according to cellular needs. Chemical probes are small molecules used to selectively interact and modulate the activities of specific proteins to study their functions such as the validation of potential drug targets. The remarkable performance of AlphaFold algorithms in the prediction of protein structures has pivoted interest toward elucidating the intracellular dynamics of protein structural conformation where covalent modification of proteins by chemical probes could be used to shed light upon. However, due to the barrier to entry by cell membrane and the general unfavorable reactive conditions of the intracellular environment, most studies using reactive chemical probes are still conducted on purified proteins and cell lysates. Nevertheless, recent progresses have been made in designing chemical probes with improved membrane permeability, stability and reactivity. This paper surveys the literature on recent advancements in membrane&#8208;permeable chemical probes and their applications with protein mass spectrometry for the intracellular studies of protein structural conformations and biomolecular interactions.

It highlights their emerging applications in catalyzing key reactions for small molecule synthesis, including reductions of ketones, imines, and aldehydes, as well as dehydrogenation processes, emphasizing their potential in drug discovery and development.







Abstract
The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress in the field of biocatalysis. One of the most frequently utilized enzymes in diverse biocatalytic applications is NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs). Traditionally, these enzymes are employed for their role in regenerating NAD(P)H in various enzymatic reactions utilizing glucose. However, recent studies have expanded the scope of GDHs beyond cofactor regeneration, highlighting their potential as biocatalysts in diverse chemical transformations. GDHs have demonstrated versatility in catalyzing key reactions in the synthesis of various drug molecules and intermediates, including ketone reduction to produce alcohols, imine reduction of C=N bonds to yield amines, reduction of aldehydes to alcohols, and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol derivatives. This review highlights recent advancements in elucidating the multifunctional roles of NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs) in biocatalysis, with an emphasis on their growing applications and significant potential in small molecule synthesis.

         <title>Reprogramming of Glucose Metabolism for Revisiting Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resistance to Transcatheter Hepatic Arterial Chemoembolization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic&#8208;based drug delivery systems and innovative treatment strategies hold significant promise in overcoming the challenges associated with transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. By targeting the unique metabolic pathways of cancer cells, these approaches can enhance therapeutic efficacy, improve drug distribution, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes in TACE resistance.







Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is recognized globally as one of the most lethal tumors, presenting a significant menace to patients&#8217; lives owing to its exceptional aggressiveness and tendency to recur. Transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy, as a first&#8208;line treatment option for patients with advanced HCC, has been proven effective. However, it is disheartening that nearly 40&#8201;% of patients exhibit resistance to this therapy. Consequently, this review delves into the metabolic aspects of glucose metabolism to explore the underlying mechanisms behind TACE treatment resistance and to propose potentially fruitful therapeutic strategies. The ultimate objective is to present novel insights for the development of personalized treatment methods targeting HCC.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular conductive hydrogels attract significant interest for their fibrous architecture and high water content, which mimic the extracellular matrix and integrate the benefits of electrical components, making them suitable for electrogenic tissue engineering. This review highlights recent advances in supramolecular conductive hydrogels, emphasizing their applications in cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering while outlining future development opportunities in this innovative field.







Abstract
Owing to their unique attributes, including reversibility, specificity, directionality, and tunability, supramolecular biomaterials have evolved as an excellent alternative to conventional biomaterials like polymers, ceramics, and metals. Supramolecular hydrogels, in particular, have garnered significant interest because their fibrous architecture, high water content, and interconnected 3D network resemble the extracellular matrix to some extent. Consequently, supramolecular hydrogels have been used to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. Supramolecular conductive hydrogels combine the advantages of supramolecular soft materials with the electrical properties of metals, making them highly relevant for electrogenic tissue engineering. Given the versatile applications of these hydrogels, it is essential to periodically review high&#8208;quality research in this area. In this review, we focus on recent advances in supramolecular conductive hydrogels, particularly their applications in tissue engineering. We discuss the conductive components of these hydrogels and highlight notable reports on their use in cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering. Additionally, we outline potential future developments in this field.

         <title>Probing Biomolecular Interactions with Paramagnetic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy offers useful opportunities for structural biology. Key techniques such as pseudocontact shifts and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements provide long&#8208;range structural restraints, while dynamic nuclear polarization can amplify NMR signals of large biomolecules in complex environments. The integration of paramagnetic NMR data with computational methods like AlphaFold holds great potential to elucidate large and dynamic biomolecular complexes.







Abstract
Recent advances in computational methods like AlphaFold have transformed structural biology, enabling accurate modeling of protein complexes and driving applications in drug discovery and protein engineering. However, predicting the structure of systems involving weak, transient, or dynamic interactions, or of complexes with disordered regions, remains challenging. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers atomic&#8208;level insights into biomolecular complexes, even in weakly interacting and dynamic systems. Paramagnetic NMR, in particular, provides long&#8208;range structural restraints, easily exceeding distances over 25&#8197;&#197;, making it ideal for studying large protein complexes. Advances in chemical tools for introducing paramagnetic tags into proteins, combined with progress in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, have enhanced the method's utility. This perspective article discusses paramagnetic NMR approaches for analyzing biomolecular complexes in solution and in the solid state, emphasizing quantities like pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Additionally, dynamic nuclear polarization offers a promising method to amplify NMR signals of large complexes, even in complex environments. The integration of AlphaFold protein structure prediction with paramagnetic NMR holds great potential for advancing our understanding of biomolecular interactions.

         <title>Strategies to Enhance the Therapeutic Efficacy of GLP&#8208;1 Receptor Agonists through Structural Modification and Carrier Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient endogenous insulin production or impaired sensitivity to insulin. In recent years, a class of incretin&#8208;based hypoglycemic drugs, glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs), have attracted great attention in the management of type&#8197;2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their benefits, including stable glycemic control ability, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction for patients. However, like other peptide drugs, GLP&#8208;1RAs face challenges such as instability, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and immunogenicity, which severely limit their clinical application. In recent years, various strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of GLP&#8208;1RAs, including structural modification and carrier&#8208;mediated delivery. This article briefly introduces the research and application status of several common GLP&#8208;1RAs and their limitations. Taking exendin&#8208;4 as an example, we focus on the research progress of improving bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy based on structural modification and carrier delivery strategies, aiming to provide reference for the development of new GLP&#8208;1RAs treatment systems.

However, like other peptide drugs, GLP-1RAs face challenges such as instability, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and immunogenicity, which severely limit their clinical application. In recent years, various strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of GLP-1RAs, including structural modification and carrier-mediated delivery. This article briefly introduces the research and application status of several common GLP-1RAs and their limitations. Taking exendin-4 as an example, we focus on the research progress of improving bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy based on structural modification and carrier delivery strategies, aiming to provide reference for the development of new GLP-1RAs treatment systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligoadenine Strand Functionalized Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Film Exhibiting pH&#8208;Triggered High&#8208;Degree Inverse Shape Deformations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the formation of parallel duplex A&#8208;motif structures under acidic conditions, oligoadenine strands (A&#8208;strands) functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films exhibited pH&#8208;responsive macroscopic reversal shape deformation.







Abstract
Smart shape&#8208;memory DNA hydrogels, which can respond to various types of external stimuli and undergo macroscopic shape deformations, have shown great potential in various applications. By constructing free&#8208;standing films, the deformation and response properties of these hydrogels can be further enhanced, and visualized deformation can be achieved. However, DNA hydrogels that can exhibit rapid and high&#8208;degree shape deformations, such as the inverse shape deformations, are still lacking. Herein, free&#8208;standing oligoadenine strand&#8208;functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films were developed that can exhibit reversible and high degree of inverse shape deformation upon cyclic pH changes. The oligoadenine strands exhibit a pH&#8208;stimulated reversible conformational transition between a flexible single&#8208;stranded state and parallel duplex A&#8208;motif structures, resulting in their role change in the film from negatively charged side chains to &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; crosslinking structures, driving a high degree of inverse shape deformation with a relative bending angle change of 223.7&#8201;% of the film, which is more than 5 times that of a film driven by pH&#8208;responsive i&#8208;motif structures, facilitating the development of bilayer hydrogel film actuators with potential in flexible sensors and robots.

         <title>Cytotoxic Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Diphosphine Complexes Affect the Mitochondrial Respiration of Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II)&#8208;based compounds containing diphosphines and mercapto ligands are cytotoxic and are able to inhibit the colony formation and the migration on A549 lung cancer cells. JC&#8208;1 and Mito stress tests revealed these compounds affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, changing the oxygen consumption and ATP levels, confirming mitochondrial dysfunction on these cells.







Abstract
In this work, we studied six Ruthenium(II)&#8208;diphosphine compounds containing different mercapto ligands (N&#8722;S), with general formula [Ru(N&#8722;S)(dppm)2]Cl (dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane). These compounds were characterized by several techniques (NMR [1H, 31P(1H), and 13C], HRMS, IR, UV&#8208;Vis and XRD) and their purity confirmed by elemental analysis. DLS experiments revealed low diameters and polydispersity indexes, and positive log P values in n&#8208;octanol/PBS indicated their preference for the organic phase. In general, these compounds are stable in different media over 48&#8197;h. Cytotoxicity experiments revealed promising IC50 values on A549 breast cancer cells, 0.48&#8197;&#956;M and 0.80&#8197;&#956;M for [Ru(mtz)(dppm)2]Cl (1) and [Ru(mmi)(dppm)2]Cl (2), respectively (mtz and mmi are 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;thiazoline and mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole in their deprotonated form, respectively). Clonogenic and migration experiments indicated their antiproliferative and anti&#8208;migratory capacity. ICP&#8208;MS results indicated their cellular accumulation in the nucleus, with little amounts in mitochondria. No covalent DNA binding was observed by ICP&#8208;MS. JC&#8208;1 and cell Mito Stress test confirmed mitochondrial dysfunction, which was verified by mitochondrial membrane potential uncoupling and drastic alterations in the oxygen consumption rate. Taken together, our results provide crucial insights regarding the anticancer potential of ruthenium(II)&#8208;phosphine compounds.

         <title>Characterisation of the Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase CYP116B46 from Tepidiphilus thermophilus as a Homogentisic Acid Generating Enzyme and its Conversion to a Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of the CYP116 family of self&#8208;sufficient P450 enzymes in the formation of homegentisic acid from 2&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid was investigated using the thermostable CYP116B46 enzyme from Tepidiphilus thermophilus. The high activity of the enzyme for this reaction demonstrates the domain architecture and structure of this enzyme is suited for efficient oxidative biotransformations.







Abstract
The heme enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYPs) catalyse the selective hydroxylation of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules. There is great interest in applying these enzymes as biocatalysts with a focus on self&#8208;sufficient CYP &#8216;fusion&#8217; enzymes, comprising a single polypeptide chain with the electron transfer components joined to the heme domain. Here we elucidate the function of the self&#8208;sufficient CYP116B46 fusion enzyme, from the thermophilic bacterium Tepidiphilus thermophilus. We demonstrate that it efficiently hydroxylates aromatic organic acids, exemplified by oxidation of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid to homogentisic acid (2,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), an important metabolite in bacterial catabolism. In line with the thermophilic nature of the source bacterium, activity increased at higher temperatures, (50&#8201;&#176;C), with a catalytic preference for NADPH over NADH. While self&#8208;sufficient fusion enzymes simplify biocatalysis; engineered peroxygenase activity is also a key advance in the application of these enzymes as biocatalysts as it eliminates the need for electron transfer partner proteins and nicotinamide cofactors. We demonstrate that a T278E mutation in the heme domain of CYP116B46, confers peroxygenase activity. This engineered peroxygenase enzyme is stable to elevated temperatures and catalytic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, with an observed optimal activity resulting in a total turnover number of ~650.

         <title>Structural and Functional Mimicry of the Antimicrobial Defensin Plectasin by Analogues with Engineered Backbone Composition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone engineering in the disulfide&#8208;rich miniprotein plectasin, a Lipid&#8208;II binding antimicrobial defensin, leads to proteomimetic analogues that reproduce the fold and function of the natural product on scaffolds with improved stability to degradation by protease enzymes.







Abstract
The threat posed by bacteria resistant to common antibiotics creates an urgent need for novel antimicrobials. Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide natural products that bind Lipid II, such as vancomycin, represent a promising source for such agents. The fungal defensin plectasin is one of a family of ribosomally produced miniproteins that also exert antimicrobial activity via Lipid II binding. Made up entirely of canonical amino acids, these molecules are potentially more susceptible to degradation by protease enzymes than non&#8208;ribosomal counterparts. Here, we report the development of proteomimetic variants of plectasin through the systematic incorporation of artificial backbone connectivity in the domain. An iterative secondary&#8208;structure&#8208;based design scheme yields a variant with a tertiary fold indistinguishable from the prototype natural product, potent activity against Gram positive bacteria, and low mammalian cell toxicity. Backbone modification is shown to improve oxidative folding efficiency of the disulfide&#8208;rich scaffold as well as resistance to proteolytic hydrolysis. These results broaden the scope of design strategies toward protein mimetics as well as folds and biological functions possible in such agents.

         <title>Entrapment of Lipase from Candida antarctica in a Xerogel for the Production of Biodiesel from Waste Cooking Oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methodology to synthesize a silica&#8208;based xerogel and immobilize the lipase from Candida antarctica (CALB) by entrapment, keeping its stability and activity without leaching. The modified status of the xerogel, from solid bloc to solid powder, brings better reagent diffusion as shown in the production of biodiesel with repetitive reuse.







Abstract
The process to synthesize biodiesel is well&#8208;developed and optimized to overcome the disadvantages like the competition with agriculture using feedstock, and the problematics in the process. Oils from waste and enzymatic catalysis have proven to be good solutions to these problems. Lipases are currently the most commonly used enzymes in the transesterification of oils; nevertheless, enzymes have a high cost and must be immobilized to offer repetitive reuse. This work focuses on the synthesis and the optimization of the conditions of a xerogel where the lipase from Candida antarctica is immobilized by entrapment. The xerogel synthesized here, a glass&#8208;like material, proved to be very effective in maintaining the enzyme on its structure, with an immobilization yield of 96&#8201;% and an activity of 5.3&#8197;U/mg (free lipase=12.1&#8197;U/mg). By grinding this xerogel, the immobilization yield remained constant (94&#8201;%). Nevertheless, grinding the xerogel allowed better diffusion of reagents, and the activity reached 9.7&#8197;U/mg. Using this xerogel in biodiesel production had a positive effect on CALB efficiency by increasing the biodiesel yield, 46.1&#8201;% against 15.1&#8201;% with free CALB. Finally, the catalyst could be reused for five runs without loss of activity.

&lt;p&gt;Methodology to synthesize a silica-based xerogel and immobilize the lipase from &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt; (CALB) by entrapment, keeping its stability and activity without leaching. The modified status of the xerogel, from solid bloc to solid powder, brings better reagent diffusion as shown in the production of biodiesel with repetitive reuse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process to synthesize biodiesel is well-developed and optimized to overcome the disadvantages like the competition with agriculture using feedstock, and the problematics in the process. Oils from waste and enzymatic catalysis have proven to be good solutions to these problems. Lipases are currently the most commonly used enzymes in the transesterification of oils; nevertheless, enzymes have a high cost and must be immobilized to offer repetitive reuse. This work focuses on the synthesis and the optimization of the conditions of a xerogel where the lipase from &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt; is immobilized by entrapment. The xerogel synthesized here, a glass-like material, proved to be very effective in maintaining the enzyme on its structure, with an immobilization yield of 96&#8201;% and an activity of 5.3&#8197;U/mg (free lipase=12.1&#8197;U/mg).

         <title>Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluation of Tanshinone Mimic Conjugates for Mechanism of Action Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small array of Tanshinone Mimics (TM) probes with a detection&#8208;promoting moiety (either a photoaffinity probe &#8208; PAP or biotin) has been synthesized for mechanism of action (MoA) studies on Human antigen R (HuR). Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates. Among these, biotinylated probe 5&#8201;a proved to be the most promising compound.







Abstract
Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) belonging to the ELAV (Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision) family, which stabilizes mRNAs and regulates the expression of multiple genes. Its altered expression or localization is related to pathological features such as cancer or inflammation. Dihydrotanshinone I (DHTS I) is a naturally occurring, tetracyclic ortho&#8208;quinone inhibitor of the HuR&#8208;mRNA interaction. Our earlier efforts led to the identification of a synthetic Tanshinone Mimic (TM) 2 with improved affinity for HuR. Here we report five new TM probes 3&#8211;5 bearing a detection&#8208;promoting moiety (either photo affinity probe &#8208; PAP or biotin) as a para&#8208;substituent on the phenyl&#8208;sulphonamide for mechanism of action (MoA) studies. Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates 3&#8211;5. They showed similar toxic activity in HuR&#8208;expressing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, with micromolar CC50s. REMSAs revealed that photoactivatable groups (4&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b), but not biotin (5&#8201;a and 5&#8201;b), prevented conjugates&#8217; ability to disrupt rHuR&#8208;RNA complexes. Further biochemical studies confirmed that biotinylated probes, in particular 5&#8201;a, can be used to isolate rM1&#8197;M2 from solutions, taking advantage of streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads, thus being the most promising HuR inhibitor to be used for further MoA studies in cell lysates.

         <title>Research Status and Applications of Adeno&#8208;Associated Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in adeno&#8208;associated viruses (AAV). Our objective is to conclude information regarding the characterization of AAVs and to emphasize the latest advancements in their applications within ocular, muscular, liver, and central nervous system disorders.







Abstract
Adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a powerful and effective tool for the delivery of exogenous genes into various cells or tissues. To improve the gene delivery efficiency, as well as the safety and specificity of AAV&#8242;s cell&#8208;targeting capabilities, extensive investigations have been conducted into its molecular biological characteristics, including capsid structure, cellular tropism, and the mechanisms underlying its entry, replication, DNA packaging, and capsid assembly. Significant differences exist between human and non&#8208;human primate AAVs regarding tissue targeting and transduction efficiency. These differences are primarily attributed to the amino acid sequences of AAV capsid proteins, the structural characteristics of these proteins, and the interactions of AAV with surface factors on host cells, such as cell surface receptors, signaling molecules, and associated proteins. This review primarily focuses on several key aspects of AAV, including its genome, coat proteins and their structures, genome replication, virus assembly, and the role of helper viruses. Additionally, it examines the utilization of recombinant adeno&#8208;associated viruses (rAAV), detailing their production methods, mechanisms of cell entry and trafficking, and various serotypes. The review further interprets the role of rAAV by analyzing its current applications in research and therapy.

         <title>Unsymmetric triazine&#8208;based triglucoside detergents for membrane protein stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins play a crucial role in a variety of biological processes and are key targets for pharmaceutical development. Structural studies of membrane proteins provide molecular insights into the mechanisms of these processes and are essential for effective drug discovery. Historically, these studies have relied on solubilization of the target protein using detergents, but conventional detergents often fail to maintain the stability of challenging membrane proteins. To address this issue, there is a need to develop novel detergents with enhanced protein stabilization properties. In this study, we synthesized unsymmetric variants of recently reported tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane(TRIS)&#8208;linker&#8208;bearing triazine&#8208;based triglucosides (TTGs) by incorporating two different alkyl chains (long and short) into the detergent structure. When tested with model membrane proteins, including a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, TTG&#8208;8,12 demonstrated superior efficacy in stabilizing membrane proteins compared to the original TTGs and the gold standard detergent DDM/LMNG. These results suggest that detergent unsymmetry is an important concept for improving detergent performance and unsymmetric detergents such as TTG&#8208;8,12 hold significant potential for advancing membrane protein structural studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiphoton Excited Fluorescence Imaging over Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with multiphoton excited fluorescence (MPEF) properties are designed through ligand design, pore modification, and crystal engineering strategies, which can be used for two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) imaging or high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence (H&#8208;MPEF) imaging. These approaches endow MPEF&#8208;MOFs with lower photodamage, stronger fluorescence intensity, and deeper tissue penetration character.







Abstract
Multiphoton excited fluorescence (MPEF) imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing biological processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous materials composed of metal ions or clusters coordinated with organic ligands, have recently gained attention for their unique optical properties and potential applications in MPEF imaging. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design, synthesis, and applications of multiphoton excited fluorescence imaging using MOFs. We discuss the principles behind the fluorescence behavior of MOFs, explore strategies to enhance their photophysical properties, and showcase their applications in bioimaging. Additionally, we address the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the potential of multiphoton excited fluorescence imaging by MOFs for advancing our understanding of complex biological processes.

         <title>d&#8208;Galactose&#8208;Esterification of a Fungal Polyketide Catalyzed by a Carnitine Acyltransferase Domain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TrgA, a highly reducing polyketide synthase bearing a C&#8208;terminal carnitine acyltransferase domain (cAT), is heterologously reconstituted to biosynthesize trichogalactin. The cAT domain of TrgA offloads and esterifies the polyketide product with d&#8208;galactose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Dephosphorylation of TrgA product by an alkaline phosphatase completes the biosynthesis of the d&#8208;galactose&#8208;esterified polyketide.







Abstract
While sugar&#8208;containing natural products are commonly biosynthesized via glycosyltranferases using sugar&#8208;UDP as the electrophile, nature has evolved alternative strategies of glyco&#8208;modification to expand the diversity of natural products. Hydroxyl groups on sugars can serve as nucleophiles in the release of polyketide products from polyketide synthases. Herein, we demonstrate a highly reducing polyketide synthase (HRPKS) from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum T22, which is terminated with a carnitine acyltransferase (cAT) domain, catalyzes the biosynthesis of a d&#8208;galactose esterified polyketide named as trichogalactin. Structure&#8208;guided enzymatic assays showed that the sugar nucleophile in the esterification reaction catalyzed by cAT is &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;galactose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P) instead of free d&#8208;galactose. The released product, trichogalactin phosphate, is subsequently dephosphorylated by a host alkaline phosphatase to complete the biosynthesis of trichogalactin. The cAT domain is highly specific for Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P and does not accept &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate or &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Our study expands the inventory of natural products from an agriculturally important fungus and demonstrates the potential of mining cAT&#8208;containing HRPKSs to discover new glyco&#8208;esterified natural products.

&lt;p&gt;TrgA, a highly reducing polyketide synthase bearing a &lt;i&gt;C-&lt;/i&gt;terminal carnitine acyltransferase domain (cAT), is heterologously reconstituted to biosynthesize trichogalactin. The cAT domain of TrgA offloads and esterifies the polyketide product with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose-1-phosphate. Dephosphorylation of TrgA product by an alkaline phosphatase completes the biosynthesis of the &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose-esterified polyketide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sugar-containing natural products are commonly biosynthesized via glycosyltranferases using sugar-UDP as the electrophile, nature has evolved alternative strategies of glyco-modification to expand the diversity of natural products. Hydroxyl groups on sugars can serve as nucleophiles in the release of polyketide products from polyketide synthases. Herein, we demonstrate a highly reducing polyketide synthase (HRPKS) from the biocontrol fungus &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma afroharzianum&lt;/i&gt; T22, which is terminated with a carnitine acyltransferase (cAT) domain, catalyzes the biosynthesis of a &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose esterified polyketide named as trichogalactin. Structure-guided enzymatic assays showed that the sugar nucleophile in the esterification reaction catalyzed by cAT is &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) instead of free &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose. The released product, trichogalactin phosphate, is subsequently dephosphorylated by a host alkaline phosphatase to complete the biosynthesis of trichogalactin. The cAT domain is highly specific for Gal-1-P and does not accept &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucose-1-phosphate or &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-mannose-1-phosphate. Our study expands the inventory of natural products from an agriculturally important fungus and demonstrates the potential of mining cAT-containing HRPKSs to discover new glyco-esterified natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein&#8208;metabolite Interactions Based on Chemical Targeting Methods</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing detectable signals for specific interactions plays a crucial role in elucidating protein&#8208;metabolite interaction networks. This article outlines the chemical targeting strategies and the applications in discovering and elucidating pathways of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions.







Abstract
The importance of the protein&#8208;metabolite interaction network extends beyond its relevance to life sciences focused on proteins, it also profoundly influences its mechanisms related to disease targets, drug screening, and clinical diagnosis and treatment. Research methods targeting protein&#8208;metabolite interaction focus on enhancing the detectable signals of specific interactions by examining the structural characteristics of both proteins and metabolites in conjunction with chemical molecules, playing a crucial role in elucidating the protein&#8208;metabolite interaction network. Consequently, this article outlines several chemical targeting strategies developed in recent years and provides examples of their applications in the discovery and interpretation of new protein&#8208;metabolite interaction pathways. Finally, a brief summary will be presented regarding technological advances, research prospects, and current challenges of protein&#8208;metabolite interaction research.

         <title>Novel Approaches in Targeting Cell Surface and Secreted Proteins for Lysosomal Degradation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TransTAC&#8208;mediated membrane protein degradation via the lysosome. TransTACs are small molecules that trigger the engagement between transferrin receptor (TfR1) and the target protein on the cell membrane surface resulting in co&#8208;internalization of the target protein and TfR1 to early endosomes and subsequently shuttling of the target protein for lysosomal degradation.







Abstract
Protein degradation is pivotal for all biochemical aspects of cellular function. In mammalian cells, protein degradation is mediated mainly by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic&#8208;lysosomal system (ALS). Over the last two decades, different types of targeted protein degradation approaches have been developed including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs), which employ the UPS to degrade intracellular proteins and the ALS to degrade extracellular and membrane proteins respectively. Nevertheless, Current targeted membrane protein degradation approaches face some inherent challenges including limited target protein degradation efficacy and cell type specific applicability. Herein, we highlight some recent developments of novel targeted membrane protein degradation modalities that exhibit wide&#8208;applicability and high protein degradation efficiency. These novel membrane protein degraders hold tremendous promise as new pharmacological and biochemical tools in targeting membrane and secretory proteins for lysosomal degradation.

         <title>Advanced Synthesis of Spherical Nucleic Acids: A Limit&#8208;Pursuing Game with Broad Implications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, the synthesis of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), an important class of bionanomaterials with widespread uses, has been greatly advanced toward reduced time consumption and record&#8208;high DNA densities. Starting from the classical salt&#8208;aging method, this concept introduces the innovative strategies based on low&#8208;pH, freezing&#8208;thawing, and dehydration conditions toward high quality SNA synthesis, with a focus on their mechanistic understanding and wide implications to various future pursuits.







Abstract
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consist of DNA strands arranged radially and packed densely on the surface of nanoparticles. Due to their unique properties, which are not found in naturally occurring linear or circular DNA, SNAs have gained widespread attention in fields such as sensing, nanomedicine, and colloidal assembly. The rapidly evolving applications of SNAs have driven a modernization of their syntheses to meet different needs. Recently, several advanced approaches have emerged, enabling ultrafast, quantitative, and low&#8208;cost SNA synthesis with maximal DNA grafting through &#8220;counterintuitive&#8221; processes like freezing and dehydration. This concept paper discusses these critical developments from a synthetic perspective, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and broad implications, with a goal of inspiring future research in related fields.

         <title>Detecting the Undetectable: Advances in Methods for Identifying Small Tau Aggregates in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores current methods for detecting and characterising small tau aggregates, which are increasingly recognised as key drivers of neurotoxicity in tauopathies. It discusses emerging techniques such as single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down (SiMPull), single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), and cryo&#8208;electron tomography (cryo&#8208;ET), highlighting their potential to improve our understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer's where traditional methods fall short.







Abstract
Tau, a microtubule&#8208;associated protein, plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal structure and function. However, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, tau misfolds and aggregates into oligomers and fibrils, leading to neuronal damage. Tau oligomers are increasingly recognised as the most neurotoxic species, inducing synaptic dysfunction and contributing to disease progression. Detecting these early&#8208;stage aggregates is challenging due to their low concentration and high heterogeneity in biological samples. Traditional methods such as immunostaining and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) lack the sensitivity and specificity to reliably detect small tau aggregates. Advanced single&#8208;molecule approaches, including single&#8208;molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down (SiMPull), offer improved sensitivity for studying tau aggregation at the molecular level. These emerging tools provide critical insights into tau pathology, enabling earlier detection and characterisation of disease&#8208;relevant aggregates, thereby offering potential for the development of targeted therapies and diagnostic approaches for tauopathies.

         <title>177Lu Radiolabeled Polydopamine Decorated with Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor for Locoregional Treatment of Glioma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine (PDA) was conjugated with fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) and macrocyclic chelator (DOTA) for specific cancer targeting and 177Lu labeling. The synthesized nanoradiopharmaceutical, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI, demonstrated satisfactory antitumor ability after intratumoral injection to U87MG tumor&#8208;bearing mice. In contrast, intravenous injection did not result in noticeable tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
Radionuclide therapy is expected to be a powerful tool for glioma treatment. Here, we introduced a novel nuclear nanomedicine based on polydopamine (PDA), incorporating fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) and macrocyclic chelator (DOTA) for specific cancer targeting and 177Lu labeling. The synthesized nanoradiopharmaceutical, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI, exhibits good stability in serum, saline and PBS over 5&#8197;days. 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI shows efficient specific uptake and internalization when incubated with U87MG cells. In vivo distribution visualized prominent accumulation and long retention ability of 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI at tumor sites after local administration. Moreover, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI has satisfactory antitumor ability without apparent toxic and side effects observed from therapy assay and H&amp;E staining. This study highlights the feasibility of using PDA as a nanocarrier for glioma endoradiotherapy by targeting fibroblast activation protein.

The synthesized nanoradiopharmaceutical, &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-PDA-FAPI, exhibits good stability in serum, saline and PBS over 5&#8197;days. &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-PDA-FAPI shows efficient specific uptake and internalization when incubated with U87MG cells. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; distribution visualized prominent accumulation and long retention ability of &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-PDA-FAPI at tumor sites after local administration. Moreover, &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-PDA-FAPI has satisfactory antitumor ability without apparent toxic and side effects observed from therapy assay and H&amp;amp;E staining. This study highlights the feasibility of using PDA as a nanocarrier for glioma endoradiotherapy by targeting fibroblast activation protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flow Cytometric Analysis for Evaluating Protein Synthesis Efficiency in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles with Charged Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GFP synthesis using reconstituted cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (PURE system) in artificial cells composed of charged lipids showed lower GFP synthesis efficiency compared to neutral lipids. This reduced efficiency was restored when both positive and negative charges were introduced to the lipid membrane, neutralizing the overall charge.







Abstract
Quantitative investigation of the relationship between endosomal translation reactions and phospholipid membrane composition is crucial for enhancing protein translation efficiency in artificial cells. In this study, we quantitatively compared the translation reactions within liposomes containing negatively and positively charged lipids using green fluorescent protein fluorescence as an indicator to investigate whether lipid membrane charge affects translation reaction efficiency in artificial cells. Thus, translation efficiency reduced in liposomes containing both negatively and positively charged lipids. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the percentage of liposomes undergoing translational reactions was reduced by the charged phospholipids. This translation reaction inhibition was alleviated by adding equal amounts of negatively and positively charged lipids, indicating that phospholipid membrane charges affected translation reaction efficiency. The relationship between membrane composition and translation reaction efficiency identified in this study is significant for the constructing complex artificial cells, particularly concerning membrane composition design

         <title>A Mn(salen)&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzyme for Nitrene and Oxene Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(salen)&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) were constructed by embedding biotinylated Mn(salen) complexes into streptavidin. Their activities were improved by genetic optimization of protein scaffold and the ArM variants catalyzed the aziridination of styrene and oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with up to 19 and 146 turnover numbers.







Abstract
The development of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) offers a potent approach to incorporate non&#8208;natural chemical reactions into biocatalysis. Here we report the assembly of Mn(salen)&#8208;based ArMs by embedding biotinylated Mn(salen) complexes into streptavidin (Sav) variants. Using commercially available nitrene and oxo transfer reagents, these biohybrid catalysts catalyzed the aziridination of alkenes and oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with up to 19 and 146 turnover numbers.

         <title>Proton Occupancies in Histidine Side Chains of Carbonic Anhydrase II by Neutron Crystallography and NMR &#8211; Differences, Similarities and Opportunities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Comparative studies of histidine proton occupancy in Human Carbonic Anhydrase II using NMR spectroscopy and neutron protein crystallography.







Abstract
Histidine is a key amino&#8208;acid residues in proteins that can exist in three different protonation states: two different neutral tautomeric forms and a protonated, positively charged one. It can act as both donor and acceptor of hydrogen bonds, coordinate metal ions, and engage in acid/base catalysis. Human Carbonic Anhydrase II (HCA II) is a pivotal enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. It contains 12 histidine residues: six are surface exposed, two buried, three are active site zinc ion ligands, and one is a proton shuttle. Comparing results from NMR spectroscopy with previously determined neutron protein crystal structures enabled a side&#8208;by&#8208;side investigation of the proton occupancies and preferred tautomeric states of the histidine residues in HCA II. Buried and zinc coordinating histidines remain in one neutral tautomeric state across the entire pH range studied, as validated by both methods. In contrast, solvent&#8208;exposed histidines display high variability in proton occupancies. While the data were overall remarkably consistent between methods, some discrepancies were observed, shedding light on the limitations of each technique. Therefore, combining these methods with full awareness of the advantages and drawbacks of each, provides insights into the dynamic protonation landscape of HCA II histidines, crucial for elucidating enzyme catalytic mechanisms.

         <title>Navigating The Deuteration Landscape: Innovations, Challenges, and Clinical Potential of Deuterioindoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuteroindole as a focal point, this review traces the evolution of deuterium chemistry from its discovery to clinical applications. It highlights how deuterium enhances drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, envisions its transformative role in precision medicine, and addresses challenges in synthesis, intellectual property, and regulation, while underscoring its broader impact across scientific disciplines.







Abstract
Indoles, pivotal to the realm of drug discovery, underpin numerous FDA&#8208;approved therapeutics. Despite their clinical benefits, pharmacokinetic and toxicity concerns have occasionally hampered their broader application. A notable advancement in this domain is the substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium, known as deuterium modification, which significantly enhances the pharmacological properties of these compounds. This review elucidates the progression of deuterium chemistry, culminating in approval of Deutetrabenazine in 2017. This milestone has catalyzed additional research into deuterated indoles, such as Dosimertinib, which have demonstrated enhancements in stability, toxicity profiles, and therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the review addresses challenges and patent issues in the synthesis of deuterated indoles and highlights their potential applications in precision medicine. In the future, deuterated indoles may positively impact therapy and contribute to advances in precision medicine through molecular engineering.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expansion Microscopy (ExM) employs physical methods to magnify biological samples, enabling visualization of refined cellular structures. Using specialized hydrogels, ExM could achieve super&#8208;resolution imaging on conventional microscope, thus permitting detailed examination of fine structures of cells and tissue sections by anchoring large biological molecules. This review highlights ExM's potential in biomedicine and provides insights into its future development prospects.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) is an innovative super&#8208;resolution imaging technique that utilizes physical expansion to magnify biological samples, facilitating the visualization of cellular structures that are challenging to observe using traditional optical microscopes. The fundamental principle of ExM revolves around employing a specialized hydrogel to uniformly expand biological samples, thereby achieving super&#8208;resolution imaging under conventional optical imaging conditions. This technology finds application not only in various biological samples such as cells and tissue sections, but also enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of large biological molecules including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolite molecules. In recent years, numerous researchers have delved into ExM, resulting in the continuous development of a range of derivative technologies that optimize experimental protocols and broaden practical application fields. This article presents a comprehensive review of these derivative technologies, highlighting the utilization of ExM for anchoring nucleic acids, proteins, and other biological molecules, as well as its applications in biomedicine. Furthermore, this review offers insights into the future development prospects of ExM technology.

         <title>Deciphering the Interplay Between G&#8208;Quadruplexes and Natural/Synthetic Polyamines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though PAs are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G4s are transient regulatory elements. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G4s and biogenic polyamines or synthetic G4 ligands containing polyamines. This work will assist to understand the biological impact of the association between G4s and natural/synthetic PAs.

The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though polyamines are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G&#8208;quadruplexes are transient regulatory elements, being both of them key regulators of biological processes. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G&#8208;quadruplexes and biogenic polyamines to understand the biological interplay between them. Moreover, we overview the main works focused on synthetic ligands containing polyamines designed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes, aiming to unravel the structural motifs for designing potent and selective G4 ligands.

         <title>The biarylitides: understanding the structure and biosynthesis of a fascinating class of Cytochrome P450 modified RiPP natural products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biarylitides are a recently discovered class of RiPP natural products that are fascinating both from the small size of the core peptides as well as the diversity of peptide crosslinking exhibited by the cytochrome P450 enzymes found in these systems. In this review, we address the discovery and biosynthetic diversity of these systems and discuss the methods and challenges of analysing the structures of these constrained cyclic peptides. We also discuss the structures of the P450 enzymes involved in these pathways and address the potential for alternate catalytic outcomes and activities as seen most recently with the inclusion of biarylitide related enzymes within rufomycin biosynthesis.</dc:description>

This concept provides an overview of the multifunctional and multitargeting nature of the tppz&#8208;based dinuclear Ru(II) complexes, including DNA probes, organelle imaging agents, phototherapeutic agents, and actin polymerization inhibitors.







Abstract
Ruthenium complexes are among the most extensively studied and developed luminescent transition&#8208;metal complexes for anticancer applications. Dinuclear Ru(II) complexes have caught significant interest for larger size, higher charge, and variable complex shapes. In this concept, we have explored past and recent works on the possible biological applications of versatile tetrapyrido[3,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;2,3&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;3,2&#8208;h&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;j]phenazine (tppz)&#8208;based dinuclear Ru(II) complexes with a focus on their use as quadruplex DNA probes, organelle imaging, and phototherapeutic agents. This concept also points out that a particular type of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes can act as multitargeting and multifunctional anticancer agents &#8208;making this an exciting research area in which an array of further applications will likely emerge.

         <title>Towards Next Generation Protein Sequencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein sequencing is essential for understanding protein structure and function. Recently, nanopore protein sequencing has rapidly emerged as a research hotspot, offering single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level detection accuracy. It also shows great potential to become the mainstream method for next&#8208;generation protein sequencing.







Abstract
Understanding the structure and function of proteins is a critical objective in the life sciences. Protein sequencing, a central aspect of this endeavor, was first accomplished through Edman degradation in the 1950s. Since the late 20th&#8197;century, mass spectrometry has emerged as a prominent method for protein sequencing. In recent years, single&#8208;molecule technologies have increasingly been applied to this field, yielding numerous innovative results. Among these, nanopore sensing has proven to be a reliable single&#8208;molecule technology, enabling advancements in amino acid recognition, short peptide differentiation, and peptide sequence reading. These developments are set to elevate protein sequencing technology to new heights. The next generation of protein sequencing technologies is anticipated to revolutionize our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biological processes and significantly enhance clinical diagnostics and treatments.

This review explores the transformative integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems for biosensing and therapeutic applications. It covers advances in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, detailing synthesis methods, functional classifications, and applications in detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Emphasis is placed on the unique synergies between DNA and nanomaterials, addressing challenges, and forecasting future opportunities in precision medicine.







Abstract
The integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems has emerged as a transformative approach in biosensing and therapeutic applications. Unique features of DNA, like its programmability and specificity, complement the diverse functions of nanomaterials, leading to the creation of advanced systems for detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Here, we review the developments in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, emphasizing their enhanced functionalities and potential across various biomedical applications. We first discuss the methodologies for synthesizing these conjugates, distinguishing between covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. We then categorize DNA&#8208;nanomaterials conjugates based on the properties of the DNA and nanomaterials involved, respectively. DNA probes are classified by their application into biosensing or therapeutic uses, and, several nanomaterials are highlighted by their recent progress in living biological. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field, anticipating that significant progress in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates will greatly enhance precision medicine.

         <title>Nanomaterial&#8208;Enhanced Red Blood Cell Biopreservation: From Refrigeration to Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are crucial in clinical and military medicine, but preservation is challenged by storage&#8208;induced damage. Traditional methods have limited effectiveness, while nanomaterials offer a promising alternative. This review examines storage and cryolesions, evaluates nanomaterials&#8217; potential to mitigate damage, and discusses key challenges in improving RBC biopreservation strategies.







Abstract
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions represent a cornerstone of clinical practice, with RBCs constituting the primary component in transfusion therapy. Extending the preservation of RBCs while maintaining their functional integrity would offer considerable advancements for both transfusion medicine and military healthcare. Despite decades of research, progress in achieving long&#8208;term RBC preservation has been limited. A key challenge is the range of physical and biochemical damage RBCs incur during storage, leading to marked changes in their morphology, physiological function, and viability. While traditional preservation techniques have provided partial mitigation of these damages, their efficacy remains suboptimal. In contrast, nanomaterials, with their distinctive spatial architectures and surface properties, offer a promising avenue for minimizing storage&#8208;related damage and extending RBC preservation. This review provides an overview of the major categories of damage encountered during RBC biopreservation, classified into storage lesions and cryolesions. We also highlight the key role of nanomaterials in enhancing the storage quality of RBCs and prolonging their preservation duration. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and pressing issues faced by nanomaterial&#8208;based RBCs biopreservation.

         <title>Dual Porphyrin&#8208;Loaded Scintillating Nanoparticles Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy in Hypoxic Cancer Cells under X&#8208;ray Irradiation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;doped NaYF4 scintillator loaded with dual porphyrins, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as a photosensitizer and hemin (Fe3+&#8208;PPIX) as an oxygen generator (Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin) enhances the activity of X&#8208;ray mediated photodynamic therapy in hypoxic cancer cells via catalase&#8208;like property of hemin in the presence of H2O2.







Abstract
Tumor hypoxia represents a major challenge to achieving successful therapy outcomes with photodynamic therapy (PDT). We hypothesized that systemic loading of dual porphyrins, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as a photosensitizer (PS) and hemin (Fe3+&#8208;PPIX) as an oxygen generator, onto Eu&#8208;doped NaYF4 scintillator (Sc), collectively terms as Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, could enhance the activity of X&#8208;ray mediated PDT. Catalase&#8208;like property of hemin in the presence of H2O2 facilitated the production of oxygen molecules (3O2) in hypoxic cancer cells. The produced 3O2 reacts with nearby excited PPIX molecules (PPIX*) in the Sc&#8208;PS pairs to produce singlet oxygen (1O2), as cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of ~60&#8197;nm efficiently produced oxygen in the presence of H2O2, which its concentration in tumor cells is higher than that in normal cells. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin generated similar amounts of ROS in hypoxic cultured cancer cells under low dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (0.5 Gy), compared to those in normoxic cancer cells. Notably, Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin exhibited similar cytotoxic effects in both hypoxic and normoxic cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Overall, the mutual Sc&#8208;PS performance between PPIX and Eu was synergistically enhanced by hemin in Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, which relieved hypoxia in the cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Sheet&#8208;Mediated Multivalent Capture of Cells with Enhanced Tunability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cell&#8208;capture surface is constructed by conjugating ligand&#8208;functionalized 2D peptide assemblies to an antifouling glass substrate. These sheet&#8208;like scaffolds allow non&#8208;uniform, patchy presentation of ligands with control over their identity, number, and spatial distribution. With this surface design, enhancements in multivalent cell&#8208;targeting affinity and selectivity are achieved.







Abstract
We report the creation of multivalent ligand surfaces for cell capture by conjugation of ligand&#8208;appended 2D peptide assemblies on an antifouling glass substrate. The sheet&#8208;like structures organize ligands into non&#8208;uniform, patchy patterns, enhancing multivalent cell targeting. A 155&#8201;% increase in captured cells was achieved compared to the presentation of the ligands on surfaces lacking the peptide sheets. Being orthogonal to the commonly used dendrimer&#8208; and cyclic organic molecular&#8208;based scaffolds, this peptide assembly&#8208;based approach offers a facile method to modulate the identity, number, and spatial distribution of ligands through controlled peptide coassembly. Using this method, we constructed a surface bearing two types of ligands, which demonstrates a 128&#8201;% enhancement in targeting selectivity between two model cells compared to the mono&#8208;ligand surface. These findings illustrate that integration of peptide assemblies into ligand substrates permits robust and effective manipulation of multivalent cell targeting, advancing the development of customizable cell&#8208;binding materials.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Oxygen&#8208;Independent DNA Photodegradation by Pheophorbide a: Implications for Future Photodynamic Therapy Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the oxygen&#8208;independent photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA provides new insights into potential photodynamic therapy strategies. Our study highlights Phed a&#8217;s ability to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals under anoxic conditions, allowing for effective DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). This capability may enhance cancer treatment in hypoxic environments.







Abstract
This study explores the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA under anoxic conditions, emphasizing its potential for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in hypoxic tumor environments. We used electron spin resonance (ESR), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to assess the radical generation and DNA interaction capabilities of Phed a compared to Pyropheophorbide a (Pyro a) under both oxygenated and anoxic conditions. Our results reveal that Phed a effectively degrades G&#8208;quadruplex DNA in the absence of oxygen, whereas Pyro a does not. Under anoxic conditions, Phed a generates unique carbon&#8208;centered radicals, as indicated by distinctive ESR signals, which are not observed in aerobic environments or with Pyro a. These radicals facilitate DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phed a&#8217;s ability to degrade DNA independently of oxygen underscores its potential as a versatile and effective PDT agent, especially for hypoxic tumors where traditional photosensitizers are ineffective. This study paves the way for the development of new PDT agents that can operate under different oxygen levels. Phed a&#8217;s radical generation and oxygen&#8208;independent DNA degradation mechanisms make it a promising candidate for future PDT applications.

&lt;p&gt;This study explores the unique properties of Pheophorbide &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; (Phed &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) in the photodegradation of G-quadruplex DNA under anoxic conditions, emphasizing its potential for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in hypoxic tumor environments. We used electron spin resonance (ESR), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to assess the radical generation and DNA interaction capabilities of Phed &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; compared to Pyropheophorbide &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; (Pyro &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) under both oxygenated and anoxic conditions. Our results reveal that Phed &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; effectively degrades G-quadruplex DNA in the absence of oxygen, whereas Pyro &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; does not. Under anoxic conditions, Phed &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; generates unique carbon-centered radicals, as indicated by distinctive ESR signals, which are not observed in aerobic environments or with Pyro &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;. These radicals facilitate DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phed &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;s ability to degrade DNA independently of oxygen underscores its potential as a versatile and effective PDT agent, especially for hypoxic tumors where traditional photosensitizers are ineffective. This study paves the way for the development of new PDT agents that can operate under different oxygen levels. Phed &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;s radical generation and oxygen-independent DNA degradation mechanisms make it a promising candidate for future PDT applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Research Progress in the Field of Hydrogen Sulfide Donors in the Last Five Years</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the progress of research on H2S donors in the last five years. In addition to inorganic sulfide salts, it is elaborated in the following four main sections. They are indirect release of H2S small molecule donor carbonyl sulfide, direct release of hydrogen sulfide small molecule donor, nanocomposite scaffold, and hydrogel.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) serves as the third gasotransmitter, crucial in various physiological processes involving its production and metabolism. Elevated levels of H2S can result in acute or chronic poisoning, whereas lower concentrations are involved in regulating diverse physiological and pathological activities within the human body. Moreover, it actively participates in maintaining normal cellular function by exerting cell protection and anti&#8208;apoptotic effects. In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to explore the physiological significance of H2S and its potential applications in developing prodrugs. To further unravel the biological and clinical potential of H2S, H2S donors have gained widespread utilization. These compounds facilitate our understanding of the specific functional aspects governed by H2S and hold promise as potential therapeutic agents. Therefore, it is necessary to study H2S as a delivery vehicle at the cellular and in&#8197;vivo levels. This review provides an overview of advancements made over the past five years regarding H2S donors and their applications in biology, encompassing indirectly released donors of carbonyl sulfide (COS), directly released small molecule donors, Nanocomposite scaffolds, and hydrogels.

         <title>The Structural Permissiveness of Triosephosphate Isomerase (TpiA) of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase has a typical (&#946;&#945;)8&#8208;barrel superfold with eight &#946;&#945; units, linked together by loops which wrap around to form a cylinder of parallel &#946;&#8208;strands (&#946;&#8208;barrel) surrounded by a layer of parallel &#945;&#8208;helices. Such loops L1&#8211;L3 are candidates for insertion of extra amino acids, but genetic analyses shown in this work reveals permissiveness in other structured sites also.







Abstract
Triosephosphate isomerase (TpiA) is widely regarded as an example of an optimally evolved enzyme due to its essential role in biological systems, its structural conservation, and its near&#8208;perfect kinetic parameters. In this study, we investigated the structural robustness of the archetypal TpiA variant from Escherichia coli using an in&#8197;vitro 5&#8208;amino acid linker scanning method. The resulting library was introduced into a tpiA mutant strain for functional complementation. From this library, 16 TpiA variants that were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild&#8208;type enzyme were selected for further analysis. Although all variants retained enzymatic activities within the wild&#8208;type range, several insertions were found in highly structured protein domains where the linker was expected to cause significant structural perturbations. Despite these potentially disruptive additions, the enzymes maintained their activity even when expressed in a dnaK mutant, suggesting that chaperones did not compensate for structural abnormalities in&#8197;vivo. Additionally, when these mutant TpiA variants were produced using an in&#8197;vitro transcription/translation system, they exhibited enzymatic activity comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the non&#8208;mutated enzyme. AlphaFold2 exposed that insertions reconstructed the local architecture of the nearby amino acid sequences. The evolutionary implications of this remarkable structural resilience are discussed.

         <title>Analysis and Prediction of Chymotrypsin Substrate Preferences through Large Data Acquisition with Target&#8208;Free mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral peptide therapeutics may be degraded by gut proteases like chymotrypsin. We used mRNA display to generate large datasets of chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant peptides and created a predictive machine learning model for chymotrypsin stability. We also identified protective and destabilizing residues and their positionally dependent effects on peptide cleavage. Finally, we validated both the computational and NGS model through half&#8208;life measurement experiments.







Abstract
Oral delivery of peptide therapeutics is limited by degradation by gut proteases like chymotrypsin. Existing databases of peptidases are limited in size and do not enable systematic analyses of protease substrate preferences, especially for non&#8208;natural amino acids. Thus, stability optimization of hit compounds is time and resource intensive. To accelerate the stability optimization of peptide ligands, we generated large datasets of chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant peptides via mRNA display to create a predictive model for chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant sequences. Through analysis of enriched motifs, we recapitulate known chymotrypsin cleavage sites, reveal positionally dependent effects of monomers on peptide cleavage, and report previously unidentified protective and destabilizing residues. We then developed a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based model predicting peptide resistance to chymotrypsin cleavage and validated both model performance and the NGS experimental data by measuring chymotrypsin half&#8208;lives for a subset of peptides. Finally, we simulated stability predictions on non&#8208;natural amino acids through a leucine hold&#8208;out model and observed robust performance. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of mRNA display as a tool for big data generation and show that pairing mRNA display with machine learning yields valuable predictions for chymotrypsin cleavage. Expansion of this workflow to additional proteases could provide complementary predictive models that focus future peptide drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework as Selective Fluorescence Sensors for Cancer Inducing Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;precision detection and quantification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is imperative for early diagnosis of several terminal diseases. Owing to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong covalent linkers, porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have found widespread application in the benign fluorescence&#8208;based sensing of diverse VOCs. This article highlights the synthesis of COFs, and the mechanism of their action in VOC detection.







Abstract
Certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as formaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol, are overexpressed in some terminal diseases like cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. Therefore, high&#8208;precision detection and quantification of VOCs is imperative for early diagnosis of such detrimental diseases. Non&#8208;invasive and accurate fluorescence&#8208;based detection of such analytes has garnered widespread attention. The inherent luminescent properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), resulting from their extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation, have made them suitable for sensing applications. Structural tunability and strong covalent linkers facilitate sensing by COFs. Appropriate choices of linker and skeletal units of the COF can help detect various biologically important analytes selectively. The most common linkers used in this regard is the imine linker, which can undergo excellent hydrogen bonding with different protic VOCs e.&#8201;g., ethanol, methanol, etc. Besides imine detection, hydrogen bonding also proved useful for detection of aldehydes. Suitable combinations of donors and acceptors enable the COFs to have specific charge transfer interactions with many electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor VOCs. In this review, we have highlighted the syntheses of selective COFs incorporating linkers designed for sensing cancer&#8208;inducing VOCs. A detailed discussion of the interaction mechanisms between COFs and these VOCs is provided, along with examples from recent literature in this field.

         <title>Engineering Gas&#8208;Releasing Nanomaterials for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, including NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, as well as synergistic therapeutic strategies with other treatment modalities such as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are discussed in wound repair.







Abstract
The escalating prevalence of tissue damage and its associated complications has elicited global apprehension. While nanomaterial&#8208;based wound healing exhibits significant potential in terms of curbing infections and surpassing conventional methods, unresolved concerns regarding nanomaterial controllability and precision remain unresolved, jeopardizing its practical applications. In recent years, a unique strategy for creating gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials for wound repair has been proposed, involving the creation of gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials to facilitate wound repair by generating gas donor moieties. The operational spatiotemporal responsiveness and broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial properties of these gases, combined with their inability to generate bacterial resistance like traditional antibiotics, establish their efficacy in addressing chronic non&#8208;healing wounds, specifically diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). In this review, we delve into the intricacies of wound healing process, emphasizing the chemical design, functionality, bactericidal activity, and potential of gas&#8208;release materials, encompassing NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, for effective wound healing. Furthermore, we explore the advancements in synergistic therapy utilizing these gases, aiming to enhance our overall comprehension of this field. The insights gleaned from this review will undoubtedly aid researchers and developers in the creation of promising gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, thus propelling efficient wound healing in the future.

         <title>A Facile Label&#8208;Free Colorimetric Assay for DNase I Activity Based on the Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Functional Nucleic Acids</title>

A colorimetric assay for DNase I detection based functional nucleic acids with peroxidase&#8208;like activity.







Abstract
DNase I plays a crucial role in fundamental biological processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and efficient method to detect DNase I activity. In this work, a colorimetric assay based on functional nucleic acid for sensitive DNase I detection was reported. The functional nucleic acids with G&#8208;rich bases exhibit peroxidase&#8208;like activity under acetic acid conditions, capable of catalyzing the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The specific nucleic acid is designed as the substrate for DNase I, which can hydrolyze the strand and reduce the catalytic activity of the reaction system. Based on this, a sensitive, simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective colorimetric detection platform was constructed for the quantitative analysis of DNase I. The detection limit (3&#963;/s) for DNase I was 0.046&#8197;U/mL with a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;U/mL. Moreover, the practicality of this colorimetric detection platform was demonstrated by detecting DNase I in human serum.

         <title>Enhanced Molecular Imaging through a Versatile Peptide Nanofiber for Self&#8208;Assembly and Precise Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;based imaging probe (TAP) is designed through effective combination of the signal unit, recognition motif, assembly motif and Pro&#8208;leverage. TAP could combine with imaging probes through unique self&#8208;assembly strategies and specifically bind to PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive tumor with high specificity and stability. The TAP probe is an effective tool for diagnostic and therapeutic integration of tumors.







Abstract
Designing molecules for multivalent targeting of specific disease markers can enhance binding stability which is critical in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. Through rational molecular design, the nanostructures formed by self&#8208;assembly of targeting peptides are expected to achieve multivalent targeting by increasing the density of recognition ligands. However, the balance between targeting peptide self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition remains elusive. In this study, we designed a targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;based imaging probe system TAP which consist of the signal unit, the recognition motif, the assembly motif and a Pro&#8208;leverage. It is verified that TAP could specifically binds to PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive tumor cells in a multivalent manner to produce biological effects, and could also be combined with imaging probes through unique self&#8208;assembly strategies. By the balance between the peptide self&#8208;assembly and targeting recognition, the specificity and stability can be improved while the accumulation capacity of the probes at the tumor site can be greatly enhanced compared with the conventional strategy, thus reducing side effects, providing an effective tool for diagnostic and therapeutic integration of tumors.
