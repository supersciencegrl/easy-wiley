         <title>Remote Photodamaging of DNA by Photoinduced Energy Transport</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far does energy migrate in DNA? DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport is a new pathway to DNA photodamage occurring at remote sites and not locally at the site of excitation by light. Although these distances might be small with regard to a whole gene, the proposal that a site might be damaged other than the site of initial photoexcitation is important to the understanding of mutations that are caused by remote DNA photodamages.







Abstract
Local DNA photodamaging by light is well&#8208;studied and leads to a number of structurally identified direct damage, in particular cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and indirect oxidatively generated damage, such as 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;hydroxyguanine. Similar damages have now been found at remote sites, at least more than 105&#8197;&#197; (30 base pairs) away from the site of photoexcitation. In contrast to the established mechanisms of local DNA photodamaging, the processes of remote photodamage are only partially understood. Known pathways include those to remote oxidatively generated DNA photodamages, which were elucidated by studying electron hole transport through the DNA about 20&#8197;years ago. Recent studies with DNA photosensitizers and mechanistic proposals on photoinduced DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport are summarized in this minireview. These new mechanisms to a new type of remote DNA photodamaging provide an important extension to our general understanding to light&#8208;induced DNA damage and their mutations.

Similar damages have now been found at remote sites, at least more than 105&#8197;&#197; (30 base pairs) away from the site of photoexcitation.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Dual Modulators of A&#946; and Tau Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The screening of a focused library of 52 thiophene molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation identified lead compounds. The potent lead compound effectively rescued neuronal cells from aggregation&#8208;induced toxicity and establish thiophene compound as a dual modulator of A&#946; and Tau aggregation.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A&#946;) and Tau aggregates in the brain, which induces various pathological events resulting in neurodegeneration. There have been continuous efforts to develop modulators of the A&#946; and Tau aggregation process to halt or modify disease progression. A few small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based inhibitors that target both A&#946; and Tau pathology have been reported. Here, we report the screening of a targeted library of small molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation together with their in&#8197;vitro, in&#8197;silico and cellular studies. In&#8197;vitro ThT fluorescence assay, dot blot assay, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results have shown that thiophene&#8208;based lead molecules effectively modulate A&#946; aggregation and inhibit Tau aggregation. In&#8197;silico studies performed by employing molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding&#8208;free energy calculations have helped in understanding the mechanism of interaction of the lead thiophene compounds with A&#946; and Tau fibril targets. In&#8197;cellulo studies revealed that the lead candidate is biocompatible and effectively ameliorates neuronal cells from A&#946; and Tau&#8208;mediated amyloid toxicity.

         <title>&#8220;A study in yellow&#8221;: investigations in the stereoselectivity of ene&#8208;reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ene&#8208;reductases from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily are a well&#8208;known and efficient biocatalytic alternative for the asymmetric reduction of C=C bonds. Considering the broad variety of substituents that can be tolerated, and the excellent stereoselectivities achieved, it is apparent why these enzymes are so appealing for preparative and industrial applications. Different classes of C=C bonds activated by at least one electron&#8208;withdrawing group have been shown to be accepted by these versatile biocatalysts in the last decades, affording a vast range of chiral intermediates employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavours, fragrances and fine chemicals. In order to access both enantiomers of reduced products, stereodivergent pairs of OYEs are desirable, but their natural occurrence is limited. The detailed knowledge of the stereochemical course of the reaction can uncover alternative strategies to orient the selectivity via mutagenesis, evolution, and substrate engineering. An overview of the ongoing studies on OYE&#8208;mediated bioreductions will be provided, with particular focus on stereochemical investigations by deuterium labelling.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs enables efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The cover feature demonstrates how PylT recodes an amber stop codon within a GFP reporter to direct site&#8208;specific incorporation of an ncAA, leading to GFP fluorescence throughout the organoid, as visible by light&#8208;sheet microscopy. The method will help to implement existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies for probing and manipulating proteins in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. van&#8197;Husen et&#8197;al.

         <title>One Scaffold &#8211; Different Organelle&#160;Sensors:&#160;pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting live cell organelles is essential to image, understand, and control specific biochemical processes. Typically, fluorescent probes with distinct structural scaffolds are used to target specific cell organelles. Here, we have designed a modular one&#8208;step synthetic strategy using a common reaction intermediate to develop new lysosomal, mitochondrial, and nucleus&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes that are all based on a single boron dipyrromethane analog. The divergent cell organelle targeting was achieved by synthesizing probes with specific functional group changes to the central scaffold resulting in differential fluorescence and pKa. Specifically, we show that the functional group transformation of the same scaffold influences cellular localization and specificity of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes in live primary microglial cells with pKa&#8217;s ranging from ~3.2&#8208;6.0. We introduce a structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) framework to target nuclei (NucShine), lysosomes (LysoShine), and mitochondria (MitoShine) in live microglia. This work will result in future applications of SOR beyond imaging to target and control organelle&#8208;specific biochemical processes in disease&#8208;specific models.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondrial Membrane Disrupting Molecules for Selective Killing of Senescent Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular senescence, a stable form of cell cycle arrest, facilitates protection from tumorigenesis and aids in tissue repair as they accumulate in the body at an early age. However, long&#8208;term retention of senescent cells causes inflammation, aging of the tissue, and progression of deadly diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Various attempts have been made to achieve selective elimination of senescent cells from the body, yet little has been explored in designing the mitochondria&#8208;targeted senolytic agent. Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here we have designed a library of alkyl&#8208;monoquaternary ammonium&#8208;triphenyl phosphine (TPP) and alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammo&#8208;nium&#8208;TPP of varying alkyl chain lengths, which target the mitochondria; we also studied their senolytic properties. It was observed that the alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP with the longest chain length induces apoptosis to senescent cells selectively via an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane disruption. This study demonstrated that mitochondria could be a potential target for designing new small molecules as senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.</dc:description>

         <title>The diverse antimicrobial activities of human milk oligosaccharides against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus agalactiae  or Group B  Streptococcus  (GBS) is a gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathobiont that is the etiological cause of severe perinatal infections. GBS can colonize the vagina of pregnant patients and invade tissues causing ascending infections of the gravid reproductive tract that lead to adverse outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal or fetal demise. Additionally, transmission of GBS during labor or breastfeeding can also cause invasive infections of neonates and infants. However, human milk has also been shown to have protective effects against infection; a characteristic that is likely derived from antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of molecules that comprise human milk. Recent evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), short&#8208;chain sugars that comprise 8&#8208;20% of breast milk, have antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and other bacterial pathogens. Additionally, HMOs have been shown to potentiate the activity of antibiotics against GBS. This review presents the most recent published work that studies the interaction between HMOs and GBS.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural studies provide new insights into the role of lysine acetylation on substrate recognition by CARM1 and inform the design of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic interplay of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin provides a communication system for the regulation of gene expression. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role that such crosstalk between PTMs plays in chromatin recognition. In this study, (bio)chemical and structural approaches were applied to specifically probe the impact of acetylation of Lys 18 in the histone H3 tail peptide on peptide recognition by the protein methyltransferase CARM1. Peptidomimetics that recapitulate the transition state of protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferases, were designed based on the H3 peptide wherein the target Arg 17 was flanked by either a free or an acetylated lysine. Structural studies with these peptidomimetics and CARM1 provide new insights into the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. While the co&#8208;crystal structures reveal that lysine acetylation results in minor conformational differences for both CARM1 and the H3 peptide, acetylation of Lys 18 does lead to additional interactions (Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) and likely reduces the cost of desolvation upon binding, resulting in increased affinity. Informed by these findings a series of smaller peptidomimetics were prepared and found to be potent and selective CARM1 inhibitors. These findings provide new insights both into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation and inform the design of potent&#160;peptidomimetic CARM1 inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Modeling&#8208;assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are important building blocks of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which can be produced by thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyases, such as benzaldehyde lyase. Here we report the discovery of a novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from  Rhodococcus erythropolis  R138 (ReBAL). While the overall sequence identity to the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from  Pseudomonas fluorescens  Biovar I (PfBAL) was only 65%, comparison of a structural model of  ReBAL with the crystal structure of  PfBAL revealed only four divergent amino acids in the substrate binding cavity. Based on rational design, we generated two  ReBAL variants, which were characterized along with the wild&#8208;type enzyme in terms of their substrate spectrum, thermostability and biocatalytic performance in the presence of different co&#8209;solvents. We found that the new enzyme variants have a significantly higher thermostability (up to 22&#160;&#176;C increase in T50) and a different co&#8209;solvent&#8208;dependent activity. Using the most stable variant immobilized in packed&#8208;bed reactors via the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, (R)&#8209;benzoin was synthesized from benzaldehyde over a period of seven days with a stable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.3&#160;mmol&#160;&#183;&#160;L&#8209;1  &#160;&#183;&#160;d&#8208;1  . Our work expands the important class of benzaldehyde lyases and therefore contributes to the development of continuous biocatalytic processes for the production of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and APIs.</dc:description>

         <title>TET&#8208;Like Oxidation in 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and Derivatives: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex 1 towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates was investigated. The reaction rates are in very good agreement with the calculated BDEs. C&#8208;Methylated compounds such as 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU.







Abstract
The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) is an important factor in DNA modification and epigenetics. It can be modified through a three&#8208;step oxidation performed by ten&#8208;eleven&#8208;translocation (TET) enzymes and we have previously reported that the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [Fe(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can oxidize 5mC. Here, we report the reactivity of this iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex towards a wider scope of methylated cytosine and uracil derivatives relevant for synthetic DNA applications, such as 1&#8208;methylcytosine (1mC), 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;iso&#8208;cytosine (5miC) and thymine (T/5mU). The observed kinetic parameters are corroborated by calculation of the C&#8722;H bond energies at the reactive sites which was found to be an efficient tool for reaction rate prediction of 1 towards methylated DNA bases. We identified oxidation products of methylated cytosine derivatives using HPLC&#8208;MS and GC&#8208;MS. Thereby, we shed light on the impact of the methyl group position and resulting C&#8722;H bond dissociation energies on reactivity towards TET&#8208;like oxidation.

         <title>Recent Developments in PROTAC&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation: From Bench to Clinic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past two decades, Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed as a new approach for targeted protein degradation by hijacking the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In this review, we describe recent PROTAC developments, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), an emerging paradigm&#8208;shifting technology, hijacks the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. PROTACs induce ternary complexes between an E3 ligase and POI, and this induced proximity leads to polyUb chain formation on substrates and eventual proteasomal&#8208;mediated POI degradation. PROTACs have shown great therapeutic potential by degrading many disease&#8208;causing proteins, such as the androgen receptor and BRD4. The PROTAC technology has advanced significantly in the last two decades, with the repertoire of PROTAC targets increased tremendously. Herein, we describe recent developments of PROTAC technology, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.

         <title>Experimental Perspectives on Direct Visualization of Endosomal Rupture</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endosomal/lysosomal disruption can be directly visualized via lysosome size or genetically engineered cell lines.







Abstract
Endosomal escape continues to be a limiting factor in the therapeutic use of nanomaterials. Assays to visualize endosomal escape often do not decouple the endosomal/lysosomal disruption from the release of payload into the cytosol. Here, we discuss three approaches to directly probe endosomal/lysosomal rupture: calcein dye dilution, lysosome size quantification and endosome/lysosome membrane integrity visualized with a genetically engineered cell line. We apply the three assays to endosomes/lysosomes ruptured via osmotic pressure and photochemical internalization.

         <title>Structural basis of cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene forming acyl&#8208;coenzyme A dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biologically important, FAD&#8208;containing acyl&#8208;coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenases (ACAD) usually catalyze the anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination of a proton and a hydride of aliphatic CoA thioesters. Here, we report on the structure and function of an ACAD from anaerobic bacteria catalyzing the unprecedented 1,4&#8208;elimination at C3 and C6 of cyclohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1CoA) to cyclohex&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1,5CoA) and at C3 and C4 of the latter to benzoyl&#8208;CoA. Based on high&#8208;resolution Ch1CoA dehydrogenase crystal structures, the unorthodox reactivity is explained by the presence of a catalytic aspartate base (D91) to C3, and by eliminating the catalytic glutamate base at C1. Moreover, C6 of Ch1CoA and C4 of Ch1,5CoA are positioned towards FAD&#8208;N5 to favor the biologically relevant C3,C6&#8208; over the C3,C4&#8208;dehydrogenation activity. The C1,C2&#8208;dehydrogenation activity was regained by structure&#8208;inspired amino acid exchanges. The results provide the structural rationale for the extended catalytic repertoire of ACADs and offer previously unknown biocatalytic options for the synthesis of cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building blocks</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;canonical Amino Acid Substrates of E. coli Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising diversity: The aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases from E. coli have been extensively explored, and a surprising number of amino acid substrates have been described. This comprehensive review catalogues all known substrates for these enzymes and highlights trends and novel applications.







Abstract
In this comprehensive review, I focus on the twenty E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases and their ability to charge non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) onto tRNAs. The promiscuity of these enzymes has been harnessed for diverse applications including understanding and engineering of protein function, creation of organisms with an expanded genetic code, and the synthesis of diverse peptide libraries for drug discovery. The review catalogues the structures of all known ncAA substrates for each of the 20 E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including ncAA substrates for engineered versions of these enzymes. Drawing from the structures in the list, I highlight trends and novel opportunities for further exploitation of these ncAAs in the engineering of protein function, synthetic biology, and in drug discovery.

         <title>What is the Sugar Code?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Information coding by sugars: Letting symbols convey information comes in many forms such as the QR code. We explain that sugars are an ideal alphabet of life. They form an unsurpassed size of bio&#8208;vocabulary. It is read and translated by a matching diversity of sugar receptors (lectins) so that establishing a dictionary for the glyco&#8208;vocabulary is now in progress. The given QR code directs you to our review on the sugar code.







Abstract
A code is defined by the nature of the symbols, which are used to generate information&#8208;storing combinations (e.&#8201;g. oligo&#8208; and polymers). Like nucleic acids and proteins, oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides are ubiquitous, and they are a biochemical platform for establishing molecular messages. Of note, the letters of the sugar code system (third alphabet of life) excel in coding capacity by making an unsurpassed versatility for isomer (code word) formation possible by variability in anomery and linkage position of the glycosidic bond, ring size and branching. The enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis (writers) realizes this enormous potential for building a large vocabulary. It includes possibilities for dynamic editing/erasing as known from nucleic acids and proteins. Matching the glycome diversity, a large panel of sugar receptors (lectins) has developed based on more than a dozen folds. Lectins &#8216;read&#8217; the glycan&#8208;encoded information. Hydrogen/coordination bonding and ionic pairing together with stacking and C&#8722;H/&#960;&#8208;interactions as well as modes of spatial glycan presentation underlie the selectivity and specificity of glycan&#8208;lectin recognition. Modular design of lectins together with glycan display and the nature of the cognate glycoconjugate account for the large number of post&#8208;binding events. They give an entry to the glycan vocabulary its functional, often context&#8208;dependent meaning(s), hereby building the dictionary of the sugar code.

         <title>Modular Design of Supramolecular Ionic Peptides with Cell&#8208;Selective Membrane Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Molecularly designed cationic peptides having low membrane activity undergo cell&#8208;specific enzyme triggered chemical transformation and self&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular cationic clusters with enhanced membrane activity. The cell&#8208;selective membrane activity by in&#8197;situ formed peptide assembly is a highly desirable feature for targeted molecular imaging and therapy.







Abstract
The rational design of materials with cell&#8208;selective membrane activity is an effective strategy for the development of targeted molecular imaging and therapy. Here we report a new class of cationic multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated molecular transformation followed by supramolecular assembly to form nanofibers in which cationic clusters are presented on a rigid &#946;&#8208;sheet backbone. This structural transformation, which is induced by cells overexpressing the specific enzymes, led to a shift in the membrane perturbation potential of the MDPs, and consequently enhanced cell uptake and drug delivery efficacy. We envision the directed self&#8208;assembly based on modularly designed MDPs as a highly promising approach to generate dynamic supramolecular nanomaterials with emerging membrane activity for a range of disease targeted molecular imaging and therapy applications.

         <dc:description>Dysregulation of tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;), a pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine, causes several diseases, making it an important therapeutic target. Here, we identified a novel DNA aptamer against human TNF&#945; using  in vitro  selection, which included a high exclusion pressure process against non&#8208;binding and weak binders through microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) in only 3 rounds. Among the 15 most enriched aptamers, Apt14 exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for the interaction between TNF&#945; and its cognate receptor in mouse L929 cells. For further improving the bioactivity of the aptamer, dimerization programed by hybridization was evaluated, resulting in the Apt14 dimer exhibited a 2&#8208;fold higher binding affinity and stronger inhibition compared to the monomer counterpart. Rapid identification of bioactive aptamers via MACE in combination with facile dimerization via hybridization accelerates the discovery of novel bioactive aptamers, paving the way toward replacing current monoclonal antibody therapy with the less expensive and non&#8208;immunogenic aptamer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Leifsonia Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Thermostability and Catalytic Efficiency by Enhancing Subunit Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leifsonia  alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) is a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. However, limitations of wild&#8208;type LnADH observed for practical application include low activity and poor stability. In this work, protein engineering was employed to improve its thermostability and catalytic efficiency by altering the subunit interfaces. Residues of T100 and S148 were identified to be significant for thermostability and activity, and the melting temperature (&#916;Tm) and catalytic efficiency of the mutant T100R/S148I toward ketone substrates were improved by 18.7 &#176;C and 1.8&#8211;5.5&#8208;fold, respectively. Solving the crystal structures of the wild&#8208;type enzyme and T100R/S148L reveals the beneficial effects of mutations on stability and catalytic activity. The most robust mutant T100R/S148I is promising for industrial applications and can produce 200 g liter  &#8208;1  day  &#8208;1  chiral alcohols at 50 &#176;C by only a 1:500 ratio of enzyme to substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient linear dsDNA tagging using deoxyuridine excision</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific strategies for exchanging segments of dsDNA are important for DNA library construction and molecular tagging. Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3&#8242; ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi&#8208;base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT&#8594;dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non&#8208;perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called deoxyUridine eXcision&#8208;tagging (dUX&#8208;tagging), is an efficient one&#8208;pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3&#8242; overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5&#8242; overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX&#8208;tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX&#8208;tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high&#8208;efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemistry behind ThiC Rearrangement</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ThiC rearrangement is one of the most significant and sophisticated processes of pyrimidine biosynthesis, which has triggered the interest of numerous scientists from both chemistry and biology. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize most of the current processes in the elucidation of the chemistry behind this fascinating transformation, including the responsible enzyme and its structural details.







Abstract
Thiamine (vitamin&#8197;B1) is crucial for life and plays a central role in metabolism. It contains thiazole and pyrimidine moieties that are constructed independently and then assembled together to generate thiamine phosphate. The study of the thiazole moiety is relatively clear, but deciphering the mechanistic enzymology of thiamine pyrimidine is more difficult. This review aims to summarize the recent research progress on ThiC rearrangement, mainly including the mechanism, related enzymes, and genes involved in the rearrangement.

         <title>Design of a full&#8208;consensus glutamate decarboxylase and its application to GABA biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of L&#8208;glutamate to GABA. Improvement of the enzymatic properties of GAD is important for the low&#8208;cost synthesis of GABA. In this study, utilizing sequences of enzymes homologous with GAD from lactic acid bacteria, highly mutated GADs were designed using sequence&#8208;based protein design methods. Two mutated GADs, FcGAD and AncGAD, generated by full&#8208;consensus design and ancestral sequence reconstruction, had more desirable properties than native GADs. With respect to thermal stability, the half&#8208;life of the designed GADs was about 10&#176;C higher than that of native GAD. The productivity of FcGAD was considerably higher than those of known GADs; more than 250 mg/L of purified enzyme could be produced in the  E. coli  expression system. In a production test using 26.4 g of L&#8208;glutamate and 3.0 g of resting cells, 17.2 g of GABA could be prepared within one hour, without purification, in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification and composition of clasper scent gland components of the butterfly Heliconius erato and its relation to mimicry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The butterfly Heliconius erato occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper scent gland releases an anti&#8208;aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)&#8208;analyses, derivatization and synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3&#8208;oxohexan&#8208;1&#8208;ol and (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol with (S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids and various alcohols. In addition, linear terpenes with up to seven uniformly connected isoprene units occur, e. g. farnesylfarnesol. A large number of the compounds have not been reported before from nature. A discriminant analyses of principal components of the gland contents showed that the iridescent mimicry group differs strongly from the other, mostly also separated, mimicry groups. Comparison with data from other species indicated that Heliconius recruits different biosynthetic pathways in a species&#8208;specific manner for semiochemical formation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The butterfly Heliconius erato occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper scent gland releases an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)-analyses, derivatization and synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3-oxohexan-1-ol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol with (S)-2,3-dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids and various alcohols.

         <title>Protein Design with Fluoroprolines: 4,4&#8208;Difluoroproline does not Eliminate the Rate&#8208;limiting Step of Thioredoxin Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  4  &#8208;substituted fluoroprolines (4  R  )&#8208;fluoroproline ((4  R  )&#8208;Flp) and (4  S  )&#8208;fluoroproline ((4  S  )&#8208;Flp) have been used in protein engineering to enhance the thermodynamic stability of peptides and proteins. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine can bias the pucker of the pyrrolidine ring, influence the conformational preference of the preceding peptide bond, and can accelerate the  cis  /  trans  prolyl peptide bond isomerisation by diminishing its double bond character. The role of 4,4&#8208;difluoroproline (Dfp) in the acceleration of the refolding rate of globular proteins bearing a proline (Pro) residue in the  cis  conformation in the native state remains elusive. Moreover, the impact of Dfp on the thermodynamic stability and bioactivity of globular proteins has been seldom described. In this study, we show that the incorporation of Dfp caused a redox state dependent and position dependent destabilisation of the thioredoxin (Trx) fold, while the catalytic activities of the modified proteins remained unchanged. The Pro to Dfp substitution at the conserved  cis  Pro76 in the thioredoxin variant Trx1P elicited no acceleration of the rate limiting  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  isomerization of the Ile75&#8208;Pro76 peptide bond. Our results show that pucker preferences in the context of a tertiary structure could play a major role in protein folding, thus overtaking the rules determined for  cis  /  trans  isomerisation barriers determined in model peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>On the weak binding and spectroscopic signature of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 interaction with RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 non&#8208;structural protein 14 (nsp14), known as exoribonuclease is encoded from the large polyprotein of viral genome and is a major constituent of the transcription replication complex (TRC) machinery of the viral RNA synthesis. This protein is highly conserved among the coronaviruses and is a potential target for the development of a therapeutic drug. Here, we report the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 expression, show its structural characterization, and ss&#8208;RNA exonuclease activity through vibrational and electronic spectroscopies. The deconvolution of amide&#8208;I band in the FTIR spectrum of the protein revealed a composition of 35% &#945;&#8208;helix and 25% &#946;&#8208;sheets. The binding between protein and RNA is evidenced from the spectral changes in the amide&#8208;I region of the nsp14, showing protein conformational changes during the binding process. A value of 20.60 &#177; 3.81 mol L  &#8208;1  of the binding constant (  K  D  ) is obtained for nsp14/RNA complex. The findings reported here can motivate further studies to develop structural models for better understanding the mechanism of exonuclease enzymes for correcting the viral genome and can help in the development of drugs against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing P450 enzyme for biotechnology and synthetic biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYPs) catalyze the oxidative transformation of wide range of organic substrates. Their functions are crucial to xenobiotic metabolism and steroid transformation in human and other organisms. The enzymes are promising for synthetic biology applications but limited by several drawbacks including low turnover rates, poor stability, the dependance of expensive cofactors and redox partners, and the narrow substrate scope. To conquer these obstacles, emerging strategies including substrate engineering, usage of decoy and decoy&#8208;based small molecules auxiliaries, designing of artificial enzyme cascades and the incorporation of materials have been explored based on the unique properties of P450s. These strategies can be applied to a wide range of P450s and be combined with protein engineering to improve the enzymatic activities. Herein, this minireview will focus on some recent developments of these strategies which have been used to leverage the P450 catalysis. Remaining challenges and future opportunities will also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;3&#8208;Glycerol Phosphate Synthase From Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Potential New Drug Target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) catalyzes the indole&#8208;forming step in bacterial tryptophan biosynthesis. This minireview summarizes the data on expression, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition of IGPS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Crystal structures are also analyzed and compared to reveal structure&#8208;function relationships of value for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.







Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, affects millions of people worldwide. Several TB drugs have lost efficacy due to emerging drug resistance and new anti&#8208;TB targets are needed. Recent research suggests that indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) in M. tuberculosis (MtIGPS) could be such a target. IGPS is a (&#946;/&#945;)8&#8208;barrel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1&#8208;(o&#8208;carboxyphenylamino)&#8208;1&#8208;deoxyribulose 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (CdRP) into indole&#8208;glycerol&#8208;phosphate (IGP) in the bacterial tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. M. tuberculosis over expresses the tryptophan pathway genes during an immune response and inhibition of MtIGPS allows CD4 T&#8208;cells to more effectively fight against M. tuberculosis. Here we review the published data on MtIGPS expression, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition. We also discuss MtIGPS crystal structures and compare them to other IGPS structures to reveal potential structure&#8208;function relationships of interest for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Early steps in the biosynthesis of the organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin are revealed, including a rare example of oxidative cyclization of an alcohol to form an epoxide.







Abstract
The fungal metabolite Fosfonochlorin features a chloroacetyl moiety that is unusual within known phosphonate natural product biochemistry. Putative biosynthetic genes encoding Fosfonochlorin in Fusarium and Talaromyces spp. were investigated through reactions of encoded enzymes with synthetic substrates and isotope labelling studies. We show that the early biosynthetic steps for Fosfonochlorin involve the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to form 2&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, followed by oxidative intramolecular cyclization of the resulting alcohol to form (S)&#8208;epoxyethylphosphonic acid. The latter reaction is catalyzed by FfnD, a rare example of a non&#8208;heme iron/2&#8208;(oxo)glutarate dependent oxacyclase. In contrast, FfnD behaves as a more typical oxygenase with ethylphosphonic acid, producing (S)&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid. FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.

FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploration of GH94 sequence space for enzyme discovery reveals a novel glucosylgalactose phosphorylase specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substantial increase in DNA sequencing efforts has led to a rapid expansion of available sequences in glycoside hydrolase families over the past few years. The ever&#8208;increasing sequence space presents considerable opportunities for the search for enzymes with novel functionalities. In this work, the sequence&#8208;function space of glycoside hydrolase family 94 (GH94) was explored in detail, using a combined approach of phylogenetic analysis and sequence similarity networks. The identification and experimental screening of unknown clusters led to the discovery of an enzyme from the soil bacterium  Paenibacillus polymyxa  that acts as a 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose phosphorylase (GGalP), a specificity that has not been reported to date. Detailed characterization of GGalP revealed that its kinetic parameters were consistent with those of other known phosphorylases. Furthermore, the enzyme could be used for production of the rare disaccharides 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose and 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;l&#8208;arabinose. Our current work highlights the power of rational sequence space exploration in the search for novel enzyme specificities, as well as the potential of phosphorylases for rare disaccharide synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity Analysis of New Multivalent Electrophilic Probes for Affinity Labeling of Carbohydrate Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of gold nanoparticle&#8208;based affinity labeling probes multivalently presenting different electrophilic groups and a carbohydrate ligand was synthesized to evaluate their reactivity against lectins. The p&#8208; and m&#8208;isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together are promising alternatives to photoreactive groups as protein&#8208;reactive affinity labels for target identification studies.







Abstract
We have designed and synthesized six different multivalent electrophiles as carbohydrate affinity labeling probes. Evaluation of the reactivity of the electrophiles against peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) showed that p&#8208; and m&#8208;aryl sulfonyl fluoride are effective protein reactive groups that label carbohydrate binding lectins in a ligand&#8208;dependent fashion at a nanomolar probe concentration. Analysis of the selectivity of affinity labeling in the presence of excess BSA as a nonspecific protein indicated that m&#8208;arylsulfonyl fluoride is a more selective protein&#8208;reactive group, albeit with attenuated reactivity. Further analysis showed that the labeling efficiency of the multivalent electrophilic probes can be improved by employing reaction conditions involving 25&#8201;&#176;C instead of typically employed 4&#8201;&#176;C. Both isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together represent promising affinity labels for target identification studies that could serve as more efficient alternatives to photoreactive groups.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Mesophilic CTP&#8208;Dependent Riboflavin Kinase and Rational Engineering to Create Its Thermostable Homologues**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinases typically use ATP to phosphorylate their substrates. But not this one! Archaeal riboflavin kinases (RibK), characterized by a unique structural fold, select CTP over all other nucleotides for phosphorylating riboflavin (Vitamin B2) to produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we report the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal RibK from Methanococcus maripaludis. Further, using structural bioinformatics and computational studies, we determined the molecular determinants that confer thermostability to MmpRibK, making this class of enzymes amenable to bioengineering applications.







Abstract
Flavins play a central role in metabolism as molecules that catalyze a wide range of redox reactions in living organisms. Several variations in flavin biosynthesis exist among the domains of life, and their analysis has revealed many new structural and mechanistic insights till date. The cytidine triphosphate (CTP)&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase in archaea is one such example. Unlike most kinases that use adenosine triphosphate, archaeal riboflavin kinases utilize CTP to phosphorylate riboflavin and produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we present the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal CTP&#8208;utilizing riboflavin kinase homologue from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmpRibK), which is linked closely in sequence to the previously characterized thermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii homologue. We reconstitute the activity of MmpRibK, determine its kinetic parameters and molecular factors that contribute to its unique properties, and finally establish the residues that improve its thermostability using computation and a series of experiments. Our work advances the molecular understanding of flavin biosynthesis in archaea by the characterization of the first mesophilic CTP&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase. Finally, it validates the role of salt bridges and rigidifying amino acid residues in imparting thermostability to this unique structural fold that characterizes archaeal riboflavin kinase enzymes, with implications in enzyme engineering and biotechnological applications.

         <title>Discovery, biocatalytic exploration and structural analysis of a 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vanillyl&#8208;alcohol oxidase (VAO) family is a rich source of biocatalysts for the oxidative bioconversion of phenolic compounds. Through genome mining and sequence comparisons, we found that several family members lack a generally conserved catalytic aspartate. This finding led us to study a VAO&#8208;homolog featuring a glutamate residue in place of the common aspartate. This 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from  Gulosibacter chungangensis  (Gc4EO) shares 42% sequence identity with VAO, contains the same 8&#945;&#8208;N3&#8208;histidyl&#8208;bound FAD and uses oxygen as electron acceptor. However, Gc4EO features a distinct substrate scope and product specificity as it is primarily effective in the dehydrogenation of  para  &#8208;substituted phenols with little generation of hydroxylated products. The three&#8208;dimensional structure shows that the characteristic glutamate side chain creates a closely packed environment that may limit water accessibility and thereby protect from hydroxylation. With its high thermal stability, well defined structural properties and high expression yields, Gc4EO may become a catalyst of choice for the specific dehydrogenation of phenolic compounds bearing small substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Gly&#8208;His&#8208;tagged Proteins with Azidogluconolactone.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific protein modifications are vital for biopharmaceutical drug development. Gluconoylation is a non&#8208;enzymatic, post&#8208;translational modification of N&#8208;terminal HisTags. We report high&#8208;yield, site&#8208;selective in vitro &#945;&#8208;aminoacylation of peptides, glycoproteins, antibodies, and Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) with azidogluconolactone at pH 7.5 in 1 h. Conjugates slowly hydrolyse, but diol&#8208;masking with borate esters inhibits reversibility. In an example, we multimerise azidogluconoylated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) onto VLPs via click&#8208;chemistry, to give a COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. Compared to yeast antigen, HEK&#8208;derived RBD was immunologically superior, likely due to observed differences in glycosylation. We show the benefits of ordered over randomly oriented multimeric antigen display, by demonstrating single&#8208;shot seroconversion and best virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies. Azidogluconoylation is simple, fast and robust chemistry, and should accelerate research and development.</dc:description>

Inclusion in cells: Supramolecular porphyrin/per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin complexation is highly specific. Per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin bearing cell&#8208;penetrating peptide and BODIPY is efficiently taken up by cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways and delivers porphyrin into the cells. The supramolecular complexation in cells was directly detected by FRET between porphyrin and BODIPY.







Abstract
Artificial supramolecular systems capable of self&#8208;assembly and that precisely function in biological media are in high demand. Herein, we demonstrate a highly specific host&#8208;guest&#8208;pair system that functions in living cells. A per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative (R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe) bearing both an octaarginine peptide chain and a BODIPY dye was synthesized as a fluorescent intracellular delivery tool. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe was efficiently taken up by HeLa cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) as a guest molecule in water, from which fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe to TPPS was observed. The FRET phenomenon was clearly detected in living cells using confocal microscopy techniques, which revealed that the formed supramolecular R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe/TPPS complex was maintained within the cells. The R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe cytotoxicity assay revealed that the addition of TPPS counteracts the strong cytotoxicity (IC50=16&#8197;&#956;M) of the CD cavity due to complexation within the cells. A series of experiments demonstrated the bio&#8208;orthogonality of the supramolecular per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD/tetraarylporphyrin host&#8208;guest pair in living cells.

         <title>Red&#8208;Blood&#8208;Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Metal&#8208;Drug Nanoparticles for Enhanced Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) were designed and synthesized that self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. The obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell membranes to improve their stability and dispersity.







Abstract
To overcome high toxicity, low bioavailability and poor water solubility of chemotherapeutics, a variety of drug carriers have been designed. However, most carriers are severely limited by low drug loading capacity and adverse side e&#64256;ects. Here, a new type of metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) was designed and synthesized. The MDNs self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. To assist systemic delivery and prolong circulation time, the obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell (RBCs) membranes (RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs) to improve their stability and dispersity. The RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs presented pH&#8208;responsive release functionalities, resulting in drug release accelerated in acidic tumor microenvironments. The outstanding in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor therapeutic outcome was realized by RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs. This study provides an innovative design guideline for chemotherapy and demonstrates the great capacity of nanomaterials in anticancer treatments.

         <title>Structural Basis for The Recognition of Deaminated Nucleobases by An Archaeal DNA Polymerase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their life in hot environments, archaea are increasingly affected by deamination of the bases cytosine and adenine. To prevent mutations, archaeal DNA polymerases seem to recognize these base changes by a so&#8208;called &#8220;read&#8208;ahead&#8221; mechanism and react accordingly. Here we show by means of crystal structures how Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase binds uracil and hypoxanthine in a special binding pocket and thus can recognize these bases on the single stranded template overhang already six nucleotides before the active site.







Abstract
With increasing temperature, nucleobases in DNA become increasingly damaged by hydrolysis of exocyclic amines. The most prominent damage includes the conversion of cytosine to uracil and adenine to hypoxanthine. These damages are mutagenic and put the integrity of the genome at risk if not repaired appropriately. Several archaea live at elevated temperatures and thus, are exposed to a higher risk of deamination. Earlier studies have shown that DNA polymerases of archaea have the property of sensing deaminated nucleobases in the DNA template and thereby stalling the DNA synthesis during DNA replication providing another layer of DNA damage recognition and repair. However, the structural basis of uracil and hypoxanthine sensing by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases is sparse. Here we report on three new crystal structures of the archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase in complex with primer and template strands that have extended single stranded DNA template 5&#8217;&#8208;overhangs. These overhangs contain either the canonical nucleobases as well as uracil or hypoxanthine, respectively, and provide unprecedented structural insights into their recognition by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases.

         <title>B4GALNT2 Controls Sda and SLex Antigen Biosynthesis in Healthy and Cancer Human Colon</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the progress made in understanding the various regulatory mechanisms underpinning Sda and SLex expression in the human gastrointestinal tract.







Abstract
The Sda carbohydrate antigen and the corresponding biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 are primarily expressed in human normal colonic mucosa and are down&#8208;regulated to variable degrees in colon cancer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This review&lt;/b&gt; summarizes the progress made in understanding the various regulatory mechanisms underpinning Sd&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; and SLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; expression in the human gastrointestinal tract.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sd&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; carbohydrate antigen and the corresponding biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 are primarily expressed in human normal colonic mucosa and are down-regulated to variable degrees in colon cancer. On the other hand, the tumor associated antigen SLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; is not detected in the healthy colon and is upregulated in colon cancer. High level of &lt;i&gt;B4GALNT2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression appears to be a good marker of prognosis in colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating these carbohydrate antigens&#8217; expression are still poorly understood. We review here the most recent progress made towards understanding this balanced expression of blood group carbohydrate epitopes Sd&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; and SLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular in recent years, we have attained a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of the &lt;i&gt;B4GALNT2&lt;/i&gt; gene and of the subcellular fate of B4GALNT2 isoforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Nanorobots for Tumor&#8208;Targeting Drug Delivery: From Dynamic Control to Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanorobots are considered an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming option for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. We classified nanorobots into two types: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. One is equipped with self&#8208;propulsion and dynamic control ability while the other can detect the biological signal and perform controlled drug release. Moreover, prospects and challenges of nanorobots are discussed, intending to promote their clinical translation.







Abstract
Nanotechnology has been widely applied to the fabrication of drug delivery systems in the past decades. Recently, with the progress made in microfabrication approaches, nanorobots are steadily becoming a promising means for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. In general, nanorobots can be divided into two categories: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. Nanomotors are nanoscale systems with the ability to convert surrounding energies into mechanical motion, whereas stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are featured with activatable capacity in response to various endogenous and exogenous stimulations. In this minireview, the dynamic control of nanomotors and the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are overviewed, with particular emphasis on their contribution to tumor&#8208;targeting therapy. Moreover, challenges and perspectives associated with the future development of nanorobots are presented.

         <title>The Innate Immune Glycoprotein Lactoferrin Represses the Helicobacter pylori cag Type IV Secretion System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2783-2790, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicobacter pylori infection results in enhanced host production of lactoferrin which participates in nutritional immunity and can also serve as a source of nutrient iron for this pathogen, which can repress a major oncogenic virulence factor, the cag T4SS.







Abstract
Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric diseases including gastric cancer. Despite development of a robust immune response, H.&#8197;pylori persists in the gastric niche. Progression of gastric inflammation to serious disease outcomes is associated with infection with H.&#8197;pylori strains which encode the cag Type&#8197;IV Secretion System (cag&#8197;T4SS). The cag T4SS is responsible for translocating the oncogenic protein CagA into host cells and inducing pro&#8208;inflammatory and carcinogenic signaling cascades. Our previous work demonstrated that nutrient iron modulates the activity of the T4SS and biogenesis of T4SS pili. In response to H.&#8197;pylori infection, the host produces a variety of antimicrobial molecules, including the iron&#8208;binding glycoprotein, lactoferrin. Our work shows that apo&#8208;lactoferrin exerts antimicrobial activity against H.&#8197;pylori under iron&#8208;limited conditions, while holo&#8208;lactoferrin enhances bacterial growth. Culturing H.&#8197;pylori in the presence of holo&#8208;lactoferrin prior to co&#8208;culture with gastric epithelial cells, results in repression of the cag&#8197;T4SS activity. Concomitantly, a decrease in biogenesis of cag&#8197;T4SS pili at the host&#8208;pathogen interface was observed under these culture conditions by high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy analyses. Taken together, these results indicate that acquisition of alternate sources of nutrient iron plays a role in regulating the pro&#8208;inflammatory activity of a bacterial secretion system and present novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of H.&#8197;pylori&#8208;related disease.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2777-2782, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmolyte synthesis at elevated temperatures: 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is produced on industrial scale using the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of sucrose phosphorylase. We engineered the catalytic efficiency and regioselectivity of a sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable than the one currently used in industry.







Abstract
2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by various bacteria and plants in response to environmental stress. It is widely applied as a bioactive moisturising ingredient in skin care products, for which it is manufactured via enzymatic glucosylation of glycerol by the sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This industrial process is operated at room temperature due to the mediocre stability of the biocatalyst, often leading to microbial contamination. The highly thermostable sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis could be a better alternative in that regard, but this enzyme is not fit for production of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol due to its low regioselectivity and poor affinity for glycerol. In this work, the thermostable phosphorylase was engineered to alleviate these problems. Several engineering approaches were explored, ranging from site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to conventional, binary, iterative or combinatorial randomisation of the active site, resulting in the screening of &#8764;3,900 variants. Variant P134Q displayed a 21&#8208;fold increase in catalytic efficiency for glycerol, as well as a threefold improvement in regioselectivity towards the 2&#8208;position of the substrate, while retaining its activity for several days at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Evaluation of an E. coli Cell Extract Prepared by Lysozyme&#8208;Assisted Sonication via Gene Expression, Phage Assembly and Proteomics</title>

E. coli extracts can be prepared using a simple combination of lysozyme incubation and ultrasonication. We evaluate their performance in cell&#8208;free protein expression via the expression of reporter proteins, the assembly of bacteriophages, and using proteomics. Our results show a synergistic effect of both lysis methods.







Abstract
Over the past decades, starting from crude cell extracts, a variety of successful preparation protocols and optimized reaction conditions have been established for the production of cell&#8208;free gene expression systems. One of the crucial steps during the preparation of cell extract&#8208;based expression systems is the cell lysis procedure itself, which largely determines the quality of the active components of the extract. Here we evaluate the utility of an E. coli cell extract, which was prepared using a combination of lysozyme incubation and a gentle sonication step. As quality measure, we demonstrate the cell&#8208;free expression of YFP at concentrations up to 0.6&#8197;mg/mL. In addition, we produced and assembled T7 bacteriophages up to a titer of 108&#8197;PFU/mL. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantitative proteomics was used to compare the produced extracts with each other and with a commercial extract. The differences in protein composition were surprisingly small between lysozyme&#8208;assisted sonication (LAS) extracts, but we observed an increase in the release of DNA&#8208;binding proteins for increasing numbers of sonication cycles. Proteins taking part in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, amino acid and nucleotide related pathways were found to be more abundant in the LAS extract, while proteins related to RNA modification and processing, DNA modification and replication, transcription regulation, initiation, termination and the TCA cycle were found enriched in the commercial extract.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Solid&#8208;Phase Assay for Substrate Profiling and Directed Evolution of Transketolase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2814-2820, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (wild type or variants) in combination with donor (&#945;&#8208;ketoacids) and acceptor substrates (aldehydes), obviating enzyme extraction.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes, and specifically transketolases, form one of the most important families of biocatalytic tools for enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation yielding various hydroxyketones of biological interest. To enable substrate profiling of transketolases for acceptance of different donors and acceptors, a&#8197;simple, direct colorimetric assay based on pH reaction variation was developed to establish a&#8197;high&#8208;throughput solid&#8208;phase assay. This assay reduces the screening effort in the directed evolution of transketolases, as only active variants are selected for further analysis. Transketolase activity is detected as bicarbonate anions released from the &#945;&#8208;ketoacid donor substrate, which causes the pH to rise. A&#8197;pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase variants, obviating enzyme extraction.

         <title>Evaluation of Naturally Occurring HIF&#8208;1 Inhibitors for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>

Activation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1) leads to expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Six naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified using the developed cell&#8208;based assay. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors are thus effective in decreasing PDK1, which causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.







Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe progressive disorder characterized by high pulmonary artery pressure. Chronic hypoxia causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) is a key enzyme in Warburg effect increased by hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1). We constructed a cell&#8208;based luciferase assay system for HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors. Using this system, six HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified. Among these inhibitors, the effect of tagitinin&#8197;C (1) on PASMC was investigated. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. This result indicates that HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors effectively decrease PDK1 activity, which is a cause of the metabolic disorder and Warburg effect observed in PASMCs. Identifying naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors could provide novel insights into the development of PAH medications.

         <title>Engineered RebH Halogenase Variants Demonstrating a Specificity Switch from Tryptophan towards Novel Indole Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2791-2798, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two engineered halogenase enzymes were developed by switching substrate specificity of the parental enzyme from tryptophan to indole compounds. They can halogenate several industrially important indole derivatives more efficiently than the parental enzyme; this includes enzymatic chlorination/bromination of novel substrates that were not reported previously. The engineered enzymes could be useful in regioselective synthesis of drug intermediates.







Abstract
Activating industrially important aromatic hydrocarbons by installing halogen atoms is extremely important in organic synthesis and often improves the pharmacological properties of drug molecules. To this end, tryptophan halogenase enzymes are potentially valuable tools for regioselective halogenation of arenes, including various industrially important indole derivatives and similar scaffolds. Although endogenous enzymes show reasonable substrate scope towards indole compounds, their efficacy can often be improved by engineering. Using a structure&#8208;guided semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis approach, we have developed two RebH variants with expanded biocatalytic repertoires that can efficiently halogenate several novel indole substrates and produce important pharmaceutical intermediates. Interestingly, the engineered enzymes are completely inactive towards their natural substrate tryptophan in spite of their high tolerance to various functional groups in the indole ring. Computational modelling and molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic insights into the role of gatekeeper residues in the substrate binding site and the dramatic switch in substrate specificity when these are mutated.

High&#8208;resolution light microscopy of Helicobacter pylori&#8208;infected gastric tissue (400&#215; magnification): The picture shows a composite fluorescent image of gastric tissue stained with eosin (pseudo&#8208;colored blue) producing lactoferrin (pseudocolored overlay cyan), with the structure of lactoferrin in an inset (circular panel). H. pylori is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial pathogen that infects the stomach and causes ulcers and gastric cancer. The host innate immune system produces the glycoprotein lactoferrin as part of the antimicrobial response to bacterial infection, and this molecule can repress the oncogenic activity of the H. pylori cag T4SS in an iron&#8208;dependent manner.

Enzyme engineering for the synthesis of a cosmetic ingredient: The osmolyte 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol is widely applied as a bioactive moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and personal&#8208;care products. It is produced on an industrial scale by exploiting the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of a sucrose phosphorylase, but the enzyme currently used suffers from poor thermostability. A homologous sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable was engineered to drastically improve its catalytic performance for the synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol, enabling the production of this compound at elevated temperatures. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Desmet et&#8197;al.

         <title>Recent Advances in Late&#8208;Stage Construction of Stapled Peptides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2762-2771, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation stapling strategies of peptides catalyzed by transition metals, such as palladium, rhodium, and manganese, are discussed. These strategies which rely on directing groups (DGs) in the reaction can be classified into three categories: (1)&#8197;directly constructing stapled peptides without DGs; (2)&#8197;those using peptide backbones as DGs; (3)&#8197;those that install additional DGs to generate stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides have been widely applied in many fields, including pharmaceutical chemistry, diagnostic reagents, and materials science. However, most traditional stapled peptide preparation methods rely on prefunctionalizations, which limit the diversity of stapled peptides. Recently, the emergence of late&#8208;stage transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation in amino acids and peptides has attracted wide interest due to its robustness and applicability for peptide stapling. In this review, we summarize the methods for late&#8208;stage construction of stapled peptides via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Inhibitors of CA IX Enzyme Based on Polyhedral Boron Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2741-2761, September 14, 2021. </description>

The review covers several classes of inhibitors specific for carbonic anhydrase IX enzyme that emerged recently from a non&#8208;traditional concept. This is characterized by combination of space&#8208;filing inorganic (metalla)carborane cluster with sulfamide and sulfonamide binding motif for Zn2+ in the active site. The structural factors essential for attaining high activity and selectivity for the CA IX isoform are discussed. Results from preclinical studies show relevance of these compounds for development of anticancer drugs.







Abstract
This review describes recent progress in the design and development of inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) based on space&#8208;filling carborane and cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters. CA IX enzyme is known to play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and metastases. The new class of potent and selective CA IX inhibitors combines the structural motif of a bulky inorganic cluster with an alkylsulfamido or alkylsulfonamido anchor group for Zn2+ ion in the enzyme active site. Detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of a large series containing 50 compounds uncovered structural features of the cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors that are important for efficient and selective inhibition of CA IX activity. Preclinical evaluation of selected compounds revealed low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics and ability to reduce tumor growth. Cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors of CA IX can thus be considered as promising candidates for drug development and/or for combination therapy in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).

         <title>Comparisons of &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Propensity Among Peptides with Homochiral or Heterochiral Strands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 18, Page 2772-2776, September 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As predicted by Pauling and Corey, pairing of homochiral (all&#8208;L) peptide strands leads to pleated &#946;&#8208;sheets, while pairing of L and D strands leads to rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets. Our evidence indicates that heterochiral strand pairing in aqueous solution is less favorable than homochiral strand pairing.







Abstract
Assemblies of racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides have attracted attention for biomedical applications because racemic forms of peptides can self&#8208;associate more avidly than do single enantiomers. In 1953, Pauling and Corey proposed &#8220;rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; modes of H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated interstrand assembly for alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;peptide strands; this structural hypothesis was complementary to their proposal of &#8220;pleated &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; assembly for L&#8208;peptides. Although no high&#8208;resolution structure has been reported for a rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet, there is strong evidence for the occurrence of rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets in some racemic peptide assemblies. Here we compare propensities of peptide diastereomers in aqueous solution to form a minimum increment of &#946;&#8208;sheet in which two antiparallel strands associate. &#946;&#8208;Hairpin folding is observed for homochiral peptides with aligned nonpolar side chains, but no &#946;&#8208;hairpin population can be detected for diastereomers in which one strand contains L residues and the other contains D residues. These observations suggest that rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are stabilized by interactions between &#946;&#8208;sheet layers rather than interactions within these layers.

         <title>Complete chemical synthesis of long DNA transcriptable in human cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical ligation reaction of DNA is useful for the construction of long functional DNA using oligonucleotide fragments that are prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis. However, the unnatural linkage structure formed by ligation reaction generally impairs the biological function of the resulting ligated DNA. We achieved the complete chemical synthesis of 78 and 258 bp synthetic DNAs via multiple chemical ligation reactions with phosphorothioate and haloacyl&#8208;modified DNA fragments. The latter synthetic DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a designed truncated SV promoter sequence, did successfully induce the expected gene silencing effect in HeLa cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs allows efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The method will make existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies to probe and manipulate proteins in live cells accessible in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models.







Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized studies on human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac&#8208;mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to an amber stop codon. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA&#8208;bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site&#8208;directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC&#8208;derived cell types and complex tissue models.

         <title>Xylose&#8208;Configured Cyclophellitols as Selective Inhibitors for Glucocerebrosidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New selective GBA inhibitor: We show that the &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylose configured epoxide and aziridine are potent selective inhibitors towards GBA in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and their selectivity and inhibitory effect towards GBA are superior to the widely used GBA inhibitor Conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE).







Abstract
Glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidase, has recently been shown to hydrolyze &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides and to transxylosylate cholesterol. Genetic defects in GBA cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD), and also constitute a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. GBA and other retaining glycosidases can be selectively visualized by activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) using fluorescent probes composed of a cyclophellitol scaffold having a configuration tailored to the targeted glycosidase family. GBA processes &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides in addition to &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosides, this in contrast to the other two mammalian cellular retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidases, GBA2 and GBA3. Here we show that the xylopyranose preference also holds up for covalent inhibitors: xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridines selectively react with GBA over GBA2 and GBA3 in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and that the xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol is more potent and more selective for GBA than the classical GBA inhibitor, conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE). Both xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridine cause accumulation of glucosylsphingosine in zebrafish embryo, a characteristic hallmark of GD, and we conclude that these compounds are well suited for creating such chemically induced GD models.

         <title>S&#8208;Denitrosylase&#8208;Like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Conjugated with Xaa&#8208;His Dipeptide: Role of Proline Spacer as a Key Activity Booster</title>

         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine conjugated with Pro&#8208;His dipeptide, a novel S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic, effectively promoted the cysteinyl S&#8208;denitrosylation and prevented protein misfolding caused by the S&#8208;nitrosylation. Structural analyses of the compound suggested that the diselenol form, which is produced as a key reactive species during the catalytic reaction, is thermodynamically stabilized by forming a &#947;&#8208;turn, dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity.







Abstract
This study developed dipeptide&#8208;conjugated 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine (1), i.&#8201;e., 1&#8208;Xaa&#8208;His, as a new class of S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic. The synthesized compounds, especially 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His, remarkably promoted S&#8208;denitrosylation of nitrosothiols (RSNO) via a catalytic cycle involving the reversible redox reaction between the diselenide and its corresponding diselenol ([SeH,SeH]) form with coexisting reductant thiols (R&#8242;SH), during which the [SeH,SeH] form as a key reactive species reduces RSNO to the corresponding thiol (RSH). Structural analyses of 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His suggested that the peptide backbone of [SeH,SeH] is rigidly bent to form a &#947;&#8208;turn, possibly including an NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se hydrogen bond between the imidazole ring of His and selenol group, thus stabilizing the [SeH,SeH] form thermodynamically, and dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the synthetic compounds were found to prohibit S&#8208;nitrosylation&#8208;induced protein misfolding in the presence of RSNO, eventually implying their potential as a drug seed for misfolding diseases caused by the dysregulation of the S&#8208;denitrosylation system.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Enzymology for Diagnostics: Profiling Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule enzymology can be used to profile heterogeneous enzyme activity in clinical samples. A diluted sample is mixed with a substrate, and the mixture is loaded to a microwell array. The change in fluorescence over time in wells containing an enzyme is used to quantify the enzyme activity, resulting in a distinct fingerprint for the target enzyme. This fingerprint is used for the quantification of multiple enzyme isotypes in the sample.







Abstract
Enzymes can be used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, profiling enzyme activity in clinical samples is challenging due to the heterogeneity in enzyme activity, and the low abundance of the target enzyme in biofluids. Single&#8208;molecule methods can overcome these challenges by providing information on the distribution of enzyme activities in a sample. Here, we describe the concept of using the single&#8208;molecule enzymology (SME) method to analyze enzymatic activity in clinical samples. We present recent work focused on measuring alkaline phosphatase isotypes in serum samples using SME. Future work will involve improving and simplifying this technology, and applying it to other enzymes for diagnostics.

         <title>Identification of the Catalytic Residues in the Cyclase Domain of the Class IV Lanthipeptide Synthetase SgbL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL were identified and validated in this study. It was demonstrated how each of these residues is crucial for the formation of the methyllanthionine &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks from Cys thiols and dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine residues in the modified globisporin precursor peptide SgbA(S20T).







Abstract
Lanthipeptides belong to the family of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and are subdivided into different classes based on their processing enzymes. The three&#8208;domain class IV lanthipeptide synthetases (LanL enzymes) consist of N&#8208;terminal lyase, central kinase, and C&#8208;terminal cyclase domains. While the catalytic residues of the kinase domains (mediating ATP&#8208;dependent Ser/Thr phosphorylations) and the lyase domains (carrying out subsequent phosphoserine/phosphothreonine (pSer/pThr) eliminations to yield dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine (Dha/Dhb) residues) have been characterized previously, such studies are missing for LanL cyclase domains. To close this gap of knowledge, this study reports on the identification and validation of the catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL, which facilitate the nucleophilic attacks by Cys thiols on Dha/Dhb residues for the formation of &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks.

         <title>Potent Tau Aggregation Inhibitor D&#8208;Peptides Selected against Tau&#8208;Repeat 2 Using Mirror Image Phage Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. We employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify Tau binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides prevent the formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich Tau fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. They might be interesting for AD therapy.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Therefore, inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. Two hexapeptides within Tau, designated PHF6* (275&#8208;VQIINK&#8208;280) and PHF6 (306&#8208;VQIVYK&#8208;311), are known to promote Tau aggregation. Recently, the PHF6* segment has been described as the more potent driver of Tau aggregation. We therefore employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptide MMD3 and its retro&#8208;inverso form, designated MMD3rev, inhibited in&#8197;vitro fibrillization of the PHF6* peptide, the repeat domain of Tau as well as full&#8208;length Tau. Dynamic light scattering, pelleting assays and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that MMD3 prevents the formation of tau &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. NMR data suggest that the D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides bound to Tau monomers with rather low affinity, but ELISA (enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) data demonstrated binding to PHF6* and full length Tau fibrils. In addition, molecular insight into the binding mode of MMD3 to PHF6* fibrils were gained by in silico modelling. The identified PHF6*&#8208;targeting peptides were able to penetrate cells. The study establishes PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids as potential molecules for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in AD research.

         <title>Exosomes as Targeted Delivery Platform of CRISPR/Cas9 for Therapeutic Genome Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Granting CRISPR/Cas9 molecules a protecting shield and a guiding &#8220;GPS&#8221;, engineered exosomes enable genome editing selectively in targeted cells or tissues. These natural vehicles also encompass rich functional molecules which their synthetic counterparts do not have, making them an appealing tool for both basic research and translational medicine.







Abstract
Therapeutic genome editing harnesses the power of genome editing tools to correct erroneous genes associated with disease pathology. To bring the CRISPR/Cas9 tool from the bench to the bedside, a critical hurdle is the safe and efficient delivery of this nucleic acid tool to the desired type of cells in patients. This review discusses the use of natural carriers, extracellular vesicles (EVs), in particular exosomes, to fill the gap. Exosomes are lipid&#8208;containing nanovesicle released by various types of cells to mediate cell&#8208;cell communications. Their inherent long&#8208;distance transportation capability, biocompatibility, and engineerability have made EVs potential vehicles for delivering therapeutic drugs. We summarize the recent progress of harnessing exosomes as delivery vehicles for the CRISPR/Cas system to achieve therapeutic gene editing for disease treatment, with a focus on various strategies to achieve selective delivery to a particular type of cell and efficient packaging of the genome editing tools in the vesicles. Critical issues and possible solutions in the design and engineering of the targeting vehicles are highlighted. Taken together, we demonstrate EV/exosome&#8208;mediated packaging of the nucleic acid/protein tools and the cell/tissue&#8208;targeted delivery to be a viable way towards the clinical translation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

         <title>Development of Tyrphostin Analogues to Study Inhibition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pup Proteasome System**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like (pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development. In this study a screen was performed identifying Tyrphostins as low micromolar inhibitors of the Mtb protease Dop. To gain insight in the important functional aspects of these inhibitors, 25 new analogues were prepared and validated, in&#8197;vitro. Several new compounds were able to inhibit both the depupylating activity of Dop as well as the pupylating activity of de pup ligase PafA.







Abstract
Tuberculosis is a global health problem caused by infection with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacteria. Although antibiotic treatment has dramatically reduced the impact of tuberculosis on the population, the existence and spreading of drug resistant strains urgently demands the development of new drugs that target Mtb in a different manner than currently used antibiotics. The prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (Pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development as it is unique to Mtb and related bacterial genera. Using a Pup&#8208;based fluorogenic substrate, we screened for inhibitors of Dop, the Mtb depupylating protease, and identified I&#8208;OMe&#8208;Tyrphostin AG538 (1) and Tyrphostin AG538 (2). The hits were validated and determined to be fast&#8208;reversible, non&#8208;ATP competitive inhibitors. We synthesized &gt;25 analogs of 1 and 2 and show that several of the synthesized compounds also inhibit the depupylation actions of Dop on native substrate, FabD&#8208;Pup. Importantly, the pupylation activity of PafA, the sole Pup ligase in Mtb, was also inhibited by some of these compounds.

         <title>Chimeric Flaviviral RNA&#8722;siRNA Molecules Resist Degradation by The Exoribonuclease Xrn1 and Trigger Gene Silencing in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules comprising an Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA motif (xrRNA) and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex were engineered. The molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in mammalian cells. This work sets the stage for further investigations into using xrRNA motifs as building blocks in RNA&#8208;based nanotechnology.







Abstract
RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery, but the susceptibility of RNA to nuclease degradation remains a major barrier to its implementation in&#8197;vivo. Here, we engineered flaviviral Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA (xrRNA) motifs to host small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. The xrRNA&#8208;siRNA molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in 293T cells. The resistance of the molecules to Xrn1 does not translate to stability in blood serum. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that flavivirus&#8208;derived xrRNA motifs can confer Xrn1 resistance on a model therapeutic payload and set the stage for further investigations into using the motifs as building blocks in RNA nanotechnology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chimeric molecules&lt;/b&gt; comprising an Xrn1-resistant RNA motif (xrRNA) and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex were engineered. The molecules self-assemble &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in mammalian cells.

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP): A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate (DAP) is a dinitrogenous derivative of orthophosphate with demonstrated prebiotic phosphorylation capabilities in aqueous medium. The ability of DAP to facilitate phosphorylation&#8208;mediated transformation of a range of abiotic and biotic molecules warrants a deeper scrutiny of: (a)&#8197;its plausible geochemical provenance on the early Earth, (b)&#8197;its prospects for synthetic and bioorganic chemistry applications, and (c)&#8197;its potential role in transforming various classes of molecules leading to systems with emergent properties capable of exhibiting life&#8208;like behavior (synthetic biology). The graphic was designed by Dr. Eddy&#8197;I. Jim&#233;nez (Scripps Research). More information can be found in the Review by A. Osumah and R. Krishnamurthy.

         <title>X&#8208;rays Actuate Anticancer Drugs: Opening New Vistas in Prodrug Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prodrug approach has emerged as a promising strategy for alleviating important limitations of small&#8208;molecule blockbuster chemotherapeutic drugs. Efficient and precise activation of a prodrug is the key for achieving the full potential of this strategy. Herein, we highlight the potential of X&#8208;rays for activating a prodrug locally in deep&#8208;seated tumors and point out its advantage over other activation triggers such as light.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality employed in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. Despite proven clinical success, adverse side effects are one of the drawbacks of this approach. The prodrug strategy has emerged as an alternative approach with the aim of alleviating these drawbacks. Prodrug activation is typically achieved by either endogenous or exogenous triggers. Exogenous triggers like light are appealing as they are independent of inherent patient and/or cancer&#8208;type variations. However, tissue penetration depth remains the Achilles&#8217; heel of this approach. In this context, usage of X&#8208;rays as the external trigger with infinite tissue penetration depth opens up exciting prospects in prodrug activation strategies.

         <title>Differential Effect of Azetidine Substitution in Firefly Luciferin Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assemble the puzzle: Replacing the N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in classical fluorophores with a four membered azetidine ring provides improved quantum yields. This strategy was extended to four types of bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and its differential effect was evaluated. Among them, the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from azetidine substitution and showed improvements of in fluorescence and bioluminescence emission.







Abstract
Replacing an N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in a classical fluorophore with a four membered azetidine ring provides an improved luminescence quantum yield. Herein, we extended this strategy to bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and evaluated its general validity. For this purpose, four types of luciferin cores were employed, and a total of eight analogues were evaluated. Among these analogues, unexpectedly, only the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from an azetidine substitution and showed enhanced bioluminescence. In addition, fluorescence measurements revealed that an azetidine substitution improved the fluorescence quantum yield by 2.3&#8208;times compared to a N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group. These findings clarify the differential effects of azetidine substituents in luciferins and present one possible strategy for enhancing photon output in benzothiazole type luciferins through a synthetic approach.

         <dc:description>
Oxygen is a central player in most aspects of life &#8211; without it, many life&#8208;giving processes will drag to a halt. Remarkably, some cell death mechanisms also require the presence of oxygen. In their study, Cordon et&#8197;al. show how oxygen&#8208;deprivation impedes the execution of ferroptosis in cancer cells. Ferroptosis is an oxidative cell death process that ultimately leads to oxidation and destruction of lipid membranes. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of oxygen when developing anticancer treatments. The graphic was created with assistance from Lise Balsby and Astrid Friis Reitzel (Aarhus University). More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;B. Poulsen et&#8197;al.

         <title>Surface Density of Ligands Controls In&#8208;Plane and Aggregative Modes of Multivalent Glycovesicle&#8208;Lectin Recognitions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of inter&#8208; and intracellular carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions that determine an inhibitory or productive biological function was investigated using glycovesicles as a synthetic membrane system. The ligand densities hold the key to the interactions occurring through either intramolecular or aggregative modes of binding. Nanomolar binding affinities govern these modes, within which the in&#8208;plane mode is more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.







Abstract
Glycovesicles are ideal tools to delineate finer mechanisms of the interactions at the biological cell membranes. Multivalency forms the basis which, in turn, should surpass more than one mechanism in order to maintain multiple roles that the ligand&#8208;lectin interactions encounter. Ligand densities hold a prime control to attenuate the interactions. In the present study, mannose trisaccharide interacting with a cognate receptor, namely, Con A, is assessed at the vesicle surface. Synthetic (1&#8594;3)(1&#8594;6)&#8208;branched mannose trisaccharides tethered with a diacetylene monomer and glycovesicles of varying sugar densities were prepared. The polydiacetylene vesicles were prepared by maintaining uniform lipid concentrations. The interactions of the glycovesicles with the lectin were probed through dynamic light scattering and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy techniques. Binding efficacies were assessed by surface plasmon resonance. Aggregative and in&#8208;plane modes of interactions show ligand&#8208;density dependence at the vesicle surface. Vesicles with sparsely populated ligands engage lectin in an aggregative mode (trans&#8208;), leading to a cross&#8208;linked complex formation. Whereas glycovesicles embedded with dense ligands engage lectin interaction in an in&#8208;plane mode intramolecularly (cis&#8208;). Sub&#8208;nanomolar dissociation constants govern the intramolecular interaction occurring within the plane of the vesicle, and are more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.

Sub-nanomolar dissociation constants govern the intramolecular interaction occurring within the plane of the vesicle, and are more efficacious than the aggregative intermolecular interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoactivation of Innate Immunity Receptor TLR8 in Live Mammalian Cells by Genetic Encoding of Photocaged Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;controllable TLR8 system was developed by site&#8208;specific genetic encoding of photocaged tyrosine to ensure spatiotemporal control of receptor function. The activity of TLR8 is masked in caged forms but can be restored upon decaging by exposure to UV light, making it a suitable tool for TLR8 function and regulatory mechanism studies.







Abstract
The effectiveness of innate immune responses relies on an intricate balance between activation and regulation. TLR8, a member of the Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) family, plays a fundamental role in host defense by sensing viral single&#8208;stranded RNAs (ssRNAs). However, the molecular recognition and regulatory mechanism of TLR8 is not fully understood, especially in a whole&#8208;cell environment. Here, we engineer the first light&#8208;controllable TLR8 model by genetically encoding a photocaged tyrosine, NBY, into specific sites of TLR8. In the caged forms, the activity of TLR8 is masked but can be restored upon decaging by exposure to UV light. To explain the mechanism clearly, we divide the sites with light responsiveness into three groups. They can separately block the ligands that bind to the pockets of TLR8, change the interaction modes between two TLR8 protomers, and interfere with the interactions between TLR8 cytosolic domains with its downstream adaptor. Specifically, we use this chemical caging strategy to probe and evaluate the function of several tyrosine sites located at the interface of TLR8 homodimers with a previously unknown regulatory mode, which may provide a new strategy for TLR8 modulator development. Effects on downstream signaling pathways are monitored at the transcriptional and translational levels in various cell lines. By photoactivating specific cells within a larger population, this powerful tool can provide novel mechanistic insights, with potential in biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>When Supramolecular Chemistry Meets Chemical Biology: New Strategies to Target Proteins through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein targeting through host&#8208;guest recognition is an exciting area but is limited by the lack of specific recognition element on protein. Chemical biology methods for site&#8208;specific protein modification provide powerful tools for introducing guest molecules into proteins and will greatly expand the scope of protein targeting using supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins is of great interest for the development of novel approaches to recognize, isolate and control proteins. Taking advantage of chemical biology approaches, such as genetic&#8208;code expansion and enzyme&#8208;mediated ligation, guest recognition elements can be built into proteins of interest, allowing supramolecular control of protein function and regulation. In this viewpoint article, we will discuss the methods, applications, limitations, and future perspectives of supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins in a site&#8208;specific manner.

         <title>Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy Enables to Quantify the Affinity Between DNA and Proteins in Cell Lysate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research targets on the quantitative determination of protein&#8208;to&#8208;ligand binding in complex cellular environments. Fluorine protein labelling has been utilized enabling to analyze signal height, line width and chemical shift upon DNA binding in great detail employing high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and simulations. This approach can be easily applied to studies generally interested in interaction processes taking place in cellular environments.







Abstract
The determination of the binding affinity quantifying the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is of crucial interest in biological and chemical research. Here, we have made use of site&#8208;specific fluorine labeling of the cold shock protein from Bacillus subtilis, BsCspB, enabling to directly monitor the interaction with single stranded DNA molecules in cell lysate. High&#8208;resolution 19F NMR spectroscopy has been applied to exclusively report on resonance signals arising from the protein under study. We have found that this experimental approach advances the reliable determination of the binding affinity between single stranded DNA molecules and its target protein in this complex biological environment by intertwining analyses based on NMR chemical shifts, signal heights, line shapes and simulations. We propose that the developed experimental platform offers a potent approach for the identification of binding affinities characterizing intermolecular interactions in native surroundings covering the nano&#8208;to&#8208;micromolar range that can be even expanded to in cell applications in future studies.

         <title>Construction of Synthetic Nanobody Library in Mammalian Cells by dsDNA&#8208;Based Strategies**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells: Two novel methods for the construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells, called dsDNA&#8208;HR and in&#8197;vitro ligation, were developed. Both methods generated over a million unique nanobody sequences as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing.







Abstract
A nanobody is an antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antigen&#8208;binding domain. Mammalian cells are ideal platforms for identifying nanobodies targeting hard&#8208;to&#8208;display transmembrane proteins and nanobodies that function as modulators of cellular phenotypes. However, the introduction of a high&#8208;diversity nanobody library into mammalian cells is challenging. We have developed two novel methods for constructing a nanobody library in mammalian cells. Complementarity&#8208;determining region (CDR) random sequences were first incorporated into upstream and downstream dsDNAs by PCR. In the first method, named dsDNA&#8208;HR, upstream and downstream dsDNAs containing an identical overlapping sequence were co&#8208;transfected into cultured mammalian cells for intracellular homologous recombination that resulted in the formation of an intact nanobody library expression cassette. In the second method, named in&#8197;vitro ligation, we generated full&#8208;length nanobody expression dsDNAs via ligation of restriction digested upstream and downstream dsDNAs. The obtained full&#8208;length dsDNAs were transfected into mammalian cells for nanobody library expression. Using both methods, we generated over a million unique nanobody sequences, as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Single&#8208;cell sequencing was employed to resolve the diversity of the dsDNA&#8208;HR nanobody library. We also identified a small molecule, Nocodazole, which could enhance the efficacy of dsDNA&#8208;HR.

         <title>NAD(H)&#8208;PEG Swing Arms Improve Both the Activities and Stabilities of Modularly&#8208;Assembled Transhydrogenases Designed with Predictable Selectivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using synthetic PEG&#8208;NAD(H) cofactor swing arms, we demonstrate the modular assembly of dehydrogenases to produce a series of novel, self&#8208;contained synthetic transhydrogenases. We also show that the stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites.







Abstract
Protein engineering has been used to enhance the activities, selectivities, and stabilities of enzymes. Frequently tradeoffs are observed, where improvements in some features can come at the expense of others. Nature uses modular assembly of active sites for complex, multi&#8208;step reactions, and natural &#8220;swing arm&#8221; mechanisms have evolved to transfer intermediates between active sites. Biomimetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) swing arms modified with NAD(H) have been explored to introduce synthetic swing arms into fused oxidoreductases. Here we report that increasing NAD(H)&#8208;PEG swing arms can improve the activity of synthetic formate:malate oxidoreductases as well as the thermal and operational stabilities of the biocatalysts. The modular assembly approach enables the KM values of new enzymes to be predictable, based on the parental enzymes. We describe four unique synthetic transhydrogenases that have no native homologs, and this platform could be easily extended for the predictive design of additional synthetic cofactor&#8208;independent transhydrogenases.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of 3&#8208;Sulfopropionaldehyde Reductase HpfD</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfoquinovose is a globally abundant organosulfur compound. Degradation by communities of anaerobic bacteria produce 3&#8208;hydroxypropanesulfonate, catalysed by sulfopropionaldehyde reductase HpfD. Biochemical investigation of HpfD revealed dehydrogenase activity for a range of alcohols, including 3&#8208;hydroxypropanesulfonate, 4&#8208;hydroxybutanesulfonate and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. Bioinformatics investigations suggest involvement of HpfD homologs in 3&#8208;HPS and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyrate degradation.







Abstract
Sulfoquinovose is the polar headgroup of plant sulfolipids and is a globally abundant organosulfur compound, and its degradation by bacteria is an important component of the sulfur cycle. Sulfoquinovose degradation by certain bacteria, including Escherichia coli, produces dihydroxypropanesulfonate (DHPS), which is further converted by anaerobic bacteria into 3&#8208;hydroxypropanesulfonate (3&#8208;HPS), through the catalytic action of DHPS dehydratase (a member of the glycyl radical enzyme family), and sulfopropionaldehyde reductase HpfD (a member of the metal&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family). Here we report biochemical investigation of Hungatella hathewayi HpfD. In addition to 3&#8208;HPS, HpfD also displayed high catalytic activities for NAD+&#8208;dependent oxidation of 4&#8208;hydroxybutanesulfonate (4&#8208;HBS) and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The highest activity was obtained with Fe2+ or Mn2+ as the divalent metal cofactor. Bioinformatics studies suggest that, in addition to DHPS degradation, 3&#8208;HPS and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyrate (GABA) degradations also involve HpfD homologs.

         <title>Kinetic Studies of Acetyl Group Migration between the Saccharide Units in an Oligomannoside Trisaccharide Model Compound and a Native Galactoglucomannan Polysaccharide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic calculations on the migration between saccharide units in a mannan trisaccharide model compounds and a galactoglucomannan polysaccharide were performed. Potential interactions of the model compounds with a lectin were also investigated.







Abstract
Acyl group migration is a fundamental phenomenon in carbohydrate chemistry, recently shown to take place also between two non&#8208;adjacent hydroxyl groups, across the glycosidic bond, in a &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked mannan trisaccharide model compound. With the central mannoside unit containing acetyl groups at the O2 and O3 positions, the O2&#8208;acetyl was in the earlier study shown to migrate to O6 of the reducing end. Potential implications of the general acyl migration process on cell signaling events and plant growth in nature are intriguing open questions. In the present work, migration kinetics in this original trisaccharide model system were studied in more detail together with potential interactions of the model compound and the migration products with DC&#8208;SIGN lectin. Furthermore, we demonstrate here for the first time that similar migration may also take place in native polysaccharides, here represented by galactoglucomannan from Norway spruce.

Functional protein nanotechnology: The cover feature illustrates the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of redox&#8208;sensitive artificial proteins. The disulfide functionality is placed strategically in between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of the artificial protein. The hydrophobic domain drives the self&#8208;assembly of artificial proteins to form monodisperse protein nanoparticles. Treatment of protein nanoparticles with dithiothreitol (DTT) results in cleavage of disulfide bonds and subsequent disassembly of protein nanoparticles due to cleavage of the hydrophobic domain.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;PAINT Enables Investigation of Endogenous Talin with Molecular Scale Resolution in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new single&#8208;molecule microscopy technique allows the analysis of a central cell adhesion protein with molecular resolution in cells. Using a direct peptide&#8208;PAINT approach, endogenously expressed talin molecules can be detected and quantified, enabling nanoscale analysis even in genetically unmodified cells and tissue sections. The image illustrates raw data from individual talin localization signals (upper left) that are processed to identify distinct cell&#8208;adhesion clusters (lower right) and individual talin molecules (zoom&#8208;in, center).

         <title>Alpha Synuclein only Forms Fibrils In Vitro when Larger than its Critical Size of 70 Monomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical size for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to form a stable fibrils, which can then replicate by monomer addition and fragmentation, has been found to be 70 monomers. Preventing aggregates from reaching this critical size would be a key cellular protective mechanism.







Abstract
The aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into small soluble aggregates and then fibrils is important in the development and spreading of aggregates through the brain in Parkinson's disease. Fibrillar aggregates can grow by monomer addition and then break into fragments that could spread into neighboring cells. The rate constants for fibril elongation and fragmentation have been measured but it is not known how large an aggregate needs to be before fibril formation is thermodynamically favorable. This critical size is an important parameter controlling at what stage in an aggregation reaction fibrils can form and replicate. We determined this value to be approximately 70 monomers using super&#8208;resolution and atomic force microscopy imaging of individual &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates formed in solution over long time periods. This represents the minimum size for a stable &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril and we hypothesis the formation of aggregates of this size in a cell represents a tipping point at which rapid replication occurs.

This critical size is an important parameter controlling at what stage in an aggregation reaction fibrils can form and replicate. We determined this value to be approximately 70 monomers using super-resolution and atomic force microscopy imaging of individual &#945;-synuclein aggregates formed in solution over long time periods. This represents the minimum size for a stable &#945;-synuclein fibril and we hypothesis the formation of aggregates of this size in a cell represents a tipping point at which rapid replication occurs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Advanced &#8216;clickECM&#8217; That Can be Modified by the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic glycoengineering was employed to incorporate dienophiles (terminal alkenes and a cyclopropene) into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ASCs). A subsequent inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction allowed the equipment of the ECM with bioactive molecules, opening numerous applications.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the natural environment of cells in tissue and therefore is a promising biomaterial in a variety of applications. Depending on the purpose, it is necessary to equip the ECM with specific addressable functional groups for further modification with bioactive molecules, for controllable cross&#8208;linking and/or covalent binding to surfaces. Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) enables the specific modification of the ECM with such functional groups without affecting the native structure of the ECM. In a previous approach (S.&#8197;M. Ruff, S. Keller, D.&#8197;E. Wieland, V. Wittmann, G.&#8197;E.&#8197;M. Tovar, M. Bach, P.&#8197;J. Kluger, Acta Biomater. 2017, 52, 159&#8211;170), we demonstrated the modification of an ECM with azido groups, which can be addressed by bioorthogonal copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Here, we demonstrate the modification of an ECM with dienophiles (terminal alkenes, cyclopropene), which can be addressed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. This reaction is cell friendly as there are no cytotoxic catalysts needed. We show the equipment of the ECM with a bioactive molecule (enzyme) and prove that the functional groups do not influence cellular behavior. Thus, this new material has great potential for use as a biomaterial, which can be individually modified in a wide range of applications.

         <title>Building siRNAs with Cubes: Synthesis and Evaluation of Cubane&#8208;Modified siRNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
siRNA lego: Cubane&#8208;functionalized siRNAs lead to potent RNAi&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;silencing activity, and improved strand selection.







Abstract
Cubane molecules hold great potential for medicinal chemistry applications due to their inherent stability and low toxicity. In this study, we report the synthesis of a cubane derivative phosphoramidite for the incorporation of cubane into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Synthetic siRNAs rely on chemical modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profiles. However, they are still able to mediate sequence&#8208;specific gene silencing via the endogenous RNA interference pathway. We designed a library of siRNAs bearing cubane at different positions within the sense and antisense strands. All siRNAs showed excellent gene&#8208;silencing activity, with IC50 values ranging from 45.4 to 305&#8197;pM. Incorporating the cubane modification in both the sense and antisense strand led to viable duplexes with good biological activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of siRNAs bearing a cubane derivative within the backbone.

Functional protein nanotechnology: We have combined in&#8208;house developed micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology with N&#8208;terminal protein bioconjugation to synthesize diverse protein nanoparticles with advanced functions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric protease to form a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex &#8220;proteasome&#8221; enables targeted protein degradation in living cells. Naturally occurring proteasomes serve as an inspiration and blueprint for the design of artificial protein&#8208;based nanoreactors. Here we disclose a general chemical strategy for the design of proteasome&#8208;like nanoreactors. Micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling (MAPLab) technology along with the N&#8208;terminal bioconjugation strategy is utilized for the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined monodisperse self&#8208;assembling semi&#8208;synthetic protease. The designed protein is programmed to self&#8208;assemble into a proteasome&#8208;like nanostructure which preserves the functional properties of native protease.

         <title>An Autophagy&#8208;Disrupting Small Molecule Promotes Cancer Cell Death via Caspase Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz), identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library, is reported. Autophazole is mainly internalized into lysosomes and disrupts their function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces LMP&#8208;mediated caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. We anticipate that Atz will be a useful chemical probe for elucidating details about the autophagic process and understanding the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I. Shin et&#8197;al.

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP): A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate (DAP), a di&#8208;nitrogenous analogue of orthophosphate, is a versatile phosphorylating&#8208;activating reagent and amine source in the context of aqueous prebiotic chemistry compatible with both prebiotic&#8208; and bio&#8208;molecules. The promising potential of this reagent, enabling a continuous transition from abiotic&#8208;to&#8208;biotic needs to be investigated both from its geochemical provenance and its applicability to (bio)organic transformations.







Abstract
Known since the 1890s, diamidophosphate (DAP) has been investigated within the context of its inorganic chemistry. In 1999 &#8211; with the demonstration of DAP's potential as a&#8197;phosphorylating agent of sugars in aqueous medium &#8211; began the exciting phase of research about DAP's role as a&#8197;plausible prebiotic phosphorylating agent. More recently, in the last five years, there has been a steady increase in the publications that have documented the surprising versatility of DAP enabling the emergence of many classes of biomolecules of life, such as nucleic acids, peptides and protocells. Thus, though in its infancy, DAP seems to be uniquely positioned to play a central role in modelling abiotic&#8208; to prebiotic&#8208;chemical evolution. In this context, there is a need for systematic investigations for: (a)&#8197;establishing DAP's likely availability on the early Earth, and (b)&#8197;developing DAP's potential as a tool for use in synthetic and bioorganic chemistry.

         <title>Probing the Role of Chirality in Phospholipid Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular handedness, or chirality, can determine the nature of molecular interactions. A key feature of life is the homochirality of biological molecules, including phospholipids. Chemical probes have been used to understand stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes, which has been applied to the development of safer therapeutics and selective chemical tools.







Abstract
Nucleotides, amino acids, sugars, and lipids are almost ubiquitously homochiral within individual cells on Earth. While oligonucleotides and proteins exist as one natural chirality throughout the tree of life, two stereoisomers of phospholipids have separately emerged in archaea and bacteria, an evolutionary divergence known as &#8220;the lipid divide&#8221;. Within this review, we focus on the emergence of phospholipid homochirality and compare the stability of synthetic homochiral and heterochiral membranes in&#8197;vitro. We discuss chemical probes designed to study the stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes in&#8197;vitro. Overall, we aim to highlight studies that help elucidate the determinants of stereospecific interactions between lipids, peptides, and small molecule ligands. Continued work in understanding the drivers of favorable interactions between chiral molecules and biological membranes will lead to the design of increasingly selective chemical tools for bioorthogonal labeling of lipid membranes and safer membrane&#8208;associating pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Complex&#8208;Based G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Selective Luminescent &#8216;Light&#8208;up&#8217; Probe for RNase H Activity Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex&#8208;based, highly selective photoluminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; probe for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA has been developed and utilized for selective RNase H activity detection. The PL light&#8208;up is solely due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide sidearm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was supported by molecular docking analysis.







Abstract
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex, 1[PF6]2 of benzothiazole amide substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (bmbbipy) has been synthesized for the selective detection of G&#8208;quadruplex (GQ) DNA and luminescence&#8208;assay&#8208;based RNase H activity monitoring. Compound 1[PF6]2 exhibited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in water. Aggregate formation was supported by DLS, UV&#8208;vis, and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy results, and the morphology of aggregated particles was witnessed by SEM and TEM. 1[PF6]2 acted as an efficient GQ DNA&#8208;selective luminescent light&#8208;up probe over single&#8208;stranded and double&#8208;stranded DNA. The competency of 1[PF6]2 for selective GQ structure detection was established by PL and CD spectroscopy. For 1[PF6]2, the PL light&#8208;up is exclusively due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide side arm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was analyzed by molecular docking analysis. The GQ structure detection capability of 1[PF6]2 was further applied in the luminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; RNase H activity detection. The assay utilized an RNA:DNA hybrid, obtained from 22AG2&#8208;RNA and 22AG2&#8208;DNA sequences. RNase H solely hydrolyzed the RNA of the RNA:DNA duplex and released G&#8208;rich 22AG2&#8208;DNA, which was detected via the PL enhancement of 1[PF6]2. The selectivity of RNase H activity detection over various other restriction enzymes was also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
A chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates is reported. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain.







Abstract
The reversible nature of disulfide functionality has been exploited to design intelligent materials such as nanocapsules, micelles, vesicles, inorganic nanoparticles, peptide and nucleic acid nanodevices. Herein, we report a new chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The disulfide functionality is strategically placed between the dendron and protein domains. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the protein assemblies is demonstrated using a suitable redox trigger.

         <title>The Chemical Biology&#8208;Medicinal Chemistry Continuum: EFMC&#8242;s Vision</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scientific continuum? EFMC covers the field of chemical biology to medicinal chemistry. What are these disciplines, and how do they differentiate, if at all? This article discusses EFMC's current understanding of chemical biology, and its relation to medicinal chemistry, biology and biochemistry. Chemical biology includes many activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools, and their use to probe, characterize or influence biological systems.







Abstract
The European Federation for Medicinal chemistry and Chemical biology (EFMC) is a federation of learned societies. It groups organizations of European scientists working in a dynamic field spanning chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. New ideas, tools, and technologies emerging from a wide array of scientific disciplines continuously energize this rapidly evolving area. Medicinal chemistry is the design, synthesis, and optimization of biologically active molecules aimed at discovering new drug candidates &#8211; a mission that in many ways overlaps with the scope of chemical biology. Chemical biology is by now a mature field of science for which a more precise definition of what it encompasses, in the frame of EFMC, is timely. This article discusses chemical biology as currently understood by EFMC, including all activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools and their use to probe, characterize, or influence biological systems.

         <title>Enzymatic Assays to Explore Viral mRNA Capping Machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To escape recognition by the host innate immune system, viruses often incorporate 5&#8242; caps into their mRNAs. The differences in mRNA capping make this process an interesting therapeutic target. Here, we review methods to explore the enzymes involved in cap biosynthesis. Such methods allow inhibitor selection, facilitating antiviral drug discovery, which is especially important considering the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks.







Abstract
In eukaryotes, mRNA is modified by the addition of the 7&#8208;methylguanosine (m7G) 5&#8242; cap to protect mRNA from premature degradation, thereby enhancing translation and enabling differentiation between self (endogenous) and non&#8208;self RNAs (e.&#8201;g., viral ones). Viruses often develop their own mRNA capping pathways to augment the expression of their proteins and escape host innate immune response. Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and facilitate drug discovery, e.&#8201;g., against viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks, such as beta&#8208;coronaviruses SARS&#8208;CoV (2002), MARS&#8208;CoV (2012), and the most recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, proper methods for the screening of large compound libraries are required to identify lead structures that could serve as a basis for rational antiviral drug design. This review summarizes the methods that allow the monitoring of the activity and inhibition of enzymes involved in mRNA capping.

&lt;p&gt;In eukaryotes, mRNA is modified by the addition of the 7-methylguanosine (m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;G) 5&#8242; cap to protect mRNA from premature degradation, thereby enhancing translation and enabling differentiation between self (endogenous) and non-self RNAs (e.&#8201;g., viral ones). Viruses often develop their own mRNA capping pathways to augment the expression of their proteins and escape host innate immune response. Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and facilitate drug discovery, e.&#8201;g., against viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks, such as beta-coronaviruses SARS-CoV (2002), MARS-CoV (2012), and the most recent SARS-CoV-2. Thus, proper methods for the screening of large compound libraries are required to identify lead structures that could serve as a basis for rational antiviral drug design. This review summarizes the methods that allow the monitoring of the activity and inhibition of enzymes involved in mRNA capping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;PAINT Enables Investigation of Endogenous Talin with Molecular Scale Resolution in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PIPKI&#947;&#8208;peptide&#8208;PAINT approach is introduced in this study to enable quantitative investigation of the cell adhesion protein talin with single&#8208;molecule resolution in cells. The technique does not require genetic modifications and allows the analysis of endogenously expressed molecules. The first application reveals atypical adhesion structures in differentiating mesenchymal stem cells.







Abstract
Talin is a cell adhesion molecule that is indispensable for the development and function of multicellular organisms. Despite its central role for many cell biological processes, suitable methods to investigate the nanoscale organization of talin in its native environment are missing. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining single&#8208;molecule resolved PAINT (points accumulation in nanoscale topography) imaging with the IRIS (image reconstruction by integrating exchangeable single&#8208;molecule localization) approach, enabling the quantitative analysis of genetically unmodified talin molecules in cells. We demonstrate that a previously reported peptide can be utilized to specifically label the two major talin isoforms expressed in mammalian tissues with a localization precision of &lt;10&#8197;nm. Our experiments show that the methodology performs equally well as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;molecule localization techniques, and the first applications reveal a thus far undescribed cell adhesion structure in differentiating stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this peptide&#8208;PAINT technique to mouse tissues paving the way to single&#8208;protein imaging of endogenous talin proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Imaging and Identification of Bacterial Toxins Causing Mushroom Soft Rot and Cavity Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of genome mining, metabolic profiling, and imaging techniques (MALDI and UV Raman spectroscopy) provided insight into the arsenal of antifungals produced by the mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola. Targeted gene knockouts and bioassays link these antifungals to prevalent symptoms of mushroom soft rot, browning, and impaired mycelium growth.







Abstract
Soft rot disease of edible mushrooms leads to rapid degeneration of fungal tissue and thus severely affects farming productivity worldwide. The bacterial mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola has been identified as the cause. Yet, little is known about the molecular basis of the infection, the spatial distribution and the biological role of antifungal agents and toxins involved in this infectious disease. We combine genome mining, metabolic profiling, MALDI&#8208;Imaging and UV Raman spectroscopy, to detect, identify and visualize a complex of chemical mediators and toxins produced by the pathogen during the infection process, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin, and sinapigladioside. Furthermore, targeted gene knockouts and in&#8197;vitro assays link antifungal agents to prevalent symptoms of soft rot, mushroom browning, and impaired mycelium growth. Comparisons of related pathogenic, mutualistic and environmental Burkholderia spp. indicate that the arsenal of antifungal agents may have paved the way for ancestral bacteria to colonize niches where frequent, antagonistic interactions with fungi occur. Our findings not only demonstrate the power of label&#8208;free, in&#8197;vivo detection of polyyne virulence factors by Raman imaging, but may also inspire new approaches to disease control.

         <title>Synthesis of KUE&#8208;siRNA Conjugates for Prostate Cancer Cell&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates were constructed based on propargyl&#8208;terminated siRNAs and lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE) ligands. These siRNA conjugates could selectively enter prostate cancer cells expressing prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to mediate the specific gene knockdown.







Abstract
The delivery of siRNAs to selectively target cells poses a great challenge in RNAi&#8208;based cancer therapy. The lack of suitable cell&#8208;targeting methods seriously restricts the advance in delivering siRNAs to extrahepatic tissues. Based on prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting ligands, we have synthesized a series of lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE)&#8208;siRNA conjugates and verified their effective cell uptake and gene silencing properties in prostate cancers. The results indicated that the KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates could selectively enter PSMA+ LNCaP cells, eventually down&#8208;regulating STAT3 expression. Based on post&#8208;synthesis modification and receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, this strategy of constructing ligand&#8208;siRNA conjugates might provide a general method of siRNA delivery for cell&#8208;targeted gene silencing.

         <title>Sphaeropsidin A: a Pimarane Diterpene with Interesting Biological Activities and Promising Practical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fungal pimarane diterpene sphaeropsidin A (SphA) has shown promising application in agriculture and medicine. This article reviews its biosynthetic origins, fungal sources, preparation of semisynthetic derivatives and biological activities as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies.







Abstract
Sphaeropsidin A (SphA) is a tetracyclic pimarane diterpene, first isolated as the main phytotoxin produced by Diplodia cupressi the causal agent of a severe canker disease of Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens&#8197;L.). It was also produced, together with several analogues, by different pathogenic Diplodia species and other fungi and showed a broad array of biological activities suggesting its promising application in agriculture and medicine. The anticancer activity of SphA is very potent and cell specific. Recent studies have revealed its unique mode of action. This minireview reports the structures of SphA and its family of natural analogues, their biosynthetic origins, their fungal sources, and biological activities. The preparation of various SphA derivatives is also described as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies and on their potential practical applications.

         <title>Recent Developments and Strategies for Mutually Orthogonal Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of mutually exclusive &#8216;orthogonal bioorthogonal&#8217; reaction pairs has received increasing attention over the past decade. This minireview discusses strategies that have been employed to achieve successful dual and triple ligation systems that display both good kinetics and minimal cross&#8208;reactivities. These tools have potential applications for the observation of simultaneous biological processes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Over the past decade, several different metal&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions have been developed to enable simultaneous double&#8208;click labeling with minimal&#8208;to&#8208;no competing cross&#8208;reactivities; such transformations are termed &#8216;mutually orthogonal&#8217;. More recently, several examples of successful triple ligation strategies have also been described. In this minireview, we discuss selected aspects of the development of orthogonal bioorthogonal reactions over the past decade, including general strategies to drive future innovations to achieve simultaneous, mutually orthogonal click reactions in one pot.

The cover picture provides an artistic impression of the green fluorescent protein, which is covalently linked to azobenzene. The linkage of the two molecules results in bright emission signals and improved photostability as seen by single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy. The cover artwork was provided by Gabriel Moya, a Ph.D. student in the Cordes laboratory at the LMU Biocenter (Munich, Germany). More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Cordes et&#8197;al.
