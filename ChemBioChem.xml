         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of the Unnatural Nucleotide 2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxyisoguanosine 5&#8242;&#8208;Monophosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring DNA contains four canonical bases, forming two Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs (adenine&#8208;thymine, guanine&#8208;cytosine). Efforts over the past decades have led to the development of several unnatural base pairs, enabling the synthesis of unnatural DNA with an expanded genetic alphabet. The engineering of organisms capable of  de novo  biosynthesis of unnatural DNA would have significant technological and philosophical implications, but remains a challenge. Here we report the enzymatic conversion of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (dXMP) into deoxyisoguanosine monophosphate (dBMP), a precursor of the unnatural isoguanine&#8208;isocytosine base pair. The reaction is catalyzed by the bacteriophage enzyme PurZ and bacterial PurB, and is a key addition to the toolbox for  de novo  biosynthesis of unnatural DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Antibody&#8208;Specific Epitope Prediction Using AlphaFold and AbAdapt
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of AlphaFold2 with AbAdapt (AbAdapt&#8208;AF) resulted in improved docking, paratope and epitope prediction compared with AbAdapt alone.







Abstract
Antibodies recognize their cognate antigens with high affinity and specificity, but the prediction of binding sites on the antigen (epitope) corresponding to a specific antibody remains a challenging problem. To address this problem, we developed AbAdapt, a pipeline that integrates antibody and antigen structural modeling with rigid docking in order to derive antibody&#8208;antigen specific features for epitope prediction. In this study, we systematically assessed the impact of integrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art protein modeling method AlphaFold with the AbAdapt pipeline. By incorporating more accurate antibody models, we observed improvement in docking, paratope prediction, and prediction of antibody&#8208;specific epitopes. We further applied AbAdapt&#8208;AF in an anti&#8208;receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody complex benchmark and found AbAdapt&#8208;AF outperformed three alternative docking methods. Also, AbAdapt&#8208;AF demonstrated higher epitope prediction accuracy than other tested epitope prediction tools in the anti&#8208;RBD antibody complex benchmark. We anticipate that AbAdapt&#8208;AF will facilitate prediction of antigen&#8208;antibody interactions in a wide range of applications.

Abstract
Pulmonary artery vascular endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the occurrence and progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling (PVR). To address this, aberrantly expressed non&#8208;coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are excellent therapeutic targets in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). Here, we discovered and validated the overexpression of miRNA&#8208;152 in HPAECs under hypoxia and its role in endothelial cell dysfunction. We constructed a framework nucleic acid nanostructure that harbors six protruding single&#8208;stranded DNA segments that can fully hybridize with miRNA&#8208;152 (DNT&#8208;152). DNT&#8208;152 was efficiently taken up by HPAECs with increasing time and concentration; it markedly induced apoptosis, and inhibited HPAEC growth under hypoxic conditions. Mechanistically, DNT&#8208;152 silenced miRNA&#8208;152 expression and upregulated its target gene Meox2, which subsequently inhibited the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. These results indicate that miRNA&#8208;152 in HPAECs may be an excellent therapeutic target against PVR, and that framework nucleic acids with carefully designed sequences are promising nanomedicines for noncancerous cells and diseases.

         <title>Initial recognition and attachment of the Zika virus to host cells: A molecular dynamics and quantum interaction approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted to humans from the bites of  Aedes Aegypti  and  Aedes Albopictus  mosquitoes produces Zika fever and neurodegenerative disorders that despite affecting millions of people, most recently in Africa and the Americas, has been declared a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. In this work, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations followed by rigorous analysis of the intermolecular interactions reveal crucial aspects of the initial virus&#183;&#183;&#183;cell molecular recognition and attachment, events that trigger the infectious cycle. Previous experimental studies have shown that Dermatan Sulphate (DS) and Chondroitin Sulphate A (CSA), two glycosaminoglycans which are actually epimers to each other and that are structural constituents of receptors expressed in cell membranes, are the preferred anchorage sites, with a marked preference for DS. Our calculations rationalize this preference from a molecular perspective as follows: when free of the virus, DS has one sulfate group that does not participate in intramolecular strong hydrogen bonds, thus, it is readily available to interact with the envelope protein of the virus (Zika&#8211;E), then, after formation of the complexes, Zika&#8211;E&#183;&#183;&#183;DS exhibits ten strong salt brides connecting the two fragments against only six salt bridges and two hydrogen bonds in Zika&#8211;E&#183;&#183;&#183;CSA.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitope fine mapping by mass spectrometry: Investigations of immune complexes consisting of monoclonal anti&#8208;HpTGEKP antibody and zinc finger protein linker phospho&#8208;hexapeptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate formation of antibody &#8211; antigen complexes has been relied on in both, multitudes of scientific projects and ample therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Mass spectrometrically&#8208;determined dissociation behavior of immune complexes with the antiHpTGEKP antibody revealed that the ten most frequently occur&#173;ring phospho&#8208;hexapeptide linker sequences from C2H2 zinc finger proteins could be divided into two classes: orthodox binders, where strong non&#8208;covalent interactions developed as anticipated, and unorthodox binders with deviating structures and weaker binding. Phosphorylation of threonine was compulsory for antibody binding in an orthodox manner. Gas phase dissociation energy determinations of seven C2H2 zinc finger protein linker phospho&#8208;hexapeptides with orthodox binding properties revealed a bipolar binding motif of the antibody&#180;s paratope. Epitope peptides, which in addition to the negatively charged phospho&#8208;threonin residue were C&#8208;terminally flanked by positively charged residues provided stronger binding, i.e. dissociation was endothermic, than peptides with acidic amino acid residues at these positions, for which dissociation was exothermic.</dc:description>

Viruslike&#160;particles and non&#8208;viral protein cages represent a potentially safer&#160;alternative but often lack desired functionality. Here, we investigated
the utility of a new enzymatic bioconjugation method, called lysine&#160;acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE), to chemoenzymatically&#160;modify protein cages. We equipped two structurally distinct protein&#160;capsules with a LACE&#8208;reactive peptide tag and demonstrated their&#160;modification with diverse ligands. This modular approach combines
the advantages of chemical conjugation and genetic fusion and allows&#160;for site&#8208;specific modification with recombinant proteins as well as&#160;synthetic peptides with facile control of the extent of labeling. This&#160;strategy has the potential to fine&#8208;tune protein containers of different&#160;shape and size, to provide them with new properties that go beyond
their biologically native functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Strategies of Enzyme Activity Regulation for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise enzyme activity regulation brings biocatalysis significantly closer to mimicking the physiological control mechanisms for treating diseases. This review provides a discussion and understanding of the mechanisms and approaches of on&#8208;demand enzyme activity control (including reversible and irreversible regulation) and prospective biomedical applications.







Abstract
Enzymes are important macromolecular biocatalysts that accelerate chemical and biochemical reactions in living organisms. Most human diseases are related to alterations in enzyme activity. Moreover, enzymes are potential therapeutic tools for treating different diseases, such as cancer, infections, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Precise remote enzyme activity regulation provides new opportunities to combat diseases. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of enzyme activity regulation, including reversible and irreversible regulation. It also discusses the mechanisms and approaches for on&#8208;demand control of these activities. Furthermore, a range of stimulus&#8208;responsive inhibitors, polymers, and nanoparticles for regulating enzyme activity and their prospective biomedical applications are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives on enzyme activity regulation are discussed.

         <dc:description>The design of novel AIEGens, has generally been facilitated by disrupting the possibility of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The recent literature describes a novel strategy to design AIEGens by introducing anion&#8722;&#960;  +  interactions to prevent the detrimental &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking. This new strategy provides access to intrinsically charged AIEgens whose photophysical properties can be tuned either by incorporating different substituents on the &#960;&#8208;molecular scaffold to modulate the acidity for tuning the interaction energy between a &#960;&#8208;acceptor and counter&#8208;anions.

         <title>Phosphoenolpyruvate mutase&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;P bond formation: mechanistic ambiguities and opportunities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonates are produced across all domains of life and used widely in medicine and agriculture. Biosynthesis almost universally originates from the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate mutase (Ppm), EC 5.4.2.9, which catalyzes O&#8208;P bond cleavage in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and forms a high energy C&#8208;P bond in phosphonopyruvate (PnPy). Mechanistic scrutiny of this unusual intramolecular O&#8208;to&#8208;C phosphoryl transfer began with the discovery of Ppm in 1988 and concluded in 2008 with computational evidence supporting a concerted phosphoryl transfer via a dissociative metaphosphatelike transition state. This mechanism deviates from the standard &#8216;in&#8208;line attack&#8217; paradigm for enzymatic phosphoryl transfer that typically involves a phosphoryl&#8208;enzyme intermediate, but definitive evidence is sparse. Here we review the experimental evidence leading to our current mechanistic understanding and highlight the roles of previously underappreciated conserved active site residues. We then identify remaining opportunities to evaluate overlooked residues and unexamined substrates/inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentachloropseudilin Treatment Impairs Host Cell Invasion by Trypanosoma cruzi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of host cell with Pentachloropseudilin (PClP) impaired Trypanosoma cruzi invasion, probably by decreasing lysosome migration to the entry site of the parasite. PClP impaired fundamental processes necessary for a successful T.&#8197;cruzi infection.







Abstract
Pentachloropseudilin (PClP) is a reversible and allosteric inhibitor of type&#8197;1 myosin. Here, we addressed the impact of PClP treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi and mammalian host cell on the parasite migration, cell adhesion and invasion. We observed that PClP was not toxic to either T.&#8197;cruzi or host cell. Moreover, treatment of T.&#8197;cruzi with PClP inhabited parasite motility, host cell adhesion and invasion. Treatment of host cell with PClP also impaired parasite invasion probably by decreasing lysosome migration to the entry site of the parasite. Therefore, PClP treatment impaired fundamental processes necessary for a successful T.&#8197;cruzi infection.

         <title>Synthesis of a Peptidoyl RNA Hairpin via a Combination of Solid&#8208;Phase and Template&#8208;Directed Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic access to peptidoyl RNA, where a peptide segment is doubly linked to RNA strands, is described. Peptidoyl RNAs are a fascinating species that may have played a role in the origin of translation.







Abstract
Peptidoyl RNAs are the products of ribosome&#8208;free, single&#8208;nucleotide translation. They contain a peptide in the backbone of the oligoribonucleotide and are interesting from a synthetic and a bioorganic point of view. A synthesis of a stabilized version of peptidoyl RNA, with an amide bond between the C&#8208;terminus of a peptide and a 3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;dideoxynucleoside in the RNA chain was developed. The preferred synthetic route used an N&#8208;Teoc&#8208;protected aminonucleoside support and involved a solution&#8208;phase coupling of the amino&#8208;terminal oligonucleotide to a dipeptido dinucleotide. Exploratory UV&#8208;melting and NMR analysis of the hairpin 5&#8242;&#8208;UUGGCGAAAGCdC&#8208;LeuLeu&#8208;AA&#8208;3&#8242; indicated that the peptide&#8208;linked RNA segments do not fold in a cooperative fashion.

     alt="Synthesis of a Peptidoyl RNA Hairpin via a Combination of Solid-Phase and Template-Directed Chain Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A synthetic access to peptidoyl RNA&lt;/b&gt;, where a peptide segment is doubly linked to RNA strands, is described. Peptidoyl RNAs are a fascinating species that may have played a role in the origin of translation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptidoyl RNAs are the products of ribosome-free, single-nucleotide translation. They contain a peptide in the backbone of the oligoribonucleotide and are interesting from a synthetic and a bioorganic point of view. A synthesis of a stabilized version of peptidoyl RNA, with an amide bond between the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminus of a peptide and a 3&#8242;-amino-2&#8242;,3&#8242;-dideoxynucleoside in the RNA chain was developed. The preferred synthetic route used an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Teoc-protected aminonucleoside support and involved a solution-phase coupling of the amino-terminal oligonucleotide to a dipeptido dinucleotide. Exploratory UV-melting and NMR analysis of the hairpin 5&#8242;-UUGGCGAAAGCdC-LeuLeu-AA-3&#8242; indicated that the peptide-linked RNA segments do not fold in a cooperative fashion. The synthetic access to doubly RNA-linked peptides on a scale sufficient for structural biology opens the door to the exploration of their structural and biochemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>FRET&#8208;based cathepsin probes for simultaneous detection of cathepsin B and D activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent cathepsin probes were prepared by modification of peptidic substrates for cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin D (CTSD) with FRET pairs. Fluorophores with distinguishable emission characteristics were applied to CTSB and CTSD probes with their appropriate quenchers to simultaneously monitor the activity of CTSB and/or CTSD. Conjugation of both the CTSB and CTSD probes with short single&#8208;stranded DNA drastically increased their reactivity to cathepsins over the parent probes possibly by improving their solubility. The activity of CTSB and CTSD were simultaneously detected by using these orthogonal FRET&#8208;based cathepsin probes.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Telomerase (TE), a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase, is enzymatically activated in most tumor cells and is responsible for promoting tumor progression and malignancy by enabling replicative immortality of cancer cells. TE has become an important hallmark for cancer diagnosis and a potential therapy target. Therefore, accurate and in site&#160;detection of TE activity, especially the simultaneous&#160;imaging of TE activity and its correlated biomolecules, is highly essential to medical diagnostics and therapeutics. DNA&#8208;based nanoprobes, with their effective cell penetration capability and programmability, are the most advantageous for detection of intracellular TE activity. This concept article introduces the recent strategies for in situ sensing and imaging of TE activity, with a focus on simultaneous detection of TE and related biomolecules, and provides challenges and perspectives for the development of new strategies for such correlated imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of an Asymmetric Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S Cluster as an Artificial Cofactor into Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenase employs a sophisticated electron transfer system and a Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C cofactor, designated the M&#8208;cluster [(cit)MoFe7  S9C]), to reduce atmospheric N2  to bioaccessible NH3. Previously, we have shown that the cofactor&#8208;free form of nitrogenase can be repurposed as a protein scaffold for the incorporation of a synthetic Fe&#8208;S cluster [Fe6  S9(SEt)2]4&#8211;. Here, we demonstrate the utility of an asymmetric Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S cluster [Cp*MoFe5S9(SH)]3&#8211;  as an alternative artificial cofactor upon incorporation into the cofactor&#8208;free nitrogenase scaffold. The resultant semi&#8208;artificial enzyme catalytically reduces C2H2  to C2H4, and CN&#8211;  into short&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, yet it is clearly distinct in activity from its [Fe6S9(SEt)2]4&#8211;&#8208;reconstituted counterpart, pointing to the possibility to employ molecular design and cluster synthesis strategies to further develop semi&#8208;artificial or artificial systems with desired catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Containing Simple Dioxo Ligands: a Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study Shows the Importance of the Charge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although platinum complexes (i.e., cisplatin, carboplatin, and others) are currently heavily used for the treatment of different types of cancer, some unwanted effects occur. Ruthenium complexes have been shown to be potential promising alternatives to these metal&#8208;based drugs. In this work, we performed a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study on two small series of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes of the type [Ru(L1)  2  (O&#8722;O)]Cl  n  (  3  &#8211;  8  ), where L1 is 4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenantroline (DIP) or 1,10&#8208;phenantroline (phen), and O&#8722;O is a symmetrical anionic dioxo ligand: oxalate (ox, n = 0), malonate (mal, n = 0), or acetylacetonate (acac, n = 1). These two self&#8208;consistent series of compounds allowed us to perform a systematic investigation for establishing how the nature of the ligands and the charge affect the anticancer properties of the complexes. Cytotoxicity tests on different cell lines demonstrated that some of the six compounds  3  &#8211;  8  have a promising anticancer activity. More specifically, the cationic complex [Ru(DIP)  2  (&#951;  2  &#8208;acac)]Cl (  4  ) has IC  50  values in the mid&#8208;nanomolar concentration range, lower than those of cisplatin on the same cell lines. Interestingly, [Ru(DIP)  2  (&#951;  2  &#8208;acac)]Cl was found to localize mainly in the mitochondria, whereas a smaller fraction was detected in the nucleus. Overall, our SAR investigation demonstrates the importance of combining the positive charge of the complex with the highly lipophilic diimine ligand DIP.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enantiomeric Fragment Pair (EFP) Approach for the Study of Cellular Uptake of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the cellular uptake of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides poses many challenges derived from the aggregation&#8208;prone nature of the system. We developed an enantiomeric fragment pair (EFP) approach to facilitate the study of the interactions with the cellular environment. The generated fragments are short and soluble, yet retain the biological activity of the full&#8208;length protein. This method allows aggregation&#8208;dependent mechanisms to be discerned from aggregation&#8208;independent mechanisms, and applies stereo&#8208;differentiation as a tool for the identification of receptors involved in cellular uptake of amyloids.







Abstract
The study of intrinsically disordered and amyloidogenic proteins poses a major challenge to researchers due to the propensity of the system to aggregate and to form amyloid fibrils and deposits. This intrinsic nature limits the way amyloids can be studied and increases the level of complexity of the techniques needed to study the system of interest. Recent reports suggest that cellular recognition and internalization of pre&#8208;fibrillary species of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins may initiate some of its toxic actions. Therefore, developing novels tools to facilitate the understanding and determination of the interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and the cellular membrane is becoming increasingly valuable. Here, we present and propose an approach for the study of the interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins with the cellular surface based on the use of enantiomeric fragment pairs (EFPs). By following a stepwise methodology in which the amyloidogenic peptide or protein is fragmented into specific segments, we show how this approach can be exploited to differentiate between different types of cellular uptake, to determine the degree of receptor&#8208;mediated cellular internalization of intrinsically disordered peptides and proteins, and to pinpoint the specific regions within the amino acid sequence responsible for the cellular recognition. Adopting this approach overcomes aggregation&#8208;related challenges and offers a particularly well&#8208;suited platform for the elucidation of receptor&#8208;intermediated recognition, uptake, and toxicity.

         <title>Exploring the Temperature Effect on Enantioselectivity of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Biooxidation by the 2,5&#8208;DKCMO Module: The SLM Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because the kinetic data did not fit with the usual model of the enantiomeric ratio, E, we used &#8216;Shape Language Modeling&#8217; (SLM) &#8211; a shape prescriptive approach which does not requires a fixed mechanistic&#8208;mathematical model &#8208; to compare the effect of temperature (from 10&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C), on the enantioselectivity of Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation by a type&#8197;II BVMO.







Abstract
Temperature is a crucial parameter for biological and chemical processes. Its effect on enzymatically catalysed reactions has been known for decades, and stereo&#8208; and enantiopreference are often temperature&#8208;dependent. For the first time, we present the temperature effect on the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of rac&#8208;bicyclo[3.2.0]hept&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;one by the type II Bayer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase, 2,5&#8208;DKCMO. In the absence of a reductase and driven by the hydride&#8208;donation of a synthetic nicotinamide analogue, the clear trend for a decreasing enantioselectivity at higher temperatures was observed. &#8220;Traditional&#8221; approaches such as the determination of the enantiomeric ratio (E) appeared unsuitable due to the complexity of the system. To quantify the trend, we chose to use the &#8216;Shape Language Modelling&#8217; (SLM), a tool that allows the reaction to be described at all points in a shape prescriptive manner. Thus, without knowing the equation of the reaction, the substrate ee can be estimated that at any conversion.

         <title>Identification of Genes Essential for Sulfamate and Fluorine Incorporation During Nucleocidin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleocidin is an adenosine analogue containing rare fluorinated and sulfamated moieties from unknown biosynthetic origins. Using gene disruption, we have identified three genes essential for sulfamation, and three for sulfamation and fluorination. Additionally, two new acetylated nucleocidin derivatives were also discovered.







Abstract
Nucleocidin is an adenosine derivative containing 4&#8217;&#8208;fluoro and 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl substituents. In this study, nucleocidin biosynthesis is examined in two newly discovered producers, Streptomyces virens B&#8208;24331 and Streptomyces aureorectus B&#8208;24301, which produce nucleocidin and related derivatives at titers 30&#8208;fold greater than S. calvus. This enabled the identification of two new O&#8208;acetylated nucleocidin derivatives, and a potential glycosyl&#8208;O&#8208;acetyltransferase. Disruption of nucJ, nucG, and nucI, within S. virens B&#8208;24331, specifying a radical SAM/Fe&#8722;S dependent enzyme, sulfatase, and arylsulfatase, respectively, led to loss of 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl biosynthesis, but not fluoronucleoside production. Disruption of nucN, nucK, and nucO specifying an amidinotransferase, and two sulfotransferases respectively, led to loss of fluoronucleoside production. Identification of S. virens B&#8208;24331 as a genetically tractable and high producing strain sets the stage for understanding nucleocidin biosynthesis and highlights the utility of using 16S&#8208;RNA sequences to identify alternative producers of valuable compounds in the absence of genome sequence data.

         <title>Evaluation of Gene Expression Knock&#8208;Down by Chemically and Structurally Modified Gapmer Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of modified nucleotides and short hairpins within gapmer antisense oligonucleotides on RNase H mediated gene silencing was evaluated. Our studies show that the majority of the modifications of the control gapmer increased the silencing potential of the antisense oligonucleotide. The results might facilitate the sensible design and development of potent, highly efficient RNA therapeutics.







Abstract
We analyzed the effect of modified nucleotides within gapmer antisense oligonucleotides on RNase H mediated gene silencing. Additionally, short hairpins were introduced into antisense oligonucleotides as structural motifs, and their influence on biological and physicochemical properties of pre&#8208;structured gapmers was investigated for the first time. The results indicate that two LNA residues in specified positions of the gap flanking regions are sufficient and favorable for efficient knock&#8208;down of the &#946;&#8208;actin gene. Furthermore, the introduction of other modified nucleotides, i.&#8201;e. glycyl&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA&#8722;T, 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;propagyluridine, polyamine functionalized uridine, and UNA, in specified positions, also increases the inhibition of &#946;&#8208;actin expression. Importantly, the presence of hairpins within the gapmers improves their silencing properties.

         <title>Anticancer Activity of Reconstituted Ribonuclease S&#8208;Decorated Artificial Viral Capsid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsid that exhibited enzyme activity were constructed by reconstituting &#946;&#8208;annulus&#8208;S&#8208;peptide with S&#8208;protein at neutral pH. The RNase S&#8208;decorated capsids taken up by HepG2 cells exhibited higher RNA degradation and anticancer activity in cells compared with RNase S alone.







Abstract
Ribonuclease S (RNase S) is an enzyme that exhibits anticancer activity by degrading RNAs within cancer cells; however, the cellular uptake efficiency is low due to its small molecular size. Here we generated RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsids with a size of 70&#8211;170&#8197;nm by self&#8208;assembly of the &#946;&#8208;annulus&#8208;S&#8208;peptide followed by reconstitution with S&#8208;protein at neutral pH. The RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsids are efficiently taken up by HepG2 cells and exhibit higher RNA degradation activity in cells compared with RNase S alone. Cell viability assays revealed that RNase S&#8208;decorated capsids have high anticancer activity comparable to that of standard anticancer drugs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis for the Screening of Novel Azoreductases and Their Preferred Electron Donor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screening approach for azoreductases was developed, including cell&#8208;free protein synthesis of an enzyme library and a multi&#8208;well microplate assay. Applicability to known and novel enzymes was demonstrated, and preferred co&#8208;substrates for each enzyme were evaluated. Five new and yet uncharacterized azoreductases were identified. Furthermore, it was shown that all azoreductases accept the co&#8208;substrate BNAH as an electron donor.







Abstract
Azoreductases are potent biocatalysts for the cleavage of azo bonds. Various gene sequences coding for potential azoreductases are available in databases, but many of their gene products are still uncharacterized. To avoid the laborious heterologous expression in a host organism, we developed a screening approach involving cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) combined with a colorimetric activity assay, which allows the parallel screening of putative azoreductases in a short time. First, we evaluated different CFPS systems and optimized the synthesis conditions of a model azoreductase. With the findings obtained, 10 azoreductases, half of them undescribed so far, were screened for their ability to degrade the azo dye methyl red. All novel enzymes catalyzed the degradation of methyl red and can therefore be referred to as azoreductases. In addition, all enzymes degraded the more complex and bulkier azo dye Brilliant Black and four of them also showed the ability to reduce p&#8208;benzoquinone. NADH was the preferred electron donor for the most enzymes, although the synthetic nicotinamide co&#8208;substrate analogue 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) was also accepted by all active azoreductases. This screening approach allows accelerated identification of potential biocatalysts for various applications.

&lt;p&gt;Azoreductases are potent biocatalysts for the cleavage of azo bonds. Various gene sequences coding for potential azoreductases are available in databases, but many of their gene products are still uncharacterized. To avoid the laborious heterologous expression in a host organism, we developed a screening approach involving cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) combined with a colorimetric activity assay, which allows the parallel screening of putative azoreductases in a short time. First, we evaluated different CFPS systems and optimized the synthesis conditions of a model azoreductase. With the findings obtained, 10 azoreductases, half of them undescribed so far, were screened for their ability to degrade the azo dye methyl red. All novel enzymes catalyzed the degradation of methyl red and can therefore be referred to as azoreductases. In addition, all enzymes degraded the more complex and bulkier azo dye Brilliant Black and four of them also showed the ability to reduce &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoquinone. NADH was the preferred electron donor for the most enzymes, although the synthetic nicotinamide co-substrate analogue 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) was also accepted by all active azoreductases. This screening approach allows accelerated identification of potential biocatalysts for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the Substrate Requirements of the In&#8197;Vitro Geranylation Activity of Selenouridine Synthase (SelU)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenouridine synthase (SelU, also called mnmH) is an enzyme with a dual activity which catalyzes selenation and geranylation in bacterial tRNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine at wobble positions. In this study, we explored the in&#8197;vitro geranylation process of tRNA anticodon stem loops (ASL) mediated by SelU. Our findings suggest a putative mechanism for SelU substrate discrimination and unveil key factors that might influence its enzymatic activity.







Abstract
Natural RNA modifications diversify the structures and functions of existing nucleic acid building blocks. Geranyl is one of the most hydrophobic groups recently identified in bacterial tRNAs. Selenouridine synthase (SelU, also called mnmH) is an enzyme with a dual activity which catalyzes selenation and geranylation in tRNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine using selenophosphate or geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate as cofactors. In this study, we explored the in&#8197;vitro geranylation process of tRNA anticodon stem loops (ASL) mediated by SelU and showed that the geranylation activity was abolished when U35 was mutated to A35 (ASL&#8208;tRNALys(s2U)UU to ASL&#8208;tRNAIle(s2U)AU). By examining the SelU cofactor geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate (gePP) and its analogues, we found that only the geranyl group, but not dimethylallyl&#8208; and farnesyl&#8208;pyrophosphate with either shorter or longer terpene chains, could be incorporated into ASL. The degree of tRNA geranylation in the end&#8208;point analysis for SelU follows the order of ASLLys(s2UUU)
ASLGln(s2UUG)&gt;ASLGlu(s2UUC). These findings suggest a putative mechanism for substrate discrimination by SelU and reveal key factors that might influence its enzymatic activity. Given that SelU plays an important role in bacterial translation systems, inhibiting this enzyme and targeting its geranylation and selenation pathways could be exploited as a promising strategy to develop SelU&#8208;based antibiotics.

         <title>The Dynamic Range of Acidity: Tracking Rules for the Unidirectional Penetration of Cellular Compartments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal tracking rules for cationic fluorescent membrane tension probes are obtained around the edge of their dynamic range of acidity, focusing on early endosomes in comparison to late endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, and on practical relevance to image the mechanics at the very beginning of endocytosis.







Abstract
Labeled ammonium cations with pKa&#8764;7.4 accumulate in acidic organelles because they can be neutralized transiently to cross the membrane at cytosolic pH&#8197;7.2 but not at their internal pH&lt;5.5. Retention in early endosomes with less acidic internal pH was achieved recently using weaker acids of up to pKa 9.8. We report here that primary ammonium cations with higher pKa 10.6, label early endosomes more efficiently. This maximized early endosome tracking coincides with increasing labeling of Golgi networks with similarly weak internal acidity. Guanidinium cations with pKa 13.5 cannot cross the plasma membrane in monomeric form and label the plasma membrane with selectivity for vesicles embarking into endocytosis. Self&#8208;assembled into micelles, guanidinium cations enter cells like arginine&#8208;rich cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and, driven by their membrane potential, penetrate mitochondria unidirectionally despite their high inner pH. The resulting tracking rules with an approximated dynamic range of pKa change &#8764;3.5 are expected to be generally valid, thus enabling the design of chemistry tools for biology research in the broadest sense. From a practical point of view, most relevant are two complementary fluorescent flipper probes that can be used to image the mechanics at the very beginning of endocytosis.

         <title>Luminescent Assay for the Screening of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 MPro Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A luminescent assay for the main protease MPro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 was developed and subsequently used for the screening of inhibitors of the chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease. The caged luminescent peptide probe used in this study releases photons upon proteolytic activity of MPro in the presence of luciferase.







Abstract
Since the outbreak of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in December 2019 millions of infections have been reported globally. The viral chymotrypsin&#8208;like main protease (MPro) exhibits a crucial role in viral replication and represents a relevant target for antiviral drug development. In order to screen potential MPro inhibitors we developed a luminescent assay using a peptide based probe containing a cleavage site specific for MPro. This assay was validated showing IC50 values similar to those reported in the literature for known MPro inhibitors and can be used to screen new inhibitors.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of 6&#8208;O&#8208;Phosphorylated Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides to Inhibit Amyloid &#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 6&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated heparan sulfate tetrasaccharide was rationally designed and synthesized to inhibit heparin&#8208;induced amyloid fibril formation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) in&#8197;vitro. Its competitive effect was confirmed by a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a tapping mode atomic force microscopy.







Abstract
Dysregulation of amyloidogenic proteins and their abnormal processing and deposition in tissues cause systemic and localized amyloidosis. Formation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) fibrils that deposit as amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains is an earliest pathological hallmark. The polysulfated heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin (HP) is one of the non&#8208;protein components of A&#946; deposits that not only modulates A&#946; aggregation, but also acts as a receptor for A&#946; fibrils to mediate their cytotoxicity. Interfering with the interaction between HS/HP and A&#946; could be a therapeutic strategy to arrest amyloidosis. Here we have synthesized the 6&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated HS/HP oligosaccharides and reported their competitive effects on the inhibition of HP&#8208;mediated A&#946; fibril formation in&#8197;vitro using a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a tapping mode atomic force microscopy.

         <title>Advanced Insights into Catalytic and Structural Features of the Zinc&#8208;Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Thauera aromatica</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zinc&#8208;dependent MDR&#8722;ADH (medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase&#8722;alcohol dehydrogenase) from Thauera aromatica has a unique substrate preference for sterically demanding &#945;&#8208;substituted linear cyclic carbonyl compounds and a remarkable thermal, pH and solvent stability. Based on high&#8208;resolution structures from X&#8208;ray analysis, structural determinants for the enzyme's special features are introduced.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of ketones to chiral hydroxyl compounds by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) is an established strategy for the provision of valuable precursors for fine chemicals and pharmaceutics. However, most ADHs favor linear aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds, and suitable biocatalysts with preference for cyclic ketones and diketones are still scarce. Among the few candidates, the alcohol dehydrogenase from Thauera aromatica (ThaADH) stands out with a high activity for the reduction of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketone 1,2&#8208;cyclohexanedione to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone. This study elucidates catalytic and structural features of the enzyme. ThaADH showed a remarkable thermal and pH stability as well as stability in the presence of polar solvents. A thorough description of the substrate scope combined with the resolution and description of the crystal structure, demonstrated a strong preference of ThaADH for cyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones, and indicated structural determinants responsible for the unique substrate acceptance.

         <title>Antibody Recognition of Cancer Cells via Glycan Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying cells for selective antibody and immune recognition is a major strategy in cancer treatment. In this study, metabolic glycoengineering of cancer cells and chemical hapten functionalization led to antibody recognition and recruitment.







Abstract
Stimulation of the body's immune system toward tumor cells is now well recognized as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Just behind cell therapy and monoclonal antibodies, small molecule&#8208;based strategies are receiving growing attention as alternatives to direct immune response against tumor cells. However, the development of small&#8208;molecule approaches to modulate the balance between stimulatory immune factors and suppressive factors in a targeted way remains a challenge. Here, we report the cell surface functionalization of LS174T cancer cells with an abiotic hapten to recruit antibodies to the cell surface. Metabolic glycoengineering followed by covalent reaction with the hapten results in antibody recognition of the target cells. Microscopy and flow cytometry studies provide compelling evidence that metabolic glycoengineering and small molecule stimulators can be combined to direct antibody recognition.

         <title>Influence of Reaction Conditions on Enzymatic Enantiopreference: the Curious Case of HEwT in the Synthesis of THF&#8208;Amine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While scaling&#8208;up the transamination of THF&#8208;ketone, an unusual switch in enantioselectivity was observed which correlated with increasing concentrations of amine donor. At high concentration of organic molecules, the enzyme was (S)&#8208;selective, while at high ionic strength the enzyme became (R)&#8208;selective. The mechanism for this effect is not yet clear.







Abstract
Enzymatic enantiopreference is one of the key advantages of biocatalysis. While exploring the synthesis of small cyclic (chiral amines) such as 3&#8208;aminotetrahydrofuran (THF&#8208;amine), using the (S)&#8208;selective transaminase from Halomonas elongata (HEwT), inversion of the enantiopreference was observed at increasing substrate loadings. In addition, the enantiopreference could be altered by variation of the ionic strength, or of the co&#8208;solvent content in the reaction mixture. For example, using otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of 2&#8197;M sodium chloride gave (R)&#8208;THF&#8208;amine (14&#8201;% ee), while the addition of 2.2&#8197;M isopropyl alcohol gave the (S)&#8208;enantiomer in 30&#8201;% ee. While the underlying cause is not currently understood, it appears likely that subtle changes in the structure of the enzyme cause the shift in enantiopreference and are worth exploring further.

         <title>Front Cover: The Dynamic Range of Acidity: Tracking Rules for the Unidirectional Penetration of Cellular Compartments (ChemBioChem 15/2022)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing color like lobsters during cooking, flipper probes with cationic acids are introduced to elucidate the mechanics of early endocytosis, and to reveal universal tracking rules for unidirectional penetration along transmembrane pH gradients. Consistent with a dynamic range of &#916;pKa=3.5 for temporary deprotonation, cationic acids with pKa=9.8 stay only within more acidic early endosomes (pH &#8764;6.3), while those with pKa=10.6 track also the less acidic ones (pH &#8764;6.5). For these early endosomes, cationic acids with pKa=7.4 are too acidic for retention, those with pKa=13.5 are too basic for penetration. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Matile et&#8197;al.

         <title>Cover Feature: Identification of Genes Essential for Sulfamate and Fluorine Incorporation During Nucleocidin Biosynthesis (ChemBioChem 15/2022)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleocidin is a rare example of naturally occurring nucleoside containing fluorine and sulfamate substituents. Identification of Streptomyces strains that are better producers of nucleocidin has facilitated the trek towards elucidating the biosynthesis of this novel molecule. For the first time gene inactivation experiments have identified three genes, nucGIJ, encoding two predicted sulfatases and a radical SAM enzyme, that are essential for sulfamate biosynthesis. This opens the door to further functional analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster encoding nucleocidin. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;L. Zechel et&#8197;al.

         <title>Combination of Immunotherapy and Photo&#8208;pyroptosis as Novel Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyroptosis is programmed cell death, and can significantly improve the immunogenicity of tumors and enhance the effect of anticancer drugs. Designing pyroptosis&#8208;inducing photosensitizers open a novel anticancer strategy. Photodynamic immunotherapy provides a new way to fight against cancer.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has made great progress in clinical cancer treatment in recent years, but its therapeutic efficacy is significantly limited by the lack of immunogenicity in the tumor microenvironment. Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death in which the dying cancer cells produce inflammatory cytokines to relieve the immuno&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and thus increase anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during photodynamic therapy (PDT) are one of the efficient activators that induce pyroptosis. Recently, a few photosensitizers have emerged with the ability to induce immunogenic cancer cell death via pyroptosis, opening a new field for PDT. This highlight introduces the latest research on antitumor strategies achieved by the combination of immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy through photo&#8208;pyroptosis.

         <title>Chemical Modifications for a Next Generation of Nucleic Acid Aptamers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 15, August 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cubane aptamer (cubamer) is a chemically modified nucleic acid aptamer incorporating cubane moieties into the nucleotide bases. The Figure shows a cubamer in complex with the malaria biomarker Plasmodium vivax lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH), with high specificity relative to Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH). Such specificity has not been possible with conventional DNA aptamers. This example demonstrates the enhanced functionality of modified aptamers. Herein, we review the chemistry, synthesis, selection, and application of such modified aptamers.







Abstract
In the past three decades, in&#8197;vitro systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has yielded many aptamers for translational applications in both research and clinical settings. Despite their promise as an alternative to antibodies, the low success rate of SELEX (&#8764;30&#8201;%) has been a major bottleneck that hampers the further development of aptamers. One hurdle is the lack of chemical diversity in nucleic acids. To address this, the aptamer chemical repertoire has been extended by introducing exotic chemical groups, which provide novel binding functionalities. This review will focus on how modified aptamers can be selected and evolved, with illustration of some successful examples. In particular, unique chemistries are exemplified. Various strategies of incorporating modified building blocks into the standard SELEX protocol are highlighted, with a comparison of the differences between pre&#8208;SELEX and post&#8208;SELEX modifications. Nucleic acid aptamers with extended functionality evolved from non&#8208;natural chemistries will open up new vistas for function and application of nucleic acids.

         <title>Anticancer Water&#8208;Soluble Organoruthenium Complexes: Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine ligands are coordinated to [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Ru(maleonitriledithiolate)] to obtain ruthenium(II) complexes with different hydrophilicities. Characterisation and evaluation of the in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity towards two ovarian, one non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer cell lines and one normal prostate cell line are presented. A mechanism of action based on reactive oxygen species production leading to apoptosis is suggested. In vivo evaluation suggests some evidence of tumour growth delay.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterisation, and evaluation of the in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity of five maleonitriledithiolate&#8208;based ruthenium metal complexes bearing various phosphine ligands towards two ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780 and A2780cisR), one non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer cell line (H460) and one normal prostate cell line (PNT2) are presented herein. These 18&#8208;electron complexes were designed with four water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands to increase the water&#8208;solubility character of the corresponding electron&#8208;deficient ruthenium complex which showed great in&#8197;vitro promises, and triphenylphosphine for comparison. The complexes with triphenylphosphine&#8208;3,3&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;trisulfonic acid and triphenylphosphine present similar cytotoxicity compared to the 16&#8208;electron precursor, with equal cytotoxicity to both A2780 and A2780cisR. Hints at the mechanism of action suggest an apoptotic pathway based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. No toxicity was observed in preliminary in&#8197;vivo pilot studies for these two complexes in subcutaneous A2780 and A2780cisR xenograft models, with some evidence of tumour growth delay.

         <title>Regulating Spatial Localization and Reactivity Biasness of DNAzymes by Metal Ions and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;equilibrium sensing and taxis of catalytically active biocolloids is crucial for understanding physiological processes and designing artificial nano&#8208; and microrobotic systems. We have demonstrated that the localization of a G&#8208;quadruplex based DNAzyme is biased to a zone where it shows higher peroxidase activity (lively area). The image shows how by diminishing the effect of inhibitors (Hg2+, symbolized by Halloween ghosts) by arresting them with thymidine&#8208;containing oligonucleotides, the activity of DNAzymes can be retained with concurrent migration from the catalytically inhibited region (deadly area). More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Maiti et&#8197;al.

         <title>Bioconjugation Strategies for Tobacco Mild Green Mosaic Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the plant virus nanoparticle TMGMV, we systematically assessed which amino acids are solvent exposed and addressable by bioconjugation strategies. We determined that glutamic acids on the exterior and interior surfaces, tyrosines on the exterior surface as well as the exterior and solvent&#8208;exposed N&#8208;terminus are reactive but to varying degrees (Tyr&gt;Glu&gt;N&#8208;term). Bioconjugation reactions and proteomics paired with structural analysis of TMGMV provided rationale for the underlying reactivity of target sites. A deeper understanding of the chemical properties of TMGMV further enables its functionalization and use as a multifunctional nanocarrier platform for applications in medicine and precision farming.







Abstract
Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) is a plant virus closely related to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), sharing many of its structural and chemical features. These rod&#8208;shaped viruses, comprised of 2130 identical coat protein subunits, have been utilized as nanotechnological platforms for a myriad of applications, ranging from drug delivery to precision agriculture. This versatility for functionalization is due to their chemically active external and internal surfaces. While both viruses are similar, they do exhibit some key differences in their surface chemistry, suggesting the reactive residue distribution on TMGMV should not overlap with TMV. In this work, we focused on the establishment and refinement of chemical bioconjugation strategies to load molecules into or onto TMGMV for targeted delivery. A combination of NHS, EDC, and diazo coupling reactions in combination with click chemistry were used to modify the N&#8208;terminus, glutamic/aspartic acid residues, and tyrosines in TMGMV. We report loading with over 600 moieties per TMGMV via diazo&#8208;coupling, which is a &gt;3&#8208;fold increase compared to previous studies. We also report that cargo can be loaded to the solvent&#8208;exposed N&#8208;terminus and carboxylates on the exterior/interior surfaces. Mass spectrometry revealed the most reactive sites to be Y12 and Y72, both tyrosine side chains are located on the exterior surface. For the carboxylates, interior E106 (66.53&#8201;%) was the most reactive for EDC&#8208;propargylamine coupled reactions, with the exterior E145 accounting for &gt;15&#8201;% reactivity, overturning previous assumptions that only interior glutamic acid residues are accessible. A deeper understanding of the chemical properties of TMGMV further enables its functionalization and use as a multifunctional nanocarrier platform for applications in medicine and precision farming.

A deeper understanding of the chemical properties of TMGMV further enables its functionalization and use as a multifunctional nanocarrier platform for applications in medicine and precision farming.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) is a plant virus closely related to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), sharing many of its structural and chemical features. These rod-shaped viruses, comprised of 2130 identical coat protein subunits, have been utilized as nanotechnological platforms for a myriad of applications, ranging from drug delivery to precision agriculture. This versatility for functionalization is due to their chemically active external and internal surfaces. While both viruses are similar, they do exhibit some key differences in their surface chemistry, suggesting the reactive residue distribution on TMGMV should not overlap with TMV. In this work, we focused on the establishment and refinement of chemical bioconjugation strategies to load molecules into or onto TMGMV for targeted delivery. A combination of NHS, EDC, and diazo coupling reactions in combination with click chemistry were used to modify the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminus, glutamic/aspartic acid residues, and tyrosines in TMGMV. We report loading with over 600 moieties per TMGMV via diazo-coupling, which is a &amp;gt;3-fold increase compared to previous studies. We also report that cargo can be loaded to the solvent-exposed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminus and carboxylates on the exterior/interior surfaces. Mass spectrometry revealed the most reactive sites to be Y12 and Y72, both tyrosine side chains are located on the exterior surface. For the carboxylates, interior E106 (66.53&#8201;%) was the most reactive for EDC-propargylamine coupled reactions, with the exterior E145 accounting for &amp;gt;15&#8201;% reactivity, overturning previous assumptions that only interior glutamic acid residues are accessible. A deeper understanding of the chemical properties of TMGMV further enables its functionalization and use as a multifunctional nanocarrier platform for applications in medicine and precision farming.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of a Functionalized GFP Nanobody</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical protein synthesis has proven to be a powerful tool to access homogenously modified proteins. The chemical synthesis of nanobodies (Nb) would create possibilities to design tailored Nbs with a range of chemical modifications such as tags, linkers, reporter groups, and subsequently, Nb&#8208;drug conjugates. Herein, we describe the total chemical synthesis of a 123 amino&#8208;acid Nb against GFP. A native chemical ligation&#8211; desulfurization strategy was successfully applied for the synthesis of this GFP Nb, modified with a propargyl (PA) moiety for on&#8208;demand functionalization. Biophysical characterization indicated that the synthetic GFP Nb&#8208;PA was correctly folded after internal disulfide bond formation. The synthetic Nb&#8208;PA was functionalized with a biotin or a sulfo&#8208;Cyanine5 dye by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), resulting in two distinct probes used for functional in vitro validation in pulldown and confocal microscopy settings.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fluorescent Enzyme Cascade Detects Low Abundance Protein Modifications Suitable for the Assembly of Functionally Annotated Modificatome Databases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathophysiological functions of proteins critically depend on both their chemical composition, including posttranslational modifications, and their three&#8208;dimensional structure, commonly referred to as structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship. Current analytical methods, like capillary electrophoresis or mass spectrometry, suffer from limitations, such as the detection of unexpected modifications at low abundance and their insensitivity to conformational changes. Building on previous enzyme&#8208;based analytic methods, we here introduce a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme cascade (fEC), which can detect diverse chemical and conformational variations in protein samples and assemble them into digital databases. Together with complementary analytical methods an automated fEC analysis established unique modification&#8208;function relationships, which can be expanded to a proteome&#8208;wide scale, i.e. a functionally annotated modificatome. The fEC offers diverse applications, including hypersensitive biomarker detection in complex samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Triggered Bioorthogonal Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene&#8208;Caged Phenols Using a Minimal Self&#8208;Immolative Linker Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond&#8208;cleavage reactions triggered by bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation have emerged as strategies to chemically control the function of (bio)molecules and achieve activation of prodrugs in living systems. While most of these approaches make use of caged amines, current methods for the release of phenols are limited by unfavorable reaction kinetics or insufficient stability of the Tz&#8208;responsive reactants. To address this issue, we have implemented a self&#8208;immolative linker that enables the connection of cleavable  trans  &#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and phenols via carbamate linkages. Based on detailed investigation of the reaction mechanism with several Tz, revealing up to 96% elimination after 2 hours, we have developed a TCO&#8208;caged prodrug with 750&#8208;fold reduced cytotoxicity compared to the parent drug and achieved in situ activation upon Tz/TCO click&#8208;to&#8208;release.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Genetically Encoded Lysine PTMs with Lactylation, &#946;&#8208;Hydroxybutyrylation and Lipoylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) occurring on lysine residues, especially diverse forms of acylations, have seen rapid growth over the past two decades. Among them, lactylation and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrylation of lysine side&#8208;chains are newly identified histone marks and their implications in physiology and diseases have aroused broad research interest. Meanwhile, lysine lipoylation is highly conserved in diverse organisms and well known for the pivotal role in central metabolic pathways, and recent findings in the proteomic profiling of protein lipoylation have nonetheless suggested a pressing need for an extensive investigation. For both basic and applied research, it is highly necessary to prepare PTM&#8208;bearing proteins particularly in a site&#8208;specific manner. Herein, we use genetic code expansion to site&#8208;specifically generate these lysine PTMs, including lactylation, &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrylation and lipoylation in proteins in E. coli and mammalian cells. Notably using strategies including activity&#8208;based selection, screening and rational design, unique pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase variants were successfully evolved for each of the three non&#8208;canonical amino acids and enable efficient production of recombinant proteins, thus holding promise to benefit relevant studies. Through encoding these ncAAs, we examined the deacylase activities of mammalian sirtuins to these modifications, and importantly unfold lipoamidase activity of several sirtuins.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Proteins Modulation in Live Cells with Small Molecules and Light</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinctive small&#8208;molecule strategies for spatiotemporal modulation of endogenous proteins in live cells are discussed, including decaging of small molecules by photolysis, visible&#8208;light photocatalytic releasing of small molecules, and small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging, which together provide powerful chemical biology tool kits with potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Protein modulation by light illumination enables the investigation of biological function in high spatiotemporal precision. Compared to genetic methods, the small molecule approach is uniquely suited for modulating endogenous proteins. Endogenous protein modulation in live cells with small molecules and light has recently advanced on three distinctive frontiers: i) the infrared&#8208;light&#8208;induced or localized decaging of small molecules by photolysis, ii) the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic releasing of small molecules, and iii) the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging for photomodulation of proteins. Together, these methods provide powerful chemical biology tool kits for spatiotemporal modulation of endogenous proteins with potential therapeutic applications. This Concept article aims to inspire organic chemists and chemical biologists to delve into this burgeoning endogenous protein modulation field for new biological discoveries.

mRNA methylation is an important regulator in eukaryotes but has not been studied in depth in prokaryotes. In this study, we compared size&#8208;dependent separation by electrophoresis and rRNA depletion for enrichment of Escherichia coli mRNA and quantitatively analyzed modified nucleosides in the different RNA types.







Abstract
mRNA methylation is an important regulator of many physiological processes in eukaryotes but has not been studied in depth in prokaryotes. Working with bacterial mRNA is challenging because it lacks a poly(A)&#8208;tail. However, methods for detecting RNA modifications, both sequencing and mass spectrometry, rely on efficient preparation of mRNA. Here, we compared size&#8208;dependent separation by electrophoresis and rRNA depletion for enrichment of Escherichia&#8197;coli mRNA. The purification success was monitored by qRT&#8208;PCR and RNA sequencing. Neither method allowed complete removal of rRNA. Nevertheless, we were able to quantitatively analyze several modified nucleosides in the different RNA types. We found evidence for stress dependent RNA modification reprofiling in rRNA, but also several modified nucleosides in the mRNA enriched fractions showed significant changes.

         <title>Peroxidase Activity of Myoglobin Variants Reconstituted with Artificial Cofactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the peroxidase activity of myoglobin, the effect of artificial cofactors (metal centre and the porphyrin ligand) was investigated. Twelve artificial cofactors were reconstituted with the myoglobin scaffold and FeCe6&#8208;Mb was identified to have 3&#8197;times improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Myoglobin (Mb) can react with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form a highly active intermediate compound and catalyse oxidation reactions. To enhance this activity, known as pseudo&#8208;peroxidase activity, previous studies have focused on the modification of key amino acid residues of Mb or the heme cofactor. In this work, the Mb scaffold (apo&#8208;Mb) was systematically reconstituted with a set of cofactors based on six metal ions and two ligands. These Mb variants were fully characterised by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and native mass spectrometry (nMS). The steady&#8208;state kinetics of guaiacol oxidation and 2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenol (TCP) dehalogenation catalysed by Mb variants were determined. Mb variants with iron chlorin e6 (Fe&#8722;Ce6) and manganese chlorin e6 (Mn&#8722;Ce6) cofactors were found to have improved catalytic efficiency for both guaiacol and TCP substrates in comparison with wild&#8208;type Mb, i.&#8201;e. Fe&#8208;protoporphyrin IX&#8208;Mb. Furthermore, the selected cofactors were incorporated into the scaffold of a Mb mutant, swMb H64D. Enhanced peroxidase activity for both substrates were found via the reconstitution of Fe&#8722;Ce6 into the mutant scaffold.

         <title>Applications and Limitations of Oxime&#8208;Linked &#8220;Split PROTACs&#8221;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activity of a proteolysis targeting chimera is highly dependent on the length and nature of the linker connecting the two component ligands. We explore the utility of using an oxime ligation to rapidly examine all the activity of &#8220;split PROTACs&#8221; created from collections of aldehyde&#8208; and alkoxyamine&#8208;functionalized pieces. Advantages and limitations of this approach are discussed.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras are of keen interest as probe molecules and drug leads. Their activity is highly sensitive to the length and nature of the linker connecting the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase (E3 Ubl) and target protein (TP) ligands, which therefore requires tedious optimization. The creation of &#8220;split PROTACs&#8221; from E3 Ubl and TP ligands modified with residues suitable for them to couple when simply mixed together would allow various combinations to be assessed in a combinatorial fashion, thus greatly easing the workload relative to a one&#8208;by&#8208;one synthesis of many different PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras). We explore oxime chemistry here for this purpose. We show that PROTAC assembly occurs efficiently when the components are mixed at a high concentration, then added to cells. However, in&#8197;situ coupling of the TP and E3 Ubl ligands is inefficient when these units are added to cells at lower concentrations.

         <title>Determination of 5&#8208;Formyluracil via Oxime&#8208;Based Nucleotide&#8208;Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After its reaction with 5&#8208;formyluracil, a small chemical molecule, 2&#8208;(aminooxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide, was used to regulate activities of DNA polymerase. Then, the content of 5&#8208;formyluracil sites in DNA samples was detected by isothermal amplification strategy. According to the calculation of experimental data, 14.7 5&#8208;formyluracil components per 106 nucleotides per Gy were obtained in the radiation process.







Abstract
2&#8208;(Aminooxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide was synthesized, and its ability to regulate activities of DNA polymerase was tested. In addition, we used the isothermal amplification technology to detect the content of 5&#8208;formyluracil sites in irradiated genomic DNA, which confirmed its capability for the detection of 5&#8208;formyluracil content in general samples. This study presents the first example of the determination of 5fU based on coordination chemistry.

         <title>New Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Phycobiliproteins with Excellent Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monomeric far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent phycobiliproteins, termed BDFPs, show excellent photostability with extreme brightness in mammalian cells. Most BDFPs among them are small monomers (15&#8764;17&#8197;kDa). These excellent BDFPs can fuse with various proteins in mammalian cells and have been successfully used in super&#8208;resolution imaging.







Abstract
Far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins can be used as fluorescence biomarkers in the region of maximal transmission of most tissues and facilitate multiplexing. Recently, we reported the generation and properties of far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent phycobiliproteins, termed BeiDou Fluorescent Proteins (BDFPs), which can covalently bind the more readily accessible biliverdin. Far&#8208;red BDFPs maximally fluoresce at &#8764;670&#8197;nm, while near&#8208;infrared BDFPs fluoresce at &#8764;710&#8197;nm. In this work, we molecularly evolved BDFPs as follows: (a) mutations L58Q, S68R and M81K of BDFPs, which can maximally enhance the effective brightness in&#8197;vivo by 350&#8201;%; (b) minimization and monomerization of far&#8208;red BDFPs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and near&#8208;infrared BDFPs 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. These newly developed BDFPs are remarkably brighter than the formerly reported far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins. Their advantages are demonstrated by biolabeling in mammalian cells using super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Menaquinone in E.&#8197;coli: Identification of an Elusive Isomer of SEPHCHC</title>

Elusive isomer: The shikimate pathway has been studied over decades, but the metabolite iso&#8208;SEPHCHC remained hidden until now.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of menaquinone in bacteria, the thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme MenD catalyzes the decarboxylative carboligation of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate and isochorismate to (1R,2S,5S,6S)&#8208;2&#8208;succinyl&#8208;5&#8208;enolpyruvyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohex&#8208;3&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate (SEPHCHC). The regioisomer of SEPHCHC, namely (1R,5S,6S)&#8208;2&#8208;succinyl&#8208;5&#8208;enolpyruvyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate (iso&#8208;SEPHCHC), has been considered as a possible product, however, its existence has been doubtful due to a spontaneous elimination of pyruvate from SEPHCHC to 2&#8208;succinyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate (SHCHC). In this work, the regioisomer iso&#8208;SEPHCHC was distinguished from SEPHCHC by liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry. Iso&#8208;SEPHCHC was purified and identified by NMR spectroscopy. Just as SEPHCHC remained hidden as a MenD product for more than two decades, its regioisomer iso&#8208;SEPHCHC has remained until now.

         <title>The Total Synthesis of Glycolipids from Streptococcus pneumoniae and a Re&#8208;evaluation of Their Immunological Activity
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic KRN7000 derived from sponge&#8208;dwelling bacteria metabolites, activates the invariant natural killer T&#8208;cells. Two glycolipids were reported isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2011 with reported potent activity. This resynthesis of both shows they are inactive against this receptor, and computational data proposes that this is expected as they present differently on the iNKT receptor.







Abstract
Invariant natural killer (iNK) T cells, Type I iNKTs, are responsible for the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines which induce a systemic immune response. They are distinctive in possessing an semi&#8208;invariant T&#8208;cell receptor that recognizes glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d, a protein closely related to the class I major histocompatibility complex, conserved across multiple mammalian species in a class of proteins well&#8208;renowned for their high degree of polymorphism. This receptor's first potent identified antigen is the &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide, KRN7000, a synthetic glycosphingolipid closely related to those isolated from bacteria that were found on a Japanese marine sponge. A corresponding terrestrial antigen remained unidentified until two specific diacylglycerol&#8208;containing glycolipids, reported to activate iNKT cells, were isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae. We report the total synthesis and immunological re&#8208;evaluation of these two glycolipids. The compounds are unable to meaningfully activate iNKT cells. Computational modelling shows that these ligands, while being capable of interacting with the CD1d receptor, create a different surface for the binary complex that makes formation of the ternary complex with the iNKT T&#8208;cell receptor difficult. Together these results suggest that the reported activity might have been due to an impurity in the original isolated sample and highlights the importance of taking care when reporting biological activity from isolated natural products.

         <title>Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Arrays Could Influence the Formation of Their Component Tiles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data that that show higher level structures, i.&#8201;e. two&#8208;dimensional arrays, could impact the formation of their component tiles, are presented. Herein, the branched Kissing Loop motif has enabled us to observe this phenomenon with regard to programmed DNA self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Tile&#8208;based DNA self&#8208;assembly is a powerful approach for nano&#8208;constructions. In this approach, individual DNA single strands first assemble into well&#8208;defined structural tiles, which, then, further associate with each other into final nanostructures. It is a general assumption that the lower&#8208;level structures (tiles) determine the higher&#8208;level, final structures. In this study, we present concrete experimental data to show that higher&#8208;level structures could, at least in the current example, also impact on the formation of lower&#8208;level structures. This study prompts questions such as: how general is this phenomenon in programmed DNA self&#8208;assembly and can we turn it into a useful tool for fine tuning DNA self&#8208;assembly?

         <title>Lectin Drug Conjugates Targeting High Mannose N&#8208;Glycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A toxin delivery system that targets the aberrant presentation of high mannose N&#8208;glycans on cancer cells is described. This delivery system leverages lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that were prepared using a high mannose N&#8208;glycan binding lectin that is site specifically functionalized at the C&#8208;terminus with peptide toxin via a sortase ligation. In vitro studies demonstrate that the described LDCs potently and preferentially induce apoptosis in high mannose N&#8208;glycans presenting cancer cells.







Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated alterations to glycosylation have been shown to aid cancer development and progression. An increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been observed in several cancers. Here, we describe the preparation of lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that permit toxin delivery to cancer cells presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Additionally, we demonstrate that cancer cells presenting low levels of high mannose N&#8208;glycans can be rendered sensitive to the LDCs by co&#8208;treatment with a type I mannosidase inhibitor. Our findings establish that an increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans in the glycocalyx of cancer cells can be leveraged to enable toxin delivery.

         <title>Photochemical and Molecular Dynamics Studies of Halide Binding in Flavoenzyme Glucose Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose oxidase (GOX), a characteristic flavoprotein oxidase with widespread industrial applications, binds fluoride (F  &#8722;  ) and chloride (Cl  &#8722;  ).

         <title>Investigating Peptide&#8208;Coenzyme A Conjugates as Chemical Probes for Proteomic Profiling of N&#8208;Terminal and Lysine Acetyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;terminal (NAT) and lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) acetylate protein N&#8208;termini and lysine side chains, respectively. Immobilized peptide&#8208;coenzyme A conjugates recruit endogenous NAT and KAT complexes from cellular lysates. Our chemoproteomics analysis showed strong preferences of NAT complexes for N&#8208;terminal coenzyme A conjugated peptide probes enabling future investigations into changes in composition, modification, and activity states.







Abstract
Acetyl groups are transferred from acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A (Ac&#8208;CoA) to protein N&#8208;termini and lysine side chains by N&#8208;terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), respectively. Building on lysine&#8208;CoA conjugates as KAT probes, we have synthesized peptide probes with CoA conjugated to N&#8208;terminal alanine (&#945;&#8208;Ala&#8208;CoA), proline (&#945;&#8208;Pro&#8208;CoA) or tri&#8208;glutamic acid (&#945;&#8208;3Glu&#8208;CoA) units for interactome profiling of NAT complexes. The &#945;&#8208;Ala&#8208;CoA probe enriched the majority of NAT catalytic and auxiliary subunits, while a lysine CoA&#8208;conjugate bound only a subset of endogenous KATs. Interactome profiling with the &#945;&#8208;Pro&#8208;CoA probe showed reduced NAT recruitment in favor of metabolic CoA binding proteins and &#945;&#8208;3Glu&#8208;CoA steered the interactome towards NAA80 and NatB. These findings agreed with the inherent substrate specificities of the target proteins and showed that N&#8208;terminal CoA&#8208;conjugated peptides are versatile probes for NAT complex profiling in lysates of physiological and pathological backgrounds.

         <title>Replacing Commercial 6&#8208;Phosphofructokinase in an Online Pyrophosphate Detection Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi&#8208;PFK) is crucial to a coupled assay that measures the release of pyrophosphate by adenylation (A) domains. We show that recombinantly expressed and purified PPi&#8208;PFK can replace the now discontinued commercial source of this enzyme.







Abstract
Detection of pyrophosphate is important in quantifying enzyme activity, particularly adenylation domain activity during non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthesis. The previous development of an enzyme coupled PPi/NADH assay allowed the measurement of such activity in an online fashion using commercially available components. Now, with a key enzyme &#8208; 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase &#8208; no longer available, we have screened and identified viable replacement enzymes that can be expressed in high yield and that are far superior in activity to the now discontinued commercial product. This will support the ability of groups to continue to use this established online assay for pyrophosphate detection.

         <title>Selective Exoenzymatic Labeling of Lipooligosaccharides of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with &#945;2,6&#8208;Sialoside Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between bacteria and their host often rely on recognition processes that involve host or bacterial glycans. Glycoengineering techniques make it possible to modify and study the glycans on the host&#8217;s eukaryotic cells, but only a few are available for the study of bacterial glycans. Here, we have adapted selective exoenzymatic labeling (SEEL), a chemical reporter strategy, to label the lipooligosaccharides of the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae, using the recombinant glycosyltransferase ST6Gal1, and three synthetic CMP&#8208;sialic acid derivatives. We show that SEEL treatment does not affect cell viability and can introduce an &#945;2,6&#8208;linked sialic acid with a reporter group on the lipooligosaccharides by Western blot, flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. This new bacterial glycoengineering technique allows for the precise modification, here with &#945;2,6&#8208;sialoside derivatives, and direct detection of specific surface glycans on live bacteria, which will aid in further unravelling the precise biological functions of bacterial glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Feruloyl Esterases Protein Engineering to Enhance Their Performance as Biocatalysts: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to enhance enzymes performance is presented in this review. Analyses of the current protein engineering strategies that have been used to improve feruloyl esterases in terms of thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and selectivity are discussed. The result is a framework that suggests the direction of feruloyl esterases protein engineering to generate robust industrial biocatalysts.







Abstract
Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) are versatile enzymes able to release hydroxycinnamic acids or synthesize their ester derivatives, both molecules with interesting biological activities such as: antioxidants, antifungals, antivirals, antifibrotic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, among others. The importance of these molecules in medicine, food or cosmetic industries provides FAEs with several biotechnological applications as key industrial biocatalysts. However, FAEs have some operational limitations that must be overcome, which can be addressed through different protein engineering approaches to enhance their thermal stability, catalytic efficiencies, and selectivity. This review aims to present a brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to improve enzymes performance and analyze the current protein engineering strategies applied to FAEs as interesting biocatalysts. Finally, an outlook of the future of FAEs protein engineering approaches to achieve successful industrial biocatalysts is given.

         <title>Honeybee Iflaviruses Pack Specific tRNA Fragments from Host Cells in Their Virions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
tRNA fragments in +ssRNA viruses: To reveal typical RNA modifications in viral genomic/mRNA, we purified RNA from Picornavirales and analyzed it using LC&#8211;MS, RNA&#8208;seq and Northern blots. While 1&#8208;methyladenosine and 5&#8208;methylcytidine were not detected in viral genomic RNA, we discovered that viral particles selectively co&#8208;pack host tRNA fragments.







Abstract
The Picornavirales include viruses that infect vertebrates, insects, and plants. It was believed that they pack only their genomic mRNA in the particles; thus, we envisaged these viruses as excellent model systems for studies of mRNA modifications. We used LC&#8211;MS to analyze digested RNA isolated from particles of the sacbrood and deformed wing iflaviruses as well as of the echovirus 18 and rhinovirus 2 picornaviruses. Whereas in the picornavirus RNAs we detected only N6&#8208;methyladenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylated nucleosides, the iflavirus RNAs contained a wide range of methylated nucleosides, such as 1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) and 5&#8208;methylcytidine (m5C). Mapping of m1A and m5C through RNA sequencing of the SBV and DWV RNAs revealed the presence of tRNA molecules. Both modifications were detected only in tRNA. Further analysis revealed that tRNAs are present in form of 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; fragments and they are packed selectively. Moreover, these tRNAs are typically packed by other viruses.

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine and 2&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylated nucleosides, the iflavirus RNAs contained a wide range of methylated nucleosides, such as 1-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A) and 5-methylcytidine (m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C). Mapping of m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A and m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C through RNA sequencing of the SBV and DWV RNAs revealed the presence of tRNA molecules. Both modifications were detected only in tRNA. Further analysis revealed that tRNAs are present in form of 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; fragments and they are packed selectively. Moreover, these tRNAs are typically packed by other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bacterial Peroxidase on Electrochemically Reduced Graphene Oxide for Highly Sensitive H2O2 Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial peroxidase (BsDyP) from the &#8220;dye&#8208;decolorizing&#8221; family was immobilized on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers to create a mechanically robust biosensor with a shelf&#8208;life of eight weeks. This biosensor was characterized for the highly selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide (linearity 0.05&#8211;280&#8197;&#956;M, LOD 32&#8197;nM).







Abstract
Peroxidase enzymes enable the construction of electrochemical sensors for highly sensitive and selective quantitative detection of various molecules, pathogens and diseases. Herein, we describe the immobilization of a peroxidase from Bacillus s. (BsDyP) on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers. XRD, SEM, AFM, FT&#8208;IR and Raman characterization of the sensor confirmed its structural integrity and a higher enzyme surface occupancy. The BsDyP&#8208;ERGO/ITO/PET electrode performed better than other horseradish peroxidase&#8208;based electrodes, as evinced by an improved electrochemical response in the nanomolar range (linearity 0.05&#8211;280&#8197;&#956;M of H2O2, LOD 32&#8197;nM). The bioelectrode was mechanically robust, active in the 3.5&#8211;6&#8197;pH range and exhibited no loss of activity upon storage for 8&#8197;weeks at 4&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Chemical Conjugation to Less Targeted Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective conjugation to the multitude of functional groups at the surface of proteins is challenging. Most commonly lysine, cysteine or tyrosine are targeted, however in recent years a range of innovative methods have been developed to selectively target other amino acids at proteins and these methods are the focus of this review.







Abstract
Protein bioconjugates are in high demand for applications in biomedicine, diagnostics, chemical biology and bionanotechnology. Proteins are large and sensitive molecules containing multiple different functional groups and in particular nucleophilic groups. In bioconjugation reactions it can therefore be challenging to obtain a homogeneous product in high yield. Numerous strategies for protein conjugation have been developed, of which a vast majority target lysine, cysteine and to a lesser extend tyrosine. Likewise, several methods that involve recombinantly engineered protein tags have been reported. In recent years a number of methods have emerged for chemical bioconjugation to other amino acids and in this review, we present the progress in this area.

         <title>Intramolecular Covalent Bonds in Gram&#8208;Positive Bacterial Surface Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;positive bacteria have evolved a variety of intramolecular covalent bonds that are found to play important mechanical roles for stabilizing host infection. Studying the proteins containing these unusual covalent bond yields rich information about the mechanical design of these proteins and inspires the design of novel antibiotics and bioengineering tools.







Abstract
Gram&#8208;positive bacteria experience considerable mechanical perturbation when adhering to host surfaces during colonization and infection. They have evolved various adhesion proteins that are mechanically robust to ensure strong surface adhesion. Recently, it was discovered that these adhesion proteins contain rare, extra intramolecular covalent bonds that stabilize protein structures and participate in surface bonding. These intramolecular covalent bonds include isopeptides, thioesters, and ester bonds, which often form spontaneously without the need for additional enzymes. With the development of single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy techniques, the detailed mechanical roles of these intramolecular covalent bonds have been revealed. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in this area of research, focusing on the link between the mechanical stability and function of these covalent bonds in Gram&#8208;positive bacterial surface proteins. We also highlight the potential impact of these discoveries on the development of novel antibiotics and chemical biology tools.

         <title>Fragment Screening Yields a Small&#8208;Molecule Stabilizer of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Dimers That Modulates Client Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment library screen identified fragment 2 as a novel non&#8208;covalent protein&#8208;protein interaction stabilizer targeting 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 dimers. Fragment 2 can act cooperatively with Fusicoccin&#8208;A, resulting in enhanced binding to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client proteins such as the estrogen receptor alpha.







Abstract
The development of protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors has been a successful strategy in drug development. However, the identification of PPI stabilizers has proven much more challenging. Here we report a fragment&#8208;based drug screening approach using the regulatory hub&#8208;protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 as a platform for identifying PPI stabilizers. A homogenous time&#8208;resolved FRET assay was used to monitor stabilization of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/peptide binding using the known interaction partner estrogen receptor alpha. Screening of an in&#8208;house fragment library identified fragment 2 (VUF15640) as a putative PPI stabilizer capable of cooperatively stabilizing 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPIs in a cooperative fashion with Fusicoccin&#8208;A. Mechanistically, fragment 2 appears to enhance 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 dimerization leading to increased client&#8208;protein binding. Functionally, fragment 2 enhanced potency of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 in a cell&#8208;free system inhibiting the enzyme activity of the nitrate reductase. In conclusion, we identified a general PPI stabilizer targeting 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, which could be used as a tool compound for investigating 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client protein interactions.

         <title>Selective and Reversible Ligand Assembly on the DNA and RNA Repeat Sequences in Myotonic Dystrophy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules that selectively bind to and reversibly assemble on the DNA and RNA sequences that are the causative agent of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) were developed. The combination of dialdehyde and diamine inhibited the formation of toxic RNA in&#8197;vitro and rescued mis&#8208;splicing in DM1 model cells.







Abstract
Small molecule targeting of DNA and RNA sequences has come into focus as a therapeutic strategy for diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a trinucleotide repeat disease characterized by RNA gain&#8208;of&#8208;function. Herein, we report a novel template&#8208;selected, reversible assembly of therapeutic agents in&#8197;situ via aldehyde&#8208;amine condensation. Rationally designed small molecule targeting agents functionalized with either an aldehyde or an amine were synthesized and screened against the target nucleic acid sequence. The assembly of fragments was confirmed by MALDI&#8208;MS in the presence of DM1&#8208;relevant nucleic acid sequences. The resulting hit combinations of aldehyde and amine inhibited the formation of r(CUG)exp in&#8197;vitro in a cooperative manner at low micromolar levels and rescued mis&#8208;splicing defects in DM1 model cells. This reversible template&#8208;selected assembly is a promising approach to achieve cell permeable and multivalent targeting via in&#8197;situ synthesis and could be applied to other nucleic acid targets.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small molecule targeting of DNA and RNA sequences has come into focus as a therapeutic strategy for diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a trinucleotide repeat disease characterized by RNA gain-of-function. Herein, we report a novel template-selected, reversible assembly of therapeutic agents &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; via aldehyde-amine condensation. Rationally designed small molecule targeting agents functionalized with either an aldehyde or an amine were synthesized and screened against the target nucleic acid sequence. The assembly of fragments was confirmed by MALDI-MS in the presence of DM1-relevant nucleic acid sequences. The resulting hit combinations of aldehyde and amine inhibited the formation of r(CUG)&lt;sup&gt;exp&lt;/sup&gt; in&#8197;vitro in a cooperative manner at low micromolar levels and rescued mis-splicing defects in DM1 model cells. This reversible template-selected assembly is a promising approach to achieve cell permeable and multivalent targeting via &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; synthesis and could be applied to other nucleic acid targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Functionalized with Fucoidan: a Potential Theranostic Nanotool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were functionalized with fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide. NP cellular uptake was quantified by magnetic measurement at various extracellular iron concentrations. Cell invasion and migration were reduced with NPs. Concomitantly, a high decrease of reactive oxygen species production related with a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 activity and an increase of its expression was observed. Proteomic analysis showed that some fucoidan regulated proteins appeared related to protein synthesis, N&#8208;glycan processing, and cellular stress. These results pave the way for USPIO&#8208;fucoidan&#8208;NPs as potential theranostic nanotools for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Geinguenaud et al.

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;Water Droplets Selectively Uptake Self&#8208;Assembled DNA Nano/Microstructures: a Versatile Method for Purification in DNA Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;rich droplets are generated in a polyethylene glycol&#8208;rich phase via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. This study demonstrates that the dextran&#8208;rich droplets can selectively uptake DNA nano/microstructures based on size and shape. This property is explored for constructing a versatile method for purifying DNA nano/microstructures. This method can be applied to various DNA nano/microstructures, including hexagons, triangles, and fibers, with a high yield and short preparation time. This picture shows the time variation of a spherical dextran&#8208;rich droplet capturing DNA nano/microstructures. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Takinoue et&#8197;al.

         <title>Inactivation Mechanism of the Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Inhibitor BIA 10&#8208;2474</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BIA 10&#8208;2474 is a time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase(FAAH) that was under clinical development for the treatment of neurological conditions when the program was terminated after one subject died and four were hospitalized with neurological symptoms during a first&#8208;in&#8208;human clinical study.
The present manuscript describes the mechanism of FAAH inhibition by BIA 10&#8208;2474 as a target&#8208;specific covalent inhibition, supported by quantum mechanics and molecular modelling studies. The inhibitor incorporates a weakly reactive electrophile which, upon specific binding to the enzyme's active site, is positioned to react readily with the catalytic residues. The reactivity is enhanced on&#8208;site by the increased molarity at the reaction site and by specific inductive interactions with FAAH. In the second stage, the inhibitor reacts with the enzyme's catalytic nucleophile to form a covalent enzyme&#8208;inhibitor adduct. The hydrolysis of this adduct is shown to be unlikely under physiological conditions, therefore leading to irreversible inactivation of FAAH.
The results also reveal the important role played by FAAH Thr236 in the reaction with BIA 10&#8208;2474, which is specific to FAAH and is not present in other serine hydrolases.</dc:description>

         <title>Tyramine Derivatives Catalyze the Aldol Dimerization of Butyraldehyde in the Presence of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial amine organocatalysis: Biogenic amines derived from L&#8208;tyrosine were found to catalyze the biocompatible self&#8208;aldol dimerization of butanal in the presence of Escherichia coli. Cell lysates from both E. coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum were also found to catalyze this reaction in&#8197;vitro. Under biocompatible conditions, the product enal was reduced to 2&#8208;ethylhexanal via endogenous reductases.







Abstract
Biogenic amine organocatalysts have transformed the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Yet despite their use in synthesis and to label biomolecules in&#8197;vitro, amine organocatalysis in&#8197;vivo has received comparatively little attention &#8211; despite the potential of such reactions to be interfaced with living cells and to modify cellular metabolites. Herein we report that biogenic amines derived from L&#8208;tyrosine catalyze the self&#8208;aldol condensation of butanal to 2&#8208;ethylhexenal &#8211; a key intermediate in the production of the bulk chemical 2&#8208;ethylhexanol &#8211; in the presence of living Escherichia coli and outperform many amine organocatalysts currently used in synthetic organic chemistry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell lysate from E. coli and the prolific amine overproducer Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 catalyze this reaction in&#8197;vitro, demonstrating the potential for microbial metabolism to be used as a source of organocatalysts for biocompatible reactions in cells.

The N&#8208;cap makes the difference: Aiming at the development of potential COVID&#8208;19 drugs distorting the interaction between the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and human ACE2, a series of N&#8208;capped peptides derived from the &#945;1&#8208;helix of ACE2 were prepared to increase the &#945;&#8208;helical content. This led to the discovery of a comparably short peptide binding to the spike protein with high affinity (KD=62&#8197;nM).







Abstract
During viral cell entry, the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to the &#945;1&#8208;helix motif of human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2). Thus, alpha&#8208;helical peptides mimicking this motif may serve as inhibitors of viral cell entry. For this purpose, we employed the rigidified diproline&#8208;derived module ProM&#8208;5 to induce &#945;&#8208;helicity in short peptide sequences inspired by the ACE2 &#945;1&#8208;helix. Starting with Ac&#8208;QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ&#8208;NH2 as a relevant section of &#945;1, a series of peptides, N&#8208;capped with either Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;[ProM&#8208;5] or Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;PP, were prepared and their &#945;&#8208;helicities were investigated. While ProM&#8208;5 clearly showed a pronounced effect, an even increased degree of helicity (up to 63&#8201;%) was observed in sequences in which non&#8208;binding amino acids were replaced by alanine. The binding affinities of the peptides towards the spike protein, as determined by means of microscale thermophoresis (MST), revealed only a subtle influence of the &#945;&#8208;helical content and, noteworthy, led to the identification of an Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;PP&#8208;capped peptide displaying a very strong binding affinity (KD=62&#8197;nM).

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Human Cancer Proteins Using Microprocessor Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microchip&#8208;based substrates and high&#8208;resolution imaging technology were used to resolve full&#8208;length p53 structures from human cancer cells for the first time.







Abstract
Mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), are heavily implicated in aggressive cancers giving rise to gain&#8208; and loss&#8208;of&#8208;function phenotypes. While individual domains of the p53 protein have been studied extensively, structural information for full&#8208;length p53 remains incomplete. Functionalized microprocessor chips (microchips) with properties amenable to electron microscopy permitted us to visualize complete p53 assemblies for the first time. The new structures revealed p53 in an inactive dimeric state independent of DNA binding. Residues located at the protein&#8208;protein interface corresponded with modification sites in cancer&#8208;related hot spots. Changes in these regions may amplify the toxic effects of clinical mutations. Taken together, these results contribute advances in technology and imaging approaches to decode native protein models in different states of activation.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Design and Evaluation of Heterobifunctional Tools: Applications to Protein Localization and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as a rocket enables the exploration of space, heterobifunctional tools allow us to probe the mysteries of biology. We have developed a powerful, microscopy&#8208;based assay to optimize the linkers of heterobifunctional tools. This is represented in the cover illustration by a rocket, powered by an optimized linker, setting out from a green, fluorescent planet (GFP) to a planet of interest (POI). We used this tool to induce phase separation, symbolized by stars in the sky. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Zhang, D.&#8197;M. Chenoweth et&#8197;al.

         <title>Trace&#8208;Level Phenolics Detection Based on Composite PAN&#8208;MWCNTs Nanofibers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrospun nanofiber mat consisting of polyacrylonitrile and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes was employed as an immobilization matrix in tyrosinase&#8208;based biosensors. The biosensors were very successful in trace&#8208;level detection of mono&#8208; and diphenol derivatives in water samples.







Abstract
In view of major concerns regarding toxicity (genotoxic, mutagenic, hepatotoxic) of phenolics, there is an on&#8208;going necessity for sensitive and accurate analytical procedures for detection and measurements in environmental field, water, and food quality control. The current study proposes composite polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous assemblies enriched with multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (PAN&#8208;MWCNTs NFs) as suitable immobilization platforms for cross&#8208;linking of tyrosinase in detection of both diphenols and monophenols, which are of much interest in water contamination. The prepared biosensor (Pt/PAN&#8208;MWCNTs/Tyr) showed high sensitivity in catechol detection (362.5&#8197;mA/M.cm2) and moderate sensitivity for the two monophenols (phenol, p&#8208;chlorophenol) with 14.79 and 25.46&#8197;mA/M.cm2, respectively. The LOD values of the sensor were in the nanomolar range: 4.42&#215;10&#8722;9, 4.06&#215;10&#8722;7 and 1.05&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M for catechol, phenol and p&#8208;chlorophenol, respectively, allowing detection of trace amounts of phenolics in spiked water samples.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Continuous Spectroscopic Assay to Measure the Activity of Natural Product Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule methylation catalyzed by natural product methyltransferases (NPMTs) carries a tremendous potential to improve bioactivity and bioavailability of natural products. To assist with the expansion of available NPMTs, we present a high&#8208;throughput continuous assay for the rapid and reliable detection of methyltransferase activity for small molecules.







Abstract
Natural product methyltransferases (NPMTs) represent an emerging class of enzymes that can be of great use for the structural and functional diversification of bioactive compounds, such as the strategic modification of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;moieties. To assess the activity and the substrate scope of the ever&#8208;expanding repertoire of NPMTs, a simple, fast, and robust assay is needed. Here, we report a continuous spectroscopic assay, in which S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methylation is linked to NADH oxidation through the coupled activities of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) deaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase. The assay is highly suitable for a high&#8208;throughput evaluation of small molecule methylation and for determining the catalytic parameters of NPMTs under conditions that remove the potent inhibition by SAH. Through the modular design, the assay can be extended to match the needs of different aspects of methyltransferase cascade reactions and respective applications.

         <title>Regioselective Biocatalytic C4&#8208;Prenylation of Unprotected Tryptophan Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C4&#8208;regioselective prenylation of 5&#8208;substituted tryptophans as well as truncated tryptophan derivatives was achieved using a set of prenlyltransferases. Conversions were increased by designing improved variants and the feasibility of preparative transformations was successfully demonstrated reaching isolated yields up to 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation belongs to the challenging tasks in organic synthesis. In this context, C&#8722;C bond formation catalyzed by 4&#8208;dimethylallyltryptophan synthases (4&#8208;DMATSs) represents a possible tool to regioselectively synthesize C4&#8208;prenylated indole derivatives without site&#8208;specific preactivation and circumventing the need of protection groups as used in chemical synthetic approaches. In this study, a toolbox of 4&#8208;DMATSs to produce a set of 4&#8208;dimethylallyl tryptophan and indole derivatives was identified. Using three wild&#8208;type enzymes as well as variants, various C5&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives as well as N&#8208;methyl tryptophan were successfully prenylated with conversions up to 90&#8201;%. Even truncated tryptophan derivatives like tryptamine and 3&#8208;indole propanoic acid were regioselectively prenylated in position C4. The acceptance of C5&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives was improved up to 5&#8208;fold by generating variants (e.&#8201;g. T108S). The feasibility of semi&#8208;preparative prenylation of selected tryptophan derivatives was successfully demonstrated on 100&#8197;mg scale at 15&#8197;mM substrate concentration, allowing to reduce the previously published multistep chemical synthetic sequence to just a single step.

         <title>BioWF: A Naturally&#8208;Fused, Di&#8208;Domain Biocatalyst from Biotin Biosynthesis Displays an Unexpectedly Broad Substrate Scope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BioWF fusion biocatalyst can convert various fatty acid substrates to &#945;&#8208;oxoamine (AON) products. The ATP&#8208;dependent BioW domain catalyses formation of an acyl&#8208;CoA thioester intermediate. The pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent BioF domain then accepts various amino acids and catalyses the formation of a range of aminoketone analogues.







Abstract
The carbon backbone of biotin is constructed from the C7 di&#8208;acid pimelate, which is converted to an acyl&#8208;CoA thioester by an ATP&#8208;dependent, pimeloyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (PCAS, encoded by BioW). The acyl&#8208;thioester is condensed with &#671;&#8208;alanine in a decarboxylative, Claisen&#8208;like reaction to form an aminoketone (8&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;oxononanoic acid, AON). This step is catalysed by the pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme (AON synthase, AONS, encoded by BioF). Distinct versions of Bacillus subtilis BioW (BsBioW) and E. coli BioF (EcBioF) display strict substrate specificity. In contrast, a BioW&#8208;BioF fusion from Corynebacterium amycolatum (CaBioWF) accepts a wider range of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;fatty acids. Analysis of the active site of the BsBioW : pimeloyl&#8208;adenylate complex suggested a key role for a Phe (F192) residue in the CaBioW domain; a F192Y mutant restored the substrate specificity to pimelate. This surprising substrate flexibility also extends to the CaBioF domain, which accepts &#671;&#8208;alanine, &#671;&#8208;serine and glycine. Structural models of the CaBioWF fusion provide insight into how both domains interact with each other and suggest the presence of an intra&#8208;domain tunnel. The CaBioWF fusion catalyses conversion of various fatty acids and amino acids to a range of AON derivatives. Such unexpected, natural broad substrate scope suggests that the CaBioWF fusion is a versatile biocatalyst that can be used to prepare a number of aminoketone analogues.

         <title>Multivalent &#947;&#8208;PGA&#8208;Exendin&#8208;4 Conjugates to Target Pancreatic &#946;&#8208;Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exendin&#8208;4&#8208;&#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid conjugates have been generated by efficient Diels&#8208;Alder click reaction. The highly functionalized conjugate (average 106 Exendin&#8208;4 molecules/&#947;&#8208;Polyglutamic acid) showed affinity towards GLP1 receptor higher with respect to Enendin&#8208;4 a labile peptide approved for type 2 diabetes treatment.







Abstract
Targeting of glucagon&#8208;like peptide 1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R), expressed on the surface of pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells, is of great interest for the development of advanced therapies for diabetes and diagnostics for insulinoma. We report the conjugation of exendin&#8208;4 (Ex&#8208;4), an approved drug to treat type 2 diabetes, to poly&#8208;&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid (&#947;&#8208;PGA) to obtain more stable and effective GLP&#8208;1R ligands. Exendin&#8208;4 modified at Lysine&#8208;27 with PEG4&#8208;maleimide was conjugated to &#947;&#8208;PGA functionalized with furan, in different molar ratios, exploiting a chemoselective Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition. The &#947;&#8208;PGA presenting the highest number of conjugated Ex&#8208;4 molecules (average 120 per polymeric chain) showed a double affinity towards GLP&#8208;1R with respect to exendin per se, paving the way to improved therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Membrane Disruptive Action of Cationic Antibacterial Peptide B1CTcu3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B1CTcu3, an &#945;&#8208;helical peptide identified from the skin secretion of Clinotarsus curtipes exhibited a broad range of antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. It also exhibits anti&#8208;biofilm properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. B1CTcu3 induces pores on the bacterial membrane which leads to the killing of bacteria.







Abstract
A twenty&#8208;two&#8208;residue peptide Brevinin1 Clinotarsus curtipus&#8208;3 (B1CTcu3), identified from the skin secretion of frog Clinotarsus curtipes of the Western Ghats, exhibited a broad range of antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It showed anti&#8208;biofilm activity even at sub&#8208;minimum inhibitory concentration (sub&#8208;MIC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Analysis of the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, confocal images, flow cytometric data and the effect of salt concentration on antibacterial potency suggests that the killing action of the peptide is through the membranolytic process. Single channel electric recording confirmed that the peptide elicited pores on the bacterial cell membrane as it induces a heterogeneous channel in the lipid bilayer. It also showed cytotoxicity against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cell with IC50 of 25&#8197;&#956;M. B1CTcu3 peptide could serve as the template for next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents, particularly against antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria.

         <title>Determination of Amide cis/trans Isomers in N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine: Tailored NMR Analysis of the N&#8208;Acetyl Group Conformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

The N&#8208;acetyl group of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) is defined by two torsion angles, &#952;1 and &#952;2, where &#952;2 defines the amide bond orientation which enables cis&#8208;trans isomerization (CTI). This is the first identification of NH protons of the amide cis isomers of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc, which has allowed conformational analysis of these isomers based on J&#8208;couplings within the N&#8208;acetyl group.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) is one of the most common amino sugars in nature, but the conformation of its N&#8208;acetyl group has drawn little attention. We report herein the first identification of NH protons of the amide cis forms of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc by NMR spectroscopy. Relative quantification and thermodynamic analysis of both cis and trans forms was carried out in aqueous solution. The NH protons were further utilized by adapting protein NMR experiments to measure eight J&#8208;couplings within the N&#8208;acetyl group, of which six are sensitive to the H2&#8208;NH conformation and two are sensitive to the amide conformation. For amide cis and trans forms, the orientation between H2 and NH was determined as anti conformation, while a small percentage of syn conformation was predicted for the amide trans form of &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc. This approach holds great promise for the detailed conformational analysis of GlcNAc in larger biomolecules, such as glycoproteins and polysaccharides.

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Functionalized with Fucoidan: a Potential Theranostic Nanotool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small super&#8208;paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO NPs) were functionalized with fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide mimicking glycosaminoglycans, to obtain a potential theranostic nanotool for hepatocellular carcinoma. The USPIO NPs act as vehicle and magnetic label to control fucoidan loading within cells.







Abstract
Fucoidan is a natural sulfated polysaccharide with a large range of biological activities including anticancer and anti&#8208;oxidation activities. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fourth most common aggressive cancer type. The aim of this study was to investigate the bioactivity of free fucoidan versus its vectorization using nanoparticles (NPs) in human hepatoma cells, Huh&#8208;7. Iron oxide NPs were functionalized with fucoidan by a one&#8208;step surface complexation. NP cellular uptake was quantified by magnetic measurement at various extracellular iron concentrations. Cell invasion and migration were reduced with NPs while free fucoidan increases these events at low fucoidan concentration (&#8804;0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Concomitantly, a high decrease of reactive oxygen species production related with a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 activity and an increase of its expression was observed with NPs compared to free fucoidan. A proteomic analysis evidenced that some fucoidan regulated proteins appeared, which were related to protein synthesis, N&#8208;glycan processing, and cellular stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study which reveals such activity induced by fucoidan. These results pave the way for USPIO&#8208;fucoidan&#8208;NPs as potential theranostic nanotools for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.

         <title>Regulating Spatial Localization and Reactivity Biasness of DNAzymes by Metal Ions and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique macroscopic spatially controlled, non&#8208;equilibrium sensing and catalytic behavior for the G&#8208;quadruplex based DNAzyme towards substrate and inhibitor concentration gradient along with its modulation in an environment with non&#8208;catalytic aptamer is reported. This unique reaction&#8208;diffusion based organizational and catalytic heterogeneity of DNAzyme in space will show new insights in the area of spatially controlled surface chemistry, bio&#8208;patterning and DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Chemical gradient sensing behavior of catalytically active colloids and enzymes is an area of immense interest owing to their importance in understanding fundamental spatiotemporal complexity patterns in living systems and designing dynamic materials. Herein, we have shown the peroxidase activity of DNAzyme (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;hemin complex tagged in a micron&#8208;sized glass bead) can be modulated by metal ions and metal ion&#8208;binding oligonucleotides. Next we demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically, that the localization and product formation ability of the DNAzyme&#8208;containing particle remains biased to the more catalytically active zone where the concentration of metal ion (Hg2+) inhibitor is low. Interestingly, this biased localization can be broken by introduction of Hg2+ binding oligonucleotide in the system. Additionally, a macroscopically asymmetric catalytic product distributed zone has been achieved with this process, showing the possibility of regulation in autonomous spatially controlled chemical processes. This demonstration of autonomous modulation of the localization pattern and spatially specific enhanced product forming ability of DNAzymes will further enable the design of responsive nucleic acid&#8208;based motile materials and surfaces.

         <title>Generation of Photocaged Nanobodies for Intracellular Applications in an Animal Using Genetic Code Expansion and Computationally Guided Protein Engineering
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;activated nanobodies for intracellular use were created using a combination of genetic code expansion and computationally guided engineering of the binding interface. The engineered nanobodies allow optical control of subcellular protein localisation in living Caenorhabditis elegans.







Abstract
Nanobodies are becoming increasingly popular as tools for manipulating and visualising proteins in&#8197;vivo. The ability to control nanobody/antigen interactions using light could provide precise spatiotemporal control over protein function. We develop a general approach to engineer photo&#8208;activatable nanobodies using photocaged amino acids that are introduced into the target binding interface by genetic code expansion. Guided by computational alanine scanning and molecular dynamics simulations, we tune nanobody/target binding affinity to eliminate binding before uncaging. Upon photo&#8208;activation using 365&#8197;nm light, binding is restored. We use this approach to generate improved photocaged variants of two anti&#8208;GFP nanobodies that function robustly when directly expressed in a complex intracellular environment together with their antigen. We apply them to control subcellular protein localisation in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Our approach applies predictions derived from computational modelling directly in a living animal and demonstrates the importance of accounting for in&#8197;vivo effects on protein&#8208;protein interactions.

         <title>Tying Up a Loose End: On the Role of the C&#8208;Terminal CCHHRAG Fragment of the Metalloregulator CueR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8208;terminal &#8220;tail&#8221; of CueR does not influence the overall structure of the protein and the structure of the functional metal site but significantly affects the binding affinity for monovalent metal ions, despite being disordered and relatively remote, i.&#8201;e. beyond the second coordination sphere of AgI coordinated at the functional metal binding loop.







Abstract
The transcriptional regulator CueR is activated by the binding of CuI, AgI, or AuI to two cysteinates in a near&#8208;linear fashion. The C&#8208;terminal CCHHRAG sequence in Escherichia coli CueR present potential additional metal binding ligands and here we explore the effect of deleting this fragment on the binding of AgI to CueR. CD spectroscopic and ESI&#8208;MS data indicate that the high AgI&#8208;binding affinity of WT&#8208;CueR is significantly reduced in &#916;7C&#8208;CueR.[111 Ag PAC spectroscopy demonstrates that the WT&#8208;CueR metal site structure (AgS2) is conserved, but less populated in the truncated variant. Thus, the function of the C&#8208;terminal fragment may be to stabilize the two&#8208;coordinate metal site for cognate monovalent metal ions. In a broader perspective this is an example of residues beyond the second coordination sphere affecting metal site physicochemical properties while leaving the structure unperturbed.

Thus, the function of the C-terminal fragment may be to stabilize the two-coordinate metal site for cognate monovalent metal ions. In a broader perspective this is an example of residues beyond the second coordination sphere affecting metal site physicochemical properties while leaving the structure unperturbed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recombinant l&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase with Broad Substrate Spectrum for Co&#8208;substrate Recycling in (S)&#8208;Selective Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolutions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient co&#8208;substrate recycling system consisting of a heterologous expressed and highly active l&#8208;amino acid oxidase combined with a catalase was applied for kinetic resolutions to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;amines in &#969;&#8208;(S)&#8208;transaminase catalyzed reactions. Consequently, catalytic instead of stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;substrate can be applied in preparative scale reactions.







Abstract
Chiral and enantiopure amines can be produced by enantioselective transaminases via kinetic resolution of amine racemates. This transamination reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;substrate. A dual&#8208;enzyme recycling system overcomes this limitation: l&#8208;amino acid oxidases (LAAO) recycle the accumulating co&#8208;product of (S)&#8208;selective transaminases in the kinetic resolution of racemic amines to produce pure (R)&#8208;amines. However, availability of suitable LAAOs is limited. Here we use the heterologously produced, highly active fungal hcLAAO4 with broad substrate spectrum. H2O2 as byproduct of hcLAAO4 is detoxified by a catalase. The final system allows using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of 1&#8197;mol% of the transaminase co&#8208;substrate as well as the initial application of l&#8208;amino acids instead of &#945;&#8208;keto acids. With an optimized protocol, the synthetic potential of this kinetic resolution cascade was proven at the preparative scale (&gt;90&#8197;mg) by the synthesis of highly enantiomerically pure (R)&#8208;methylbenzylamine (&gt;99&#8201;%ee) at complete conversion (50&#8201;%).

         <title>Tailored Phenyl Esters Inhibit ClpXP and Attenuate Staphylococcus aureus &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Secretion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibitory activity and stability of phenyl esters for chemical inhibition of the ClpXP&#8208;complex were systemically tailored. The new generation inhibitors show enhanced hydrolytic stability, while retaining inhibitory potency. Furthermore, this inhibition evidently reduces secretion of a major virulence factor (&#945;&#8208;hemolsyin) in Staphylococcus aureus while the inhibitors did not exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity against human and bacterial cells.







Abstract
Novel strategies against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria are urgently needed in order to overcome the current silent pandemic. Manipulation of toxin production in pathogenic species serves as a promising approach to attenuate virulence and prevent infections. In many bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocyotgenes, serine protease ClpXP is a key contributor to virulence and thus represents a prime target for antimicrobial drug discovery. The limited stability of previous electrophilic warheads has prevented a sustained effect of virulence attenuation in bacterial culture. Here, we systematically tailor the stability and inhibitory potency of phenyl ester ClpXP inhibitors by steric shielding of the ester bond and fine&#8208;tuning the phenol leaving group. Out of 17 derivatives, two (MAS&#8208;19 and MAS&#8208;30) inhibited S. aureus ClpP peptidase and ClpXP protease activities by &gt;60&#8201;% at 1&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the novel inhibitors did not exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity against human and bacterial cells. Unlike the first generation phenylester AV170, these molecules attenuated S. aureus virulence markedly and displayed increased stability in aqueous buffer compared to the previous benchmark AV170.

         <title>STAT Protein Thermal Shift Assays to Monitor Protein&#8208;Inhibitor Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STAT proteins are a family of multifaceted transcription factors whose deregulated activity is linked to diseases like cancer and arthritis. To interrogate a selection of STAT inhibitors, we have developed a protein thermal shift assay which serves as a steppingstone between biochemical thermal stability assays and cellular thermal shift assays.







Abstract
STAT3 protein is a sought&#8208;after drug target as it plays a key role in the progression of cancer. Many STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i) have been reported, but accumulating evidence suggests many of these act as off&#8208;target/indirect inhibitors of STAT signaling. Herein, we describe the STAT protein thermal shift assay (PTSA) as a novel target engagement tool, which we used to test the binding of known STAT3i to STAT3 and STAT1. This revealed STATTIC, BP&#8208;1&#8208;102, and Cpd188 destabilized both STATs and produced unique migratory patterns on SDS&#8208;PAGE gels, suggesting covalent protein modifications. Mass spectrometry experiments confirmed that these compounds are nonspecifically alkylating STATs, as well as an unrelated protein, NUDT5. These experiments have highlighted the benefits of PTSA to investigate interactions with STAT proteins and have helped reveal the novel reactivity of Cpd188. The described PTSA represents a promising chemical biology tool that could be applied to an array of other protein targets.

         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As exemplified with TZM&#8208;E9, a foldable detergent with an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance is able to form stable micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors. Detergent foldability is favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability and represents a new concept that can be utilized for novel detergent development for membrane protein structural study.







Abstract
Detergents are widely used for membrane protein structural study. Many recently developed detergents contain multiple tail and head groups, which are typically connected via a small and branched linker. Due to their inherent compact structures, with small inter&#8208;alkyl chain distances, these detergents form micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors, a feature favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability. A recent study on tandem triazine maltosides (TZMs) revealed a distinct trend; despite possession of an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance, the TZM&#8722;Es were highly effective at stabilizing membrane proteins. Thanks to the incorporation of a flexible spacer between the two triazine rings in the linker region, these detergents are prone to folding into a compact architecture in micellar environments instead of adopting an extended conformation. Detergent foldability represents a new concept of novel detergent design with significant potential for future detergent development.

         <title>Methyltransferases: Functions and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyltransferases are enzymes that will in the future enable clean and green alkylation of amino and hydroxy groups as well as reactive carbon atoms. These enzymes, their cofactor SAM (S&#8208;adenosylmethionine) and the opportunities&#8217; they offer for new SN2 chemistries are highlighted.







Abstract
In this review the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and SAM are evaluated. Their structural classification and diversity is introduced and key mechanistic aspects presented which are then detailed further. Then, catalytic SAM as a target for drugs, and approaches to utilise SAM as a cofactor in synthesis are introduced with different supply and regeneration approaches evaluated. The use of SAM analogues are also described. Finally O&#8208;, N&#8208;, C&#8208; and S&#8208;MTs, their synthetic applications and potential for compound diversification is given.

These enzymes, their cofactor SAM (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosylmethionine) and the opportunities&#8217; they offer for new S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 chemistries are highlighted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this review the current state-of-the-art of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases and SAM are evaluated. Their structural classification and diversity is introduced and key mechanistic aspects presented which are then detailed further. Then, catalytic SAM as a target for drugs, and approaches to utilise SAM as a cofactor in synthesis are introduced with different supply and regeneration approaches evaluated. The use of SAM analogues are also described. Finally &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MTs, their synthetic applications and potential for compound diversification is given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;Water Droplets Selectively Uptake Self&#8208;Assembled DNA Nano/Microstructures: a Versatile Method for Purification in DNA Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;rich droplets display a selective uptake of DNA structures based on size and shape. This property is explored for creating a versatile protocol for the purification of DNA structures used in DNA nanotechnology. The protocol is applicable to a wide size range of DNA structures, with a high yield and short preparation time.







Abstract
DNA is an excellent material for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures. Owing to the widespread use of DNA as a building block in laboratories and industry, it is desirable to increase the efficiency of all steps involved in producing self&#8208;assembled DNA structures. One of the bottlenecks is the purification required to separate the excess components from the target structures. This paper describes a purification method based on the fractionation by water&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/W) droplets composed of phase&#8208;separated dextran&#8208;rich droplets in a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;rich continuous phase. The dextran&#8208;rich droplets facilitate the selective uptake of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures and allow the separation of the target structure. This study investigates the ability to purify DNA origami, DNA hydrogels, and DNA microtubes. The W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation allows the purification of structures of a broad size spectrum without changes to the protocol. By quantifying the activity of deoxyribozyme&#8208;modified DNA origami after W/W&#8208;droplet purification, this study demonstrates that this method sufficiently preserves the accessibility to the surface of a functional DNA nanostructure. It is considered that the W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation could become one of the standard methods for the purification of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures for biomedical and nanotechnology applications owing to its low cost and simplicity.

         <title>Colorimetric High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Prazole Sulfide Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric high&#8208;throughput screening method for the rapid screening of desired variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity was developed based on distinguishing sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones. Using this method, a CbBVMO variant was identified with improved activity and thermostability, and a 71.3&#8201;% increase in catalyzing the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are important biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of chiral sulfoxides, including chiral sulfoxide&#8208;type proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, native BVMOs are not yet suitable for practical application due to their unsatisfactory activity and thermostability. Although protein engineering approaches can help address these issues, few feasible high&#8208;throughput methods are available for the engineering of such enzymes. Herein, a colorimetric detection method to distinguish sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones was developed for prazole sulfide monooxygenases. Directed evolution enabled by this method has identified a prazole sulfide monooxygenase CbBVMO variant with improved activity and thermostability that catalyzes the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide. A 71.3&#8201;% increase in conversion and 6&#8201;&#176;C enhancement in the melting point were achieved compared with the wild&#8208;type enzyme. This new method is feasible for high&#8208;throughput screening of prazole sulfide monooxygenase variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity.

         <title>Annonaceous Acetogenin Mimic AA005 Inhibits the Growth of TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 Cells by Altering Cell Energy Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annonaceous acetogenins mimic AA005, disrupts both oxidative respiration and aerobic glycolysis in the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468, thus driving the cell energy crisis and exhibiting antitumor activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a serious health issue for women worldwide and there is still no suitable treatment option. AA005, a structurally simplified mimic of natural Annonaceous acetogenins, presents outstanding properties with impressive cytotoxicity and cell&#8208;type selective actions. The present study was aimed at evaluating the potential of AA005 as a therapeutic agent for TNBC. AA005 potently inhibited the growth of TNBC cells at 50&#8197;nM level. Inspired by the finding of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumor suppressor, the effect of AA005 on aerobic glycolysis was investigated in TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells. A short&#8208;term AA005 exposure markedly suppressed mitochondrial function in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells, thus activating the aerobic glycolysis to lessen the risk of decreased ATP generation in mitochondria. Prolonging the incubation time of AA005 clearly weakened the aerobic glycolysis in the cells. This was in part attributed to the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway inactivation and subsequent declined glucose uptake. As a consequence, the energy supply was completely cut from the two major energy&#8208;producing pathways. Further experiments showed that AA005 resulted in irreversible damage on cell activity including cell cycle and growth, inducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and ultimately leading to cell death. In addition, the in&#8197;vivo therapeutic efficacy of AA005 was proved on 4T1 xenograft tumor mice model. Our data demonstrate that AA005 exhibited a great potential for future clinical applications in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Boosted Productivity in Single&#8208;Tile&#8208;Based DNA Polyhedra Assembly by Simple Cation Replacement</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet efficient strategy for avoiding the concentration&#8208;dependent kinetic trap in DNA self&#8208;assembly is proposed. Through substituting monovalent Na+ for conventional divalent Mg2+, we have successfully achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the concentration reported previously.







Abstract
Cations such as divalent magnesium ion (Mg2+) play an essential role in DNA self&#8208;assembly. However, the strong electrostatic shielding effect of Mg2+ would be disadvantageous in some situations that require relatively weak interactions to allow a highly reversible error&#8208;correcting mechanism in the process of assembly. Herein, by substituting the conventional divalent Mg2+ with monovalent sodium ion (Na+), we have achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the DNA concentrations reported previously. This strategy takes advantage of coexisting counterions and is expected to surmount the major obstacle to potential applications of such DNA nanostructures: large&#8208;scale production.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A simple yet efficient&lt;/b&gt; strategy for avoiding the concentration-dependent kinetic trap in DNA self-assembly is proposed. Through substituting monovalent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for conventional divalent Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, we have successfully achieved one-pot high-yield assembly of tile-based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the concentration reported previously.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cations such as divalent magnesium ion (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) play an essential role in DNA self-assembly. However, the strong electrostatic shielding effect of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; would be disadvantageous in some situations that require relatively weak interactions to allow a highly reversible error-correcting mechanism in the process of assembly. Herein, by substituting the conventional divalent Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with monovalent sodium ion (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), we have achieved one-pot high-yield assembly of tile-based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the DNA concentrations reported previously. This strategy takes advantage of coexisting counterions and is expected to surmount the major obstacle to potential applications of such DNA nanostructures: large-scale production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Myricetin Inhibits &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Aggregation by Delaying the Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase Transition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate amyloid aggregation. We discovered that myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, does not affect the initial formation of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates but dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition in the condensates.







Abstract
The aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) is a critical pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prevention of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation has become a key strategy for treating PD. Recent studies have suggested that &#945;&#8208;Syn undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate nucleation and amyloid formation. Here, we examined the modulation of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation by myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, under the conditions of LLPS. Unexpectedly, neither the initial morphology nor the phase&#8208;separated fraction of &#945;&#8208;Syn was altered by myricetin. However, the dynamics of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates decreased upon myricetin binding. Further studies showed that myricetin dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation in the condensates by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition. In addition, myricetin could disassemble the preformed &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregates matured from the condensates. Together, our study shows that myricetin inhibits &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregation in the condensates by retarding the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition and reveals that &#945;&#8208;Syn phase transition can be targeted to inhibit amyloid aggregation.

         <title>Towards a Better Understanding of Toxin Biosynthesis in Seaweeds</title>

Pick and mix: In an impressive new report, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of marine toxin domoic acid in the red alga Chondria armata, but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss in this Highlight article the importance of continuing to acquire new data on biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for both diagnostic and metabolic&#8208;engineering purposes.







Abstract
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) represent both ecological and public health hazards in the marine environment. Indeed, some algae can produce metabolites that have negative effects on marine ecosystems and mammals. Kainoid derivatives such as kainic acid (KA) and domoic acid (DA) are considered some of the most toxic metabolites of marine origin biosynthesized by a limited number of micro&#8208; and macroalgae. While recent works have provided the first insights into the biosynthetic route of KA in red algae and DA in diatoms, the DA biosynthetic pathway has remained uncharacterized for red algae. In a recent work, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of DA in the red alga Chondria armata but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss here the importance of pursuing active research in this area to gain insights into secondary biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for diagnostic and metabolic engineering perspectives.

         <title>Diterpenoids from Streptomyces: Structures, Biosyntheses and Bioactivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diterpenoids from Streptomyces, which were identified by direct isolation or genome mining, show diverse biological activities and can be potential drug candidates. Biosynthesis of these diterpenoids holds great promise for uncovering novel skeletons of diterpenoids by genome mining in Streptomyces strains.







Abstract
Bacteria, especially Streptomyces spp., have emerged as a rich source for natural diterpenoids with diverse structures and broad bioactivities. Here, we review diterpenoids biosynthesized by Streptomyces, with an emphasis on their structures, biosyntheses, and bioactivities. Although diterpenoids from Streptomyces are relatively rare compared to those from plants and fungi, their novel skeletons, biosyntheses and bioactivities present opportunities for discovering new drugs, enzyme mechanisms, and applications in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway engineering.

         <title>Conjugation of a Toll&#8208;Like Receptor Agonist to Glycans of an HIV Native&#8208;Like Envelope Trimer Preserves Neutralization Epitopes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viral glycoprotein immunogens can be modified by a small molecule adjuvant by chemical attachment of an immune&#8208;potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 followed by transfer to N&#8208;glycans of the glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelop trimer with an agonist of Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8. The modification did not compromise structural integrity and Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies.







Abstract
Small molecule adjuvants are attractive for enhancing broad protection and durability of immune responses elicited by subunit vaccines. Covalent attachment of an adjuvant to an immunogen is particularly attractive because it simultaneously delivers both entities to antigen presenting cells resulting in more efficient immune activation. There is, however, a lack of methods to conjugate small molecule immune potentiators to viral glycoprotein immunogens without compromising epitope integrity. We describe herein a one&#8208;step enzymatic conjugation approach for the covalent attachment of small molecule adjuvants to N&#8208;linked glycans of viral glycoproteins. It involves the attachment of an immune potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 by Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition followed by sialyltransferase&#8208;mediated transfer to N&#8208;glycans of a viral glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelope trimer with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist. The modification did not compromise Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies. Electron microscopy confirmed structural integrity of the modified immunogen.
