         <title>Discovery of the Class I Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide Arcumycin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lasso peptides are a family of natural products that have shown potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. Using a targeted genome mining approach, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides. We validated this approach with the isolation, structural validation, and investigation of bioactivity of a novel class&#8197;I lasso peptide arcumycin.







Abstract
Lasso peptides are a structurally diverse superfamily of conformationally constrained peptide natural products, of which a subset exhibits broad antimicrobial activity. Although advances in bioinformatics have increased our knowledge of strains harboring the biosynthetic machinery for lasso peptide production, relating peptide sequence to bioactivity remains a continuous challenge. To this end, genome mining investigation of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides was performed to correlate predicted structure with antibiotic activity. Bioinformatic evaluation revealed eight putative novel class I lasso peptide sequences. Fermentation of one of these hits, Streptomyces NRRL F&#8208;5639, resulted in the production of a novel class I lasso peptide, arcumycin. Arcumycin exhibited antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis (4&#8197;&#956;g/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL), and Micrococcus luteus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL). Arcumycin treatment of B. subtilis liaI&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal promoter fusion reporter strain resulted in upregulation of the liaRS system by the promoter liaI, indicating arcumycin interferes with lipid&#8197;II biosynthesis. Cumulatively, the results illustrate the relationship between phylogenetically related lasso peptides and their bioactivity as validated through the isolation, structural determination, and evaluation of bioactivity of the novel class&#8197;I antimicrobial lasso peptide arcumycin.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Imaging and Identification of Bacterial Toxins Causing Mushroom Soft Rot and Cavity Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft rot disease of edible mushrooms leads to rapid degeneration of fungal tissue and thus severely affects farming productivity worldwide. The bacterial mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola has been identified as the cause. Yet, little is known about the molecular basis, the spatial distribution and the biological role of antifungal agents and toxins involved in this infectious disease. We combine genome mining, metabolic profiling, MALDI&#8208;Imaging and UV Raman spectroscopy, to detect, identify and visualize a complex of chemical mediators and toxins produced by the pathogen during the infection process, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin, and sinapigladioside. Furthermore, targeted gene knockouts and in vitro assays link antifungal agents to prevalent symptoms of soft rot, mushroom browning, and impaired mycelium growth. Comparisons of related pathogenic, mutualistic and environmental Burkholderia spp. indicate that the arsenal of antifungal agents may have paved the way for ancestral bacteria to colonize niches where frequent, antagonistic interactions with fungi occur. Our findings not only demonstrate the power of label&#8208;free, in vivo detection of polyyne virulence factors by Raman imaging, but may also inspire new approaches to disease control.</dc:description>

         <title>Preliminary Structural Data Revealed That the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 B.1.617 Variant's RBD Binds to ACE2 Receptor Stronger Than the Wild Type to Enhance the Infectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biomolecular simulation techniques were used in this study to explore the impact of specific mutations in the B.1.617 variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on the binding of receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. The analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic stability, residual flexibility, and structural compactness.







Abstract
The evolution of new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants around the globe has made the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic more worrisome, further pressuring the health care system and immunity. Novel variations that are unique to the receptor&#8208;binding motif (RBM) of the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i.&#8201;e. L452R&#8208;E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R&#8208;E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic&#8208;stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural&#8208;dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants.

         <title>PEGylated Oligothioetheramide Prodrugs Activated by Host Serum Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the increasing prominence of antibiotic resistance, novel drug discovery and delivery approaches targeting bacteria are essential. In this work we evaluate a prodrug design to improve the cytotoxic profile of polycationic oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs), which are promising antimicrobials. Herein we chemically modify the oligoTEA, PDT&#8208;4G, with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) and show that 1, 2, and 5 kDa PEGs mitigate cytotoxicity. As PEGylation reduces antibacterial activity, we evaluate two peptide linkers which, unlike oligoTEAs, are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in serum. To gain insight into the prodrug reactivation, two linkers were tested, the 5&#8208;residue peptide sequence LMPTG, and the dipeptide sequence VC&#8208;PABC. In the presence of 20% serum, prodrugs made with the VC&#8208;PABC linker successfully inhibited bacterial growth. Overall, we observed reactivation of oligoTEAs facilitated by serum protease cleavage of the peptide linkers. This work opens the door to the future design of antimicrobial prodrugs with tunable release profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of novel histone deacetylase 6&#8208;selective inhibitors bearing 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) motif as a zinc binding group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer and immunological diseases. Most of the previously reported HDAC6 inhibitors have a hydroxamate group as a zinc binding group (ZBG), which coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion of HDAC6. The hydroxamate group is liable to metabolically generate mutagenetic hydroxylamine; therefore, non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors would be advantageous. In this study, to identify novel non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors, screening of a chemical library and the subsequent structural optimization were performed, which led to the identification of HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel ZBG. The identified inhibitor showed potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent advances in light energy conversion with biomimetic vesicle membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable for self&#8208;assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane&#8208;facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer. The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer&#8208;membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light&#8208;driven reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of Naturally Occurring HIF&#8208;1 Inhibitors for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe progressive disorder characterized by high pulmonary artery pressure. Chronic hypoxia causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) is a key enzyme increased by hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1). We constructed a cell&#8208;based luciferase assay system for HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors. Using this system, six HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified. Among these inhibitors, the effect of tagitinin C (  1  ) on PASMC was investigated. Tagitinin C (  1  ) clearly decreased HIF&#8208;1 b &#160;and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. This result indicates that HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors effectively decrease PDK1 activity, which is a cause of the metabolic disorder and Warburg effect observed in PASMCs. Identifying naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors could provide novel insights into the development of PAH medications.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA polymerase &#946; (Pol &#946;) is a frequently overexpressed and/or mutated bifunctional repair enzyme. Pol &#946; possesses polymerase and lyase active sites, that are employed in two steps of base excision repair. Pol &#946; is an attractive therapeutic target for which there is a need for inhibitors. Two mechanistically inspired covalent inhibitors (  1  , IC  50  = 21.0 &#956;M;  9  , IC  50  = 18.7 &#956;M) that modify lysine residues in different Pol &#946; active sites are characterized. Despite modifying lysine residues in different active sites,  1  and  9  inactivate the polymerase and lyase activities of Pol &#946;. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments indicate that they do so by preventing DNA binding. Inhibitors  1  and  9  provide the basis for a general approach to preparing domain selective inhibitors of bifunctional polymerases. Such molecules could prove to be useful tools for studying the role of wild type and mutant forms of Pol &#946; in DNA repair.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potent, Selective CBX2 Chromodomain Ligand and Its Cellular Activity During Prostate Cancer Neuroendocrine Differentiation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 13, Page 2335-2344, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prostate cancers survive androgen deprivation by going through a process called neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), which requires gene repression by CBX2, a histone methyllysine reader protein. Selective inhibition of the CBX2 chromodomain using a cell permeable ligand blocks NED and promotes prostate cancer cell death.







Abstract
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic regulators that facilitate both embryonic development and cancer progression. PcG proteins form Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone mark recognized by the N&#8208;terminal chromodomain (ChD) of the CBX subunit of canonical PRC1. There are five PcG CBX paralogs in humans. CBX2 in particular is upregulated in a variety of cancers, particularly in advanced prostate cancers. Using CBX2 inhibitors to understand and target CBX2 in prostate cancer is highly desirable; however, high structural similarity among the CBX ChDs has been challenging for developing selective CBX ChD inhibitors. Here, we utilize selections of focused DNA encoded libraries (DELs) for the discovery of a selective CBX2 chromodomain probe, SW2_152F. SW2_152F binds to CBX2 ChD with a Kd of 80&#8197;nM and displays 24&#8208;1000&#8208;fold selectivity for CBX2 ChD over other CBX paralogs in&#8197;vitro. SW2_152F is cell permeable, selectively inhibits CBX2 chromatin binding in cells, and blocks neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cell lines in response to androgen deprivation.

         <title>Binding Mode Characterization of Osteopontin on Hydroxyapatite by Solution NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 13, Page 2300-2305, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsically disordered protein osteopontin is associated with modulating the formation, growth and proliferation of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite. Employing different solution NMR spectroscopy methods, we characterize the binding modes to hydroxyapatite and provide evidence for the influence of phosphorylation of the protein on the binding character and the differing roles in biomineralization.







Abstract
Extracellular matrix glycoproteins play a major role in bone mineralization and modulation of osteogenesis. Among these, the intrinsically disordered protein osteopontin (OPN) is associated with the inhibition of formation, growth and proliferation of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite (HAP). Furthermore, post&#8208;translational modifications like phosphorylation can alter conformations and interaction properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Therefore, the actual interaction of OPN with a HAP surface on an atomic level and how this interaction is affected by phosphorylation is of great interest. Here, we study the interaction of full&#8208;length OPN on the surface of suspended HAP nanoparticles by solution NMR spectroscopy. We report the binding modes of this IDP and provide evidence for the influence of hyperphosphorylation on the binding character and an explanation for the differing roles in biomineralization. Our study moreover presents an easy and suitable option to measure interaction of nanoparticles in a stable suspension with full&#8208;length proteins.

         <title>Ratiometric Detection of Glutathione Based on Disulfide Linkage Rupture between a FRET Coumarin Donor and a Rhodamine Acceptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 13, Page 2282-2291, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probe based on a coumarin donor and a near&#8208;infrared rhodamine acceptor linked via a disulfide&#8208;tethered bond has been developed for ratiometric visualization of glutathione in live cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae through modulation of efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor.







Abstract
Abnormal levels of glutathione, a cellular antioxidant, can lead to a variety of diseases. We have constructed a near&#8208;infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect glutathione concentrations in biological samples. The probe consists of a coumarin donor, which is connected through a disulfide&#8208;tethered linker to a rhodamine acceptor. Under the excitation of the coumarin donor at 405&#8197;nm, the probe shows weak visible fluorescence of the coumarin donor at 470&#8197;nm and strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence of the rhodamine acceptor at 652&#8197;nm due to efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor. Glutathione breaks the disulfide bond through reduction, which results in a dramatic increase in coumarin fluorescence and a corresponding decrease in rhodamine fluorescence. The probe possesses excellent cell permeability, biocompatibility, and good ratiometric fluorescence responses to glutathione and cysteine with a self&#8208;calibration capability. The probe was utilized to ratiometrically visualize glutathione concentration alterations in HeLa cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae.

         <title>A H2S&#8208;Specific Ultrasensitive Fluorogenic Probe Reveals TMV&#8208;Induced H2S Production to Limit Virus Replication</title>

H2S biogenesis promoted by TMV invasion is visualized by a highly sensitive and selective fluorogenic probe, highlighting H2S as an endogenous defense against RNA viruses.







Abstract
Understanding the role of H2S in host defense mechanisms against RNA viruses may provide opportunities for the development of antivirals to combat viral infections. Here, we have developed a green&#8208;emitting fluorogenic probe, which exhibits a large fluorescence response at 520&#8197;nm (&gt;560&#8208;fold) when treated with 100&#8197;&#956;M H2S for 1&#8197;h. It is highly selective for H2S over biothiols (&gt;400&#8208;fold F/F0) and has a detection limit of 12.9&#8197;nM. We demonstrate the application of the probe for endogenous H2S detection in&#8197;vivo for the understanding of its roles in antiviral host defense. Such virus&#8208;induced H2S inhibits viral replication by reducing gene expression of RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP). Additionally, a H2S donor GYY4137 showed significantly antiviral activity as ribavirin, a broad&#8208;spectrum drug against RNA viruses. Furtherly, we propose a possible molecular mechanism for the TMV&#8208;induced H2S biogenesis. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in support of further studies identifying endogenous H2S and its donors as potential antivirals toward RNA viruses.

         <title>Investigation of Vitamin D2 and Vitamin D3 Hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 13, Page 2266-2274, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microbial transformation of vitamin D to the active forms by a two&#8208;step hydroxylation represents a promising alternative to complex chemical syntheses. The ascomycete K. albida was shown to catalyze vitamin D hydroxylation by forming diverse single&#8208; and double&#8208;hydroxylation products. The efficiency of the reaction could be drastically increased by the addition of cyclodextrin derivatives to the biotransformation.







Abstract
The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D2 (VD2) and vitamin D3 (VD3) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain, Kutzneria albida, with the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D2 and 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D3 was identified. To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D3 and tenfold higher concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D2 after addition of 5&#8201;% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single&#8208;hydroxylation products, the human double&#8208;hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D2 and 1,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D3 and various other potential single&#8208; and double&#8208;hydroxylation products were detected. Thus, K. albida represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD2 and VD3 metabolites.

         <title>Isopentenol Utilization Pathway for the Production of Linalool in Escherichia coli Using an Improved Bacterial Linalool/Nerolidol Synthase</title>

Linalool is a monoterpenoid used as fragrance ingredient, and a promising source for alternative fuels. Here we explore the artificial isoprenol utilization pathway to produce linalool in Escherichia coli using the linalool/nerolidol synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus. The generation of improved bLinS variants together with substrate and strain optimization increased linalool production and decreased nerolidol by&#8208;product levels.







Abstract
Linalool is a monoterpenoid used as a fragrance ingredient, and is a promising source for alternative fuels. Synthetic biology offers attractive alternative production methods compared to extraction from natural sources and chemical synthesis. Linalool/nerolidol synthase (bLinS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus is a bifunctional enzyme, producing linalool as well as the sesquiterpenoid nerolidol when expressed in engineered Escherichia coli harbouring a precursor terpenoid pathway such as the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Here we identified two residues important for substrate selection by bLinS, L72 and V214, where the introduction of bulkier residues results in variants with reduced nerolidol formation. Terpenoid production using canonical precursor pathways is usually limited by numerous and highly regulated enzymatic steps. Here we compared the canonical MVA pathway to the non&#8208;canonical isopentenol utilization (IU) pathway to produce linalool using the optimised bLinS variant. The IU pathway uses isoprenol and prenol to produce linalool in only five steps. Adjusting substrate, plasmid system, inducer concentration, and cell strain directs the flux towards monoterpenoids. Our integrated approach, combining enzyme engineering with flux control using the artificial IU pathway, resulted in high purity production of the commercially attractive monoterpenoid linalool, and will guide future efforts towards efficient optimisation of terpenoid production in engineered microbes.

         <title>High Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Multi&#8208;enzymatic Synthesis of All Phenylpropanolamine Stereoisomers from &#946;&#8208;Methylstyrene</title>

Through the simultaneous combination of stereocomplementary alcohol dehydrogenases and &#969;&#8208;transaminases, we have developed a cascade for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of nor(pseudo)ephedrines with excellent optical purities and high yields. The cascade requires 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols as key intermediates, which are obtained from &#946;&#8208;methylstyrenes by combining a styrene monooxygenase with stereocomplementary epoxide hydrolases.







Abstract
We present a one&#8208;pot cascade for the synthesis of phenylpropanolamines (PPAs) in high optical purities (er and dr up to &gt;99.5&#8201;%) and analytical yields (up to 95&#8201;%) by using 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols as key intermediates. This bioamination entails the combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;TA) and an alanine dehydrogenase to create a redox&#8208;neutral network, which harnesses the exquisite and complementary regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities of the selected ADHs and &#969;TAs. The requisite 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol intermediates were obtained from trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylstyrene by combining a styrene monooxygenase with epoxide hydrolases. Furthermore, in selected cases, the envisioned cascade enabled to obtain the structural isomer (1S,2R)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol in high optical purity (er and dr &gt;99.5&#8201;%). This is the first report on an enzymatic method that enables to obtain all of the four possible PPA stereoisomers in great enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Switching ON of Transcription&#8208;Translation System Using GUV Fusion by Co&#8208;supplementation of Calcium with Long&#8208;Chain Polyethylene Glycol</title>

A novel giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) fusion method using Ca2+ and PEG20k was established in this study. Because of its low leakage of molecules during GUV fusion, the method enabled the switch&#8208;ON of transcription&#8208;translation within GUVs by complementation of elements in different GUVs after fusion.







Abstract
Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) have been used as a material for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. However, due to the semi&#8208;permeability of the membrane, the need for methods to fuse GUVs has increased. To this aim, methods that are simple and show low leakage during fusion are important. In this study, we report a method of GUV fusion by a divalent cation (Ca2+) enhanced with a long chain polyethylene glycol (PEG20k). The methods showed significant GUV fusion without leakage of internal components of GUVs and maintained cell&#8208;free transcription&#8208;translation ability inside the GUVs without external supplementation of macromolecules. We demonstrate that the Ca&#8208;PEG method can be applied for switching ON of transcription&#8208;translation in GUVs in a fusion&#8208;dependent manner. The method developed here can be applied to extend bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and molecular robotics that use GUVs as a chassis.

Abstract
Cytotoxic aggregation of misfolded &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) proteins is the main culprit suspected to be behind the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, A&#946; interactions with the novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as therapeutic options for avoiding &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation have been investigated. The results from multi&#8208;scale atomistic simulations suggest that amine&#8208;functionalized COFs with a large surface area (more than 1000&#8197;m2/gr) have the potential to prevent A&#946; aggregation. Gibb's free energy analysis confirmed that COFs could prevent protofibril self&#8208;assembly in addition to inhibiting &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation. Additionally, it was observed that the amine functional group and high contact area could improve the inhibitory effect of COFs on A&#946; aggregation and enhance the diffusivity of COFs through the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). In addition, microsecond coarse&#8208;grained (CG) simulations with three hundred amyloids reveal that the presence of COFs creates instability in the structure of amyloids and consequently prevents the fibrillation. These results suggest promising applications of engineered COFs in the treatment of AD and provide a new perspective on future experimental research.

Running rings around vesicles: We describe a droplet&#8208;based technology to manufacture cell&#8208;sized multilamellar lipid vesicles. Individual membranes are assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, giving control over the number of induvial layers and their molecular content. We investigated how the biomechanical properties of the structures change with each added layer.







Abstract
Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes, are multilamellar. Due to a lack of technologies available for their controlled construction, multilayered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell&#8208;mimetic motifs used in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. To address this, we developed emulsion&#8208;based technologies that allow cell&#8208;sized multilayered vesicles to be produced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, with compositional control over each layer, thus enabling studies that would otherwise remain inaccessible. We discovered that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter&#8208;bilayer registration between coexisting liquid&#8211;liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multilayered membrane structures, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple bilayers.

We have developed a technology to manufacture multilayered lipid vesicles. Individual bilayers are deposited layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, allowing us to regulate the number of bilayers and their individual composition. This depiction of our structures portrays the self&#8208;assembly underpinning our method (bottom left) and our discovery that phase&#8208;separated domains align with one another through the layers (yellow). The undulating membranes represent the fluctuation analysis technique that we use to show that the mechanical properties of the vesicle scale with the number of layers.

         <title>Cover Feature: Expanding the Substrate Scope of Nitrating Cytochrome P450 TxtE by Active Site Engineering of a Reductase Fusion (ChemBioChem 13/2021)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 13, Page 2183-2183, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tryptophan&#8208;nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE has the potential to be developed into an environmentally benign aromatic nitration biocatalyst. However, the enzyme's narrow substrate tolerance is an impediment to this. The picture shows how randomly mutagenizing a key active site residue led to the discovery of a TxtE variant that efficiently nitrates tryptamine, which is not accepted by the wild&#8208;type enzyme. This demonstrates that directed evolution can be used to create TxtE variants able to nitrate synthetically useful substrates. More information can be found in the Communication by L.&#8197;M. Alkhalaf, G.&#8197;L. Challis et&#8197;al.

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools To Investigate Malaria Parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 13, Page 2219-2236, July 1, 2021. </description>

Ghost hunting: Malaria tropica has been haunting mankind for centuries, but investigating the biology of the causative agent, the protozoan parasite P. falciparum, remains challenging. Herein, we describe ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, non&#8208;genetic, small molecular probes from the field of chemical biology that have been, or may be, used to interrogate the complex infection cycle, with an emphasis on infected red blood cells.







Abstract
Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite's biology is pivotal to deciphering unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensure the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small&#8208;molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance research into this parasite in the future. We anticipate that the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of P. falciparum and we hope that researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge &#8211; with the aim of ending this devastating disease.

Functional nanodevices: DNA tetrahedra represent a versatile construct that can be functionalized for numerous purposes including the delivery of small molecules and oligonucleotide therapeutics to the cell as well as a range of applications for biosensing. In this minireview, a number of exciting recent advances in functional nanodevices based on this intriguing structure are highlighted.







Abstract
The chemical and self&#8208;assembly properties of nucleic acids make them ideal for the construction of discrete structures and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices for a diverse array of applications. Amongst the various three&#8208;dimensional assemblies, DNA tetrahedra are of particular interest, as these structures have been shown to be readily taken up by the cell, by the process of caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, without the need for transfection agents. Moreover, these structures can be readily modified with a diverse range of pendant groups to confer greater functionality. This minireview highlights recent advances related to applications of this interesting DNA structure including the delivery of therapeutic agents ranging from small molecules to oligonucleotides in addition to its use for sensing and imaging various species within the cell.

         <title>Marine Polysaccharides: Occurrence, Enzymatic Degradation and Utilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 13, Page 2247-2256, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Algae biomass is a source for many valuable compounds for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. Especially marine polysaccharides contain rare sugars of interest, but a major bottleneck is access to these sugars. In this mini&#8208;review the common knowledge of marine CAZyme&#8208;based deconstruction of these polysaccharides and the biotechnological potential of the thus accessible oligo&#8208; and monosugars are described.







Abstract
Macroalgae species are fast growing and their polysaccharides are already used as food ingredient due to their properties as hydrocolloids or they have potential high value bioactivity. The degradation of these valuable polysaccharides to access the sugar components has remained mostly unexplored so far. One reason is the high structural complexity of algal polysaccharides, but also the need for suitable enzyme cocktails to obtain oligo&#8208; and monosaccharides. Among them, there are several rare sugars with high value. Recently, considerable progress was made in the discovery of highly specific carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes able to decompose complex marine carbohydrates such as carrageenan, laminarin, agar, porphyran and ulvan. This minireview summarizes these achievements and highlights potential applications of the now accessible abundant renewable resource of marine polysaccharides.

Kinking the duplex and other alterations: This review describes the rational design of metal complexes with nucleic acid recognition properties and how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions is opening up new avenues in the fields of gene engineering and targeted therapies.







Abstract
DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or noncovalent binding modes. Several recognition modes &#8211; including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation &#8211; are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes, which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This Review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.

Light up the kinome. Probes for photoaffinity labelling of kinases are powerful research tools for detecting (off&#8208;)targets of kinase inhibitors, imaging kinases within the cell or identifying binding partners. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available kinase photoaffinity probes and discuss how such probes are designed. We illustrate the applicability with various examples.







Abstract
Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for the photoaffinity labelling of kinases are important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several areas of application of these probes, including the identification of targets and off&#8208;targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, the development of inhibitor screening assays, the imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.

Intracellular inhibition insights: NanoBRET assays were developed to measure target engagement of cytosolic FK506&#8208;binding proteins, confirming selectivities and revealing permeation issues of FKBP ligands.







Abstract
FK506&#8208;binding proteins (FKBPs) are promising targets for a variety of disorders and infectious diseases. High FKBP occupancy is thought to be necessary for ligands to effectively compete with the endogenous intracellular functions of FKBPs. Here, we report the development of NanoBRET assays for the most prominent cytosolic FKBPs, FKBP12, 12.6, 51 and 52. These assays allowed rapid profiling of FKBP ligands for target engagement and selectivity in living cells. These assays confirmed the selectivity of SAFit&#8208;type ligands for FKBP51 over FKBP52 but revealed a substantial offset for the intracellular activity of these ligands compared to bicyclic ligands or natural products. Our results stress the importance to control for intracellular FKBP occupancy and provide the assays to guide further FKBP ligand optimization.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of Nitrating Cytochrome P450 TxtE by Active Site Engineering of a Reductase Fusion</title>

Directed evolution of aromatic nitration biocatalysts: Screening variants of a self&#8208;sufficient reductase fusion of the indole&#8208;nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE led to the discovery of an active site mutant that nitrates tryptamine and a range of tryptamine analogues with alterations to the aminoethyl group and/or indole.







Abstract
Aromatic nitration reactions are a cornerstone of organic chemistry, but are challenging to scale due to corrosive reagents and elevated temperatures. The cytochrome P450 TxtE nitrates the indole 4&#8208;position of l&#8208;tryptophan at room temperature using NO, O2 and NADPH, and has potential to be developed into a useful aromatic nitration biocatalyst. However, its narrow substrate scope (requiring both the &#945;&#8208;amino acid and indole functionalities) have hindered this. Screening of an R59 mutant library of a TxtE&#8208;reductase fusion protein identified a variant (R59C) that nitrates tryptamine, which is not accepted by native TxtE. This variant exhibits a broader substrate scope than the wild type enzyme and is able to nitrate a range of tryptamine analogues, with significant alterations to the aromatic and aminoethyl moieties.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Conjugation of a Cationic Metalloporphyrin to BSA and HSA via &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugates: We present a method for the conjugation between alkyne&#8208;functionalized BSA and HSA with a cationic azido&#8208;metalloporphyrin that yields conjugates that possess photodynamic activity when evaluated against human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29). Their natural fluorescent properties allow for determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting their potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
In this study, we present a convenient method for the labelling of tyrosine residues on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) and report for the first time their subsequent bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with porphyrins via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry. We demonstrate that these serum proteins can be labelled with an alkyne&#8208;diazonium heterobifunctional linker and can then undergo chemo&#8208;selective bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with a water&#8208;soluble azido metalloporphyrin via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield protein&#8208;conjugates that retain their photodynamic properties. In our hands, this method was found to be highly reproducible, scalable, and tuneable which allows for the production of bioconjugates where the porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugate not only retains an ability to generate singlet oxygen but possess an enhanced relative singlet oxygen quantum yields relative to the porphyrin alone. Furthermore, we have investigated the photochemical properties of these conjugates through photospectrometric techniques and have determined that the porphyrin macrocycles remain appreciably photostable under light irradiation. Our phototoxic protein&#8208;photosensitizer&#8208;conjugates show excellent photodynamic activity against a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (HT&#8208;29) with cell viabilities of 7.7&#177;0.5&#8201;% (IC50 8.76&#177;2.14&#8197;&#956;M) and 1.7&#177;1.9&#8201;% (IC50 8.48&#177;5.11&#8197;&#956;M) for BSA and HAS, respectively, when irradiated with 20&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of white&#8208;light. Importantly, neither of the conjugates was found to possess any significant &#8220;dark&#8221; toxicity even at concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the natural fluorescent properties of the bioconjugates allowed for the determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting the potential theranostic applications of these unique protein&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugates.

Intracellular delivery of catalase DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells to activate a ROS&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein (RNase A&#8208;NBC) for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and potential cancer treatment.







Abstract
The conditional control of protein function in response to the physiological change of cells is of great interest for studying protein function in biological settings and developing protein therapeutics. We report herein that catalase (CAT) DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells by knocking down catalase expression, which could further activate a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, in&#8197;situ. Using an optimized lipid nanoparticle delivery system to simultaneously introduce CAT DNAzyme and RNase A&#8208;NBC into cells, we show that the pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, could be activated in a significantly enhanced manner to prohibit tumor cell growth in different types of cancer cells. We believe the methodology of regulating pro&#8208;protein activity using DNAzyme biocatalysis to differentiate intracellular environment could further be extended to other functional proteins, and even fundamental investigations in living systems to develop pro&#8208;protein therapeutics.

         <title>Multicomponent Bioluminescence Imaging with Naphthylamino Luciferins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthylamino luciferins were used for rapid, multi&#8208;component bioluminescent imaging. The analogues were synthesized using a modular route, and activities were measured in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. Mutant luciferases were identified that could differentiate the substrates, and the unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs were compatible with existing bioluminescent probes. These substrates add to the growing set of bioluminescent tools for multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Bioluminescent tools have been used for decades to image processes in complex tissues and preclinical models. However, few distinct probes are available to probe multicellular interactions. We and others are addressing this limitation by engineering new luciferases that can selectively process synthetic luciferin analogues. In this work, we explored naphthylamino luciferins as orthogonal bioluminescent probes. Three analogues were prepared using an optimized synthetic route. The luciferins were found to be robust emitters with native luciferase in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. We further screened the analogues against libraries of luciferase mutants to identify unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs. The new probes can be used in conjunction with existing bioluminescent tools for multi&#8208;component imaging.

         <title>Stacked thiazole orange dyes in DNA capable of switching emissive behavior in response to structural transitions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional nucleic acids with the capability of generating fluorescence in response to hybridization events, microenvironment or structural changes are valuable as structural probes and chemical sensors. We now demonstrate the enzyme&#8208;assisted preparation of nucleic acids possessing multiple thiazole orange (TO) dyes and their fluorescent behavior, that show a spectral change from the typical monomer emission to the excimer&#8208;type red&#8208;shifted emission. We found that the fluorescent response and emission wavelength of the TO dyes were dependent upon both the state of the DNA structure (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA) and the arrangement of the TO dyes. We showed that the fluorescent behavior of the TO dyes can be applied for the detection of RNA molecules, suggesting that our approach for preparing the fluorescent nucleic acids functionalized with multiple TO dyes could be useful to design a multicolor bioimaging and detection technique of biomolecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Core Steps to the Azaphilone Family of Fungal Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azaphilones are a family of polyketide based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This review explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic synthesis assisted discovery of proline&#8208;rich macrocyclic peptides in marine sponges</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proline&#8208;rich macrocyclic peptides (PRMPs) are natural products present in geographically and phylogenetically dispersed marine sponges. The large diversity and low abundance of PRMPs in sponge metabolomes precludes isolation and structure elucidation of each individual PRMP congener. Here, using standards developed via biomimetic enzymatic synthesis of PRMPs, a mass spectrometry&#8208;based workflow to sequence PRMPs was developed and validated to reveal that the diversity of PRMPs in marine sponges is much greater than that has been realized by natural product isolation&#8208;based strategies. Findings are placed in the context of diversity&#8208;oriented transamidative macrocyclization of peptide substrates in sponge holobionts.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Monoxide is an Inhibitor of HIF Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain 2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenously produced gasotransmitter that is involved in a range of physiological roles including the stabilisation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor that regulates oxygen homeostasis. Herein, by using CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;2 as a CO donor, we show that CO is an inhibitor of HIF PHD2, one of the most important oxygen sensing enzymes in humans that regulates HIF stability at the protein level.







Abstract
Hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) is an important oxygen sensor in animals. By using the CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;2 (CORM&#8208;2) as an in&#8197;situ CO donor, we demonstrate that CO is an inhibitor of PHD2. This report provides further evidence about the emerging role of CO in oxygen sensing and homeostasis.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor can occur naturally as a constituent of essential oils of several plants, including Cinnamomum camphora, or it can be obtained chemically from optically pure &#945;&#8208;pinene, which itself must be isolated from plants. Camphor is well known for its characteristic pungent odor and health benefits. While (+)&#8208;camphor can be isolated from various natural sources, (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor is more difficult to obtain. In our work, we demonstrate facile enantioselective kinetic resolution of renewable isobornyl esters for the synthesis of the valuable (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor.

         <title>Methemoglobin&#8208;Albumin Cluster Incorporating Protoporphyrin IX: Dual Functional Protein Drug for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell protein cluster comprising a methemoglobin (metHb) at the center and human serum albumin containing protoporphyrin IX (HSA&#8208;PPIX) at the periphery was synthesized as a unique photosensitizer with O2&#8208;generation property. The metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2&#160;is protein drug showing dual task for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis, photophysical properties, and photodynamic activity of a methemoglobin (metHb) wrapped covalently by human serum albumins (HSAs) incorporating protoporphyrin IX (PPIX): a metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 cluster. The metHb core catalyzes H2O2 disproportionation to generate O2 in tumor tissue. The HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 shell acts as a photosensitizer for 1O2 formation. The metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 cluster acts as a dual functional protein drug for photodynamic therapy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A core-shell&lt;/b&gt; protein cluster comprising a methemoglobin (metHb) at the center and human serum albumin containing protoporphyrin IX (HSA-PPIX) at the periphery was synthesized as a unique photosensitizer with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-generation property. The metHb-HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;is protein drug showing dual task for photodynamic therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the synthesis, photophysical properties, and photodynamic activity of a methemoglobin (metHb) wrapped covalently by human serum albumins (HSAs) incorporating protoporphyrin IX (PPIX): a metHb-HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cluster. The metHb core catalyzes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; disproportionation to generate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tumor tissue. The HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell acts as a photosensitizer for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation. The metHb-HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cluster acts as a dual functional protein drug for photodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) of Intracellular Transport by Means of Doubly Labelled siRNA Architectures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
siRNA traffic lights: RNA is labelled at internal positions of the sequence by two different fluorescent dyes that undergo interstrand energy transfer. The emission is shifted to green after processing of siRNA into single stranded antisense RNA, potentially binding to target mRNA. This allowed imaging of siRNA by microscopy, using the fluorescence lifetime of the donor dye.







Abstract
For monitoring the intracellular pathway of small interfering RNA (siRNA), both strands were labelled at internal positions by two ATTO dyes as an interstrand F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer pair. siRNA double strands show red emission and a short donor lifetime as readout, whereas siRNA antisense single strands show green emission and a long donor lifetime. This readout signals if GFP silencing can be expected (green) or not (red). We attached both dyes to three structurally different alkyne anchors by postsynthetic modifications. There is only a slight preference for the ribofuranoside anchors with the dyes at their 2&#8217;&#8208;positions. For the first time, the delivery and fate of siRNA in live HeLa cells was tracked by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), which revealed a clear relationship between intracellular transport using different transfection methods and knockdown of GFP expression, which demonstrates the potential of our siRNA architectures as a tool for future development of effective siRNA.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Selenocysteine Incorporation into Proteins by Genetic Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native Sec incorporation is highly species&#8208;dependent, which makes it challenging to express selenoproteins recombinantly. This article reviews recent progress in the method development for selenoprotein production, including the uses of engineered tRNA, allo&#8208;tRNA and Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element as well as genetic code expansion approaches for efficient site&#8208;specific Sec incorporation.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation in vivo is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe the progress in selenoprotein production methodology.

         <title>The innate immune glycoprotein lactoferrin represses the Helicobacter pylori&#160;cag type IV secretion system</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chronic infection with  Helicobacter pylori  increases risk of gastric diseases including gastric cancer. Despite development of a robust immune response,  H. pylori  persists in the gastric niche. Progression of gastric inflammation to serious disease outcomes is associated with infection with  H. pylori  strains which encode the  cag  Type IV Secretion System (  cag  T4SS). The  cag  T4SS is responsible for translocating the oncogenic protein CagA into host cells and inducing pro&#8208;inflammatory and carcinogenic signaling cascades. Our previous work demonstrated that nutrient iron modulates the activity and biogenesis of the T4SS. In response to  H. pylori  infection, the host produces a variety of antimicrobial molecules, including the iron&#8208;binding glycoprotein, lactoferrin.&#160; Our work shows that apo&#8208;lactoferrin exerts antimicrobial activity against  H. pylori  under iron&#8208;limited conditions, while holo&#8208;lactoferrin enhances bacterial growth and represses&#160;  cag  T4SS&#160;activity. Concomitantly, a decrease in biogenesis of  cag  T4SS pili at the host&#8208;pathogen interface was observed under these culture conditions by high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy analyses. Taken together, these results indicate that acquisition of alternate sources of nutrient iron plays a role in regulating the pro&#8208;inflammatory activity of a bacterial secretion system and present novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of  H. pylori  &#8208;related disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaches to Introduce Helical Structure in Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides with a Bimane Group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical structure can be introduced into short peptides, known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha, by macrocyclization with an inherently fluorescent bimane linker. Alternatively, a bimane&#8208;modification on a cysteine residue stabilises helicity in a tryptophan&#8208;containing, or to a lesser extent, a tyrosine&#8208;containing sequence.







Abstract
An i&#8722;i+4 or i&#8722;i+3 bimane&#8208;containing linker was introduced into a peptide known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), in order to stabilise an &#945;&#8208;helical geometry. These macrocycles were studied by CD and NMR to reveal the i&#8722;i+4 constrained peptide adopts a 310&#8208;helical structure in solution, and an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation on interaction with the ER&#945; coactivator recruitment surface in silico. An acyclic bimane&#8208;modified peptide is also helical, when it includes a tryptophan or tyrosine residue; but is significantly less helical with a phenylalanine or alanine residue, which indicates such a bimane modification influences peptide structure in a sequence dependent manner. The fluorescence intensity of the bimane appears influenced by peptide conformation, where helical peptides displayed a fluorescence increase when TFE was added to phosphate buffer, compared to a decrease for less helical peptides. This study presents the bimane as a useful modification to influence peptide structure as an acyclic peptide modification, or as a side&#8208;chain constraint to give a macrocycle.

         <title>Lessons in Organic Fluorescent Probe Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of molecular science. This review provides an overview of the methods used to discover fluorescent natural products, beginning with classical synthetic approaches. Here, lessons are presented that provide modern examples for classical methods and identify new classics that chart novel avenues for probe discovery. The central focus of this work embodies an understanding of the fundamental properties that guide the development of fluorescent probes and the challenges within their design.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes have gained profound use in biotechnology, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, molecular and cell biology. The development of methods for the translation of fluorophores into fluorescent probes continues to be a robust field for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists, alike. Access to new experimental designs has enabled molecular diversification and led to the identification of new approaches to probe discovery. This review provides a synopsis of the recent lessons in modern fluorescent probe discovery.

         <title>Recent Advances in Bioactive Artificial Ionophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure&#8208;activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.







Abstract
Several life&#8208;threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non&#8208;toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations. In addition, their ability to disrupt cellular homeostasis and to alter lysosomal pH endow ionophores as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Overall, critically outlining the advances in artificial ionophores in terms of in vitro ion transport, possible modes of action and biological activities enables us to propose possible future roadmaps in this research area.

         <title>Photosensitized Oxidative Dimerization at Tyrosine by a Water&#8208;Soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of proteins generates reactive amino acid (AA) residue intermediates, leading to protein modification and cross&#8208;linking. Aerobic studies with peptides and photosensitizers allow for the controlled generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive AA residue intermediates, providing mechanistic insights as to how natural protein modifications form. Such studies have inspired the development of abiotic methods for protein modification and crosslinking, including applications of biomedical importance. Dityrosine linkages derived from oxidation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues represent one of the more well&#8208;understood oxidation&#8208;induced modifications. Here we demonstrate an aerobic, visible light&#8208;dependent oxidation reaction of Tyr&#8208;containing substrates promoted by a water&#8208;soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based photosensitizer. The developed procedure converts Tyr&#8208;containing substrates into  o,o&#8217;&#8208;  Tyr&#8211;Tyr linked dimers. The regioselectively formed  o,o&#8217;  &#8208;Tyr&#8211;Tyr linkage is consistent with dimeric standards prepared using a known enzymatic method. A crossover study with two peptides provides a statistical mixture of three distinct  o,o&#8217;  &#8208;Tyr&#8211;Tyr linked dimers, supporting a mechanism that involves Tyr residue oxidation followed by intermolecular combination.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Responsive Singlet Oxygen Nanocarriers for Hypoxic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia in the tumor cells has been demonstrated to restrict the outcomes of photodynamic therapy. Here, we designed photothermal responsive singlet oxygen nanocarriers, which bear the endoperoxide of 1,4&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene, to ablate cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The unique O2&#8208;independent singlet oxygen&#8208;generation process suggests that the nanocarriers can be used as novel cancer phototherapy agents.







Abstract
Hypoxia in aggressively proliferating tumor cells has been demonstrated to restrict the efficiency of photodynamic therapy owing to its oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from photosensitizers under light irradiation. To address this problem, we propose a small&#8208;molecule dye&#8208;based 1O2 capturing agent, B1. B1 not only bears a near&#8208;infrared absorbing azo&#8208;boron dipyrromethene backbone, but also has 1,4&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene, which facilitates the capture of 1O2 to form endoperoxide (B1&#8208;SO). B1&#8208;SO undergoes a reversible reaction via near&#8208;infrared photothermal stimulation, thus allowing 1O2 release. Based on this mechanism, stable B1&#8208;SO containing micelles (B1&#8208;SO NPs) were prepared and employed as 1O2 nanocarriers to ablate cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. Taking advantage of this O2&#8208;independent 1O2 releasing ability, B1&#8208;SO NPs were demonstrated to have efficient cytotoxicity under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, especially in a hypoxic environment. The unique O2&#8208;independent 1O2 generation process of B1&#8208;SO NPs suggests they can be used as novel cancer phototherapy agents.

         <title>Advances in Strategies and Tools Available for Interrogation of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New exciting strategies are being used to study and control O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, an overview of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided.







Abstract
The attachment of a single O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of numerous proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and plays an important role as a regulator of various cellular processes in both healthy and disease states. Advances in strategies and tools that allow for the detection of dynamic O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins have helped to enhance our initial and ongoing understanding of its dynamic effects on cellular stimuli and given insights into its link to the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases. Furthermore, chemical genetic strategies and related tools have been successfully applied to a myriad of biological systems with a new level of spatiotemporal and molecular precision. These strategies have started to be used in studying and controlling O&#8208;GlcNAcylation both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, overviews of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided. In addition, chemical genetic strategies that have already been applied or are potentially usable in O&#8208;GlcNAc functional are also discussed.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Optical Ligands That Selectively Detect A&#946; Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular matchmaking: Ligands MK&#8208;6240 and b&#8208;TVBT2 are selective for aggregated tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). When combining the azaindole moiety of MK&#8208;6240 with the methyl&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;carboxylate unit of b&#8208;TVBT2, the resulting ligand, termed HS&#8208;276, does not show binding to tau but instead high selectivity for A&#946; aggregates in AD brain tissue. By introducing small structural alterations of the HS&#8208;276 scaffold, the binding properties change.







Abstract
In several neurodegenerative diseases, the presence of aggregates of specific proteins in the brain is a significant pathological hallmark; thus, developing ligands able to bind to the aggregated proteins is essential for any effort related to imaging and therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based ligands containing nitrogen heterocycles. The ligands selectively recognized amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates in brain tissue from individuals diagnosed neuropathologically as having Alzheimer's disease (AD). The selectivity for A&#946; was dependent on the position of nitrogen in the heterocyclic compounds, and the ability to bind A&#946; was shown to be reduced when introducing anionic substituents on the thiophene backbone. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of ligands that can differentiate between aggregated proteinaceous species comprised of distinct proteins. These ligands might also be powerful tools for studying the pathogenesis of A&#946; aggregation and for designing molecules for imaging of A&#946; pathology.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;Benzoyllysine by Engineering Methanomethylophilus alvus Pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Methanomethylophilus alvus PylRS mutants were engineered to genetically encode &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;benzoyllysine &#8208; a newly discovered histone post&#8208;translational modification &#8208; into proteins in E. coli and mammalian cells with high efficiency. Mutations at different locations in M. alvus PylRS active site (pink and yellow) were able to achieve high specificity for the same amino acid substrate (grey).







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications regulate protein structure and function. Lysine benzoylation is a newly discovered histone modification with unique physiological relevance. To construct proteins with this modification site&#8208;specifically, we generated orthogonal tRNAPyl&#8208;MaBzKRS pairs by engineering Methanomethylophilus alvus pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase, allowing the genetic incorporation of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;benzoyllysine (BzK) into proteins with high efficiency in E. coli and mammalian cells. Two types of MaBzKRS were identified to incorporate BzK using mutations located at different positions of the amino acid binding pocket. These MaBzKRS are small in size and highly expressed, which will afford broad utilities in studying the biological effects of lysine benzoylation.

         <title>Protein Macrocyclization for Tertiary Structure Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein function is often tightly linked to a particular tertiary structure. For many protein applications it is required to stabilize the tertiary structure and prevent unfolding. Here, we summarize strategies that have been used to cyclize expressed proteins aiming for the stabilization of their native fold.







Abstract
Proteins possess unique molecular recognition capabilities and enzymatic activities, features that are usually tied to a particular tertiary structure. To make use of proteins for biotechnological and biomedical purposes, it is often required to enforce their tertiary structure in order to ensure sufficient stability under the conditions inherent to the application of interest. The introduction of intramolecular crosslinks has proven efficient in stabilizing native protein folds. Herein, we give an overview of methods that allow the macrocyclization of expressed proteins, discussing involved reaction mechanisms and structural implications.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), by the fungus Pleurotus sapidus resulted in the formation of two vanilla&#8208;like aroma compounds: The highly valuable piperonal, which is used for the aromatization of different sweets and dairy products, such as chocolate and ice cream, and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde. The conversion was identified as the result of a co&#8208;oxidative reaction catalyzed by a lipoxygenase of P. sapidus in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. More information can be found in the Communication by N.&#8208;K. Krahe et&#8197;al.

         <title>Design and Hybridization Properties of Acyclic Xeno Nucleic Acid Oligomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic xeno nucleic acid (XNA) oligomers with polyanion backbones generally suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation due to their flexible scaffold. However, recent studies have revealed that some acyclic XNAs can enable the formation of highly stable duplexes. This minireview summarizes hybridization properties of negatively charged acyclic XNA. Instead of cyclic nucleic acids, such acyclic XNAs have potential for use as novel biological tools. More information can be found in the Minireview by K. Murayama and H. Asanuma.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane transporters are flexible proteins that cycle between structurally diverse conformations during transport. Yet, little is known about structural ensembles along transport paths, the transition speed between them, and particularly about the coupling between structures and transport. In this review the power of single&#8208;molecule FRET to answer some of these questions is highlighted and key studies on a broad variety of membranes transporters are discussed. More information can be found in the Review by H. Hofmann, C. L&#246;w et&#8197;al.

         <title>Chemoproteomics for Plasmodium Parasite Drug Target Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding drugs&#8217; mechanism of action is integral to successful antimalarial drug development. Recent advances in chemoproteomic methods have created an avenue to globally profile drug targets in the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Some of these strategies even allow direct measurement in living intracellular parasites. The cover feature highlights the achievement of probing the drug&#8211;protein interactome in an intact Plasmodium&#8208;infected erythrocyte. More information can be found in the review article by E.&#8197;R. Derbyshire et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Escherichia coli produces a phosphoethanolamine modified cellulose that is required for extracellular matrix assembly and biofilm scaffolds. A synthetic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose mimics the behavior of the naturally occurring polymer, inducing curli production and increasing biofilm formation. The discovery has implications for understanding microbial biofilms and the generation of new cellulosic probes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Gaddy, S.&#8197;D. Townsend et&#8197;al.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme engineering for the synthesis of a cosmetic ingredient: The osmolyte 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol is widely applied as a bioactive moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and personal&#8208;care products. It is produced on an industrial scale by exploiting the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of a sucrose phosphorylase, but the enzyme currently used suffers from poor thermostability. A homologous sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable was engineered to drastically improve its catalytic performance for the synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol, enabling the production of this compound at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Strategies for Covalent Labeling of Long RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating long RNAs: This review discusses currently available approaches for the introduction of reporter groups into large RNA molecules at internal positions in a site&#8208;specific fashion to allow visualization, tracking and structural investigations on long RNAs.







Abstract
The introduction of chemical modifications into long RNA molecules at specific positions for visualization, biophysical investigations, diagnostic and therapeutic applications still remains challenging. In this review, we present recent approaches for covalent internal labeling of long RNAs. Topics included are the assembly of large modified RNAs via enzymatic ligation of short synthetic oligonucleotides and synthetic biology approaches preparing site&#8208;specifically modified RNAs via in&#8197;vitro transcription using an expanded genetic alphabet. Moreover, recent approaches to employ deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) and ribozymes for RNA labeling and RNA methyltransferase based labeling strategies are presented. We discuss the potentials and limits of the individual methods, their applicability for RNAs with several hundred to thousands of nucleotides in length and indicate future directions in the field.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time and Label&#8208;Free Measurement of Deubiquitinase Activity with a MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MspA nanopore is demonstrated as a sensor for discriminating and quantifying various ubiquitin proteins. Real&#8208;time measurement of polymeric ubiquitin chain disassembly by a deubiquitinating enzyme was performed and enzyme kinetics were determined.







Abstract
Covalently attaching ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins as a post&#8208;translational modification can result in altered function of modified proteins. Enzymes regulating Ub as a post&#8208;translational modification, such as ligases and deubiquitinases, are challenging to characterize in part due to the low throughput of in&#8208;vitro assays. Single&#8208;molecule nanopore based assays have the advantage of detecting proteins with high specificity and resolution, and in a label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time fashion. Here we demonstrate the use of a MspA nanopore for discriminating and quantifying Ub proteins. We further applied the MspA pore to measure the Ub&#8208;chain disassembly activity of UCH37, a proteasome associated deubiquitinase. The implementation of this MspA system into nanopore arrays could enable high throughput characterizations of unknown deubiquitinases as well as drug screening against disease related enzymes.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are a valuable tool for upcycling side&#8208;stream from renewable sources. We have found that EstB from Burkholderia gladioli could achieve high enantiopurity in upcycling &#945;&#8208;pinene, a side&#8208;product from turpentine production, whereas common lipases and esterases could not. This reaction can be easily integrated with the existing chemical synthetic route for the production of the racemic camphor with minimal adjustments as the route goes through an intermediate isobornyl acetate.







Abstract
Racemic camphor and isoborneol are readily available as industrial side products, whereas (1R)&#8208;camphor is available from natural sources. Optically pure (1S)&#8208;camphor, however, is much more difficult to obtain. The synthesis of racemic camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene proceeds via an intermediary racemic isobornyl ester, which is then hydrolyzed and oxidized to give camphor. We reasoned that enantioselective hydrolysis of isobornyl esters would give facile access to optically pure isoborneol and camphor isomers, respectively. While screening of a set of commercial lipases and esterases in the kinetic resolution of racemic monoterpenols did not lead to the identification of any enantioselective enzymes, the cephalosporin Esterase B from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB) and Esterase C (EstC) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed outstanding enantioselectivity (E&gt;100) towards the butyryl esters of isoborneol, borneol and fenchol. The enantioselectivity was higher with increasing chain length of the acyl moiety of the substrate. The kinetic resolution of isobornyl butyrate can be easily integrated into the production of camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene and thus allows the facile synthesis of optically pure monoterpenols from a renewable side&#8208;product.

         <title>A Yeast Chronological Lifespan Assay to Assess Activity of Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chronological lifespan (CLS) assay using various strains of yeast to monitor the effect of proteasome stimulation with small molecules is described.







Abstract
Aging is characterized by changes in several cellular processes, including dysregulation of proteostasis. Current research has shown long&#8208;lived rodents display elevated proteasome activity throughout life and proteasome dysfunction is linked to shorter lifespans in a transgenic mouse model. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is one of the main pathways leading to cellular protein clearance and quality maintenance. Reduction in proteasome activity is associated with aging and its related pathologies. Small molecule stimulators of the proteasome have been proposed to help alleviate cellular stress related to unwanted protein accumulation. Here we have described the development of techniques to monitor the impact of proteasome stimulation in wild&#8208;type yeast and a strain that has impaired proteasome expression. We validated our chronological lifespan assay using both types of yeast with a variety of small molecule stimulators at different concentrations. By modifying the media conditions for the yeast, molecules can be evaluated for their potential to increase chronological lifespan in five days. Additionally, our assay conditions can be used to monitor the activity of proteasome stimulators in modulating the degradation of a YFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein fusion protein produced by yeast. We anticipate these methods to be valuable for those wishing to study the impact of increasing proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation of proteins in a eukaryotic model organism.

An emerging tool against the pandemic war: Thanks to the identification of the RGD sequence on the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, RGD&#8208;recognizing integrins have recently received important attention. Among them, &#945;V&#946;6 may be an intriguing target not only for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry, but also for the diagnosis/treatment of COVID&#8208;19 related fibrosis.







Abstract
The outbreak of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has been an extraordinary event that constituted a global health emergency. As the novel coronavirus is continuing to spread over the world, the need for therapeutic agents to control this pandemic is increasing. &#945;V&#946;6 Integrin may be an intriguing target not only for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry, but also for the diagnosis/treatment of COVID&#8208;19 related fibrosis, an emerging type of fibrotic disease which will probably affect a significant part of the recovered patients. In this short article, the possible role of this integrin for fighting COVID&#8208;19 is discussed on the basis of recently published evidence, showing how its underestimated involvement may be interesting for the development of novel pharmacological tools.

         <title>Metal Complexes as Antiviral Agents for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes for COVID&#8208;19&#8201;targets: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has caused a global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. Herein, metal complexes that have been reported to inhibit various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 enzymes and their proposed mechanism of action are discussed.







Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome &#8211; coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), the infectious agent responsible for COVID&#8208;19 &#8211; has caused more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide and triggered a global pandemic. Even with successful vaccines being delivered, there is an urgent need for novel treatments to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and other emerging viral diseases. While several organic small molecule drug candidates are in development, some effort has also been devoted towards the application of metal complexes as potential antiviral agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Herein, the metal complexes that have been reported to show antiviral activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 or one of its target proteins are described and their proposed mechanisms of action are discussed.

         <title>Substrate Protection in Controlled Enzymatic Transformation of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly specific enzymes make protecting groups unnecessary in biology but some enzymes including proteases and kinases have multiple biological substrates and there is strong interest to stop a specific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction without inhibiting the enzyme itself. Recent developments in peptide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles allow precise protection of peptide substrates and open up previously impossible ways to manipulate enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Proteins are involved in practically every single biological process. The many enzymes involved in their synthesis, cleavage, and posttranslational modification (PTM) carry out highly specific tasks with no usage of protecting groups. Yet, the chemists&#8217; strategy of protection/deprotection potentially can be highly useful, for example, when a specific biochemical reaction catalyzed by a broad&#8208;specificity enzyme needs to be inhibited, during infection of cells by enveloped viruses, in the invasion and spread of cancer cells, and upon mechanistic investigation of signal&#8208;transduction pathways. Doing so requires highly specific binding of peptide substrates in aqueous solution with biologically competitive affinities. Recent development of peptide&#8208;imprinted cross&#8208;linked micelles allows such protection and affords previously impossible ways of manipulating peptides and proteins in enzymatic transformations.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;kinetics Reveal Dynamic Effects on the Chemistry of Human Dihydrofolate Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotopologues, enzymes that differ only in their isotopic substitution, engage in a tug of war to determine the role of protein motions and electrostatics for catalysis. The features of the ribbon diagrams indicate that the enzymes are human dihydrofolate reductases. More information can be found in the Communication by R.&#8197;K. Allemann et&#8197;al.

         <title>Labeling and Characterization of Phenol&#8208;Containing Glycopeptides Using Chemoselective Probes with Isotope Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new tools to target natural products (NPs) can be applied to isolate novel NPs from complex samples. We have developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides by the ene&#8208;type reaction. After &#8220;clicking&#8221; with the biotin handle, the labeled NPs can be enriched, followed by the LC&#8208;MS and MSn analysis for structural prediction. Using Amycolatopsis orientalis as an example, a vancomycin&#8208;related glycopeptide was labeled and characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery. More information can be found in the Communication by T.&#8208;S.&#8197;A. Wang et&#8197;al.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of promiscuous halide methyltransferases enables the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues from alkyl iodides and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine. This facilitates the synthesis of analogues with alkyl groups larger than methyl groups, which can readily be used by methyltransferases. These processes provide access to diverse alkylated products with altered bioactivities, expanding the synthetic potential of methyltransferases. We expect a toolbox of protein&#8208;engineered halide methyltransferase variants to pave the way towards versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations. More information can be found in the Concept article by C.&#8197;P.&#8197;S. Badenhorst, U.&#8197;T. Bornscheuer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Chemoproteomics for Plasmodium Parasite Drug Target Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoproteomics adapted to Plasmodium parasites enable proteome&#8208;wide assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions. These methods assist in target deconvolution of novel antimalarial compounds, commonly discovered in phenotypic screens, that have unknown mechanisms of action. In this review, we detail current methods of label&#8208;based and energetics&#8208;based chemoproteomics and their application for Plasmodium parasite drug target discovery.







Abstract
Emerging Plasmodium parasite drug resistance is threatening progress towards malaria control and elimination. While recent efforts in cell&#8208;based, high&#8208;throughput drug screening have produced first&#8208;in&#8208;class drugs with promising activities against different Plasmodium life cycle stages, most of these antimalarial agents have elusive mechanisms of action. Though challenging to address, target identification can provide valuable information to facilitate lead optimization and preclinical drug prioritization. Recently, proteome&#8208;wide methods for direct assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions have emerged as powerful tools in a number of systems, including Plasmodium. In this review, we will discuss current chemoproteomic strategies that have been adapted to antimalarial drug target discovery, including affinity&#8208; and activity&#8208;based protein profiling and the energetics&#8208;based techniques thermal proteome profiling and stability of proteins from rates of oxidation. The successful application of chemoproteomics to the Plasmodium blood stage highlights the potential of these methods to link inhibitors to their molecular targets in more elusive Plasmodium life stages and intracellular pathogens in the future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemoproteomics adapted&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; parasites enable proteome-wide assessment of drug-protein interactions. These methods assist in target deconvolution of novel antimalarial compounds, commonly discovered in phenotypic screens, that have unknown mechanisms of action. In this review, we detail current methods of label-based and energetics-based chemoproteomics and their application for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; parasite drug target discovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; parasite drug resistance is threatening progress towards malaria control and elimination. While recent efforts in cell-based, high-throughput drug screening have produced first-in-class drugs with promising activities against different &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; life cycle stages, most of these antimalarial agents have elusive mechanisms of action. Though challenging to address, target identification can provide valuable information to facilitate lead optimization and preclinical drug prioritization. Recently, proteome-wide methods for direct assessment of drug-protein interactions have emerged as powerful tools in a number of systems, including &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;. In this review, we will discuss current chemoproteomic strategies that have been adapted to antimalarial drug target discovery, including affinity- and activity-based protein profiling and the energetics-based techniques thermal proteome profiling and stability of proteins from rates of oxidation. The successful application of chemoproteomics to the &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; blood stage highlights the potential of these methods to link inhibitors to their molecular targets in more elusive &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; life stages and intracellular pathogens in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This communication advances the recently developed &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;(Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe)&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for fluorescent labeling of JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV) pentamers. We show a concise (two steps) synthesis of a small molecule &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive probe that is easily tunable for a broad set of fluorescent reporters, solubility, and fluorophore distance from the modification site. With this probe we demonstrate labeling in a structured loop region of a protein and visualize cellular entry of JCPyV viral particles.







Abstract
The major capsid protein VP1 of JC Polyomavirus assembles into pentamers that serve as a model for studying viral entry of this potentially severe human pathogen. Previously, labeling of viral proteins utilized large fusion proteins or non&#8208;specific amine&#8208; or cysteine&#8208;functionalization with fluorescent dyes. Imaging of these sterically hindered fusion proteins or heterogeneously labeled virions limits reproducibility and could prevent the detection of subtle trafficking phenomena. Here we advance the &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for site&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of VP1&#8208;pentamers. We demonstrate a one&#8208;step synthesis of a probe consisting of a bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry handle bridged to a perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive electrophile by a polyethylene glycol linker. We expand the scope of the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation by demonstrating selective labeling of an internal, surface exposed loop in VP1. Thus, the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation offers a general method to selectively bioconjugate tags&#8208;of&#8208;interest to viral proteins without impeding their ability to bind and enter cells.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine to piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde: A lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus (LOXPsa1) was identified, which generated the highly valuable, vanilla&#8208;like aroma compound piperonal through co&#8208;oxidation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper, in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, which also presents a vanilla&#8208;like odor, was produced as second product.







Abstract
The valuable aroma compound piperonal with its vanilla&#8208;like olfactory properties is of high interest for the fragrance and flavor industry. A lipoxygenase (LOXPsa1) of the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was identified to convert piperine, the abundant pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), to piperonal and a second volatile product, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, with a vanilla&#8208;like odor through an alkene cleavage. The reaction principle was co&#8208;oxidation, as proven by its dependence on the presence of linoleic or &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid, common substrates of lipoxygenases. Optimization of the reaction conditions (substrate concentrations, reaction temperature and time) led to a 24&#8208;fold and 15&#8208;fold increase of the piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde concentration using the recombinant enzyme. Monokaryotic strains showed different concentrations of and ratios between the two reaction products.

         <title>Molecular Basis of Selectivity and Activity for the Antimicrobial Peptide Lynronne&#8208;1 Informs Rational Design of Peptide with Improved Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we describe the biophysical characterization of Lynronne&#8208;1, an antimicrobial peptide found in the bovine rumen microbiome. We reveal the location of an amphipathic helix containing all six cationic residues, and observe lipid&#8208;selective folding, membrane&#8208;binding and lysis. Our structural data were used to design three variants with changes in the size of the hydrophobic helical face, one of which yielded 32&#8208;fold improved activity in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to human health, with natural products remaining the best source for new antimicrobial compounds. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural products with great potential for clinical use as they are small, amenable to customization, and show broad&#8208;spectrum activities. Lynronne&#8208;1 is a promising AMP identified in the rumen microbiome that shows broad&#8208;spectrum activity against pathogens such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Here we investigated the structure of Lynronne&#8208;1 using solution NMR spectroscopy and identified a 13&#8208;residue amphipathic helix containing all six cationic residues. We used biophysical approaches to observe folding, membrane partitioning and membrane lysis selective to the presence of anionic lipids. We translated our understanding of Lynronne&#8208;1 structure to design peptides which varied in the size of their hydrophobic helical face. These peptides displayed the predicted continuum of membrane&#8208;lysis activities in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and yielded a new AMP with 4&#8208;fold improved activity against A. baumannii and 32&#8208;fold improved activity against S. aureus.

         <title>Caged Cumate Enables Proximity&#8208;Dependent Control Over Gene Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for visualizing cellular interactions was developed based on the cumate genetic switch. Nitrile&#8208;caged cumate released by activator cells induces gene expression in neighboring reporter cells.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;cell interactions underlie diverse physiological processes yet remain challenging to examine with conventional imaging tools. Here we report a novel strategy to illuminate cell proximity using transcriptional activators. We repurposed cumate, a small molecule inducer of gene expression, by caging its key carboxylate group with a nitrile. Nitrilase&#8208;expressing activator cells released the cage, liberating cumate for consumption by reporter cells. Reporter cells comprising a cumate&#8208;responsive switch expressed a target gene when in close proximity to the activator cells. Overall, this strategy provides a versatile platform to image and potentially manipulate cellular interactions over time.

         <title>Per&#8208;glycosylation of the Surface&#8208;Accessible Lysines: One&#8208;Pot Aqueous Route to Stabilized Proteins with Native Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical glycosylation of proteins is achieved via a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol, to pursue indiscriminate modification of the surface accessible amines. This facile method, drastically simpler than site&#8208;specific glycosylation, afforded a highly desired stabilization of proteins against aggregation and fibrillation, with a minimal change to the protein activity.







Abstract
Chemical glycosylation of proteins is a powerful tool applied widely in biomedicine and biotechnology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical glycosylation&lt;/b&gt; of proteins is achieved via a one-pot aqueous protocol, to pursue indiscriminate modification of the surface accessible amines. This facile method, drastically simpler than site-specific glycosylation, afforded a highly desired stabilization of proteins against aggregation and fibrillation, with a minimal change to the protein activity.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical glycosylation of proteins is a powerful tool applied widely in biomedicine and biotechnology. However, it is a challenging undertaking and typically relies on recombinant proteins and site-specific conjugations. The scope and utility of this nature-inspired methodology would be broadened tremendously by the advent of facile, scalable techniques in glycosylation, which are currently missing. In this work, we investigated a one-pot aqueous protocol to achieve indiscriminate, surface-wide glycosylation of the surface accessible amines (lysines and/or N-terminus). We reveal that this approach afforded minimal if any change in the protein activity and recognition events in biochemical and cell culture assays, but at the same time provided a significant benefit of stabilizing proteins against aggregation and fibrillation - as demonstrated on serum proteins (albumins and immunoglobulin G, IgG), an enzyme (uricase), and proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease (&#945;-synuclein) and diabetes (insulin). Most importantly, this highly advantageous result was achieved via a one-pot aqueous protocol performed on native proteins, bypassing the use of complex chemical methodologies and recombinant proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Modulation of Cellular Fate of Vinyl Triarylamines through Structural Fine Tuning: To Stay or Not To Stay in the Mitochondria?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes based on a triphenylamine core have been designed and synthesized as cellular imaging tools for monitoring mitochondrial status. This study was carried out to decipher the mechanism of relocalization from mitochondria to nucleus under mitochondrial membrane depolarisation.







Abstract
Mitochondria are involved in many cellular pathways and dysfunctional mitochondria are linked to various diseases. Hence efforts have been made to design mitochondria&#8208;targeted fluorophores for monitoring the mitochondrial status. However, the factors that govern the mitochondria&#8208;targeted potential of dyes are not well&#8208;understood. In this context, we synthesized analogues of the TP&#8208;2Bzim probe belonging to the vinyltriphenylamine (TPA) class and already described for its capacity to bind nuclear DNA in fixed cells and mitochondria in live cells. These analogues (TP&#8208;1Bzim, TPn&#8208;2Bzim, TP1+&#8208;2Bzim, TN&#8208;2Bzim) differ in the cationic charge, the number of vinylbenzimidazolium branches and the nature of the triaryl core. Using microscopy, we demonstrated that the cationic derivatives accumulate in mitochondria but do not reach mtDNA. Under depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane, TP&#8208;2Bzim and TP1+&#8208;2Bzim translocate to the nucleus in direct correlation with their strong DNA affinity. This reversible phenomenon emphasizes that these probes can be used to monitor &#916;&#936;m variations.

         <title>Design and Hybridization Properties of Acyclic Xeno Nucleic Acid Oligomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers composed of various acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) have been designed. This minireview highlights the design of acyclic XNA scaffolds with polyanion backbone and hybridization properties of acyclic XNA oligomers. Thermal stabilities of such acyclic XNA duplexes strongly depend on the structure of the scaffold.







Abstract
Xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) are analogues of DNA and RNA that have a non&#8208;ribose artificial scaffold. XNAs are possible prebiotic genetic carriers as well as alternative genetic systems in artificial life. In addition, XNA oligomers can be used as biological tools. Acyclic XNAs, which do not have cyclic scaffolds, are attractive due to facile their synthesis and remarkably high nuclease resistance. To maximize the performance of XNAs, a negatively charged backbone is preferable to provide sufficient water solubility; however, acyclic XNAs containing polyanionic backbones suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation, because of the high flexibility of the acyclic nature. Herein, we review the relationships between the structure and duplex hybridization properties of various acyclic XNA oligomers with polyanion backbones.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmolyte synthesis at elevated temperatures: 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is produced on industrial scale using the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of sucrose phosphorylase. We engineered the catalytic efficiency and regioselectivity of a sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable than the one currently used in industry.







Abstract
2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by various bacteria and plants in response to environmental stress. It is widely applied as a bioactive moisturising ingredient in skin care products, for which it is manufactured via enzymatic glucosylation of glycerol by the sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This industrial process is operated at room temperature due to the mediocre stability of the biocatalyst, often leading to microbial contamination. The highly thermostable sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis could be a better alternative in that regard, but this enzyme is not fit for production of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol due to its low regioselectivity and poor affinity for glycerol. In this work, the thermostable phosphorylase was engineered to alleviate these problems. Several engineering approaches were explored, ranging from site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to conventional, binary, iterative or combinatorial randomisation of the active site, resulting in the screening of &#8764;3,900 variants. Variant P134Q displayed a 21&#8208;fold increase in catalytic efficiency for glycerol, as well as a threefold improvement in regioselectivity towards the 2&#8208;position of the substrate, while retaining its activity for several days at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Incorporation of TePhe into Expressed Proteins is Minimally Perturbing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using standard protein expression conditions, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve high levels of Phe to TePhe substitution. The modified protein is minimally perturbed, as judged by NMR spectroscopy and melting experiments, by this substitution that will provide the basis for new tellurium based biophysical studies.







Abstract
Tellurium is a versatile heavy chalcogen with numerous applications in chemical biology, providing valuable probes in mass cytometry, fluorescence imaging and structural biology. L&#8208;Tellurienylalanine (TePhe) is an analogue of the proteinogenic amino acid L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe) in which the phenyl side chain has been replaced by a 5&#8208;membered tellurophene moiety. High incorporation level of TePhe in expressed proteins at defined sites is expected to facilitate studies in proteomics, protein NMR spectroscopy, and structure elucidation. As a model we chose immunoglobulin&#8208;binding Protein G, B1 domain (GB1) to validate TePhe as a suitable structural analogue for Phe. We demonstrate that approximately 1 in 2 of all Phe sites within GB1 can be substituted with TePhe through expression in standard non&#8208;Phe&#8208;auxotrophic E. coli in Phe&#8208;deficient media containing glyphosate, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The TePhe content of the GB1 sample can be further increased to 85&#8201;% through HPLC. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we confirm that the Phe&#8208;to&#8208;TePhe substitution has negligible impact on the global structure and stability of GB1.

         <title>Stabilisation of the Fatty Acid Decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis by Caprylic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep me busy: The photoactivated fatty acid decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64&#8197;A (CvFAP) is a promising catalyst to generate next generation biodiesel from (waste) fatty acids. CvFAP, however is also plagued by pronounced photoinactivation, which can be alleviated by keeping it busy, i.&#8201;e. converting carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid.







Abstract
The fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64&#8197;A (CvFAP) catalyses the light&#8208;dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids. Photoinactivation of CvFAP still represents one of the major limitations of this interesting enzyme en route to practical application. In this study we demonstrate that the photostability of CvFAP can easily be improved by the administration of medium&#8208;chain length carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid indicating that the best way of maintaining CvFAP stability is &#8216;to keep the enzyme busy&#8217;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep me busy&lt;/b&gt;: The photoactivated fatty acid decarboxylase from &lt;i&gt;Chlorella variabilis&lt;/i&gt; NC64&#8197;A (&lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP) is a promising catalyst to generate next generation biodiesel from (waste) fatty acids. CvFAP, however is also plagued by pronounced photoinactivation, which can be alleviated by keeping it busy, i.&#8201;e. converting carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatty acid photodecarboxylase from &lt;i&gt;Chlorella variabilis&lt;/i&gt; NC64&#8197;A (&lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP) catalyses the light-dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids. Photoinactivation of &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP still represents one of the major limitations of this interesting enzyme &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; to practical application. In this study we demonstrate that the photostability of &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP can easily be improved by the administration of medium-chain length carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid indicating that the best way of maintaining &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP stability is &#8216;to keep the enzyme busy&#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biosynthesis of [14C]&#8208;11&#8208;De&#8208;O&#8208;Methyltomaymycin, a Precursor of Radiolabelled Antibody Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this research was to avoid a radiolabelled multistep chemical synthesis of tomaymycin derivative using biosynthesis. The 14C radiolabel was incorporated efficiently in one step from radiolabelled tyrosine using the strain Streptomyces sp. FH6421. Optimization by using radiolabelled anthranilic acid led to one of the highest incorporation levels of radiochemical precursors published to date.







Abstract
Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are one of the most promising technologies to treat cancer as they combine the specificity of an antibody with the high potency of a cytotoxic molecule such as tomaymycin derivatives, which are DNA&#8208;interactive antitumor antibiotics previously isolated from bacterial broth. The multistep chemical synthesis of some tomaymycin derivatives is complicated because their structures contain a reactive imine bond. Therefore, we turned to biosynthesis to obtain 14C radiolabelled tomaymycin derivative to support ADME studies. Following Hurley's work (J. Antibiotics 1977, 30, 349&#8211;370; Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979, 15, 42&#8211;45; Acc. Chem. Res. 1980, 13, 263&#8211;269), the 14C radiolabel was incorporated efficiently in one step from radiolabelled tyrosine using the strain Streptomyces sp. FH6421. This process has been further optimized by using anthranilic acid as radiolabelled precursor, leading to one of the highest incorporation levels of radiochemical precursors published to date. This biosynthetic strategy is the fastest way to access such radiolabelled precursors.

         <title>Inhibitors of CA IX Enzyme Based on Polyhedral Boron Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review covers several classes of inhibitors specific for carbonic anhydrase IX enzyme that emerged recently from a non&#8208;traditional concept. This is characterized by combination of space&#8208;filing inorganic (metalla)carborane cluster with sulfamide and sulfonamide binding motif for Zn2+ in the active site. The structural factors essential for attaining high activity and selectivity for the CA IX isoform are discussed. Results from preclinical studies show relevance of these compounds for development of anticancer drugs.







Abstract
This review describes recent progress in the design and development of inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) based on space&#8208;filling carborane and cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters. CA IX enzyme is known to play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and metastases. The new class of potent and selective CA IX inhibitors combines the structural motif of a bulky inorganic cluster with an alkylsulfamido or alkylsulfonamido anchor group for Zn2+ ion in the enzyme active site. Detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of a large series containing 50 compounds uncovered structural features of the cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors that are important for efficient and selective inhibition of CA IX activity. Preclinical evaluation of selected compounds revealed low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics and ability to reduce tumor growth. Cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors of CA IX can thus be considered as promising candidates for drug development and/or for combination therapy in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).

         <title>Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum Lysyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase via a Piperidine&#8208;Ring Scaffold Inspired Cladosporin Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the synthesis and structural analysis of piperidine ring inspired cladosporin inhibitors against Plasmodium falciparum lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PfKRS). The series retains selectivity against its human counterpart but it was observed that replacing the tetrahydropyran moiety by piperidine reduces potency. Co&#8208;crystals of Cla&#8722;B and Cla&#8722;C with PfKRS reveal key interactions and loop readjustments that allow drug binding and inhibition of the enzyme.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PfKRS) represents a promising therapeutic anti&#8208;malarial target. Cladosporin was identified as a selective and potent PfKRS inhibitor but lacks metabolic stability. Here, we report chemical synthesis, biological evaluation and structural characterization of analogues where the tetrahydropyran (THP) frame of cladosporin is replaced with the piperidine ring bearing functional group variations. Thermal binding, enzymatic, kinetic and parasitic assays complemented with X&#8208;ray crystallography reveal compounds that are moderate in potency. Co&#8208;crystals of Cla&#8722;B and Cla&#8722;C with PfKRS reveal key atomic configurations that allow drug binding to and inhibition of the enzyme. Collectively these piperidine ring scaffold inhibitors lay a framework for further structural editing and functional modifications of the cladosporin scaffold to obtain a potent lead.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent single&#8208;molecule FRET studies on members of various transporter families reveal the potential of this technique to advance the mechanistic understanding of this protein class.







Abstract
Uncovering the structure and function of biomolecules is a fundamental goal in structural biology. Membrane&#8208;embedded transport proteins are ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. Despite structural flexibility, their mechanisms are typically studied by ensemble biochemical methods or by static high&#8208;resolution structures, which complicate a detailed understanding of their dynamics. Here, we review the recent progress of single molecule F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) in determining mechanisms and timescales of substrate transport across membranes. These studies do not only demonstrate the versatility and suitability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smFRET tools for studying membrane transport proteins but they also highlight the importance of membrane mimicking environments in preserving the function of these proteins. The current achievements advance our understanding of transport mechanisms and have the potential to facilitate future progress in drug design.

         <title>Functional Nucleic Acids Under Unusual Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual conditions, such as low solution pH, high and low temperatures, and organic solvents, were speculated to be the circumstances that ribozymes and riboswitches may have faced on the early Earth. Moreover, some artificial functional nucleic acids have been discovered to work under such unusual conditions and these molecules offer the potential for some interesting applications. Herein, we review recent progress of research on these functional nucleic acids.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including naturally occurring ribozymes and riboswitches as well as artificially created DNAzymes and aptamers, have been popular molecular toolboxes for diverse applications. Given the high chemical stability of nucleic acids and their ability to fold into diverse sequence&#8208;dependent structures, FNAs are suggested to be highly functional under unusual reaction conditions. This review will examine the progress of research on FNAs under conditions of low pH, high temperature, freezing conditions, and the inclusion of organic solvents and denaturants that are known to disrupt nucleic acid structures. The FNA species to be discussed include ribozymes, riboswitches, G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;based peroxidase mimicking DNAzymes, RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes, and aptamers. Research within this space has not only revealed the hidden talents of FNAs but has also laid important groundwork for pursuing these intriguing functional macromolecules for unique applications.

     alt="Functional Nucleic Acids Under Unusual Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unusual conditions&lt;/b&gt;, such as low solution pH, high and low temperatures, and organic solvents, were speculated to be the circumstances that ribozymes and riboswitches may have faced on the early Earth. Moreover, some artificial functional nucleic acids have been discovered to work under such unusual conditions and these molecules offer the potential for some interesting applications. Herein, we review recent progress of research on these functional nucleic acids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including naturally occurring ribozymes and riboswitches as well as artificially created DNAzymes and aptamers, have been popular molecular toolboxes for diverse applications. Given the high chemical stability of nucleic acids and their ability to fold into diverse sequence-dependent structures, FNAs are suggested to be highly functional under unusual reaction conditions. This review will examine the progress of research on FNAs under conditions of low pH, high temperature, freezing conditions, and the inclusion of organic solvents and denaturants that are known to disrupt nucleic acid structures. The FNA species to be discussed include ribozymes, riboswitches, G-quadruplex-based peroxidase mimicking DNAzymes, RNA-cleaving DNAzymes, and aptamers. Research within this space has not only revealed the hidden talents of FNAs but has also laid important groundwork for pursuing these intriguing functional macromolecules for unique applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids for biological imaging: This work comprehensively reviews the use of ionic liquids for preparing hard&#8208;to&#8208;image, non&#8208;conductive, soft, and/or wet, biological materials for electron microscopy. Commonly used ionic liquids and their application to biomaterials for imaging are summarized to illicit sample&#8208;specific best practices. While the technique has risen in popularity and holds promise for several biological fields, key challenges must be solved to allow for its widespread adoption in microscopy.







Abstract
For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapor pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of in&#8197;situ physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL, in&#8197;situ microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.

         <title>Labeling and Characterization of Phenol&#8208;Containing Glycopeptides Using Chemoselective Probes with Isotope Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS analysis. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery.







Abstract
Secondary metabolites are structurally diverse natural products (NPs) and have been widely used for medical applications. Developing new tools to enrich NPs can be a promising solution to isolate novel NPs from the native and complex samples. Here, we developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides by the ene&#8208;type labeling used in proteomic research. The clickable azido&#8208;linker was included for further biotin functionalization to facilitate the enrichment of labeled substrates. Afterward, our chemoselective method, in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS and MSn analysis, was demonstrated in bacterial cultures. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was labeled and characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery in complex environments.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring and engineered promiscuous halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues to be enzymatically synthesised and recycled, using simple and readily available alkyl iodides as alkyl donors. In combination with promiscuous methyltransferases (MTs), they dramatically expand the bioalkylation toolbox.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) and methyl iodide. Characterisation of a range of naturally occurring HMTs and subsequent protein engineering led to HMT variants capable of synthesising ethyl, propyl, and allyl analogues of SAM. Notably, HMTs do not depend on chemical synthesis of methionine analogues, as required by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). However, at the moment MATs have a much broader substrate scope than the HMTs. Herein we provide an overview of the discovery and engineering of promiscuous HMTs and how these strategies will pave the way towards a toolbox of HMT variants for versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Selection Methods of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries (DEL) have become a major technology platform in drug discovery. Besides encoding method, DEL&#8208;compatible chemistry, and analysis of large datasets, another important but less&#8208;covered technological component of DELs is selection method. Although presently DEL selection is predominantly conducted with immobilized proteins on a matrix, the recent development of novel DEL selection methods has expanded the target scope and led to novel utilities of DELs. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of DEL selection methods with a particular focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DEL) have come of age and become a major technology platform for ligand discovery in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Technological maturation in the past two decades and the recent explosive developments of DEL&#8208;compatible chemistries have greatly improved the chemical diversity of DELs and fueled its applications in drug discovery. A relatively less&#8208;covered aspect of DELs is the selection method. Typically, DEL selection is considered as a binding assay and the selection is conducted with purified protein targets immobilized on a matrix, and the binders are separated from the non&#8208;binding background via physical washes. However, the recent innovations in DEL selection methods have not only expanded the target scope of DELs, but also revealed the potential of the DEL technology as a powerful tool in exploring fundamental biology. In this Review, we first cover the &#8220;classic&#8221; DEL selection methods with purified proteins on solid phase, and then we discuss the strategies to realize DEL selections in solution phase. Finally, we focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellobiose was synthesized and evaluated for its effects on E. coli biofilms . The impact of the synthetic disaccharide on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays revealing an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate. Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo red binding to bacterial cells. Lastly, single electron microscopy reveals the disaccharide increased the production of curli fibers.







Abstract
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria growing in complex, multicellular enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Recently, a zwitterionic cellulose derivative produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined to play an important role in the formation and assembly of biofilms. In order to produce a minimal, yet structurally defined tool compound to probe the biology of the naturally occurring polymer, we have synthesized a zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose (pEtN cellobiose) and evaluated its biofilm activity in the gram&#8208;negative bacterium E. coli, a pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of UTIs. The impact of synthetic pEtN cellobiose on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays which revealed an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate compared to untreated samples. Additionally, Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo Red binding to bacterial cells. These results reveal new opportunities to study the impact glycopolymers have on cellular adhesion in gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

These results reveal new opportunities to study the impact glycopolymers have on cellular adhesion in gram-negative pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Recent Advances in Late&#8208;Stage Construction of Stapled Peptides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation stapling strategies of peptides catalyzed by transition metals, such as palladium, rhodium, and manganese, are discussed. These strategies which rely on directing groups (DGs) in the reaction can be classified into three categories: (1)&#8197;directly constructing stapled peptides without DGs; (2)&#8197;those using peptide backbones as DGs; (3)&#8197;those that install additional DGs to generate stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides have been widely applied in many fields, including pharmaceutical chemistry, diagnostic reagents, and materials science. However, most traditional stapled peptide preparation methods rely on prefunctionalizations, which limit the diversity of stapled peptides. Recently, the emergence of late&#8208;stage transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation in amino acids and peptides has attracted wide interest due to its robustness and applicability for peptide stapling. In this review, we summarize the methods for late&#8208;stage construction of stapled peptides via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;kinetics Reveal Dynamic Effects on the Chemistry of Human Dihydrofolate Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR) catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis are reported. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures.







Abstract
Effects of isotopic substitution on the rate constants of human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR), an important target for anti&#8208;cancer drugs, have not previously been characterized due to its complex fast kinetics. Here, we report the results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the HsDHFR catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures. The presented cryogenic approach provides an opportunity to probe the kinetics of mammalian DHFRs, thereby laying the foundation for characterizing their transition state structure.

         <title>Thermodynamic Stability of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Impact of Sequence and Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological functions of G&#8208;quadruplexes and their properties as exploited in various technological applications depend on their major fold adopted under specific conditions. The present minireview guides through structural and environmental factors that have been identified to play a major role in the formation and stability of G&#8208;quadruplexes.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes have attracted growing interest in recent years due to their occurrence in&#8197;vivo and their possible biological functions. In addition to being promising targets for drug design, these four&#8208;stranded nucleic acid structures have also been recognized as versatile tools for various technological applications. Whereas a large number of studies have yielded insight into their remarkable structural diversity, our current knowledge on G&#8208;quadruplex stabilities as a function of sequence and environmental factors only gradually emerges with an expanding collection of thermodynamic data. This minireview provides an overview of general rules that may be used to better evaluate quadruplex thermodynamic stabilities but also discusses present challenges in predicting most stable folds for a given sequence and environment.

         <title>Variety of Nucleotide Polymerase Mutants Aiming to Synthesize Modified RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces several nucleotide polymerase mutants that can incorporate chemically modified nucleotides. Altering amino acid residues around the active sites effectively renders both DNA and RNA polymerases tolerant to ribose 2&#8217; modified ribonucleotide substrates. Introduction of these modifications makes RNA stable and beneficial for therapeutics.







Abstract
Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic RNA aptamers that exploit synthetic RNA to capture target molecules. However, ensuring RNA aptamers are resistant against intrinsic nucleases remains an issue and restricts their use as therapeutics. Introduction of chemical modifications to the 2&#8242; sugar moiety of RNA improves their stability effectively and can be achieved by chemical synthesis using modified phosphoramidites; however, this approach is not suitable for preparing long RNA molecules. Although recombinant nucleotide polymerases can transcribe RNA, these polymerases cannot synthesize modified RNA because they do not recognize 2&#8242; modified nucleoside triphosphates. In this review, we focus on several polymerase mutants that tolerate substrates containing modifications of the 2&#8242; sugar moiety to synthesize RNA, and the problems that must be overcome to prepare chemically modified RNA with high efficacy by in&#8197;vitro transcription.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
