         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Ligand Binds Ascaris Telomere Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with Blue&#8208;Shift and Enhanced Emission</title>

Selective G4 DNA ligands: We report a novel microenvironment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent ligand (Q1) that shows selectivity to ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 through enhanced fluorescence intensity along with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted properties. The detailed interactions of Q1 with ASC20 G4 DNA are illustrated, and the results demonstrate that Q1 mainly binds at the terminals of ASC20 through an end&#8208;stacking mode.







Abstract
The development of small molecules that can selectively target G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNAs has drawn considerable attention due to their unique physiological and pathological functions. However, only a few molecules have been found to selectively bind a particular G4 DNA structure. We have developed a fluorescence ligand Q1, a molecular scaffold with a carbazole&#8211;pyridine core bridged by a phenylboronic acid side chain, that acts as a selective ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 ligand with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced fluorescence intensity. Photophysical properties revealed that Q1 was sensitive to the microenvironment and gave the best selectivity to ASC20 with an equilibrium binding constant Ka=6.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies also demonstrated that Q1 showed a longer fluorescence lifetime in the presence of ASC20. The binding characteristics of Q1 with ASC20 were shown in detail in a fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay, a 2&#8208;Ap titration experiment and by molecular docking. Ligand Q1 could adopt an appropriate pose at terminal G&#8208;quartets of ASC20 through multiple interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between aromatic rings; this led to strong fluorescence enhancement. In addition, a co&#8208;staining image showed that Q1 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, this work provides insights for the development of ligands that selectively targeting a specific G4 DNA structure.

         <title>Novel Dioxane and Morpholino Nucleotide Analogues: Syntheses and RNA&#8208;Hybridization Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1072-1078, March 16, 2021. </description>

Towards synthetic oligonucleotides: Starting from the 4&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;modified ribose derivative (1), synthetic routes to two novel nucleoside analogues with dioxane and morpholine central scaffolds were developed and realized in two diastereomeric series. The final phosphoramidites were incorporated into an artificial RNA double strand, and the thermal stabilities were determined by melting temperature analysis.







Abstract
A novel class of nucleotide analogues with a dioxane ring as central scaffold has been developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized, and the final thymidine analogues were synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to analogous morpholine derivatives. This opens up the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double&#8208;stranded RNA sequences, and their hybridization properties investigated by melting&#8208;temperature analysis. Both scaffolds, dioxanes and morpholines, had an equal impact on double&#8208;strand stability, but Tm values differed depending on the chirality in the six&#8208;membered ring.

         <title>A MIF&#8208;Derived Cyclopeptide that Inhibits MIF Binding and Atherogenic Signaling via the Chemokine Receptor CXCR2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1012-1019, March 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The specific targeting of the interaction between the atypical chemokine MIF and its receptor CXCR2, and its atherosclerosis&#8208;promoting activity in a tailored peptide&#8208;based approach is illustrated. Based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of short N&#8208;like loop&#8208;derived MIF peptides, the cyclic MIF peptide analogue MIF(cyclo10) was identified as a promising candidate that blocks MIF/CXCR2 and counteracts MIF's inflammatory and pro&#8208;atherogenic activity.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine and atypical chemokine with a key role in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. Key atherogenic functions of MIF are mediated by noncognate interaction with the chemokine receptor CXCR2. The MIF N&#8208;like loop comprising the sequence 47&#8211;56 is an important structural determinant of the MIF/CXCR2 interface and MIF(47&#8211;56) blocks atherogenic MIF activities. However, the mechanism and critical structure&#8211;activity information within this sequence have remained elusive. Here, we show that MIF(47&#8211;56) directly binds to CXCR2 to compete with MIF receptor activation. By using alanine scanning, essential and dispensable residues were identified. Moreover, MIF(cyclo10), a designed cyclized variant of MIF(47&#8211;56), inhibited key inflammatory and atherogenic MIF activities in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo/ex vivo, and exhibited strongly improved resistance to proteolytic degradation in human plasma in&#8197;vitro, thus suggesting that it could serve as a promising basis for MIF&#8208;derived anti&#8208;atherosclerotic peptides.

         <title>On the Use of Side&#8208;Chain NMR Relaxation Data to Derive Structural and Dynamical Information on Proteins: A Case Study Using Hen Lysozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1049-1064, March 16, 2021. </description>

Different techniques, same answer: The application of S2 order&#8208;parameter restraining molecular dynamics simulations to the protein HEWL shows that this technique is able to produce a conformational ensemble compatible with experimentally derived side&#8208;chain order parameters and demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic.







Abstract
Values of 
 and 
 order parameters derived from NMR relaxation measurements on proteins cannot be used straightforwardly to determine protein structure because they cannot be related to a single protein structure, but are defined in terms of an average over a conformational ensemble. Molecular dynamics simulation can generate a conformational ensemble and thus can be used to restrain 
 and 
 order parameters towards experimentally derived target values 
(exp) and 
(exp). Application of 
 and 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining MD simulation to bond vectors in 63 side chains of the protein hen egg white lysozyme using 51 
(exp) target values and 28 
(exp) target values shows that a conformational ensemble compatible with the experimentally derived data can be obtained by using this technique. It is observed that 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining of C&#8722;H bonds in methyl groups is less reliable than 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining because of the possibly less valid assumptions and approximations used to derive experimental 
(exp) values from NMR relaxation measurements and the necessity to adopt the assumption of uniform rotational motion of methyl C&#8722;H bonds around their symmetry axis and of the independence of these motions from each other. The restrained simulations demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic. Any hydrogen bonds they form and that appear in any of four different crystal structures, are fluctuating with short lifetimes in solution.

         <title>Millisecond Allosteric Dynamics of Activated Ras Reproduced with a Slowly Hydrolyzable GTP Analogue</title>

Slowly does it: The correlated internal motions of GTP&#947;S&#8208;bound Ras have been quantified using relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy with site&#8208;specific details, demonstrating its accurate preservation of the physiological dynamics network critical for the binding of allosteric ligands.







Abstract
The millisecond timescale dynamics of activated Ras transiently sample a low&#8208;populated conformational state that has distinct surface property from the major state and represents a promising target for binding of small&#8208;molecule compounds. To avoid the complications of hydrolysis, dynamics and other properties of active Ras have so far been routinely investigated by using non&#8208;hydrolyzable GTP analogues, which, however, were previously reported to alter both the kinetics and distribution of the conformational exchange. In this study, we quantitatively measured and validated the internal dynamics of Ras complexed with a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP&#947;S, which increases the lifetime of active Ras by 23 times relative to that of native GTP. It was found that GTP&#947;S, in addition to its better mimicking of the exchange kinetics than the commonly used non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogues GppNHp and GppCH2p, can rigorously reproduce the natural dynamics network in active Ras, thus indicating its fitness for use in the development of allosteric inhibitors.

         <title>The Charged Linker Modulates the Conformations and Molecular Interactions of Hsp90</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1084-1092, March 16, 2021. </description>

Open wide: The charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal and middle domains of Hsp90 contains two segments with transient secondary structure that interact dynamically with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this element partially detaches and exposes a hydrophobic site that mediates binding to the p53 client. Our results disclose additional roles of the NTD&#8722;MD linker.







Abstract
The molecular chaperone Hsp90 supports the functional activity of specific substrate proteins (clients). For client processing, the Hsp90 dimer undergoes a series of ATP&#8208;driven conformational rearrangements. Flexible linkers connecting the three domains of Hsp90 are crucial to enable dynamic arrangements. The long charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal (NTD) and middle (MD) domains exhibits additional functions in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. The structural basis for these functions remains unclear. Here, we characterize the conformation and dynamics of the linker and NTD&#8722;MD domain interactions by NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal two regions in the linker that are dynamic and exhibit secondary structure conformation. We show that these regions mediate transient interactions with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this strand detaches and exposes a hydrophobic surface patch, which enables binding to the p53 client. We propose that the charged linker plays an important regulatory role by coupling the Hsp90 NTD&#8722;MD arrangement with the accessibility of a client binding site on the NTD.

         <title>Fluorescent Peptide Biosensor for Probing CDK6 Kinase Activity in Lung Cancer Cell Extracts</title>

Distinguished kinases: We describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase, that reports on CDK6 kinase activity in&#8197;vitro and in lung cancer cell extracts. Implementation of this biosensor in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients highlights differences between CDK6 kinase activity and closely related CDK4 kinase activity.







Abstract
CDK6 kinase regulates cell&#8208;cycle progression in G1, together with CDK4, but has cell&#8208;, tissue&#8208; and developmentally distinct functions associated with transcription, angiogenesis and metabolism. Although CDK6 makes an attractive cancer biomarker and target, there are no means of assessing its activity in a complex environment. In this study, we describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase that reports on CDK6 kinase activity through sensitive changes in fluorescence intensity. This biosensor can report on CDK6 activity in a dose&#8208;dependent fashion, thereby enabling quantification of differences in kinase activity in complex and physiologically relevant environments. Further implementation of this biosensor in different lung and melanoma cell lines, as well as in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients together with a CDK4 biosensor highlighted differences in kinase activity between CDK6 and CDK4 kinase. This work demonstrates the utility of these selective tools for monitoring two closely related kinases comparatively and simultaneously in the same samples, thereby offering attractive perspectives for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

CDA&#8208;Luc: The M. tuberculosis cyclic dinucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, is leveraged to establish a coupled enzyme assay that facilitates high&#8208;throughput quantification of the bacterial signaling molecule 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. This assay can be carried out in 96&#8208;well plate format and read out by a standard luminescence plate reader, thereby replacing conventional LC&#8208;MS&#8208;based quantification assays.







Abstract
Cyclic dinucleotide signaling systems, which are found ubiquitously throughout nature, allow organisms to rapidly and dynamically sense and respond to alterations in their environments. In recent years, the second messenger, cyclic di&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP), has been identified as an essential signaling molecule in a diverse array of bacterial genera. We and others have shown that defects in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP homeostasis result in severe physiological defects and virulence attenuation in many bacterial species. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP levels. To address this limitation, we describe here the development of a luciferase&#8208;based coupled enzyme assay that leverages the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, for the sensitive and high&#8208;throughput quantification of 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for the quantification of the cyclic oligonucleotide&#8208;based anti&#8208;phage signaling system (CBASS) effector, 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP. These findings establish CDA&#8208;Luc as a more affordable and sensitive alternative to conventional c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP detection tools with broad utility for the study of bacterial cyclic dinucleotide physiology.

         <title>Regulation of Lipid Bilayer Ion Permeability by Antibacterial Polymethyloxazoline&#8208;Polyethyleneimine Copolymers</title>

Coming through: The black lipid membrane technique was used to investigate the membrane&#8208;permeabilization abilities of a series of amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers. The most potent antibacterial polymer induces step&#8208;like current behavior typical for an ion&#8208;channel.







Abstract
Amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers display activity against the outer bacterial cell membrane, triggering various physiological effects. We investigated the regulation of ion transport across the lipid bilayer to understand differences in biological activity for a series of amphiphilic polymethyloxazoline &#8211; polyethyleneimine copolymers. The results confirmed that the tested structures were able to increase the permeability of the lipid bilayer (LB) membrane or its rupture. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments show that the triggered conductance profile and its character is strongly correlated with the polymer structure and zeta potential. The polymer exhibiting the highest antimicrobial activity promotes ion transport by using a unique mechanism and step&#8208;like characteristics with well&#8208;defined discreet openings and closings. The molecule was incorporated into the membrane in a reproducible way, and the observed channel&#8208;like activity could be responsible for the antibacterial activity of this molecule.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coming through&lt;/b&gt;: The black lipid membrane technique was used to investigate the membrane&#8208;permeabilization abilities of a series of amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers. The most potent antibacterial polymer induces step&#8208;like current behavior typical for an ion&#8208;channel.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers display activity against the outer bacterial cell membrane, triggering various physiological effects. We investigated the regulation of ion transport across the lipid bilayer to understand differences in biological activity for a series of amphiphilic polymethyloxazoline &#8211; polyethyleneimine copolymers. The results confirmed that the tested structures were able to increase the permeability of the lipid bilayer (LB) membrane or its rupture. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments show that the triggered conductance profile and its character is strongly correlated with the polymer structure and zeta potential. The polymer exhibiting the highest antimicrobial activity promotes ion transport by using a unique mechanism and step&#8208;like characteristics with well&#8208;defined discreet openings and closings. The molecule was incorporated into the membrane in a reproducible way, and the observed channel&#8208;like activity could be responsible for the antibacterial activity of this molecule.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>CYP154C5 Regioselectivity in Steroid Hydroxylation Explored by Substrate Modifications and Protein Engineering**
</title>

Changes in selectivity: Using substrate and protein engineering based on key residues and functional groups, the regioselectivity of the bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP154C5 in the hydroxylation of different steroids was altered. Apart from 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, steroid products containing hydroxy groups in 15&#945; and 21 position were formed.







Abstract
CYP154C5 from Nocardia farcinica is a P450 monooxygenase able to hydroxylate a range of steroids with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity at the 16&#945;&#8208;position. Using protein engineering and substrate modifications based on the crystal structure of CYP154C5, an altered regioselectivity of the enzyme in steroid hydroxylation had been achieved. Thus, conversion of progesterone by mutant CYP154C5 F92A resulted in formation of the corresponding 21&#8208;hydroxylated product 11&#8208;deoxycorticosterone in addition to 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation. Using MD simulation, this altered regioselectivity appeared to result from an alternative binding mode of the steroid in the active site of mutant F92A. MD simulation further suggested that the entrance of water to the active site caused higher uncoupling in this mutant. Moreover, exclusive 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was observed for wild&#8208;type CYP154C5 in the conversion of 5&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;3&#8208;one, lacking an oxy&#8208;functional group at C17. Overall, our data give valuable insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of this cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for steroid hydroxylation.

         <title>Stepwise Strategy for One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Rings from Multiple Short Fragments</title>

One at a time, please: Large, circular, single&#8208;stranded DNAs (up to 452&#8208;nt sizes) have been efficiently prepared from multiple linear, single&#8208;stranded short DNA fragments by using T4 DNA ligase through sequential addition of different sets of splints in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The lengths of splints and the order of splint addition were optimized to obtain a satisfying yield of c&#8208;ssDNA products. This method is convenient and practical, and benefits the development of DNA nanotechnology and bioscience.







Abstract
Cyclic rings of single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA have various unique properties, but wider applications have been hampered by their poor availability. This paper reports a convenient one&#8208;pot method in which these rings are efficiently synthesized by using T4 DNA ligase through convergent cyclization of easily available short DNA fragments. The key to the present method is to separate all the splint oligonucleotides into several sets, and add each set sequentially at an appropriate interval to the solutions containing all the short DNA fragments. Compared with simple one&#8208;pot strategies involving simultaneous addition of all the splints at the beginning of the reaction, both the selectivity and the yields of target ssDNA rings are greatly improved. This convergent method is especially useful for preparing large&#8208;sized rings that are otherwise hard to obtain. By starting from six short DNA fragments (71&#8211;82&#8197;nt), prepared by a DNA synthesizer, a ssDNA ring of 452&#8208;nt size was synthesized in 35&#8197;mol&#8201;% yield and in high selectivity. Satisfactorily pure DNA rings were obtainable simply by treating the crude products with exonuclease.

Silver lining: Antibiotic resistance jeopardizes the effective treatment of infectious diseases and represents an increasing threat to public health. We discovered that the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene 1,3&#8208;dibenzyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene silver(I) acetate (SBC3) is a potent inhibitor of bacterial thioredoxin reductase that proved to be highly effective against resistant Gram&#8208;negative nosocomial isolates.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem for public health and associated with increasing economic costs and mortality rates. Silver and silver&#8208;related compounds have been used for centuries due to their antimicrobial properties. In this work, we show that 1,3&#8208;dibenzyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene silver(I) acetate/NHC*&#8208;Ag&#8208;OAc (SBC3) is a reversible, high affinity inhibitor of E. coli thioredoxin reductase (TrxR; Ki=10.8&#177;1.2&#8197;nM). Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) tests with different E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains demonstrated that SBC3 can efficiently inhibit bacterial cell growth, especially in combination with established antibiotics like gentamicin. Our results show that SBC3 is a promising antibiotic drug candidate targeting bacterial TrxR.

See what&#8216;s missing: Biosynthetic study of plant metabolites paves the way for manufacturing plant&#8208;derived drugs by synthetic biology. However, identifying any missing enzymes in a plant metabolic pathway is a formidable challenge. Biosynthetic intermediate probes make potentially useful tools to resolve the challenge by visualizing biosynthetic enzymes to facilitate transcriptome analysis or chemical proteomics approaches for identifying the biosynthetic enzymes.







Abstract
Plant metabolites play important roles in both plant physiology and drug discovery. Taking advantage of new emerging technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), whole genome assembly, bioinformatics, omics&#8208;based strategies have been demonstrated as popular and powerful ways to elucidate complex metabolic pathways in plants. In this viewpoint, biosynthetic intermediates probes have been proposed as the potentinal tools to study the plant natural product biosynthesis via chemical proteomics appoaches or transcriptome analysis.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 985-987, March 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

Multicomponent products are assembled step by step: When more than three kinds of parts are used to prepare thousands of big molecules with a specific structure, the procedure has to be carefully designed. For example, when ligating ssDNA strands to a long circular ssDNA, each group should contain only two or three stands to give a high yield. This rule has to be obeyed until the final product is obtained, otherwise, the materials will be used up before it is ready. This design is suitable for preparing any other complex molecule. More information can be found in the full paper by X. G. Liang et&#8197;al.

Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides are being used as stable scaffolds to produce bioactive grafted peptides with either a single epitope (first generation), two identical epitopes (second generation), or two distinct epitopes (third generation). The spatial grid is a metaphor for the tridimensional design one needs to consider when combining a scaffold with one or more epitopes. More information can be found in the minireview by F. Plisson et&#8197;al. Picture by R. G.&#8208;C.

COVID&#8208;19 is a pandemic that requires global action. This review presents the latest status of research on the use of two drugs (favipiravir and remdesivir) in tackling COVID&#8208;19, and offers an overview of the life cycle and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. It is hoped that the opportunities and challenges brought about by the use of these two drugs can be illuminated for future research.







Abstract
The human world is currently influenced largely by the outbreak of pandemic COVID&#8208;19. At this moment, most researchers focus on developing treatment strategies and measures to work against COVID&#8208;19. Treatment strategies specific for COVID&#8208;19 are lacking. This article provides an overview of the life cycle and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The therapeutic effects of two drugs [i.&#8201;e., remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV)] which can potentially tackle COVID&#8208;19 are discussed based on current published data. This review can serve as a reference for future studies.

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide Oxidation by Sulfide Quinone Oxidoreductase</title>

Regulating sulfide toxicity and signaling: Utilizing an active&#8208;site cysteine trisulfide, human sulfide quinone oxidoreductase detoxifies hydrogen sulfide, a respiratory poison. Herein, we detail the remarkable enzymology of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase and its potential modulation of sulfide signaling.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an environmental toxin and a heritage of ancient microbial metabolism that has stimulated new interest following its discovery as a neuromodulator. While many physiological responses have been attributed to low H2S levels, higher levels inhibit complex IV in the electron transport chain. To prevent respiratory poisoning, a dedicated set of enzymes that make up the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway exists to clear H2S. The committed step in this pathway is catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), which couples sulfide oxidation to coenzyme Q10 reduction in the electron transport chain. The SQOR reaction prevents H2S accumulation and generates highly reactive persulfide species as products; these can be further oxidized or can modify cysteine residues in proteins by persulfidation. Here, we review the kinetic and structural characteristics of human SQOR, and how its unconventional redox cofactor configuration and substrate promiscuity lead to sulfide clearance and potentially expand the signaling potential of H2S. This dual role of SQOR makes it a promising target for H2S&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Enzymatic Modification of Cellulose To Unlock Its Exploitation in Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 974-981, March 16, 2021. </description>

Promising new biomaterials: Cellulose, the most abundant natural polymer, is of great interest for industrial use, due to its low cost, chemical stability, mechanical properties and recyclability. The application of different enzyme&#8208;based processes to modify cellulose are reviewed here. The type of reaction, the mediators, substrates and enzymes used and the properties of cellulose derivatives are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Nowadays natural biopolymers have a wide variety of uses in various industrial applications, such as food, adhesives and composite materials. Among them, cellulose has attracted the interest of researchers due to its properties: high strength and flexibility, biocompatibility and nontoxicity. Despite that, in many cases its practical use is limited because of poor solubility and/or an unsuitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In this context, enzymatic modification appears as a powerful strategy to overcome these problems through selective, green and environmentally friendly processes. This minireview discusses the different methods developed for the enzymatic modification of cellulose, emphasizing the type of reaction, the enzymes used (laccases, esterases, lipases, hexokinases, etc.), and the properties and applications of the cellulose derivatives obtained. Considering that cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth and can be derived from residual lignocellulosic biomass, the impact of its use in bio&#8208;based process following the logic of the circular economy is relevant.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Rich Peptides: Hyperstable Scaffolds for Protein Engineering</title>

Better in the loop: Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides possess hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and proteolytic degradation. These peptides have been successfully used as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process in which cysteine&#8208;rich structures enclave an exogenous and bioactive epitope that provides higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to the epitope and new functionality to the scaffold.







Abstract
Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides (CRPs) are small proteins of less than 100 amino acids in length characterized by the presence of disulfide bridges and common end&#8208;to&#8208;end macrocyclization. These properties confer hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and protease degradation to CRPs. Moreover, their intercysteine domains (loops) are susceptible to residue hypervariability. CRPs have been successfully applied as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process in which cysteine&#8208;rich structures provide higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to an epitope and acquire new biological function(s). This review describes the successes and limitations of seven cysteine&#8208;rich scaffolds, their bioactive epitopes, and the resulting grafted peptides.

         <title>Coniferyl Alcohol Radical Detection by the Dirigent Protein AtDIR6 Monitored by EPR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 992-995, March 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of CA&#8226; by DIR has been observed experimentally. Using controlled photo&#8208;irradiation of coniferyl alcohol to generate a CA&#8226; and room temperature EPR and HPLC to monitor its fate, we demonstrate that the dirigent protein AtDIR6 stabilizes the formed radical prior to directing the coupling of radicals towards the formation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pinoresinol.







Abstract
Plant dirigent proteins (DIRs) control the stereoselectivity of the monolignol coniferyl alcohol radical coupling. The main mechanistic hypothesis on this chemo&#8208; and stereoselective reaction invokes a binding of coniferyl alcohol radical substrates in the dirigent protein active site so that only one enantiomeric form can be produced. We have studied the influence of the Arabidopsis thaliana AtDIR6 protein on the transient coniferyl alcohol radical by EPR. Herein, we show that AtDIR6 stabilizes coniferyl alcohol radicals prior to directing their coupling towards the formation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pinoresinol.

         <title>An Animal Able To Tolerate D2O</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 988-991, March 16, 2021. </description>

Anhydrobiosis allows two&#8208;step organismal H2O to D2O replacement in the nematode P. superbus, as well as its survival. It is thus the first animal species shown to reproduce in 99.9&#8201;% D2O. In silico structural analyses reveal that its water channel protein is an aquaglyceroporin, whose larger pore might help explain successful organismal influx of D2O.







Abstract
It is possible to gain a deeper insight into the role of water in biology by using physicochemical variant molecules, such as deuterium oxide (D2O); however, D2O is toxic to multicellular organisms in high concentrations. By using a unique desiccation&#8208;rehydration process, we demonstrate that the anhydrobiotic nematode Panagrolaimus superbus is able to tolerate and proliferate in 99&#8201;% D2O. Moreover, we analysed P. superbus&#8217; water&#8208;channel protein (aquaporin; AQP), which is associated with dehydration/rehydration, by comparing its primary structure and modelling its tertiary structure in silico. Our data evidence that P. superbus&#8217; AQP is an aquaglyceroporin, a class of water channel known to display a wider pore; this helps to explain the rapid and successful organismal influx of D2O into this species. This is the first demonstration of an animal able to withstand high D2O levels, thus paving a way for the investigation of the effects D2O on higher levels of biological organization.

         <title>A Methionine Chemical Shift Based Order Parameter Characterizing Global Protein Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1001-1004, March 16, 2021. </description>

Near or far: The solution 13C&#8208;NMR chemical shifts of methione methyl groups in a protein are linearly correlated with the values calculated from rigid X&#8208;ray models. The protein dependent slope provides an order parameter for the network of dynamic interactions connecting motions of distant residues.







Abstract
Coupling of side chain dynamics over long distances is an important component of allostery. Methionine side chains show the largest intrinsic flexibility among methyl&#8208;containing residues but the actual degree of conformational averaging depends on the proximity and mobility of neighboring residues. The 13C NMR chemical shifts of the methyl groups of methionine residues located at long distances in the same protein show a similar scaling with respect to the values predicted from the static X&#8208;ray structure by quantum methods. This results in a good linear correlation between calculated and observed chemical shifts. The slope is protein dependent and ranges from zero for the highly flexible calmodulin to 0.7 for the much more rigid calcineurin catalytic domain. The linear correlation is indicative of a similar level of side&#8208;chain conformational averaging over long distances, and the slope of the correlation line can be interpreted as an order parameter of the global side&#8208;chain flexibility.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for the Directed Evolution of Hydroxynitrile Lyase towards Cyanohydrin Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 996-1000, March 16, 2021. </description>

Making biohydrocyanation measurable: Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyze the enantioselective cleavage/formation of cyanohydrins. However, current methods for determining hydrocyanation are not suitable for mass screening of mutants for protein engineering of these biocatalysts. We demonstrate herein a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening method for cyanohydrin synthesis that is validated by either substrate profiling or the directed evolution of HNLs.







Abstract
Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. However, currently available methods for demonstrating hydrocyanation are still stalled at precise, but low&#8208;throughput, GC or HPLC analyses. Herein, we report a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method that is feasible for the cyanohydrin synthesis reaction. This method was highly anti&#8208;interference and sensitive, and could be used to directly profile the substrate scope of HNLs either in cell&#8208;free extract or fermentation clear broth. This HTS method was also validated by generating new variants of PcHNL5 that presented higher catalytic efficiency and stronger acidic tolerance in variant libraries.

         <title>Tuning the Transglycosylation Reaction of a GH11 Xylanase by a Delicate Enhancement of its Thumb Flexibility</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shifting the balance: Glycoside hydrolases are attractive tools for the enzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates. We used the xylanase from B. circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and the transglycosylation reaction. A point mutation that enhances the flexibility and dynamics of BCX active site shifts the balance of the enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are attractive tools for multiple biotechnological applications. In conjunction with their hydrolytic function, GHs can perform transglycosylation under specific conditions. In nature, oligosaccharide synthesis is performed by glycosyltransferases (GTs); however, the industrial use of GTs is limited by their instability in solution. A key difference between GTs and GHs is the flexibility of their binding site architecture. We have used the xylanase from Bacillus circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and transglycosylation. Residues of the BCX &#8220;thumb&#8221; were substituted to increase the flexibility of the enzyme binding site. Replacement of the highly conserved residue P116 with glycine shifted the balance of the BCX enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation. The effects of this point mutation on the structure and dynamics of BCX were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The P116G mutation induces subtle changes in the configuration of the thumb and enhances the millisecond dynamics of the active site. Based on our findings, we propose the remodelling of the GH enzymes glycon site flexibility as a strategy to improve the transglycosylation efficiency of these biotechnologically important catalysts.

         <title>Production of the Carboxylate Reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a Soluble, Active Form for in&#8197;vitro Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic reduction of carboxylates: Optimization of cultivation parameters and host strain selection were fundamental to decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies and enhancing the production of NoCAR, which was able to reduce up to 65&#8197;mM sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde in 24&#8197;h with integrated in&#8197;vitro recycling of NADPH and ATP.







Abstract
Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over&#8208;reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (NoCAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post&#8208;translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of Escherichia coli tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110&#8208;fold increase in the specific activity of NoCAR. This highly active NoCAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an in&#8197;vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30&#8197;mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2&#8197;h of reaction.

         <title>Sirtuin 2 Regulates Protein LactoylLys Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play roles in both physiological and pathophysiological processes through the regulation of enzyme structure and function. We recently identified a novel PTM, lactoylLys, derived through a non&#8208;enzymatic mechanism from the glycolytic by&#8208;product, lactoylglutathione. Under physiologic scenarios, glyoxalase 2 prevents the accumulation of lactoylglutathione and thus lactoylLys modifications. What dictates the site&#8208;specificity and abundance of lactoylLys PTMs, however, remains unknown. Here, we report sirtuin 2 as a lactoylLys eraser. Using chemical biology and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, we show that SIRT2 controls the abundance of this PTM both globally and on chromatin. These results address a major gap in our understanding of how non&#8208;enzymatic PTMs are regulated and controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Hydrocarbon Conjugation and Cyclisation in Synthetic Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strength in weakness: Selective and high&#8208;yielding late&#8208;stage modifications to unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins are enabled by S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine by using weakly electrophilic alkyl halides and zinc complexes. Under neutral conditions, iodoalkanes do not compromise selectivity for cysteine: Zn2+ can bind other amino acids but only Cys is alkylated.







Abstract
The conventional S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine relies upon using activated electrophiles. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;yielding and selective S&#8208;alkylation and S&#8208;lipidation of cysteines in unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins by using weak electrophiles and a Zn2+ promoter. Linear or branched iodoalkanes can S&#8208;alkylate cysteine in an unprotected 38&#8208;residue Myc peptide fragment and in a 91&#8208;residue miniprotein Omomyc, thus highlighting selective late&#8208;stage synthetic modifications. Metal&#8208;assisted cysteine alkylation is also effective for incorporating dehydroalanine into unprotected peptides and for peptide cyclisation via aliphatic thioether crosslinks, including customising macrocycles to stabilise helical peptides for enhanced uptake and delivery to proteins inside cells. Chemoselective and efficient late&#8208;stage Zn2+&#8208;promoted cysteine alkylation in unprotected peptides and proteins promises many useful applications.

         <title>Recent Advances of DNA Tetrahedra for Therapeutic Delivery and Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nanodevices: DNA tetrahedra represent a versatile construct that can be functionalized for numerous purposes including the delivery of small molecules and oligonucleotide therapeutics to the cell as well as a range of applications for biosensing. In this minireview, a number of exciting recent advances in functional nanodevices based on this intriguing structure are highlighted.







Abstract
The chemical and self&#8208;assembly properties of nucleic acids make them ideal for the construction of discrete structures and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices for a diverse array of applications. Amongst the various three&#8208;dimensional assemblies, DNA tetrahedra are of particular interest, as these structures have been shown to be readily taken up by the cell, by the process of caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, without the need for transfection agents. Moreover, these structures can be readily modified with a diverse range of pendant groups to confer greater functionality. This minireview highlights recent advances related to applications of this interesting DNA structure including the delivery of therapeutic agents ranging from small molecules to oligonucleotides in addition to its use for sensing and imaging various species within the cell.

         <title>Fluorophosphonates on&#8208;Demand: A General and Simplified Approach toward Fluorophosphonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not too demanding: A robust and purification&#8208;free, one&#8208;step synthesis has been developed to enable the on&#8208;demand preparation of structurally diverse fluorophosphonates from a stable, and storable &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of readily accessible p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. Additionally, a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay protocol is highlighted that further facilitates the rapid screening of these valuable activity&#8208;based probes.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general and simplified synthesis of fluorophosphonates directly from p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. This FP on&#8208;demand reaction is mediated by a commercially available polymer&#8208;supported fluoride reagent that produces a variety (25 examples) of fluorophosphonates in high yields while only requiring reagent filtration for pure fluorophosphonate isolation. This reaction protocol facilitates the rapid profiling of serine hydrolases with diverse and novel sets of activated phosphonates with differential proteome reactivity. Moreover, slight modification of the procedure into a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay format has enabled additional screening efficiency.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G&#8594;T substitutions in the third G4&#8208;tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild&#8208;type sequence into a three&#8208;tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1:3:1 and a minor 1:2:2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1:3:1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;occurring Congeners Reveal the Position of Enantiomeric Amino Acids in Nonribosomal Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The position of enantiomeric amino acid residues in some nonribosomal peptides can be revealed by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners. This concept does not rely on genome sequencing and is an alternative to laborious approaches based on partial peptide hydrolysis or the synthesis of diastereomers.







Abstract
The absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined by Marfey's method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A challenge to structure elucidation arises when both d and l enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are present. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality that governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The information on configuration provided by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners can reveal unequivocally the stereochemical sequence of the whole peptide family.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapour pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of  in situ  physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL,  in situ  microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Reversed&#8208;Phase Flash Chromatography Purification of Peptides and Chemically Modified Insulins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purification of peptides made easy: Automated flash chromatography using reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance columns and low&#8208;to&#8208;medium pressure is an alternative to HPLC. It enables the purification of peptides that are poorly soluble or very hydrophobic.







Abstract
Preparative reversed&#8208;phase HPLC is the established method for the purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for the purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including the choice of columns, eluents, and gradients. We believe that HPFC is a valuable alternative to HPLC purification of peptides and small proteins.

         <title>Asparaginyl Ligases: New Enzymes for the Protein Engineer&#8217;s Toolbox</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;catalysed site&#8208;specific protein modifications enable the precision manufacture of conjugates for the study of protein function and/or for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Asparaginyl ligases are a class of highly efficient transpeptidases with the capacity to modify proteins bearing only a tripeptide recognition motif. Here we review the types of protein modifications that are accessible using these enzymes, including N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal protein labelling, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation, and protein&#8208;protein conjugation. We describe the progress that has been made to engineer highly efficient ligases as well as efforts to chemically manipulate the enzyme reaction to favour product formation. These enzymes are powerful additions to the protein engineer&#8217;s toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CRISPR&#8208;BLI platform for real&#8208;time, sensitive, and&#160;specific DNA detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been widely applied for nucleic acid detection because of its high specificity. By using the highly specific and irreversible bond between HaloTag and its alkane chlorine ligand, we modified dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR/Cas 9) with biotin as a biosensor to detect nucleic acids. The CRISPR biosensor was facilely prepared to adequately maintain its DNA&#8208;recognition capability. Furthermore, by coupling biolayer interferometry (BLI) with the CRISPR biosensor, a real&#8208;time, sensitive, and rapid digital system called CRISPR&#8211;BLI was established for the detection of double&#8208;stranded DNA. The CRISPR biosensor immobilised on the biolayer could recruit the target DNA onto the biosensor surface and change its optical thickness, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern and responding signal of the BLI. The CRISPR&#8211;BLI system was further applied to detect the ALP &#160;gene of Escherichia coil DH5&#945; combined with polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated a linear range from 20 to 20,000 pg and a low detection limit (1.34 pg). The CRISPR&#8211;BLI system is a promising approach for rapid and sensitive detection of target DNA analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Methionine Sulfoxide on the Synthesis and Purification of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ox and red: A synthesis and purification method for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and aggregation&#8208;prone peptides that exploits the reversibility of methionine oxidation is reported. Incorporating methionine sulfoxide rather than methionine reduces aggregation during peptide synthesis and significantly facilitates peptide purification due to the increased peptide polarity. Final reduction to methionine proceeds smoothly and quantitatively.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step synthesis for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation&#8208;prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields the crude peptide, with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine&#8208;rich Tar&#8208;DNA&#8208;binding protein 43 (307&#8211;347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated by the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation&#8208;prone peptides from the human prion protein.

         <title>Artificial Organelles: Towards Adding or Restoring Intracellular Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoreactors meet living systems. Artificial organelles, synthetic analogues of natural organelles, are gaining interest for the correction of dysfunctional intracellular processes and the addition of novel functionalities to living systems. This review outlines the different strategies via which these mostly nanosized catalytic compartments are produced and integrated with living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is one of the main characteristics that define living systems. Creating a physically separated microenvironment allows nature a better control over biological processes, as is clearly specified by the role of organelles in living cells. Inspired by this phenomenon, researchers have developed a range of different approaches to create artificial organelles: compartments with catalytic activity that add new function to living cells. In this review we will discuss three complementary lines of investigation. First, orthogonal chemistry approaches are discussed, which are based on the incorporation of catalytically active transition metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles in living cells. The second approach involves the use of premade hybrid nanoreactors, which show transient function when taken up by living cells. The third approach utilizes mostly genetic engineering methods to create bio&#8208;based structures that can be ultimately integrated with the cell's genome to make them constitutively active. The current state of the art and the scope and limitations of the field will be highlighted with selected examples from the three approaches.

         <title>Ligand Binding to Dynamically Populated G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Returning to the fold: We reveal the molecular mechanisms of binding of a small&#8208;molecule ligand to dynamically populated G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4). Upon ligand binding, a large G4 conformational redistribution occurs. This is driven by a combination of two distinct phenomena: ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and ligand&#8208;induced trapping of folded G4 conformations.







Abstract
Several small&#8208;molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered to be promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures of varying stability, and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA by using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 and a combination of single&#8208;molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopies. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre&#8208;folded G4 structures and that Phen&#8208;DC3 also induces G4 formation in unfolded single strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions that do not involve direct ligand&#8208;induced G4 conformational interconversion. On the contrary, the redistribution is driven by ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short&#8208;lived conformation states. Thus, ligand&#8208;induced stabilization does not necessarily require the initial presence of stably folded G4s.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making a difference: Inorganic enzyme mimics, mainly consisting of inorganic complexes and nanozymes, have attracted much interest and found widespread applications in healthcare, energy, and environmental fields. Because of their splendid properties, such as high stability, tailorable activity and low cost, these enzyme mimics are making and will continue to make a big difference in future science and technology.







Abstract
Enzyme mimics (or artificial enzymes) have emerged as valuable alternatives to natural enzymes since the pioneering work of Ronald Breslow. They have numerous advantages over natural enzymes, such as high stability, low cost, and tailorable activity. Among varieties of materials explored to mimic enzymes, the inorganic ones, including inorganic complexes and nanomaterials, have attracted increasing interest over the last decade and have the potential to address the current challenges in energy, environment, health, etc.

         <title>Two triterpene synthases from Imperata cylindrica catalyzing the formation of a pair of diastereoisomers through boat or chair cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imperata cylindrica  is known to produce a pair of triterpenes, isoarborinol and fernenol, that exhibit identical planar structures but possess opposite stereochemistry at six of the nine chiral centers. These differences arise from a  boat  or a  chair  cyclization of the B&#8208;ring of the substrate. Here, we report the characterization of three OSC genes from  I. cylindrica  . IcOSC1 and IcOSC5 were identified as isoarborinol and fernenol synthases, respectively, while IcOSC3 was characterized as a multifunctional enzyme that produces glutinol and friedelin as its major products. Mutational studies of isoarborinol and fernenol synthases revealed that the residues surrounding the DCTAE motif partially affected the conformation of the B&#8208;ring during cyclization. Additionally, the IcOSC1&#8208;W255H mutant produced the rare triterpene boehmerol. The introduced histidine residue presumably abstracted a proton during the intermediary carbocation at C18 during the 1,2&#8208;rearrangement processes. Expression analysis indicated that all OSC genes were highly expressed in stems.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silent treatment: Glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. We report the largest subset of glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors, which are produced and identified after the silent biosynthetic gene cluster plu1881&#8211;1877 is activated in the native host P. laumondii.







Abstract
The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin&#8197;A and cepafungin&#8197;I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) plu1881&#8211;1877 is present in entomopathogenic Photorhabdus laumondii but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in Escherichia coli. Their chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Biological Applications of O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar modifications on proteins enable cells to respond quickly to environmental cues. We review the plethora of chemical strategies to access precise glycoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc peptides and full proteins and explore the translational use of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptides and glycoproteins as biomarkers, mechanistic probes, and therapeutics. Synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycobiology is poised to rapidly identify roles in chronic and infectious disease.







Abstract
All human cells use O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modifications (O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists in defining precise roles for specific O&#8208;GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non&#8208;genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of O&#8208;GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this review details the state of the art of two strategies for O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modification: advances in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; installation of O&#8208;GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure&#8211;function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational O&#8208;GlcNAc biology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Two&#8208;Photon AIEgens and Their Application in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving potential: Two&#8208;photon AIEgen probes have attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages of large penetration depth, little light damage, dark field imaging and target excitation. This paper reviews the most representative two&#8208;photon imaging technology of the past five years, and discusses its great application potential in the field of biological imaging.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, little light damage, and high spatiotemporal resolution, which make it a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easily reduced or disappears completely, and is not conducive to optimal application. The concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides a solution to the problem of aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption properties can readily be improved just by increasing the loading content of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probes based on AIEgen to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in&#8197;vitro/in&#8197;vivo has become a major research hotspot. This review aims to summarize representative two&#8208;photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene, quinoline, naphthalene and other new structures from the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.

         <title>IsPETase Is a Novel Biocatalyst for Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottle: IsPETase is receiving increased attention for its ability to degrade crystalline PET, a major cause of plastic pollution. This review summarizes the current state of investigation into IsPETase and puts forward the necessity of utilizing and engineering IsPETase for industrial applications.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic polyesters, but also a major cause of plastic pollution. Because the chemical degradation of PET would be uneconomical and rather burdensome, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring enzymatic processes for the disposal of PET waste. Many PET&#8208;hydrolyzing enzymes have been reported in recent decades, some of which demonstrate excellent potential for industrial applications. This review sets out to summarize the state of investigation into IsPETase, a cutinase&#8208;like enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis possessing ability to degrade crystalline PET, and to gain further insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of IsPETase. Benefiting from the continuing identification of novel cutinase&#8208;like proteins and growing availability of the engineered IsPETase, we may anticipate future developments in this type of enzyme would generate suitable biocatalyst for industrial use.

         <title>Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 Transcriptional Systems for Sensing and Genome Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transforming transcription: Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcription systems that rely on exogenous and endogenous cues to conditionally control the function of dCas9 proteins or gRNAs have provided pioneering platforms for genome engineering, cell&#8208;specific sensing and therapies.







Abstract
The clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats&#8208;associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR&#8208;Cas9) and the nuclease&#8208;deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized our ability to precisely engineer and regulate genomes. Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein using exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for the spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing, and so on. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in conditionally controlling CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcriptional systems through gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.

         <title>Investigation of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D  2  (VD  2  ) and vitamin D  3  (VD  3  ) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain,  Kutzneria albida  , was identified, showing the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  2  and 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  . To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  and 10&#8208;fold higher concentrations of 25&#8209;OH&#8208;D  2  after addition of 5% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single hydroxylation products, the human double hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  2  and 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  3  and various other potential single and double hydroxylation products were detected. Thus,  K. albida  represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD  2  and VD  3  metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the interaction of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 polypeptides with the chaperonin nanomachine GroEL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Huntington&#8217;s disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon&#8208;1 region of huntingtin (htt  ex1  ), resulting in an aggregation prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various htt  ex1  constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of htt  ex1  constructs with intact GroEL and a mini&#8208;chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation&#8208;based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100&#8208;400 m s with equilibrium dissociation constants (  K  D  ) of &#160;~1&#8208;2 mM. The binding interface is formed by the N&#8208;terminal amphiphilic region of htt  ex1  (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric htt  ex1  by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing multiple, non&#8208;proteogenic substitutions to optimize CSP:ComD hydrophobic interactions in group1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pneumoniae  (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) &#8208; mediated quorum sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in  S. pneumoniae  can therefore be utilized to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility for resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure&#8208;activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP&#8208;based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence microscopy imaging provides information about the localization and trafficking of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. To visualize these proteins, reporter groups must be introduced on the surface of live cells. This review discusses live&#8208;cell protein labelling by small, genetically encoded peptide tags serving as enzyme substrates or recognition sites for interactions with proteins, coiled&#8208;coil peptides and metal reagents.







Abstract
Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site&#8208;specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live&#8208;cell labeling of peptide&#8208;tagged cell&#8208;surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme&#8208;mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled&#8208;coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide&#8208;templated labeling chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Transition Metal Complexes for Medicine: Translational in Situ Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Drugs from Bench to in Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control and select: Novel metal&#8208;based drugs for treating diverse diseases have recently been under the spotlight. Fine control of off&#8208;targeted toxic effects was achieved by using a variety of stabilized coordination ligands along with different metal centers. Herein, we highlight the versatile, effective and valuable use of transition metals in medicine, namely for in&#8197;situ activation of metal&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs has been hampered, among other reasons, by their lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In a recent article, Zou and co&#8208;workers presented the successful intracellular activation of organogold(I) complexes for potential cancer treatment through Pd(II)&#8208;mediated transmetallation, overcoming some off&#8208;target activity of novel gold&#8208;based drugs. This unique strategy builds the perfect bridge between metallodrug usage and bioorthogonal intracellular catalysis for more advanced and selective therapies. Such an approach will hopefully pave the way for forthcoming studies in medicinal inorganic chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Control of Gelatin Hydrogel Stiffness by Using DNA Crosslinkers**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going soft: We report a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel crosslinked with DNA. The stiffness of the gel can be switched by a factor of &#8764;2, over two cycles, by using displacement strands, with no degradation of gel performance. Using two DNA sequences allows orthogonal control of gel stiffness and ligand presentation.







Abstract
Biomaterials with dynamically tunable properties are critical for a range of applications in regenerative medicine and basic biology. In this work, we show the reversible control of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel stiffness through the use of DNA crosslinkers. We replaced some of the inter&#8208;GelMA crosslinks with double&#8208;stranded DNA, allowing for their removal through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. The crosslinks could be restored by adding fresh dsDNA with complementary handles to those on the hydrogel. The elastic modulus (G&#8217;) of the hydrogels could be tuned between 500 and 1000&#8197;Pa, reversibly, over two cycles without degradation of performance. By functionalizing the gels with a second DNA strand, it was possible to control the crosslink density and a model ligand in an orthogonal fashion with two different displacement strands. Our results demonstrate the potential for DNA to reversibly control both stiffness and ligand presentation in a protein&#8208;based hydrogel, and will be useful for teasing apart the spatiotemporal behavior of encapsulated cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution DNA Dual&#8208;Rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branch line: Precise DNA rulers were developed to investigate the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. Based on super&#8208;resolution force spectroscopy, they revealed nucleic acid motion with subnucleotide resolution. New intermediate states were identified, one of which differed from the conventional state by less than a single nucleotide. Our work contributes towards understanding branching among different reading frames during protein synthesis.







Abstract
Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis that involves mRNA translocation of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with subnucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with current techniques. We report a method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA7G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8722;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near&#8208;&#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; intermediate the Post(&#8722;1*) state because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Action and Peptide&#8208;Membrane Interactions of Aib&#8208;Rich Peptides: Multitechnique Experimental and Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sit up or lie down: Linear dichroism, circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore how mimics of peptaibol antibiotics (Aib foldamers) interact with membranes. These studies revealed all peptides partitioned well into the bilayers, with orientation dependent upon peptide length, as well as chiral interactions between peptides and the phospholipids.







Abstract
The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered by their mechanism of action not being clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, linear dichroism, Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, the Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All the peptides studied quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes, and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.

         <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where is thy sting? Wasp venom&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;helical peptides and analogues were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The analogues were less toxic to cells and could accumulate inside cancer cells. Protonectin&#8208;F kills cancer cells and bacteria whereas neuroVAL is a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide.







Abstract
Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp Parachartergus fraternus that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F, were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined by using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.

         <title>The Antimicrobial Peptide Gad&#8208;1 Clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms under Cystic Fibrosis Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a metal&#8208;mediated mode of action, the metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gad&#8208;1 can effectively clear P. aeruginosa biofilms. In the presence of Cu2+ ions, Gad&#8208;1 rapidly cleaves the exogenous DNA that allows biofilms to thrive. Anti&#8208;biofilm activity was observed at a range of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of exogenous DNA, conditions relevant to cystic fibrosis.







Abstract
Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are an emerging health issue and lead to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates a thick mucus in the lungs that is prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin&#8208;1 (Gad&#8208;1) eradicates established P. aeruginosa biofilms through a combination of modes of action that includes nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad&#8208;1 exhibits synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, thus making Gad&#8208;1 a new lead compound for the potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.

         <title>Cleavage of an RNA Model Compound by an Arylmercury Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble, but not so speedy: The potential of an water&#8208;soluble arylmercury compound to cleave RNA has been explored. The somewhat low catalytic activity compared to free HgII was attributed to the relatively low affinity of the arylmercury catalyst for the RNA model compound. This suggests that improved derivatives could be obtained by covalent tethering to an appropriate targeting group.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble arylmercury complex has been synthesized, and its ability to catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage of the RNA model compound adenylyl&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyleneadenosine) has been assessed over a pH range of 3&#8211;8.5 and a catalyst concentration range of 0&#8211;7&#8197;mM. In the presence of 1&#8197;mM catalyst, the observed pH&#8211;rate profile featured a new pH&#8208;independent region between pH&#8197;6 and 7, the catalyzed reaction being as much as eight times faster than the background reaction. At pH&#8197;7, the acceleration increased linearly from three&#8208; to 17&#8208;fold upon increasing the catalyst concentration from 1 to 7&#8197;mM. The linear dependence indicates a relatively low affinity of the catalyst for the substrate and, hence, the potential for considerable improvement on tethering to an appropriate targeting group, such as an oligonucleotide.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of the Interaction of pICln, RioK1 and COPR5 with the PRMT5&#8208;MEP50 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The PRMT5&#8208;MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein&#8208;protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins which recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5 we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identified the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Driven by Base Stacking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open and shut case: A new system of DNA supramolecular polymerization driven by DNA base stacking together with a sequence symmetry design strategy is demonstrated. In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self&#8208;healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Stable Hairpin Structures Formed by Xylose&#8208;Based Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ladder: Thermal and spectroscopic analyses of xylose (XyNA) and deoxyxylose nucleic acids (dXyNA) indicate the formation of stable hairpin structures. The solution structure of a fully modified dXyNA hairpin indicates the structural preference for a ladder&#8208;like stem with a noncanonical loop.







Abstract
Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo&#8208; and deoxyxylo&#8208;nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3&#8217; epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered to be potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analyses show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem into a stable ladder&#8208;like duplex with marginal right&#8208;handed helicity. The reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures described so far.

         <title>Approaches to Evaluate the Impact of a Small Molecule Binder to a Non&#8208;catalytic Site of the Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteasome activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. In recent years, small molecules have been discovered that can affect the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Rather than targeting the active sites of the proteasome, it may be possible to affect ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of proteins by limiting the association of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) with the 20S core particle (20S CP) of the proteasome. We recently described the discovery of TXS&#8208;8, a peptoid that binds to Rpn&#8208;6. Rpn&#8208;6 is a proteasome associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Here we describe methods used to evaluate the impact of TXS&#8208;8 on proteasome activity through a variety of cell&#8208;based assays.&#160; Although our results suggest TXS&#8208;8 does not affect the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome, we have developed a sequence of assays that could be used to evaluate future small molecule binders to 19S RP or 20S CP subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of neuron&#8208;selective fluorescent probe, NeuA, to identify mouse retinal degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe &#8211; NeuA &#8211; for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined  in vitro  ,  ex vivo  and  in vivo  using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Manufacture of multi&#8208;layered artificial cell membranes through sequential bilayer deposition on emulsion templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes are multi&#8208;lamellar, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes. Due to a lack of technologies available for their construction, multi&#8208;layered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell&#8208;mimetic motifs used in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. To address this, we develop emulsion&#8208;based technologies that allow cell&#8208;sized multi&#8208;layered vesicles to be produced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, with compositional control over each layer, enabling studies that otherwise remain inaccessible. We discover that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter&#8208;bilayer registration between coexisting liquid&#8208;liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multi&#8208;layered membrane structure, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand&#8208;Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bigger cage, bigger effect: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo by using guest&#8208;molecule&#8208;modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5&#8242; terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.







Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)&#8208;induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.

Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNA Thresholder Controlled by Concentrations of miRNA Cancer Marker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On a high: We have developed a deoxyribozyme&#8208;based thresholder (DTh) that distinguishes the high levels of miR markers found in cancer cells from the low levels found in healthy cells and cleaves another, vital RNA. The DTh constructs showed the expected response to different concentrations of a neuroblastoma marker, exhibiting efficient cleavage of long RNA molecules with high selectivity.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents suppress specific mRNAs in cells and thus reduce the expression of targeted genes. The ability to unambiguously distinguish cancer from healthy cells can solve the low selectivity problem of OGT agents. Cancer RNA markers are expressed in both healthy and cancer cells with a higher expression level in cancer cells. We have designed a DNA&#8208;based construct, named DNA thresholder (DTh) that cleaves targeted RNA only at high concentrations of cancer marker RNA and demonstrates low cleavage activity at low marker concentrations. The RNA&#8208;cleaving activity can be adjusted within one order of magnitude of the cancer marker RNA concentration by simply redesigning DTh. Importantly, DTh recognizes cancer marker RNA, while cleaving targeted RNA; this offers a possibility to suppress vital genes exclusively in cancer cells, thus triggering their death. DTh is a prototype of computation&#8208;inspired molecular device for controlling gene expression and cancer treatment.

         <title>Tagged Benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones as Novel Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;step synthesis, 2&#8208;step labeling: Alkyne&#8208;conjugated benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones are easily accessible in a 1&#8208;step synthesis from substituted anthranilic acid derivatives. They make novel activity&#8208;based probes that covalently react with serine proteases and allow read&#8208;out by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne&#8208;substituted benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne&#8208;tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be used in two&#8208;step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre&#8208;functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.

         <title>SP3&#8208;FAIMS Chemoproteomics for High&#8208;Coverage Profiling of the Human Cysteinome**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile verification: A new cysteine chemoproteomic method enables rapid and high&#8208;coverage analysis of the human cysteinome. By combining enhanced cysteine biotinylation with SP3 sample decontamination and FAIMS on&#8208;line fraction, we identified in aggregate 34225 unique cysteines found on 7243 proteins. Integration with the isoTOP&#8208;ABPP workflow enabled the high&#8208;throughput discovery of cysteines labeled by electrophilic compounds.







Abstract
Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome&#8208;wide discovery of functional, redox&#8208;sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample&#8208;preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample&#8208;preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single&#8208;pot, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;enhanced sample&#8208;preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, even from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with on&#8208;line high&#8208;field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labeled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of &gt;14000 unique cysteines in a single&#8208;shot 70&#8197;min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small&#8208;molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis&#8211;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP). In aggregate, our analysis of 18 samples from seven cell lines identified 34225 unique cysteines using only &#8764;28&#8197;h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.

         <title>Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenases from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter brockii as Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) represent an important type of enzymes that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus ( Te SADH) and from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ( Tb SADH) are well&#8208;known as robust catalysts. However, and like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This review discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune enantioselectivity of Te SADH and Tb SADH using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, Te SADH has been used in quantitative non&#8208;stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to accomplish deracemization of alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized biocatalytic synthesis of 2&#8208;Seleno pyrimidine nucleosides via transglycosylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The wide&#8208;spread application of 2&#8208;seleno pyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Here, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60&#160;or 80&#160;&#176;C and at pH 9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10 and therefore differ by an order of magnitude compared to equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, which complicates their synthesis significantly. A ten&#8208;fold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40% isolated yield which compares favorably to established chemical routes.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.

         <title>An Artificial Cofactor Catalyzing the Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction with Designed Streptavidin as Protein Host**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A story in pictures: An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst was embedded in streptavidin to catalyze the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction. The following protein design process was described by solved crystal structures for every design step, and the outcome of the chemical reaction was represented by using DFT calculations and MD simulations.







Abstract
An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst embedded in a protein has been used to conduct the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction in a buffered system. As protein host, we chose streptavidin, as it can be easily crystallized and thereby supports the design process. The protein host around the cofactor was rationally designed on the basis of high&#8208;resolution crystal structures obtained after each variation of the amino acid sequence. Additionally, DFT&#8208;calculated intermediates and transition states were used to rationalize the observed activity. Finally, repeated cycles of structure determination and redesign led to a system with an up to one order of magnitude increase in activity over the bare cofactor and to the most active proteinogenic catalyst for the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction known today.

         <title>Organomercury Nucleic Acids: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organomercury renaissance: Research on the synthesis and applications of organomercury nucleic acids and their constituents is reviewed, with a focus on recent developments, such as efforts to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes through HgII&#8208;mediated base pairing of covalently mercurated base moieties.







Abstract
Synthetic efforts towards nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides and nucleic acids covalently mercurated at one or more of their base moieties are summarized, followed by a discussion of the proposed, realized and abandoned applications of this unique class of compounds. Special emphasis is given to fields in which active research is ongoing, notably the use of HgII&#8208;mediated base pairing to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes. Finally, this minireview attempts to anticipate potential future applications of organomercury nucleic acids.

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Screen against a Regulator of G Protein Signaling Identifies a Binding &#8220;Hot Spot&#8221;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altered expression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in G&#8197;protein signaling, eventually altering the transcription of cancer&#8208;promoting proteins. Therefore, inhibiting RGS17 has potential as an anticancer therapy. We used an NMR FBLD approach to identify fragments capable of binding RGS17. Chemical&#8208;shift mapping of the 15N/1H HSQC spectra of 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH identified a previously unknown putative fragment binding site on RGS17.







Abstract
Regulator of G&#8197;protein signaling (RGS) proteins have attracted attention as a result of their primary role in directing the specificity as well as the temporal and spatial aspects of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor signaling. In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. In this area, RGS17 is of particular interest. It has been demonstrated that, while RGS17 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it has been found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G&#8197;protein signaling and an overproduction of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types. Suppressing RGS17 expression with RNA interference (RNAi) has been found to decrease tumorigenesis and sufficiently prevents cancer cell migration, leading to the hypothesis that pharmacological blocking of RGS17 function could be useful in anticancer therapies. We have identified small&#8208;molecule fragments capable of binding the RGS homology (RH) domain of RGS17 by using a nuclear magnetic resonance fragment&#8208;based screening approach. By chemical shift mapping of the two&#8208;dimensional 15N,1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the backbone&#8208;assigned 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH, we determined the fragment binding sites to be distant from the G&#945; interface. Thus, our study identifies a putative fragment binding site on RGS17 that was previously unknown.

         <title>Exchange of proteins in liposomes through streptolysin O pores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. One of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. To this end, we used streptolysin O (SLO), a toxic protein that forms pores in lipid membranes made of phospholipids with cholesterol, that can be closed by the addition of calcium ion. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98 kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in ~8% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;targeted metallodrugs: an untapped source of artificial gene editing technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or non&#8208;covalent binding modes. Several recognition modes&#8212;including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation&#8212;are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8208;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8208;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.</dc:description>

Step by step: A dehydrogenase KanQ oxidizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;OH of kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxykanaymycin C or paromamine before introduction of C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2, thus suggesting that the kanosamine moiety with C&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;NH2 is strictly recognized by KanQ. Furthermore, oxygenase KanJ recognizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2 of the pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide for deamination of C&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;NH2; this suggests that these modifications mainly occur in a stepwise manner.







Abstract
Kanamycin&#8197;A is the major 2&#8208;deoxystreptamine (2DOS)&#8208;containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose (6ADG) at O&#8208;4 and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose at O&#8208;6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C&#8208;2 and introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase, KanQ, and an aminotransferase, KanB, are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than the 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino derivative. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of an oxygenase, KanJ, that is responsible for deamination at C&#8208;2 of the GlcN moiety was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 is important for substrate recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C&#8208;2 by KanJ.

         <title>Discovery of an Allosteric Ligand Binding Site in SMYD3 Lysine Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of an allosteric ligand binding site in SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase (@BioChemInf, @HelenaDanielson, @UUBiochem, @UU&#8194;University)From a distance: SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase is an epigenetic enzyme with multiple cellular functions and the ability to recognize broad range of substrates from histones to cytosolic proteins. An SPR biosensors&#8208;based biophysical strategy for screening SMYD3 ligands was developed and revealed an allosteric binding site. Subsequent crystallographic studies provided a structural description of the novel binding site of SMYD3.







Abstract
SMYD3 is a multifunctional epigenetic enzyme with lysine methyltransferase activity and various interaction partners. It is implicated in the pathophysiology of cancers but with an unclear mechanism. To discover tool compounds for clarifying its biochemistry and potential as a therapeutic target, a set of drug&#8208;like compounds was screened in a biosensor&#8208;based competition assay. Diperodon was identified as an allosteric ligand; its R and S enantiomers were isolated, and their affinities to SMYD3 were determined (KD=42 and 84&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that both enantiomers bind to a previously unidentified allosteric site in the C&#8208;terminal protein binding domain, consistent with its weak inhibitory effect. No competition between diperodon and HSP90 (a known SMYD3 interaction partner) was observed although SMYD3&#8211;HSP90 binding was confirmed (KD=13&#8197;&#956;M). Diperodon clearly represents a novel starting point for the design of tool compounds interacting with a druggable allosteric site, suitable for the exploration of noncatalytic SMYD3 functions and therapeutics with new mechanisms of action.

         <title>Luminescent Amphiphilic Aminoglycoside Probes to Study Transfection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfection tracker: Conjugates of luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties linked to the aminoglycoside tobramycin are reported. These compounds reveal an emission &#8220;on&#8221; behavior upon plasmid&#8208;DNA binding and are able to transfect different mammalian cell lines. The cellular uptake was investigated using the emission properties of the formed plasmid DNA&#8208;vector assemblies.







Abstract
We report the characterization of amphiphilic aminoglycoside conjugates containing luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties as transfection reagents. These inherently luminescent transfection vectors are capable of binding plasmid DNA through electrostatic interactions; this binding results in an emission &#8220;on&#8221; signal due to restriction of intramolecular motion of the luminophore core. The luminescent cationic amphiphiles effectively transferred plasmid DNA into mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293T), as proven by expression of a red fluorescent protein marker. The morphologies of the aggregates were investigated by microscopy as well as &#950;&#8208;potential and dynamic light&#8208;scattering measurements. The transfection efficiencies using luminescent cationic amphiphiles were similar to that of the gold&#8208;standard transfection reagent Lipofectamine&#174; 2000.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite&#8217;s biology is pivotal to decipher unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensures the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite&#160;  Plasmodium falciparum  . We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance the research of this parasite in the future. We anticipate the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of&#160;  P. falciparum  &#160;and we hope researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge &#8211;&#160;with the aim of ending this devastating disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties Determine Solubility and Stability in &#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins of the Eye Lens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clear as crystallin? &#946;&#947;&#8208;crystallins serve as structural and refractive proteins in the vertebrate lens. Mutations in these proteins are associated with cataracts. Herein, we review recent developments toward understanding the biophysical properties and chemical reactivity of monomeric and oligomeric &#946;&#947; crystallins, including a discussion of the common techniques used to study crystallin structure and stability.







Abstract
&#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins are the primary structural and refractive proteins found in the vertebrate eye lens. Because crystallins are not replaced after early eye development, their solubility and stability must be maintained for a lifetime, which is even more remarkable given the high protein concentration in the lens. Aggregation of crystallins caused by mutations or post&#8208;translational modifications can reduce crystallin protein stability and alter intermolecular interactions. Common post&#8208;translational modifications that can cause age&#8208;related cataracts include deamidation, oxidation, and tryptophan derivatization. Metal ion binding can also trigger reduced crystallin solubility through a variety of mechanisms. Interprotein interactions are critical to maintaining lens transparency: crystallins can undergo domain swapping, disulfide bonding, and liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, all of which can cause opacity depending on the context. Important experimental techniques for assessing crystallin conformation in the absence of a high&#8208;resolution structure include dye&#8208;binding assays, circular dichroism, fluorescence, light scattering, and transition metal FRET.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling of Bile Salt Hydrolysis in the Human Gut Microbiome with Beta&#8208;Lactam or Acrylamide&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than a gut feeling: The salts in bile, which aids digestion, can be modified by gut microbes. Bile salts act as signaling molecules, so structural modifications can impact host physiology. The microbial &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; for bile salt modification is bile salt hydrolase (BSH). To uncover the molecular links between BSH and host health, novel activity&#8208;based probes for BSH were developed.







Abstract
Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Therefore, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases by using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.

         <title>Synthetic Phenolic Glycolipids for Application in Diagnostic Tests for Leprosy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting to the point of care: Trisaccharides of phenolic glycolipids (PGL) originating from M. leprae were evaluated for their diagnostic potential as neoglycoproteins in ELISA and an up&#8208;converting particle lateral flow assay (UCP&#8208;LFA). Two naturally occurring trisaccharides were found to be suitable for this purpose and can thus be used for future field studies in leprosy endemic areas.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative pathogen of leprosy, represent efficient tools to guide therapeutic and prophylactic treatment strategies in leprosy control programs, thus positively contributing to clinical outcome and reducing transmission of this infectious disease. Levels of antibodies directed against the M. leprae&#8208;specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL&#8722;I) closely correlate with an individual's bacterial load and a higher risk of developing leprosy. We describe herein the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns. The PGL trisaccharides were applied to construct neoglycoproteins that were used to detect anti&#8208;PGL IgM antibodies in leprosy patients. ELISAs and quantitative lateral&#8208;flow assays based on up&#8208;converting nanoparticles (UCP&#8208;LFAs) showed that the generated PGL&#8722;I and PGL&#8208;II trisaccharide neoglycoconjugates can be applied for the detection of anti M. leprae IgM antibodies in POC tests.

         <title>Comparative Biochemistry of Four Polyester (PET) Hydrolases**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass&#8208;action kinetics for enzymatic PET hydrolysis: Four PET hydrolases have been tested within a kinetic framework for comparing enzymes hydrolysing the insoluble polymer PET. Analysis provided kinetic parameters in units of M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, as well as values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface. This makes Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics possible for plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes.







Abstract
The potential of bioprocessing in a circular plastic economy has strongly stimulated research into the enzymatic degradation of different synthetic polymers. Particular interest has been devoted to the commonly used polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and a number of PET hydrolases have been described. However, a kinetic framework for comparisons of PET hydrolases (or other plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes) acting on the insoluble substrate has not been established. Herein, we propose such a framework, which we have tested against kinetic measurements for four PET hydrolases. The analysis provided values of kcat and KM, as well as an apparent specificity constant in the conventional units of M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. These parameters, together with experimental values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface, enabled comparative analyses. A variant of the PET hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis was the most efficient enzyme at ambient conditions; it relied on a high kcat rather than a low KM. Moreover, both soluble and insoluble PET fragments were consistently hydrolyzed much faster than intact PET. This suggests that interactions between polymer strands slow down PET degradation, whereas the chemical steps of catalysis and the low accessibility associated with solid substrate were less important for the overall rate. Finally, the investigated enzymes showed a remarkable substrate affinity, and reached half the saturation rate on PET when the concentration of attack sites in the suspension was only about 50&#8197;nM. We propose that this is linked to nonspecific adsorption, which promotes the nearness of enzyme and attack sites.

         <title>The Perturbed Free&#8208;Energy Landscape: Linking Ligand Binding to Biomolecular Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New approaches to drug design and systems biology: The link between ligand binding and biomolecular folding can be understood as arising from perturbation of the free energy landscapes (FEL). Traditional visual descriptions of ligand binding mechanisms are reinterpreted in terms of the perturbed FEL. Recent experimental and computational studies characterizing the pFEL for various biomolecular interactions are reviewed.







Abstract
The effects of ligand binding on biomolecular conformation are crucial in drug design, enzyme mechanisms, the regulation of gene expression, and other biological processes. Descriptive models such as &#8220;lock and key&#8221;, &#8220;induced fit&#8221;, and &#8220;conformation selection&#8221; are common ways to interpret such interactions. Another historical model, linked equilibria, proposes that the free&#8208;energy landscape (FEL) is perturbed by the addition of ligand binding energy for the bound population of biomolecules. This principle leads to a unified, quantitative theory of ligand&#8208;induced conformation change, building upon the FEL concept. We call the map of binding free energy over biomolecular conformational space the &#8220;binding affinity landscape&#8221; (BAL). The perturbed FEL predicts/explains ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes conforming to all common descriptive models. We review recent experimental and computational studies that exemplify the perturbed FEL, with emphasis on RNA. This way of understanding ligand&#8208;induced conformation dynamics motivates new experimental and theoretical approaches to ligand design, structural biology and systems biology.

         <dc:description>
RNA under the spotlight: Chemical reactions used to probe RNA structure combined with deep sequencing helps us towards obtaining a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be used to control RNA biology. This review looks at how advances in chemical methods merged with transcriptome&#8208;wide RNA probing could extend our understanding of RNA structure and function in normal cells and disease.







Abstract
RNA molecules can fold into complex two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are critical for their function. Chemical probes have long been utilized to interrogate RNA structure and are now considered invaluable resources in the goal of relating structure to function. Recently, the power of deep sequencing and careful chemical probe design have merged, permitting researchers to obtain a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be utilized to control RNA biology transcriptome&#8208;wide. Within this review, we outline the recent advancements in chemical probe design for interrogating RNA structures inside cells and discuss the recent advances in our understanding of RNA biology through the lens of chemical probing.

         <title>Intrinsic Fluorescence of the Active and the Inactive Functional Forms of Human Thymidylate Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The observables associated with protein intrinsic fluorescence &#8208; spectra, time decays, anisotropies &#8208; offer opportunities to monitor in real time and non&#8208;invasively a protein functional form and its interchange with other forms with different functions. We employ these observables to sketch the fluorometric profiles of two functional forms of human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a homodimeric enzyme crucial for cell proliferation and thus targeted by anticancer drugs. The protein takes an active and an inactive forms. Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate&#160;the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylphosphonate&#8208;tethered porphyrins: Fluorescence silencing speaks a metal language in living enterocytes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the application of a highly versatile and engineerable novel sensor platform to monitor biologically significant and toxic metal ions in live human Caco&#8208;2 enterocytes. The extended conjugation between the fluorescent porphyrin core and metal ions via aromatic phenylphosphonic acid tethers generates a unique turn off and turn on fluorescence and, in addition, shifts in absorption and emission spectra for zinc, cobalt, cadmium and mercury. The reported fluorescent probes p&#8208;H 8 TPPA and m&#8208;H 8 TPPA can monitor a wide range of metal ion concentrations via fluorescence titration and also via fluorescence decay curves. Cu and Zn&#8208;induced turn off fluorescence can be differentially reversed by the addition of common chelators. Both p&#8208;H 8 TPPA and m&#8208;H 8 TPPA readily pass the mammalian cellular membrane due to their amphipathic character as confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging of living enterocytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Probes for Photoaffinity Labeling of Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for photoaffinity labeling of kinases represent important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several application areas of these probes, which include identification of targets and off&#8208;targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, development of inhibitor screening assays, imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.</dc:description>

         <title>The Molecular T&#234;te&#8208;&#224;&#8208;T&#234;te between G&#8208;Quadruplexes and the i&#8208;motif in the Human Genome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review provides the requisites and implications of mutually exclusive or simultaneous formation of G&#8208;Quadruplex and i&#8208;motif structures in human genome. The comprehensive discussion on the spatiotemporal formation of G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif structures gives the insight on their integrated effect in gene&#8208;regulatory functions and cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
G&#8208;Quadruplex (GQ) and i&#8208;motif structures are the paradigmatic examples of nonclassical tetrastranded nucleic acids having multifarious biological functions and widespread applications in therapeutics and material science. Recently, tetraplexes emerged as promising anticancer targets due to their structural robustness, gene&#8208;regulatory roles, and predominant distribution at specific loci of oncogenes. However, it is arguable whether the i&#8208;motif evolves in the complementary single&#8208;stranded region after GQ formation in its opposite strand and vice versa. In this review, we address the prerequisites and significance of the simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive formation of GQ and i&#8208;motif structures at complementary and sequential positions in duplexes in the cellular milieu. We discussed how their dynamic interplay Sets up cellular homeostasis and exacerbates carcinogenesis. The review gives insights into the spatiotemporal formation of GQ and i&#8208;motifs that could be harnessed to design different types of reporter systems and diagnostic platforms for potential bioanalytical and therapeutic intervention.

         <title>N3&#8208;Kethoxal&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Intracellular RNA Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small, membrane&#8208;permeable probe N3&#8208;kethoxal has low toxicity and highly selectivity for reaction with guanine allowing it to introduce azido groups into RNA within a cellular environment. This N3K&#8208;assisted bioorthogonal intracellular RNA strategy provides a great prospect for in&#8197;vivo RNA labeling to develop various RNA tools for RNA functional research.







Abstract
There is growing interest in developing intracellular RNA tools. Herein, we describe a strategy for N3&#8208;kethoxal (N3K)&#8208;based bioorthogonal intracellular RNA functionalization. With N3K labeling followed by an in&#8197;vivo click reaction with DBCO derivatives, RNA can be modified with fluorescent or phenol groups. This strategy provides a new way of labeling RNA inside cells.

         <title>Ligand Induced CuII Transport Restricts Cancer and Mycobacterial Growth: Towards a Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Select Ion Channel Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hole in more than one: A peptide scaffold with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII across simple and complex lipid membranes. The peptide forms stables pores in the membranes and transports ions by an antiport mechanism. Such peptides could facilitate Cu transport across mycobacterial or cancer cell membranes as an effective anti&#8208;infective strategy or to induce cell death.







Abstract
Synthetic channels with high ion selectivity are attractive drug targets for diseases involving ion dysregulation. Achieving selective transport of divalent ions is highly challenging due their high hydration energies. A small tripeptide amphiphilic scaffold installed with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII ions across membranes. The peptide forms stable dimeric pores in the membrane and transports ions by a Cu2+/H+ antiport mechanism. The ligand&#8208;induced excellent CuII selectivity as well as high membrane permeability of the peptide is exploited to promote cancer cell death. The peptide's ability to restrict mycobacterial growth serves as seeds to evolve antibacterial strategies centred on selectively modulating ion homeostasis in pathogens. This simple peptide can potentially function as a universal, yet versatile, scaffold wherein the ion selectivity can be precisely controlled by modifying the ligand at the C terminus.

         <title>Peptide Vectors Carry Pyrene to Cell Organelles Allowing Real&#8208;Time Quantification of Free Radicals in Mitochondria by Time&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On and off ROS formation detected. Two pyrene butyric acid isomers, and their respective derivatives produced by grafting them onto a peptide vector, demonstrated outstanding real&#8208;time quantification of intracellular and mitochondrial free radicals and oxygen. The four fluorescent probes work well inside living cells for detection by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time quantification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (ROS) in cells is of paramount importance as they are essential for cellular functions. Their excessive formation contributes to the dysfunction of cells and organisms, ultimately leading to cell death. As ROS are mostly produced in the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time&#8208;resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non&#8208;radical species such as H2O2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On and off ROS formation detected&lt;/b&gt;. Two pyrene butyric acid isomers, and their respective derivatives produced by grafting them onto a peptide vector, demonstrated outstanding real&#8208;time quantification of intracellular and mitochondrial free radicals and oxygen. The four fluorescent probes work well inside living cells for detection by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real&#8208;time quantification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (ROS) in cells is of paramount importance as they are essential for cellular functions. Their excessive formation contributes to the dysfunction of cells and organisms, ultimately leading to cell death. As ROS are mostly produced in the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time&#8208;resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non&#8208;radical species such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Alkylating Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamides for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be specific! We review the recent research on DNA&#8208;alkylating pyrrole&#8208;imidazole (PI) polyamides that show sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activity. Their application to targeting cancer&#8208;related sequences, such as human telomere repeat sequences, KRAS mutated sequences and RUNX binding sequences, are described to show the possibility of these conjugates as chemotherapeutic drugs.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole (PI) polyamides, which target specific DNA sequences, have been studied as a class of DNA minor&#8208;groove&#8208;binding molecules. To investigate the potential of compounds for cancer treatment, PI polyamides were conjugated with DNA&#8208;alkylating agents, such as seco&#8208;CBI and chlorambucil. DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides have attracted attention because of their sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activities, which contribute to reducing the severe side effects of current DNA&#8208;damaging drugs. Many of these types of conjugates have been developed as new candidates for anticancer drugs. Herein, we review recent progress into research on DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides and their sequence&#8208;specific action on targets associated with cancer development.

         <title>Use of Copper as a Trigger for the in Vivo Activity of E. coli Laccase CueO: A Simple Tool for Biosynthetic Purposes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient: The endogenous E. coli laccase CueO was activated by the addition of copper ions to cells, which were subsequently used for oxidative phenolic coupling. As a proof of concept, CueO&#8208;catalyzed dimerization of coniferyl alcohol was integrated into a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade in E. coli to produce the plant lignan (&#8722;)&#8208;matairesinol.







Abstract
Laccases are multi&#8208;copper oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of various electron&#8208;rich substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The multi&#8208;copper oxidase/laccase CueO of Escherichia coli is responsible for the oxidation of Cu+ to the less harmful Cu2+ in the periplasm. CueO has a relatively broad substrate spectrum as laccase, and its activity is enhanced by copper excess. The aim of this study was to trigger CueO activity in&#8197;vivo for the use in biocatalysis. The addition of 5&#8197;mM CuSO4 was proven effective in triggering CueO activity at need with minor toxic effects on E. coli cells. Cu&#8208;treated E. coli cells were able to convert several phenolic compounds to the corresponding dimers. Finally, the endogenous CueO activity was applied to a four&#8208;step cascade, in which coniferyl alcohol was converted to the valuable plant lignan (&#8722;)&#8208;matairesinol.

         <title>Efficient Incorporation of Clickable Unnatural Amino Acids Enables Rapid and Biocompatible Labeling of Proteins in Vitro and in Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All about the numbers: We report the evolution of translation machinery for incorporation of an alkyne&#8208;bearing unnatural amino acid (uAA) into proteins, and show that it enables efficient multisite uAA incorporation in recoded and wild&#8208;type bacteria. Using this approach, we demonstrate rapid and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of uAA&#8208;containing elastin&#8208;like polypeptides.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) bearing a bioorthogonal group has enabled the attachment &#8211; typically at a single site or at a few sites per protein &#8211; of chemical groups at precise locations for protein and biomaterial labeling, conjugation, and functionalization. Herein, we report the evolution of chromosomal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the alkyne&#8208;bearing uAA, 4&#8208;propargyloxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pPR), with &#8764;30&#8208;fold increased production of green fluorescent protein containing three instances of pPR compared with a previously described M. jannaschii&#8208;derived aaRS for pPR, when expressed from a single chromosomal copy. We show that when expressed from multicopy plasmids, the evolved aaRSs enable the production &#8211; using a genomically recoded Escherichia coli and the non&#8208;recoded BL21 E. coli strain &#8211; of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) containing multiple pPR residues in high yields. We further show that the multisite incorporation of pPR in ELPs facilitates the rapid, robust, and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of these proteins in bacteria. The evolved variants described in this work can be used to produce a variety of protein and biomaterial conjugates and to create efficient minimal tags for protein labeling.

         <title>Subcellular Localisation of a Quinoline&#8208;Containing Fluorescent Cyclometallated IrIII Complex in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lighting the way: We have explored the subcellular localisation of an antimalarial hybrid quinoline&#8208;triazole cyclometallated iridium(III) complex containing an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore, with a view to gaining insight into a possible mechanism of action of antimalarials exemplified by this structure.







Abstract
A fluorescent analogue of a previously synthesised N,N&#8208;chelated IrIII complex was prepared by coordination of the organic ligand to an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore. This cyclometallated IrIII complex in itself displays good, micromolar activity against the chloroquine&#8208;sensitive NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy found negligible localisation of the fluorescent complex within the digestive vacuole of the parasite. This eliminated the haem detoxification pathway as a potential mechanism of action. Similarly, no localisation of the complex within the parasitic nucleus was found, thus suggesting that this complex probably does not interfere with the DNA replication process. A substantial saturation of fluorescence from the complex was found near phospholipid structures such as the plasma and nuclear membranes but not in neutral lipid bodies. This indicates that an association with these membranes, or organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or branched mitochondrion, could be essential to the efficacies of these types of antimalarial compounds.

         <title>A reconstructed common ancestor of the fatty acid photodecarboxylase clade shows photodecarboxylation activity and increased thermostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520 nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose&#8208;methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photodecarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15 &#176;C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12&#8208;fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type.

A recently discovered fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520 nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose&#8208;methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photodecarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15 &#176;C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12&#8208;fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photodecarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Sortases in Peptide and Protein Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorting out sortases: The bacterial transpeptidase sortase A has entered center stage as a versatile tool for protein bioconjugation and semisynthesis. Sortase A of Staphylococcus is widely used, but suffers from slow kinetics and a narrow specificity profile. Recent protein engineering campaigns aiming to improve these shortcomings have been successful and delivered enhanced sortase mutants with enhanced catalytic properties.







Abstract
The transpeptidase sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa&#8208;SrtA) is a valuable tool in protein chemistry. The native enzyme anchors surface proteins containing a highly conserved LPxTG sorting motif to a terminal glycine residue of the peptidoglycan layer in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This reaction is exploited for sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML), allowing the site&#8208;specific linkage of synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins by a native peptide bond. However, the moderate catalytic efficiency and specificity of Sa&#8208;SrtA fueled the development of new biocatalysts for SML, including the screening of sortase A variants form microorganisms other than S. aureus and the directed protein evolution of the Sa&#8208;SrtA enzyme itself. Novel display platforms and screening formats were developed to isolate sortases with altered properties from mutant libraries. This yielded sortases with strongly enhanced catalytic activity and enzymes recognizing new sorting motifs as substrates. This minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of directed sortase evolution and applications of these tailor&#8208;made enzymes in biochemistry.

         <title>Genomic and Targeted Approaches Unveil the Cell Membrane as a Major Target of the Antifungal Cytotoxin Amantelide A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amantelide A, a polyhydroxylated macrolide isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, displayed broad&#8208;spectrum activity against mammalian cells, bacterial pathogens and marine fungi. We conducted comprehensive mechanistic studies to identify the molecular targets and pathways affected by amantelide A. Our investigations relied on chemical structure similarities with compounds of known mechanisms, yeast knockout mutants, yeast chemogenomic profiling, and direct biochemical and biophysical methods. We established that amantelide A exerts its antifungal action via binding to ergosterol&#8208;containing membranes followed by pore formation and cell death, a mechanism partially shared with polyene antifungals. Binding assays demonstrated that amantelide A also binds to membranes containing epicholesterol or mammalian cholesterol, suggesting that the cytotoxicity to mammalian cells might be due to its affinity to cholesterol&#8208;containing membranes. However, membrane interactions were not completely dependent on sterols. Yeast chemogenomic profiling suggested additional direct or indirect effects on actin. Actin polymerization assays suggested that amantelide A also promotes actin polymerization in cell&#8208;free systems. However, the C&#8208;33 acetoxy derivative amantelide B showed similar effect on actin dynamics in vitro but no significant activity against yeast. Overall, these studies suggest that the membrane effects are the most functionally relevant interactions for the mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Malic Enzyme Variants Favoring a Non&#8208;natural Redox Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Implementation of nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD), a biocompatible nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) analogue, is of great scientific and biotechnological interest. Several redox enzymes have been devised to favor NCD, and have been successfully applied in creating NCD&#8208;dependent redox systems. However, molecular interactions between cofactor and protein remain to be disclosed to guide further engineering efforts. Here we report the structural analysis of an  Escherichia coli  derived NCD&#8208;favoring malic enzyme (ME) variant. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure data revealed that the residues located at position 346 and 401 in ME acted as the &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; of the adenine moiety binding cavity. When Arg346 was substituted with either acidic or aromatic residues, the corresponding mutants showed substantially reduced NCD preference. Inspired by these observations, we generated  Lactobacillus helveticus  derived D&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase variants at Ile177, the counterpart of Arg346 in ME, and found a similar trend in terms of cofactor preference changes. As many NAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases share key structural features, our results provide guidance for protein engineering to obtain more NCD&#8208;favoring variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Prelabeling Expansion Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy with Minimal Linkage Error</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping it all together: Single&#8208;molecule expansion microscopy can reach a resolution on the molecular scale that is challenged by labeling density and linkage error. We introduce a biotinylizable peptide tag and gel&#8208;linkable fluorescent streptavidin that enable a fixed 5&#8208;nm linkage between a fluorophore and a protein of interest in a cell.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy combined with single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (ExSMLM) has a potential for approaching molecular resolution. However, ExSMLM faces multiple challenges such as loss of fluorophores and proteins during polymerization, digestion or denaturation, and an increase in linkage error arising from the distance between the fluorophore and the target molecule. Here, we introduce a trifunctional streptavidin to link the target, fluorophore and gel matrix via a biotinylizable peptide tag. The resultant ExSMLM images of vimentin filaments demonstrated high labeling efficiency and a minimal linkage error of &#8764;5&#8197;nm. Our ExSMLM provides a simple and practical means for fluorescence imaging with molecular resolution.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Semi&#8208;synthesis Enables Efficient Production of Isotopically Labeled &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Site&#8208;Specific Tyrosine Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies for producing &#945;&#8208;synuclein phosphorylated at Tyr39 (&#945;S&#8208;pY39) are compared, and the value of a chemoenzymatic strategy with one&#8208;pot ligation is demonstrated, in particular for producing 15N&#8208;labeled protein for NMR studies.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) can affect the normal function and pathology of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S), an amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;forming protein linked to Parkinson's disease. Phosphorylation of &#945;S Tyr39 has recently been found to display a dose&#8208;dependent effect on fibril formation kinetics and to alter the morphology of the fibrils. Existing methods to access site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated &#945;S for biochemical studies include total or semi&#8208;synthesis by native chemical ligation (NCL) as well as chemoenzymatic methods to phosphorylate peptides, followed by NCL. Here, we investigated a streamlined method to produce large quantities of phosphorylated &#945;S by co&#8208;expressing a kinase with a protein fragment in Escherichia coli. We also introduced the use of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) to enable one&#8208;pot NCL and desulfurization. We compare our optimized methods to previous reports and show that we can achieve the highest yields of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated protein through chemoenzymatic methods using MTG, and that our strategy is uniquely well suited to producing 15N&#8208;labeled, phosphorylated protein for NMR studies.

Tiny, but targeted: The protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 is targeted by 18 CRaf peptide ligands on the surface of an ultrasmall gold nanoparticle (ca. 115 gold atoms). ITC and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy demonstrate an efficient supramolecular binding between nanoparticle and protein. The easy uptake of nanoparticles by cells opens up the possibility of targeting proteins inside cells.







Abstract
The surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.55&#8197;nm was conjugated with a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;binding peptide derived from CRaf. Each particle carries 18 CRaf peptides, leading to an overall stoichiometry of Au(115)Craf(18). The binding to the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 was probed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy (FP). The dissociation constant (KD) was measured as 5.0&#8197;&#956;M by ITC and 0.9&#8197;&#956;M by FP, which was close to the affinity of dissolved CRaf to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963;. In contrast to dissolved CRaf, which alone did not enter HeLa cells, CRAF&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles were well taken up by HeLa cells, opening the opportunity to target the protein inside a cell.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter&#8208;Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper&#8208;Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going for the triple: Copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from the remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer from Glu113 to an intermediate H2O or from Lys128 to His260.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide; key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron&#8208;/proton&#8208;transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton&#8208;transfer channels, the high&#8208;pH proton channel and the primary proton channel, by using two&#8208;layered ONIOM calculations. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanism. In the high&#8208;pH proton channel, the water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel, the transfer is from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton&#8208;transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase and could extend our understanding of the diverse proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms in complicated proteins.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis of Selenoproteins in High Yield and Purity for Selective Protein Tagging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
34Se&#8208;lective protein tagging: Cell&#8208;free protein synthesis is used to produce selenoproteins in high yield and purity. Selenocysteine has long been recognized as offering an exquisitely reactive chemical handle for chemical modifications of proteins, and we show that the alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenol groups with a chloro&#8208;alkyl group proceeds quickly under conditions that leaves cysteine residues unchanged.







Abstract
The selenol group of selenocysteine is much more nucleophilic than the thiol group of cysteine. Selenocysteine residues in proteins thus offer reactive points for rapid post&#8208;translational modification. Herein, we show that selenoproteins can be expressed in high yield and purity by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis by global substitution of cysteine by selenocysteine. Complete alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenocysteine residues was achieved in 10 minutes with 4&#8208;chloromethylene dipicolinic acid (4Cl&#8208;MDPA) under conditions that left cysteine residues unchanged even after overnight incubation. GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured by double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments of maltose binding protein (MBP) containing two selenocysteine residues tagged with 4Cl&#8208;MDPA&#8208;GdIII were indistinguishable from GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured of MBP containing cysteine reacted with 4Br&#8208;MDPA tags.

         <title>Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed phenoxy radical biotinylation, an increasingly important tool in biotechnology and molecular biology applications, is here shown to label guanosine bases in RNA, but not in DNA, under defined conditions. Remarkably, common fluorescein conjugates of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides are found to undergo facile biotinylation on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence. This convenient observation points to a variety of practical applications of peroxidase&#8208;catalyzed chemistry for analysis of DNA conjugates in vitro and in cells.







Abstract
Recent advances in peroxidase&#8208;mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high&#8208;resolution and subcellular compartment&#8208;specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence&#8208;independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.

         <title>The Peculiar Case of the Hyper&#8208;thermostable Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What? The pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is an outlier among its peers. The enzyme is extremely stable and performs remarkably well in near&#8208;boiling, cosolvent&#8208;heavy media, but an apparent inhibition by nucleobases renders its performance in preparative applications rather subpar.







Abstract
The poor solubility of many nucleosides and nucleobases in aqueous solution demands harsh reaction conditions (base, heat, cosolvent) in nucleoside phosphorylase&#8208;catalyzed processes to facilitate substrate loading beyond the low millimolar range. This, in turn, requires enzymes that can withstand these conditions. Herein, we report that the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is active over an exceptionally broad pH (4&#8211;10), temperature (up to 100&#8201;&#176;C) and cosolvent space (up to 80&#8201;% (v/v) nonaqueous medium), and displays tremendous stability under harsh reaction conditions with predicted total turnover numbers of more than 106 for various pyrimidine nucleosides. However, its use as a biocatalyst for preparative applications is critically limited due to its inhibition by nucleobases at low concentrations, which is unprecedented among nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases.

Structurally diverse chemical probes have been used to label protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation. Herein, we review how CoA analogs could be incorporated by highly promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) and used for in&#8197;situ labeling of the membrane proteins fused with acceptor tags. These cell&#8208;permeable pantetheine analogs facilitated the metabolic labeling of the endogenous substrates in both bacterial and mammalian cells.







Abstract
Nature uses a diverse array of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) to regulate protein structure, activity, localization, and function. Among them, protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation derived from coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential PTM for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To explore its functions, various chemical probes mimicking the natural structure of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation have been developed. In this minireview, we summarize these chemical probes and describe their applications in direct and metabolic labeling of proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells.

         <title>Efficient Assay for the Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide by Estimating Enzyme Promiscuous Activity in the Perhydrolysis Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For availability and atom economy, hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant. Due to its diverse roles, the lack of a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed an efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide based on enzyme promiscuity with p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters as substrates.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in view of its availability, atom economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling physiological processes, but its unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to preventing the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide with the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the formation of peracid. To our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting hydrogen peroxide in aqueous media.

         <title>Targeting TRIM Proteins: A quest towards drugging an emerging protein class</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitination machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signalling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named Tri&#8208;Partite Motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein&#8208;protein interactions, whose multi&#8208;domains and adapter&#8208;like nature make their druggability very challenging. Here we report an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.</dc:description>

         <title>NOVEL PET&#8208;DEGRADING ENZYMES: STRUCTURE&#8208;FUNCTION FROM A COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bacterium strain  Ideonella sakaiensis  201&#8208;F6 is able to hydrolyze low&#8208;crystallinity PET films a 30&#176;C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to the elucidation of the structure and features of those two enzymes and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure, in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts with the purpose to make it more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, strategies adopted by different research groups to deeply investigate the structure and the functionality on both PETase and MHETase are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by  Ideonella sakaiensis  enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging to prioritize the efforts in this prolific research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Isopenicillin N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron oxidase (NHIO) which catalyses cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(  l  &#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;  l  &#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;  d  &#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin N (IPN). Over the last 25 years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of iron at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme&#8208;substrate complex IPNS&#8208;Fe&#8208;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co&#8208;substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover  in crystallo  . In this way, X&#8208;ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution&#8208;phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have in turn informed computational experiments which have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
