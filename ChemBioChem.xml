         <title>Colorimetric High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Prazole Sulfide Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric high&#8208;throughput screening method for the rapid screening of desired variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity was developed based on distinguishing sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones. Using this method, a CbBVMO variant was identified with improved activity and thermostability, and a 71.3&#8201;% increase in catalyzing the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are important biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of chiral sulfoxides, including chiral sulfoxide&#8208;type proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, native BVMOs are not yet suitable for practical application due to their unsatisfactory activity and thermostability. Although protein engineering approaches can help address these issues, few feasible high&#8208;throughput methods are available for the engineering of such enzymes. Herein, a colorimetric detection method to distinguish sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones was developed for prazole sulfide monooxygenases. Directed evolution enabled by this method has identified a prazole sulfide monooxygenase CbBVMO variant with improved activity and thermostability that catalyzes the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide. A 71.3&#8201;% increase in conversion and 6&#8201;&#176;C enhancement in the melting point were achieved compared with the wild&#8208;type enzyme. This new method is feasible for high&#8208;throughput screening of prazole sulfide monooxygenase variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity.

         <title>Regulating Spatial Localization and Reactivity Biasness of DNAzymes by Metal Ions and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical gradient sensing behavior of catalytically active colloids and enzymes is an area of immense interest owing to their importance in understanding fundamental spatiotemporal complexity pattern in living systems and designing of dynamic materials. Herein, we have shown peroxidase activity of DNAzyme (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;hemin complex tagged in a micron&#8208;sized glass bead) can be modulated by metal ions and metal ion&#8208;binding oligonucleotides. Next we demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that the localization and product formation ability of the DNAzyme containing particle remains biased to the more catalytically active zone where concentration of metal ion (Hg2+) inhibitor is low. Interestingly, this biased localization can be broken by introduction of Hg2+ binding oligonucleotide in the system. Additionally, macroscopically asymmetric catalytic product distributed zone has also been achieved on this process, showing possibility in regulation in autonomous spatially controlled chemical process. This demonstration of autonomous modulation of the localization pattern and spatially specific enhanced product forming ability of DNAzymes will further enable in designing of responsive nucleic acid&#8208;based motile materials and surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivalent &#947;&#8208;PGA&#8208;Exendin&#8208;4 conjugates to target pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting of glucagon&#8208;like peptide 1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R), expressed on the surface of pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells, is of great interest for the development of advanced therapies for diabetes and diagnostics for insulinoma. We report the conjugation of exendin&#8208;4 (Ex&#8208;4), an approved drug to treat type 2 diabetes, to poly&#8208;&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid (&#947;&#8208;PGA) to obtain more stable and effective GLP&#8208;1R ligands. Exendin&#8208;4 modified at Lysine&#8208;27 with PEG4&#8208;maleimide was conjugated to &#947;&#8208;PGA functionalized with furan, in different molar ratios, exploiting a chemoselective Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition. The &#947;&#8208;PGA presenting the highest number of conjugated Ex&#8208;4 molecules (average 120 per polymeric chain) showed a double affinity towards GLP&#8208;1R with respect to exendin per se, opening the way to improved therapeutic and diagnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Functionalized with Fucoidan: a Potential Theranostic Nanotool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fucoidan is a natural sulfated polysaccharide with a large range of biological activities including anticancer and anti&#8208;oxidation activities. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fourth most common aggressive cancer type. The aim of this study was to investigate the bioactivity of free fucoidan versus its vectorization using nanoparticles (NPs) in human hepatoma cells, Huh&#8208;7. Iron oxide NPs were functionalized with fucoidan by a one&#8208;step surface complexation. NP cellular uptake was quantified by magnetic measurement at various extracellular iron concentrations. Cell invasion and migration were reduced with NPs while free fucoidan increases these events at low fucoidan concentration (&#8804; 0.5 mM). Concomitantly, a high decrease of reactive oxygen species production related with a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 activity and an increase of its expression was observed with NPs compared to free fucoidan. A proteomic analysis evidenced that some fucoidan regulated proteins appeared related to protein synthesis, N&#8208;glycan processing, and cellular stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study which reveals such activity induced by fucoidan. These results pave the way for USPIO&#8208;fucoidan&#8208;NPs as potential theranostic nanotool for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment</dc:description>

         <title>Annonaceous Acetogenin Mimic AA005 Inhibits the Growth of TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 Cells by Altering Cell Energy Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annonaceous acetogenins mimic AA005, disrupts both oxidative respiration and aerobic glycolysis in the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468, thus driving the cell energy crisis and exhibiting antitumor activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a serious health issue for women worldwide and there is still no suitable treatment option. AA005, a structurally simplified mimic of natural Annonaceous acetogenins, presents outstanding properties with impressive cytotoxicity and cell&#8208;type selective actions. The present study was aimed at evaluating the potential of AA005 as a therapeutic agent for TNBC. AA005 potently inhibited the growth of TNBC cells at 50&#8197;nM level. Inspired by the finding of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumor suppressor, the effect of AA005 on aerobic glycolysis was investigated in TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells. A short&#8208;term AA005 exposure markedly suppressed mitochondrial function in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells, thus activating the aerobic glycolysis to lessen the risk of decreased ATP generation in mitochondria. Prolonging the incubation time of AA005 clearly weakened the aerobic glycolysis in the cells. This was in part attributed to the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway inactivation and subsequent declined glucose uptake. As a consequence, the energy supply was completely cut from the two major energy&#8208;producing pathways. Further experiments showed that AA005 resulted in irreversible damage on cell activity including cell cycle and growth, inducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and ultimately leading to cell death. In addition, the in&#8197;vivo therapeutic efficacy of AA005 was proved on 4T1 xenograft tumor mice model. Our data demonstrate that AA005 exhibited a great potential for future clinical applications in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Boosted Productivity in Single&#8208;Tile&#8208;Based DNA Polyhedra Assembly by Simple Cation Replacement</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet efficient strategy for avoiding the concentration&#8208;dependent kinetic trap in DNA self&#8208;assembly is proposed. Through substituting monovalent Na+ for conventional divalent Mg2+, we have successfully achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the concentration reported previously.







Abstract
Cations such as divalent magnesium ion (Mg2+) play an essential role in DNA self&#8208;assembly. However, the strong electrostatic shielding effect of Mg2+ would be disadvantageous in some situations that require relatively weak interactions to allow a highly reversible error&#8208;correcting mechanism in the process of assembly. Herein, by substituting the conventional divalent Mg2+ with monovalent sodium ion (Na+), we have achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the DNA concentrations reported previously. This strategy takes advantage of coexisting counterions and is expected to surmount the major obstacle to potential applications of such DNA nanostructures: large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Evaluation of Gene Expression Knock&#8208;Down by Chemically and Structurally Modified Gapmer Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of modified nucleotides and short hairpins within gapmer antisense oligonucleotides on RNase H mediated gene silencing was evaluated. Our studies show that the majority of the modifications of the control gapmer increased the silencing potential of the antisense oligonucleotide. The results might facilitate the sensible design and development of potent, highly efficient RNA therapeutics.







Abstract
We analyzed the effect of modified nucleotides within gapmer antisense oligonucleotides on RNase H mediated gene silencing. Additionally, short hairpins were introduced into antisense oligonucleotides as structural motifs, and their influence on biological and physicochemical properties of pre&#8208;structured gapmers was investigated for the first time. The results indicate that two LNA residues in specified positions of the gap flanking regions are sufficient and favorable for efficient knock&#8208;down of the &#946;&#8208;actin gene. Furthermore, the introduction of other modified nucleotides, i.&#8201;e. glycyl&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA&#8722;T, 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;propagyluridine, polyamine functionalized uridine, and UNA, in specified positions, also increases the inhibition of &#946;&#8208;actin expression. Importantly, the presence of hairpins within the gapmers improves their silencing properties.

         <title>Histidine Ligated Iron&#8208;Sulfur Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;sulfur peptides typically rely on Cys for ligation. Here, we show that peptides containing both Cys and His are able to stably coordinate [2Fe&#8208;2S] clusters with properties similar to the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster of Rieske proteins.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are thought to be ancient cofactors that could have played a role in early protometabolic systems. Thus far, redox active, prebiotically plausible iron&#8208;sulfur clusters have always contained cysteine ligands to the cluster. However, extant iron&#8208;sulfur proteins can be found to exploit other modes of binding, including ligation by histidine residues, as seen with [2Fe&#8208;2S] Rieske and MitoNEET proteins. Here, we investigated the ability of cysteine&#8208; and histidine&#8208;containing peptides to coordinate a mononuclear Fe2+ center and a [2Fe&#8208;2S] cluster and compare their properties with purified iron&#8208;sulfur proteins. The iron&#8208;sulfur peptides were characterized by UV&#8208;vis, circular dichroism, and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. Small (&#8804;6 amino acids) peptides can coordinate [2Fe&#8208;2S] clusters through a combination of cysteine and histidine residues with similar reduction potentials as their corresponding proteins. Such complexes may have been important for early cell&#8208;like systems.

         <title>Generation of photocaged nanobodies for intracellular applications in an animal using genetic code expansion and computationally guided protein engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanobodies are becoming increasingly popular as tools for manipulating and visualising proteins &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt;. The ability to control nanobody/antigen interactions using light could provide precise spatiotemporal control over protein function. We develop a general approach to engineer photo&#8208;activatable nanobodies using photocaged amino acids that are introduced into the target binding interface by genetic code expansion. Guided by computational alanine scanning and molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, we tune nanobody/target binding affinity to eliminate binding before uncaging. Upon photo&#8208;activation using 365 nm light, binding is restored. We use this approach to generate improved photocaged variants of two anti&#8208;GFP nanobodies that function robustly when directly expressed in a complex intracellular environment together with their antigen. We apply them to control subcellular protein localisation in the nematode worm &lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt;. Our approach applies predictions derived from computational modelling directly in a living animal and demonstrates the importance of accounting for &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; effects on protein&#8208;protein interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Myricetin Inhibits &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Aggregation by Delaying the Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase Transition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate amyloid aggregation. We discovered that myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, does not affect the initial formation of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates but dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition in the condensates.







Abstract
The aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) is a critical pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prevention of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation has become a key strategy for treating PD. Recent studies have suggested that &#945;&#8208;Syn undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate nucleation and amyloid formation. Here, we examined the modulation of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation by myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, under the conditions of LLPS. Unexpectedly, neither the initial morphology nor the phase&#8208;separated fraction of &#945;&#8208;Syn was altered by myricetin. However, the dynamics of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates decreased upon myricetin binding. Further studies showed that myricetin dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation in the condensates by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition. In addition, myricetin could disassemble the preformed &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregates matured from the condensates. Together, our study shows that myricetin inhibits &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregation in the condensates by retarding the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition and reveals that &#945;&#8208;Syn phase transition can be targeted to inhibit amyloid aggregation.

Pick and mix: In an impressive new report, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of marine toxin domoic acid in the red alga Chondria armata, but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss in this Highlight article the importance of continuing to acquire new data on biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for both diagnostic and metabolic&#8208;engineering purposes.







Abstract
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) represent both ecological and public health hazards in the marine environment. Indeed, some algae can produce metabolites that have negative effects on marine ecosystems and mammals. Kainoid derivatives such as kainic acid (KA) and domoic acid (DA) are considered some of the most toxic metabolites of marine origin biosynthesized by a limited number of micro&#8208; and macroalgae. While recent works have provided the first insights into the biosynthetic route of KA in red algae and DA in diatoms, the DA biosynthetic pathway has remained uncharacterized for red algae. In a recent work, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of DA in the red alga Chondria armata but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss here the importance of pursuing active research in this area to gain insights into secondary biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for diagnostic and metabolic engineering perspectives.

         <title>Anticancer Activity of Reconstituted Ribonuclease S&#8208;Decorated Artificial Viral Capsid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsid that exhibited enzyme activity were constructed by reconstituting &#946;&#8208;annulus&#8208;S&#8208;peptide with S&#8208;protein at neutral pH. The RNase S&#8208;decorated capsids taken up by HepG2 cells exhibited higher RNA degradation and anticancer activity in cells compared with RNase S alone.







Abstract
Ribonuclease S (RNase S) is an enzyme that exhibits anticancer activity by degrading RNAs within cancer cells; however, the cellular uptake efficiency is low due to its small molecular size. Here we generated RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsids with a size of 70&#8211;170&#8197;nm by self&#8208;assembly of the &#946;&#8208;annulus&#8208;S&#8208;peptide followed by reconstitution with S&#8208;protein at neutral pH. The RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsids are efficiently taken up by HepG2 cells and exhibit higher RNA degradation activity in cells compared with RNase S alone. Cell viability assays revealed that RNase S&#8208;decorated capsids have high anticancer activity comparable to that of standard anticancer drugs.

         <title>Probing the Substrate Requirements of the In&#8197;Vitro Geranylation Activity of Selenouridine Synthase (SelU)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenouridine synthase (SelU, also called mnmH) is an enzyme with a dual activity which catalyzes selenation and geranylation in bacterial tRNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine at wobble positions. In this study, we explored the in&#8197;vitro geranylation process of tRNA anticodon stem loops (ASL) mediated by SelU. Our findings suggest a putative mechanism for SelU substrate discrimination and unveil key factors that might influence its enzymatic activity.







Abstract
Natural RNA modifications diversify the structures and functions of existing nucleic acid building blocks. Geranyl is one of the most hydrophobic groups recently identified in bacterial tRNAs. Selenouridine synthase (SelU, also called mnmH) is an enzyme with a dual activity which catalyzes selenation and geranylation in tRNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine using selenophosphate or geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate as cofactors. In this study, we explored the in&#8197;vitro geranylation process of tRNA anticodon stem loops (ASL) mediated by SelU and showed that the geranylation activity was abolished when U35 was mutated to A35 (ASL&#8208;tRNALys(s2U)UU to ASL&#8208;tRNAIle(s2U)AU). By examining the SelU cofactor geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate (gePP) and its analogues, we found that only the geranyl group, but not dimethylallyl&#8208; and farnesyl&#8208;pyrophosphate with either shorter or longer terpene chains, could be incorporated into ASL. The degree of tRNA geranylation in the end&#8208;point analysis for SelU follows the order of ASLLys(s2UUU)
ASLGln(s2UUG)&gt;ASLGlu(s2UUC). These findings suggest a putative mechanism for substrate discrimination by SelU and reveal key factors that might influence its enzymatic activity. Given that SelU plays an important role in bacterial translation systems, inhibiting this enzyme and targeting its geranylation and selenation pathways could be exploited as a promising strategy to develop SelU&#8208;based antibiotics.

         <title>Diterpenoids from Streptomyces: Structures, Biosyntheses and Bioactivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diterpenoids from Streptomyces, which were identified by direct isolation or genome mining, show diverse biological activities and can be potential drug candidates. Biosynthesis of these diterpenoids holds great promise for uncovering novel skeletons of diterpenoids by genome mining in Streptomyces strains.







Abstract
Bacteria, especially Streptomyces spp., have emerged as a rich source for natural diterpenoids with diverse structures and broad bioactivities. Here, we review diterpenoids biosynthesized by Streptomyces, with an emphasis on their structures, biosyntheses, and bioactivities. Although diterpenoids from Streptomyces are relatively rare compared to those from plants and fungi, their novel skeletons, biosyntheses and bioactivities present opportunities for discovering new drugs, enzyme mechanisms, and applications in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway engineering.

         <title>Direct Measurements of the Cobalt&#8208;Thiolate Bonds Strength in Rubredoxin by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining chemical denature/renature method and single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy, Co&#8208;substituted rubredoxin polyprotein was constructed and the strength of Co(II)&#8208;thiolate bonds was quantified with a rupture force of &#8764;140&#8197;pN, as a mechanostable chemical bond.







Abstract
Cobalt is a trace transition metal. Although it is not abundant on earth, tens of cobalt&#8208;containing proteins exist in life. Moreover, the characteristic spectrum of Co(II) ion makes it a powerful probe for the characterization of metal&#8208;binding proteins through the formation of cobalt&#8208;ligand bonds. Since most of these natural and artificial cobalt&#8208;containing proteins are stable, we believe that these cobalt&#8208;ligand bonds in the protein system are also mechanically stable. To prove this, we used atomic force microscopy&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (AFM&#8208;SMFS) to directly measure the rupture force of Co(II)&#8208;thiolate bond in Co&#8208;substituted rubredoxin (CoRD). By combining the chemical denature/renature method for building metalloprotein and cysteine coupling&#8208;based polyprotein construction strategy, we successfully prepared the polyprotein sample (CoRD)n suitable for single&#8208;molecule studies. Thus, we quantified the strength of Co(II)&#8208;thiolate bonds in rubredoxin with a rupture force of &#8764;140&#8197;pN, revealing that it is a mechanostable chemical bond. In addition, the Co&#8722;S bond is more labile than the Zn&#8722;S bond in proteins, similar to the result from the metal&#8208;competing titration experiment.

         <title>Proteomic Tools for the Quantitative Analysis of Artificial Peptide Libraries: Detection and Characterization of Target&#8208;Amplified PD&#8208;1 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) method, coupled to a proteomics data analysis workflow, was used to discover interface blockers of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 interaction. The S&#8208;linked dimeric species that were significantly amplified in the protein&#8208;templated mixture were identified, synthesized, and subjected to biophysical screening.







Abstract
We report a quantitative proteomics data analysis pipeline, which coupled to protein&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DDC) experiments, enables the rapid discovery and direct characterization of protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) modulators. A low&#8208;affinity PD&#8208;1 binder was incubated with a library of &gt;100 D&#8208;peptides under thiol&#8208;exchange favoring conditions, in the presence of the target protein PD&#8208;1, and we determined the S&#8208;linked dimeric species that resulted, amplified in the protein samples versus the controls. We chemically synthesized the target dimer candidates and validated them by thermophoresis binding and protein&#8208;protein interaction assays. The results provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for using this strategy in the high&#8208;throughput search of improved drug&#8208;like peptide binders that block therapeutically relevant protein&#8208;protein interactions.

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of Human Bleomycin Hydrolase: Mutation of a Cysteine Protease into a Serine Protease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>

Human bleomycin hydrolase (hBH) switches from a cysteine protease to a serine protease that selectively reacts with the primary amide of bleomycins (BLMs) but is unable to cleave the secondary amide of hBH C&#8208;terminus.







Abstract
Human bleomycin hydrolase (hBH) catalyzes deamidation of the anticancer drug bleomycins (BLM). This enzyme is involved in BLM detoxification and drug resistance. Herein, we report the putative BLM&#8208;binding site and catalytic mechanism of hBH. The crystal structures and biochemical studies suggest that hBH cleaves its C&#8208;terminal residue without significant preference for the type of amino acid, and therefore can accordingly accommodate the &#946;&#8208;aminoalanine amide moiety of BLM for deamidation. Interestingly, hBH is capable of switching from a cysteine protease to a serine protease that is unable to cleave the secondary amide of hBH C&#8208;terminus but reacts with the primary amide of BLMs.

         <title>Tetraphenylethene Derivatives Modulate the RNA Hairpin&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Conformational Equilibria in Proto&#8208;oncogenes
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular conformational equilibria between RNA hairpin and G&#8208;quadruplex in the 5&#8217;&#8208;UTRs of proto&#8208;oncogenes serve as attractive therapeutic targets. Tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives are shown to modulate the translation by shifting the conformational equilibria towards G&#8208;quadruplexes. The results suggest that the small molecule&#8208;mediated conformational shift in RNA can be used to modulate regulatory function for therapy.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (GQs) sequences in 5&#8242;&#8208;UTRs of certain proto&#8208;oncogenes co&#8208;localize with hairpin (Hp) forming sequences resulting in intramolecular Hp&#8208;GQ conformational equilibria, which is suggested to regulate cancer development and progression. Thus, regulation of Hp&#8208;GQ equilibria with small molecules is an attractive but less explored therapeutic approach. Herein, two tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives, TPE&#8722;Py and TPE&#8208;MePy, were synthesized and their effect on Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium was explored. FRET, CD and molecular docking experiments suggest that cationic TPE&#8208;MePy shifts the Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium significantly towards the GQ conformer mainly through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and van der Waals interactions. In the presence of TPE&#8208;MePy, the observed rate constant values for first and second folding steps were increased up to 14.6 and 2.6&#8208;fold, respectively. The FRET melting assay showed a strong stabilizing ability of TPE&#8208;MePy (&#916;Tm=4.36&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, the unmethylated derivative TPE&#8722;Py did not alter the Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium. Subsequently, luciferase assay analysis demonstrated that the TPE&#8208;MePy derivatives suppressed the translation efficiency by &#8764;5.7&#8208;fold by shifting the Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium toward GQ conformers in the 5&#8217;&#8208;UTR of TRF2. Our data suggests that HpGQ equilibria could be selectively targeted with small molecules to modulate translation for therapy.

         <title>Artificial Fusions between P450 BM3 and an Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Efficient (+)&#8208;Nootkatone Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fruitful fusion: A cytochrome P450 BM3 mutant and an alcohol dehydrogenase were genetically fused in different order and with different linkers to unite both substrate oxidation and cofactor regeneration in one construct. The fusions exhibited higher activity compared to separate enzymes as highlighted with the two&#8208;step oxidation of (+)&#8208;valencene to the grapefruit aroma (+)&#8208;nootkatone formed at a concentration of 1080&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzyme cascades enable the production of valuable chemical compounds, and fusion of the enzymes that catalyze these reactions can improve the reaction outcome. In this work, P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium and an alcohol dehydrogenase from Sphingomonas yanoikuyae were fused to bifunctional constructs to enable cofactor regeneration and improve the in&#8197;vitro two&#8208;step oxidation of (+)&#8208;valencene to (+)&#8208;nootkatone. An up to 1.5&#8208;fold increased activity of P450 BM3 was achieved with the fusion constructs compared to the individual enzyme. Conversion of (+)&#8208;valencene coupled to cofactor regeneration and performed in the presence of the solubilizing agent cyclodextrin resulted in up to 1080&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 (+)&#8208;nootkatone produced by the fusion constructs as opposed to 620&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 produced by a mixture of the separate enzymes. Thus, a two&#8208;step (+)&#8208;valencene oxidation was considerably improved through the simple method of enzyme fusion.

In this work, P450 BM3 from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt; and an alcohol dehydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Sphingomonas yanoikuyae&lt;/i&gt; were fused to bifunctional constructs to enable cofactor regeneration and improve the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; two-step oxidation of (+)-valencene to (+)-nootkatone. An up to 1.5-fold increased activity of P450 BM3 was achieved with the fusion constructs compared to the individual enzyme. Conversion of (+)-valencene coupled to cofactor regeneration and performed in the presence of the solubilizing agent cyclodextrin resulted in up to 1080&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (+)-nootkatone produced by the fusion constructs as opposed to 620&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; produced by a mixture of the separate enzymes. Thus, a two-step (+)-valencene oxidation was considerably improved through the simple method of enzyme fusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crucial Role of the Chaperonin GroES/EL for Heterologous Production of the Soluble Methane Monooxygenase from Methylomonas methanica MC09</title>

Methane monooxygenase: The chaperonin GroES/EL enables folding and correct assembly of soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. The production of recombinant sMMO will enable a variety of novel biotechnological applications in future.







Abstract
Methane is a widespread energy source and can serve as an attractive C1 building block for a future bioeconomy. The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) is able to break the strong C&#8722;H bond of methane and convert it to methanol. The high structural complexity, multiplex cofactors, and unfamiliar folding or maturation procedures of sMMO have hampered the heterologous production and thus biotechnological applications. Here, we demonstrate the heterologous production of active sMMO from the marine Methylomonas methanica MC09 in Escherichia coli by co&#8208;synthesizing the GroES/EL chaperonin. Iron determination, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and native gel immunoblots revealed the incorporation of the non&#8208;heme diiron centre and homodimer formation of active sMMO. The production of recombinant sMMO will enable the expansion of the possibilities of detailed studies, allowing for a variety of novel biotechnological applications.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Activatable Photocaged Variant of the Ultra&#8208;High Affinity ALFA&#8208;Tag Nanobody</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tag control: Photo&#8208;activatable antibodies are a recent addition to the chemical biology toolbox that allow the manipulation of biological processes by antigen&#8208;binding with unprecedented spatiotemporal control. We report the successful extension of our design concept of suitably photocaged nanobodies, termed photobodies, to the first short tag (13 amino acids) binding nanobody, the ultra&#8208;high affinity ALFA nanobody, to open the door for more fine&#8208;tuned control.







Abstract
Nanobodies against short linear peptide&#8208;epitopes are widely used to detect and bind proteins of interest (POI) in fusion constructs. Engineered nanobodies that can be controlled by light have found very recent attention for various extra&#8208; and intracellular applications. We here report the design of a photocaged variant of the ultra&#8208;high affinity ALFA&#8208;tag nanobody, also termed ALFA&#8208;tag photobody. ortho&#8208;Nitrobenzyl tyrosine was incorporated into the paratope region of the nanobody by genetic code expansion technology and resulted in a &#8805;9,200 to 100,000&#8208;fold impairment of the binding affinity. Irradiation with light (365&#8197;nm) leads to decaging and reconstitutes the native nanobody. We show the light&#8208;dependent binding of the ALFA&#8208;tag photobody to HeLa cells presenting the ALFA&#8208;tag. The generation of the first photobody directed against a short peptide epitope underlines the generality of our photobody design concept. We envision that this photobody will be useful for the spatiotemporal control of proteins in many applications using cultured cells.

         <title>Characterization of 2&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine in Duplex, G&#8208;Quadruplex and i&#8208;Motif</title>

A small, but effective modification: Canonical and non&#8208;canonical DNA structures containing 2&#8208;fluoroadenosine (2FA) were characterized by thermal stability and CD spectroscopy. The results show interesting features such as high thermal stability of the 2FA&#8208;C base pair and different structural influences on G&#8208;quadruplexes in the presence of sodium ions. Incorporation of 2FA into the i&#8208;motif induced small increases in pKa.







Abstract
Among various kinds of fluorine&#8208;substituted biomolecules, 2&#8208;fluoroadenine (2FA) and its derivatives have been actively investigated as therapeutic reagents, radio&#8208;sensitizers, and 19F NMR probes. In spite of their excellent properties, DNA containing 2FA has not been studied well. For fundamental understanding and future applications to the development of functional nucleic acids, we characterized 2FA&#8208;containing oligonucleotides for canonical right&#8208;handed DNA duplex, G&#8208;quadruplex, and i&#8208;motif structures. Properties of 2FA were similar to native adenine due to the small size of the fluorine atom, but it showed unique features caused by high electronegativity. This work provides useful information for future application of 2FA&#8208;modified DNA.

         <title>Carbonate&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemical Tool for Uncovering Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) Activity Variations in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the established importance of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in drug metabolism, methods to monitor factors that influence CES1 activity are limited. Herein, we exploit the self&#8208;immolative properties of carbonates to generate a fluorescent chemical tool and use it to identify activity differences between CES1 sequence variants in live cells.







Abstract
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) plays a key role in the metabolism of endogenous biomolecules and xenobiotics including a variety of pharmaceuticals. Despite the established importance of CES1 in drug metabolism, methods to study factors that can vary CES1 activity are limited with only a few suitable for use in live cells. Herein, we report the development of FCP1, a new CES1 specific fluorescent probe with a unique carbonate substrate constructed from commercially available reagents. We show that FCP&#8208;1 can specifically report on endogenous CES1 activity with a robust fluorescence response in live HepG2 cells through studies with inhibitors and genetic knockdowns. Subsequently, we deployed FCP&#8208;1 to develop a live cell fluorescence microscopy&#8208;based approach to identify activity differences between CES1 isoforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of a fluorescent probe to measure the activity of CES1 sequence variants in live cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Signal Peptide Library with Novel Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe, Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII, which could be used to specifically label His&#8208;tagged proteins in&#8197;vitro, was synthesized by a one&#8208;pot method. The recombinant that could secrete NHase HBA was screened from a signal peptide (SP) library (ca. 6500 clones) with Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII. This is the first time that secreted NHase has been expressed in Bacillus subtilis successfully.







Abstract
Nitrile hydratase (NHase) is an excellent biocatalyst for the synthesis of amide compounds and is composed of two heterologous subunits. However, the secretory expression of NHase has been difficult to achieve because of its complex expression mechanism. In this work, a novel fluorescent probe Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII was synthesized by a one&#8208;pot method. Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII could specifically label His&#8208;tagged proteins in&#8197;vitro, such as for staining in&#8208;gel, Western blot, and ELISA analysis. Furthermore, Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII combined with dot blots could quantitatively detect His&#8208;tagged proteins at between 1&#8211;10&#8197;pmol and perform high&#8208;throughput screening for the NHase signal peptide library. Recombinant Bacillus subtilis WB800/phoB&#8208;HBA with the extracellular expression of NHase was screened (ca. 6500&#8197;clones).

This is the first time that secretory NHase has been expressed in B.&#8197;subtilis successfully.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel fluorescent probe&lt;/b&gt;, Rho-IDA-CoII, which could be used to specifically label His-tagged proteins &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, was synthesized by a one-pot method. The recombinant that could secrete NHase HBA was screened from a signal peptide (SP) library (ca. 6500 clones) with Rho-IDA-CoII. This is the first time that secreted NHase has been expressed in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; successfully.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrile hydratase (NHase) is an excellent biocatalyst for the synthesis of amide compounds and is composed of two heterologous subunits. However, the secretory expression of NHase has been difficult to achieve because of its complex expression mechanism. In this work, a novel fluorescent probe Rho-IDA-CoII was synthesized by a one-pot method. Rho-IDA-CoII could specifically label His-tagged proteins &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, such as for staining in-gel, Western blot, and ELISA analysis. Furthermore, Rho-IDA-CoII combined with dot blots could quantitatively detect His-tagged proteins at between 1&#8211;10&#8197;pmol and perform high-throughput screening for the NHase signal peptide library. Recombinant &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; WB800/phoB-HBA with the extracellular expression of NHase was screened (ca. 6500&#8197;clones). After optimization of fermentation conditions, the NHase activity in the culture supernatant reached 17.34&#177;0.16&#8197;U/mL. This is the first time that secretory NHase has been expressed in &lt;i&gt;B.&#8197;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; successfully.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of Linaridin Peptides Contains Epimerase Gene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterologous expression experiments of three linaridin biosynthetic gene clusters revealed that the presence of multiple D&#8208;amino acids is a common feature of linaridin natural products, and unveiled the involvement of novel peptide epimerases conserved among linaridin clusters. By gene&#8208;deletion experiments, we also show that peptide epimerization occurs in the early stage of biosynthesis.







Abstract
Salinipeptins belong to the type&#8208;A linaridin class of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) comprising 22 amino acid residues with multiple D&#8208;amino acids. Although chirality of other type&#8208;A linaridins, such as grisemycin and cypemycin, has not been reported, the biosynthetic gene clusters of type&#8208;A linaridins have identical gene organization. Here, we report heterologous expression of grisemycin biosynthetic gene cluster (grm) and show that grisemycin contains multiple D&#8208;amino acids, similar to salinipeptins. The heterologous expression experiments also confirm the involvement of a novel peptide epimerase in grisemycin biosynthesis. Gene&#8208;deletion experiments indicate that grmL, a single gene with unknown function, is indispensable for grisemycin production. We also show that the presence of D&#8208;amino acids is likely a common feature of linaridin natural products by analyzing two other type&#8208;A linaridin clusters.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminopurine Fluorescence Spectroscopy for Probing a Glucose Binding Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 2&#8208;aminopurine fluorescence spectroscopy, the glucose binding DNA aptamer showed binding to glucose and glucose containing disaccharides. This enthalpy&#8208;driven binding reaction requires two Na+ ions or one Mg2+ ion, and the Na+ binding state has a higher affinity for glucose.







Abstract
Glucose is the most important analyte for biosensors. Recently a DNA aptamer was reported allowing binding&#8208;based detection. However, due to a relatively weak binding affinity, it is difficult to perform binding assays to understand the property of this aptamer. In this work, we replaced the only adenine base in the aptamer binding pocket with a 2&#8208;aminopurine (2AP) and used fluorescence spectroscopy to study glucose binding. In the selection buffer, glucose increased the 2AP fluorescence with a Kd of 15.0&#8197;mM glucose, which was comparable with the 10&#8197;mM Kd previously reported using the strand displacement assay. The binding required two Na+ ions or one Mg2+ that cannot be replaced by Li+ or K+. The binding was weaker at higher temperature and its van't Hoff plot indicated enthalpy&#8208;driven binding. While other monosaccharides failed to achieve saturated binding even at high concentrations, two glucose&#8208;containing disaccharides, namely trehalose and sucrose, reached a similar fluorescence level as glucose although with over 10&#8208;fold higher Kd values. Detection limits in both the selection buffer (0.9&#8197;mM) and in artificial interstitial fluids (6.0&#8197;mM) were measured.

         <title>Spatio&#8208;Temporal Photoactivation of Cytotoxic Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successful photoactivation of proteins in mammalian cells is reported. We use a photocaged&#8208;intein (shown in yellow and pink respectively) to deactivate the protein of interest (shown in grey) and we deliver this construct to mammalian cells to activate it in&#8197;vivo using light (active protein shown in red and light in blue). In this work we achieved photocontrol of strong cytotoxic proteins in cancer cells, describing a possible new generation of protein therapeutics.







Abstract
Protein therapeutics offer exquisite selectivity in targeting cellular processes and behaviors, but are rarely used against non&#8208;cell surface targets due to their poor cellular uptake. While cell&#8208;penetrating peptides can be used to deliver recombinant proteins to the cytosol, it is generally difficult to selectively deliver active proteins to target cells. Here, we report a recombinantly produced, intracellular protein delivery and targeting platform that uses a photocaged intein to regulate the spatio&#8208;temporal activation of protein activity in selected cells upon irradiation with light. The platform was successfully demonstrated for two cytotoxic proteins to selectively kill cancer cells after photoactivation of intein splicing. This platform can generically be applied to any protein whose activity can be disrupted by a fused intein, allowing it to underpin a wide variety of future protein therapeutics.

         <title>Front Cover: Carbonate&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemical Tool for Uncovering Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) Activity Variations in Live Cells (ChemBioChem 12/2022)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, however, factors that modulate CES1 activity are poorly studied. In this research article, the self&#8208;immolative properties of carbonates are exploited to generate a fluorescent chemical tool, FCP&#8208;1, from a commercially available fluorophore. The ability of FCP&#8208;1 to report on endogenous CES1 in live cells is demonstrated before this fluorescent chemical tool is deployed to develop an assay that can measure the activity differences between CES1 isoforms in live cells. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;W. Beck et&#8197;al.

The ability of FCP-1 to report on endogenous CES1 in live cells is demonstrated before this fluorescent chemical tool is deployed to develop an assay that can measure the activity differences between CES1 isoforms in live cells.

         <title>Cover Feature: Direct Measurements of the Cobalt&#8208;Thiolate Bonds Strength in Rubredoxin by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy (ChemBioChem 12/2022)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy is a powerful tool which can quantify the strength of the metal&#8211;ligand bond. In this study, the strength of cobalt&#8211;thiolate bonds in Co&#8208;substituted rubredoxin was measured for the first time. The polymerized rubredoxin with cobalt ion ready for single&#8208;molecule measurement was constructed by combination of classic chemical denature/renature and cysteine coupling methods. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. Zheng et&#8197;al.

         <title>Strategies to Reduce the On&#8208;Target Platelet Toxicity of Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitors: PROTACs, SNIPERs and Prodrug&#8208;Based Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bcl&#8208;xL protein expression is essential for the survival of platelets, cancer, and senescence cells. Therefore, early&#8208;stage anticancer/senolytic Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs are plagued with on&#8208;target platelet toxicity. Initial attempts with synergistic combinations allowed researchers to reduce effective Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor dosage and related dose&#8208;dependent toxicity. As these designs presented occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology, approaches based on event&#8208;driven pharmacology (especially protein degradation approaches: PROTACs &amp; SNIPERs) gained significant interest. Also, some prodrug strategies have been developed, which are discussed in detail in this review.







Abstract
Apoptosis is a highly regulated cellular process. Aberration in apoptosis is a common characteristic of various disorders. Therefore, proteins involved in apoptosis are prime targets in multiple therapies. Bcl&#8208;xL is an antiapoptotic protein. Compared to other antiapoptotic proteins, the expression of Bcl&#8208;xL is common in solid tumors and, to an extent, in some leukemias and lymphomas. The overexpression of Bcl&#8208;xL is also linked to survival and chemoresistance in cancer and senescent cells. Therefore, Bcl&#8208;xL is a promising anticancer and senolytic target. Various nanomolar range Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitors have been developed. ABT&#8208;263 was successfully identified as a Bcl&#8208;xL/Bcl&#8208;2 dual inhibitor. But it failed in the clinical trial (phase&#8208;II) because of its on&#8208;target platelet toxicity, which also implies an essential role of Bcl&#8208;xL protein in the survival of human platelets. Classical Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs utilize occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology with typical shortcomings (such as dose&#8208;dependent off&#8208;target and on&#8208;target platelet toxicities). Hence, event&#8208;driven pharmacology&#8208;based approaches, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and SNIPERs (specific non&#8208;genetic IAP&#8208;based protein erasers) have been developed. The development of Bcl&#8208;xL based PROTACs was expected, as 600 E3&#8208;ligases are available in humans, while some (such as cereblon (CRBN), von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)) are relatively less expressed in platelets. Therefore, E3 ligase ligand&#8208;based Bcl&#8208;xL PROTACs (CRBN: XZ424, XZ739; VHL: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b) showed a significant improvement in platelet therapeutic index than their parent molecules (ABT&#8208;263: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b, XZ739, PZ15227; A1155463: XZ424). Other than their distinctive pharmacology, PROTACs are molecularly large, which limits their cell permeability and plays a role in improving their cell selectivity. We also discuss prodrug&#8208;based approaches, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ABBV&#8208;155), phosphate prodrugs (APG&#8208;1252), dendrimer conjugate (AZD0466), and glycosylated conjugates (Nav&#8208;Gal). Studies of in&#8208;vitro, in&#8208;vivo, structure&#8208;activity relationships, biophysical characterization, and status of preclinical/clinical inhibitors derived from these strategies are also discussed in the review.

         <title>Opportunities for Expanding Encoded Chemical Diversification and Improving Hit Enrichment in mRNA&#8208;Displayed Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 12, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA&#8208;displayed libraries of peptides and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries of small molecules are compared and contrasted in this review with a focus on diversification reactions and selection approaches where the former can learn from developments in the latter. We conclude by outlining a path towards approaches that may offer discovery of hybrid small&#8208;molecule peptidomimetics.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded small&#8208;molecule libraries and mRNA displayed peptide libraries both use numerically large pools of oligonucleotide&#8208;tagged molecules to identify potential hits for protein targets. They differ dramatically, however, in the &#8216;drug&#8208;likeness&#8217; of the molecules that each can be used to discover. We give here an overview of the two techniques, comparing some advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest areas where particularly mRNA display can benefit from adopting advances developed with DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We outline cases where chemical modification of the peptide library has already been used in mRNA display, and survey opportunities to expand this using examples from DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We also propose potential opportunities for encoding such reactions within the mRNA/cDNA tag of an mRNA&#8208;displayed peptide library to allow a more diversity&#8208;oriented approach to library modification. Finally, we outline alternate approaches for enriching target&#8208;binding hits from a pooled and tagged library, and close by detailing several examples of how an adjusted mRNA&#8208;display based approach could be used to discover new &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; modified small peptides.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs): Promising Biocatalysts for the Environmentally Friendly Production of Aroma Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are promising biocatalysts that catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids to produce (one carbon&#8208;shortened) fatty aldehydes, which are used as flavors and fragrances. This comprehensive review summarizes the recent advances in the biotechnological utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with focus on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs together with analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity.







Abstract
Fatty aldehydes (FALs) can be derived from fatty acids (FAs) and related compounds and are frequently used as flavors and fragrances. Although chemical methods have been conventionally used, their selective biotechnological production aiming at more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly synthetic routes is in demand. &#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are heme&#8208;dependent oxidative enzymes biologically involved in the initial step of plant FA &#945;&#8208;oxidation during which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the C&#945;&#8208;position of a FA (Cn) to generate the intermediate FA hydroperoxide, which is subsequently converted into the shortened corresponding FAL (Cn&#8208;1). &#945;&#8208;DOXs are promising biocatalysts for the flavor and fragrance industries, they do not require NAD(P)H as cofactors or redox partner proteins, and they have a broad substrate scope. Here, we highlight recent advances in the biocatalytic utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with emphasis on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs as well as analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

Although chemical methods have been conventionally used, their selective biotechnological production aiming at more efficient and eco-friendly synthetic routes is in demand. &#945;-Dioxygenases (&#945;-DOXs) are heme-dependent oxidative enzymes biologically involved in the initial step of plant FA &#945;-oxidation during which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;-position of a FA (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) to generate the intermediate FA hydroperoxide, which is subsequently converted into the shortened corresponding FAL (C&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;). &#945;-DOXs are promising biocatalysts for the flavor and fragrance industries, they do not require NAD(P)H as cofactors or redox partner proteins, and they have a broad substrate scope. Here, we highlight recent advances in the biocatalytic utilization of &#945;-DOXs with emphasis on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;-DOXs as well as analytical methods to measure &#945;-DOX activity &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antibody Recognition of Cancer Cells via Glycan Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying cells for selective antibody and immune recognition is a major strategy in cancer treatment. In this study, metabolic glycoengineering of cancer cells and chemical hapten functionalization led to antibody recognition and recruitment.







Abstract
Stimulation of the body's immune system toward tumor cells is now well recognized as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Just behind cell therapy and monoclonal antibodies, small molecule&#8208;based strategies are receiving growing attention as alternatives to direct immune response against tumor cells. However, the development of small&#8208;molecule approaches to modulate the balance between stimulatory immune factors and suppressive factors in a targeted way remains a challenge. Here, we report the cell surface functionalization of LS174T cancer cells with an abiotic hapten to recruit antibodies to the cell surface. Metabolic glycoengineering followed by covalent reaction with the hapten results in antibody recognition of the target cells. Microscopy and flow cytometry studies provide compelling evidence that metabolic glycoengineering and small molecule stimulators can be combined to direct antibody recognition.

         <title>Conjugation of a Toll&#8208;Like Receptor Agonist to Glycans of an HIV Native&#8208;Like Envelope Trimer Preserves Neutralization Epitopes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viral glycoprotein immunogens can be modified by a small molecule adjuvant by chemical attachment of an immune&#8208;potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 followed by transfer to N&#8208;glycans of the glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelop trimer with an agonist of Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8. The modification did not compromise structural integrity and Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies.







Abstract
Small molecule adjuvants are attractive for enhancing broad protection and durability of immune responses elicited by subunit vaccines. Covalent attachment of an adjuvant to an immunogen is particularly attractive because it simultaneously delivers both entities to antigen presenting cells resulting in more efficient immune activation. There is, however, a lack of methods to conjugate small molecule immune potentiators to viral glycoprotein immunogens without compromising epitope integrity. We describe herein a one&#8208;step enzymatic conjugation approach for the covalent attachment of small molecule adjuvants to N&#8208;linked glycans of viral glycoproteins. It involves the attachment of an immune potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 by Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition followed by sialyltransferase&#8208;mediated transfer to N&#8208;glycans of a viral glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelope trimer with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist. The modification did not compromise Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies. Electron microscopy confirmed structural integrity of the modified immunogen.

         <title>Bacterial Peroxidase on Electrochemically Reduced Graphene Oxide for Highly Sensitive H2O2 Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxidase enzymes enable the construction of electrochemical sensors for highly sensitive and selective quantitative detection of various molecules, pathogens and diseases. Herein, we describe the immobilization of a peroxidase from  Bacillus s.  (BsDyP) on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers. XRD, SEM, AFM, FT&#8208;IR and Raman characterization of the sensor confirmed its structural integrity and a higher enzyme surface occupancy. The BsDyP&#8208;ERGO/ITO/PET electrode performed better than other horseradish peroxidase&#8208;based electrodes, as evinced by an improved electrochemical response in the nanomolar range (linearity 0.05&#8211;280 &#181;M of H  2  O  2  , LOD 32 nM). The bioelectrode was mechanically robust, active in the 3.5&#8211;6 pH range and exhibited no loss of activity upon storage for 7 weeks at 4 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldable detergents for membrane protein stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are widely used for membrane protein structural study. Many recently developed detergents contain multiple tail and head groups, which are typically connected via a small and branched linker. Due to their inherent compact structures, with small inter&#8208;alkyl chain distances, these detergents form micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors, a feature favorably associated with membrane protein stability. A recent study on tandem triazine maltosides (TZM) revealed a distinct trend; despite possession of an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance, the TZM&#8208;Es were highly effective at stabilizing membrane proteins. Thanks to the incorporation of a flexible spacer between the two triazine rings in the linker region, these detergents are prone to folding into a compact architecture in micellar environments instead of adopting an extended conformation. Detergent foldability represents a new concept of novel detergent design with significant potential for future detergent development.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane disruptive action of cationic anti&#8208;bacterial peptide B1CTcu3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A twenty&#8208;two&#8208;residue peptide Brevinin1 Clinotarsus curtipus&#8208;3 (B1CTcu3), identified from the skin secretion of frog Clinotarsus curtipes of the Western Ghats, exhibited a broad range of antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It showed anti&#8208;biofilm activity even at sub&#8208;Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (sub&#8208;MIC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Analysis of the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, confocal images, flow cytometric data and the effect of salt concentration on antibacterial potency suggests that the killing action of the peptide is through the membranolytic process. Single channel electric recording confirmed that the peptide elicited pores on the bacterial cell membrane as it induces a heterogeneous channel in the lipid bilayer. &#160;It also showed cytotoxicity against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cell with IC50 of 25&#181;M. B1CTcu3 peptide could serve as the template for next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents, particularly against antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Recombinant L&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase with broad substrate spectrum for Co&#8208;Substrate Recycling in (S)&#8208;Selective Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolutions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral and enantiopure amines can be produced by enantioselective transaminases via kinetic resolution of amine racemates. This transamination reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;substrate. A dual&#8208;enzyme recycling system overcomes this limitation: L&#8208;amino acid oxidases (LAAO) recycle the accumulating co&#8208;product of (  S  )&#8208;selective transaminases in the kinetic resolution of racemic amines to produce pure (  R  )&#8208;amines.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral and enantiopure amines can be produced by enantioselective transaminases via kinetic resolution of amine racemates. This transamination reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of co-substrate. A dual-enzyme recycling system overcomes this limitation: L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) recycle the accumulating co-product of (  S  )-selective transaminases in the kinetic resolution of racemic amines to produce pure (  R  )-amines. However, availability of suitable LAAOs is limited. Here we use the heterologously produced, highly active fungal hcLAAO4 with broad substrate spectrum. H  2  O  2  as by-product of hcLAAO4 is detoxified by a catalase. The final system allows using sub-stoichiometric amounts of 1&#160;mol% of the transaminase co-substrate as well as the initial application of L-amino acids instead of &#945;-keto acids. With an optimized protocol, synthetic potential of this kinetic resolution cascade was proven at the preparative scale (&amp;gt;90&#160;mg) by the synthesis of highly enantiomerically pure (  R  )-methylbenzylamine (&amp;gt;99&#160;%ee) at complete conversion (50&#160;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Determination of Amide Cis/Trans Isomers in N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine: Tailored NMR Analysis of the N&#8208;Acetyl Group Conformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N &#8208;Acetyl&#8208; d &#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) is one of the most common amino sugars in nature, but the conformation of its N &#8208;acetyl group has drawn little attention. We report herein the first identification of NH protons of the amide cis forms of &#945; &#8208; and &#946; &#8208;GlcNAc by NMR spectroscopy. Relative quantification and thermodynamic analysis of both cis and trans forms was carried out in aqueous solution. The NH protons were further utilized by adapting protein NMR experiments to measure eight J &#8208;couplings within the N &#8208;acetyl group, of which six are sensitive to the H2&#8208;NH conformation and two are sensitive to the amide conformation. For amide cis and trans forms, the orientation between H2 and NH was determined as anti conformation, while a small percentage of syn conformation was predicted for the amide trans form of &#946; &#8208;GlcNAc. This approach holds great promise for the detailed conformational analysis of GlcNAc in larger biomolecules, such as glycoproteins and polysaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored phenyl esters inhibit ClpXP and attenuate Staphylococcus aureus &#945;&#8208;hemolysin secretion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel strategies against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria are urgently needed in order to overcome the current silent pandemic. Manipulation of toxin production in pathogenic species serves as a promising approach to attenuate virulence and prevent infections. In many bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocyotgenes, serine protease ClpXP is a key contributor to virulence and thus represents a prime target for antimicrobial drug discovery. The limited stability of previous electrophilic warheads prevented a sustained effect of virulence attenuation in bacterial culture. Here, we systematically tailor the stability and inhibitory potency of phenyl ester ClpXP inhibitors by steric shielding of the ester bond and fine&#8208;tuning the phenol leaving group. Out of 17 derivatives, two (MAS&#8208;19 and MAS&#8208;30) inhibited Staphylococcus aureus ClpP peptidase and ClpXP protease activities by &gt; 60% at 1 &#181;M. Furthermore, the novel inhibitors did not exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity against human and bacterial cells. Unlike the first generation phenylester AV170, these molecules attenuated S. aureus virulence evidently and displayed increased stability in aqueous buffer compared to the previous benchmark AV170.</dc:description>

         <title>Tying up a loose end: On the role of the C&#8208;terminal CCHHRAG fragment of the metalloregulator CueR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transcriptional regulator CueR is activated by the binding of Cu  I  , Ag  I  , or Au  I  to two cysteinates in a near&#8208;linear fashion. The C&#8208;terminal CCHHRAG sequence in  Escherichia coli  CueR present potential additional metal binding ligands and here we explore the effect of deleting this fragment on the binding of Ag  I  to CueR. CD&#8208;spectroscopic and ESI&#8208;MS data indicate that the high Ag  I  &#8208;binding affinity of WT&#8208;CueR is significantly reduced in &#916;7C&#8208;CueR.  111  Ag PAC spectroscopy demonstrates that the WT&#8208;CueR metal site structure (AgS  2  ) is conserved, but less populated in the truncated variant. Thus, the function of the C&#8208;terminal fragment may be to stabilize the two&#8208;coordinate metal site for cognate monovalent metal ions. In a broader perspective this is an example of residues beyond the second coordination sphere affecting metal site physico&#8208;chemical properties while leaving the structure unperturbed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis for the Screening of Novel Azoreductases and Their Preferred Electron Donor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screening approach for azoreductases was developed, including cell&#8208;free protein synthesis of an enzyme library and a multi&#8208;well microplate assay. Applicability to known and novel enzymes was demonstrated, and preferred co&#8208;substrates for each enzyme were evaluated. Five new and yet uncharacterized azoreductases were identified. Furthermore, it was shown that all azoreductases accept the co&#8208;substrate BNAH as an electron donor.







Abstract
Azoreductases are potent biocatalysts for the cleavage of azo bonds. Various gene sequences coding for potential azoreductases are available in databases, but many of their gene products are still uncharacterized. To avoid the laborious heterologous expression in a host organism, we developed a screening approach involving cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) combined with a colorimetric activity assay, which allows the parallel screening of putative azoreductases in a short time. First, we evaluated different CFPS systems and optimized the synthesis conditions of a model azoreductase. With the findings obtained, 10 azoreductases, half of them undescribed so far, were screened for their ability to degrade the azo dye methyl red. All novel enzymes catalyzed the degradation of methyl red and can therefore be referred to as azoreductases. In addition, all enzymes degraded the more complex and bulkier azo dye Brilliant Black and four of them also showed the ability to reduce p&#8208;benzoquinone. NADH was the preferred electron donor for the most enzymes, although the synthetic nicotinamide co&#8208;substrate analogue 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) was also accepted by all active azoreductases. This screening approach allows accelerated identification of potential biocatalysts for various applications.

         <title>Exploring the Temperature Effect on Enantioselectivity of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Biooxidation by the 2,5&#8208;DKCMO Module: The SLM Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because the kinetic data did not fit with the usual model of the enantiomeric ratio, E, we used &#8216;Shape Language Modeling&#8217; (SLM) &#8211; a shape prescriptive approach which does not requires a fixed mechanistic&#8208;mathematical model &#8208; to compare the effect of temperature (from 10&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C), on the enantioselectivity of Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation by a type&#8197;II BVMO.







Abstract
Temperature is a crucial parameter for biological and chemical processes. Its effect on enzymatically catalysed reactions has been known for decades, and stereo&#8208; and enantiopreference are often temperature&#8208;dependent. For the first time, we present the temperature effect on the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of rac&#8208;bicyclo[3.2.0]hept&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;one by the type II Bayer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase, 2,5&#8208;DKCMO. In the absence of a reductase and driven by the hydride&#8208;donation of a synthetic nicotinamide analogue, the clear trend for a decreasing enantioselectivity at higher temperatures was observed. &#8220;Traditional&#8221; approaches such as the determination of the enantiomeric ratio (E) appeared unsuitable due to the complexity of the system. To quantify the trend, we chose to use the &#8216;Shape Language Modelling&#8217; (SLM), a tool that allows the reaction to be described at all points in a shape prescriptive manner. Thus, without knowing the equation of the reaction, the substrate ee can be estimated that at any conversion.

Thus, without knowing the equation of the reaction, the substrate &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; can be estimated that at any conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Strategy for the Design and Evaluation of Heterobifunctional Tools: Applications to Protein Localization and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linkerology 101: This work presents a quantitative method for the rational design of tools to control protein&#8208;protein interactions. A library of probes based on the Trimethoprim&#8208;HaloTag system was synthesized and evaluated. The top&#8208;performing probe was used to control protein localization to various organelles within a cell and to initiate both local and global phase separation.







Abstract
To mimic the levels of spatiotemporal control that exist in nature, tools for chemically induced dimerization (CID) are employed to manipulate protein&#8208;protein interactions. Although linker composition is known to influence speed and efficiency of heterobifunctional compounds, modeling or in&#8197;vitro experiments are often insufficient to predict optimal linker structure. This can be attributed to the complexity of ternary complex formation and the overlapping factors that impact the effective concentration of probe within the cell, such as efflux and passive permeability. Herein, we synthesize a library of modular chemical tools with varying linker structures and perform quantitative microscopy in live cells to visualize dimerization in real&#8208;time. We use our optimized probe to demonstrate our ability to recruit a protein of interest (POI) to the mitochondria, cell membrane, and nucleus. Finally, we induce and monitor local and global phase separation. We highlight the importance of quantitative approaches to linker optimization for dynamic systems and introduce new, synthetically accessible tools for the rapid control of protein localization.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of 6&#8208;O&#8208;Phosphorylated Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides to Inhibit Amyloid &#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 6&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated heparan sulfate tetrasaccharide was rationally designed and synthesized to inhibit heparin&#8208;induced amyloid fibril formation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) in&#8197;vitro. Its competitive effect was confirmed by a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a tapping mode atomic force microscopy.







Abstract
Dysregulation of amyloidogenic proteins and their abnormal processing and deposition in tissues cause systemic and localized amyloidosis. Formation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) fibrils that deposit as amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains is an earliest pathological hallmark. The polysulfated heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin (HP) is one of the non&#8208;protein components of A&#946; deposits that not only modulates A&#946; aggregation, but also acts as a receptor for A&#946; fibrils to mediate their cytotoxicity. Interfering with the interaction between HS/HP and A&#946; could be a therapeutic strategy to arrest amyloidosis. Here we have synthesized the 6&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated HS/HP oligosaccharides and reported their competitive effects on the inhibition of HP&#8208;mediated A&#946; fibril formation in&#8197;vitro using a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a tapping mode atomic force microscopy.

         <title>Influence of reaction conditions on enzymatic enantiopreference: the curious case of HEwT in the synthesis of THF&#8208;amine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic enantiopreference is one of the key advantages of biocatalysis. While exploring the synthesis of small cyclic (chiral amines) such as 3&#8208;aminotetrahydrofuran (THF&#8208;amine), using the ( S )&#8208;selective transaminase from Halomonas elongata (HEwT), inversion of the enantiopreference was observed at increasing substrate loadings. In addition, the enantiopreference could also be altered by variation of the ionic strength, or of the co&#8208;solvent content in the reaction mixture. For example, using otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of 2 M sodium chloride gave ( R )&#8208;THF&#8208;amine (14% ee ), while the addition of 2.2 M isopropyl alcohol gave the ( S )&#8208;enantiomer in 30% ee . While the underlying cause is not currently understood, it appears likely that subtle changes in the structure of the enzyme cause the shift in enantiopreference and are worth exploring further.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Assay for the Screening of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 MPro Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A luminescent assay for the main protease MPro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 was developed and subsequently used for the screening of inhibitors of the chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease. The caged luminescent peptide probe used in this study releases photons upon proteolytic activity of MPro in the presence of luciferase.







Abstract
Since the outbreak of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in December 2019 millions of infections have been reported globally. The viral chymotrypsin&#8208;like main protease (MPro) exhibits a crucial role in viral replication and represents a relevant target for antiviral drug development. In order to screen potential MPro inhibitors we developed a luminescent assay using a peptide based probe containing a cleavage site specific for MPro. This assay was validated showing IC50 values similar to those reported in the literature for known MPro inhibitors and can be used to screen new inhibitors.

         <title>Advanced Insights into Catalytic and Structural Features of the Zinc&#8208;Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Thauera aromatica</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zinc&#8208;dependent MDR&#8722;ADH (medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase&#8722;alcohol dehydrogenase) from Thauera aromatica has a unique substrate preference for sterically demanding &#945;&#8208;substituted linear cyclic carbonyl compounds and a remarkable thermal, pH and solvent stability. Based on high&#8208;resolution structures from X&#8208;ray analysis, structural determinants for the enzyme's special features are introduced.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of ketones to chiral hydroxyl compounds by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) is an established strategy for the provision of valuable precursors for fine chemicals and pharmaceutics. However, most ADHs favor linear aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds, and suitable biocatalysts with preference for cyclic ketones and diketones are still scarce. Among the few candidates, the alcohol dehydrogenase from Thauera aromatica (ThaADH) stands out with a high activity for the reduction of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketone 1,2&#8208;cyclohexanedione to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone. This study elucidates catalytic and structural features of the enzyme. ThaADH showed a remarkable thermal and pH stability as well as stability in the presence of polar solvents. A thorough description of the substrate scope combined with the resolution and description of the crystal structure, demonstrated a strong preference of ThaADH for cyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones, and indicated structural determinants responsible for the unique substrate acceptance.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Cell&#8208;Free ATP Regeneration Module Based on Non&#8208;Oxidative Glycolysis Using Thermophilic Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP regeneration made simple! We have developed an in&#8197;vitro system for ATP regeneration in a single&#8208;expression strain powered by starch and orthophosphate as the phosphate carrier. This system does not produce harmful byproducts, use costly substrates, or require expression of multiple enzymes. In addition, only heat&#8208;treatment is required for the preparation of this system.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential cofactor for energy&#8208;dependent enzymatic reactions that occur during in&#8197;vitro biochemical conversion. Recently, an enzyme cascade based on non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis, which uses starch and orthophosphate as energy and phosphate sources, respectively, for the regeneration of ATP from adenosine diphosphate, has been developed (Wei et&#8197;al., ChemCatChem 2018, 10, 5597&#8211;5601). However, the 12 enzymes required for this system hampered its practical usability and further testing potential. Here, we addressed this issue by constructing co&#8208;expression vectors for the simultaneous gene expression of the 12 enzymes in a single expression strain. All enzymes were sourced from (hyper)thermophiles, which enabled a one&#8208;step purification via a heat&#8208;treatment process. We showed that the combination of the two enabled the ATP regeneration system to function in a single recombinant Escherichia coli strain. Additionally, this work provides a strategy to rationally design and control proteins expression levels in the co&#8208;expression vectors.

         <title>STAT Protein Thermal Shift Assays to Monitor Protein&#8208;Inhibitor Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>STAT3 protein is a sought&#8208;after drug target as it plays a key role in the progression of cancer. Many STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i) have been reported, but accumulating evidence suggests many of these act as off&#8208;target/indirect inhibitors of STAT signaling. Herein, we describe the STAT protein thermal shift assay (PTSA) as a novel target engagement tool, which we used to test the binding of known STAT3i to STAT3 and STAT1. This revealed STATTIC, BP&#8208;1&#8208;102, and Cpd188 destabilized both STATs and produced unique migratory patterns on SDS&#8208;PAGE gels, suggesting covalent protein modifications. Mass spectrometry experiments confirmed these compounds are nonspecifically alkylating STATs, as well as an unrelated protein, NUDT5. These experiments have highlighted the benefits of PTSA to investigate interactions with STAT proteins and helped reveal novel reactivity of Cpd188. The described PTSA represents a promising chemical biology tool that could be applied to an array of other protein targets.</dc:description>

         <title>BioWF: A naturally&#8208;fused, di&#8208;domain biocatalyst from biotin biosynthesis displays an unexpectedly broad substrate scope.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon backbone of biotin is constructed from the C  7  di&#8208;acid pimelate, which is converted to an acyl&#8208;CoA thioester by an ATP&#8208;dependent, pimeloyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (PCAS, encoded by BioW). The acyl&#8208;thioester is condensed with &#671;&#8208;alanine in a decarboxylative, Claisen&#8208;like reaction to form an aminoketone (8&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;oxononanoic acid, AON). This step is catalysed by the pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme (AON synthase, AONS, encoded by BioF). Distinct versions of  Bacillus subtilis  BioW (  Bs  BioW) and  E. coli  BioF (  Ec  BioF) display strict substrate specificity. In contrast, a BioW&#8208;BioF fusion from  Corynebacterium amycolatum  (  Ca  BioWF) accepts a wider range of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;fatty acids. Analysis of the active site of the  Bs  BioW:pimeloyl&#8208;adenylate complex suggested a key role for a Phe (F192) residue in the  Ca  BioW domain; a F192Y mutant restored the substrate specificity to pimelate. This surprising substrate flexibility also extends to the  Ca  BioF domain, which accepts &#671;&#8208;alanine, &#671;&#8208;serine and glycine. Structural models of the  Ca  BioWF fusion provide insight into how both domains interact with each other and suggest the presence of an intra&#8208;domain tunnel. The  Ca  BioWF fusion catalyses conversion of various fatty acids and amino acids to a range of AON derivatives. Such unexpected, natural broad substrate scope suggests that the  Ca  BioWF fusion is a versatile biocatalyst that can be used to prepare a number of aminoketone analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>First Fluorescent Acetylspermidine Deacetylation Assay for HDAC10 Identifies Selective Inhibitors with Cellular Target Engagement
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HDAC10 is as a polyamine deacetylase from the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family. Using a fluorescent acetylspermidine derivative, we developed the first enzymatic conversion assay for HDAC10. We designed HDAC10 selective inhibitors and demonstrated that they do not cause a lysosomal phenotype previously associated with HDAC10 inhibition in cancer cells.







Abstract
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important epigenetic regulators involved in many diseases, especially cancer. Five HDAC inhibitors have been approved for anticancer therapy and many are in clinical trials. Among the 11 zinc&#8208;dependent HDACs, HDAC10 has received relatively little attention by drug discovery campaigns, despite its involvement, e.&#8201;g., in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. This is due in part to a lack of robust enzymatic conversion assays. In contrast to the protein lysine deacetylase and deacylase activity of most other HDAC subtypes, it has recently been shown that HDAC10 has strong preferences for deacetylation of oligoamine substrates like acetyl&#8208;putrescine or &#8208;spermidine. Hence, it is also termed a polyamine deacetylase (PDAC). Here, we present the first fluorescent enzymatic conversion assay for HDAC10 using an aminocoumarin&#8208;labelled acetyl&#8208;spermidine derivative to measure its PDAC activity, which is suitable for high&#8208;throughput screening. Using this assay, we identified potent inhibitors of HDAC10&#8208;mediated spermidine deacetylation in&#8197;vitro. Based on the oligoamine preference of HDAC10, we also designed inhibitors with a basic moiety in appropriate distance to the zinc binding hydroxamate that showed potent inhibition of HDAC10 with high selectivity, and we solved a HDAC10&#8208;inhibitor structure using X&#8208;ray crystallography. We could demonstrate selective cellular target engagement for HDAC10 but a lysosomal phenotype in neuroblastoma cells that was previously associated with HDAC10 inhibition was not observed. Thus, we have developed new chemical probes for HDAC10 that allow further clarification of the biological role of this enzyme.

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets selectively uptake self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures: a versatile method for purification in DNA nanotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA is an excellent material for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures. Owing to the widespread use of DNA as a building block in laboratories and industry, it is desirable to increase the efficiency of all steps involved in producing self&#8208;assembled DNA structures. One of the bottlenecks is the purification required to separate the excess components from the target structures. This paper describes a purification method based on the fractionation by water&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/W) droplets composed of phase&#8208;separated dextran&#8208;rich droplets in a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;rich continuous phase. The dextran&#8208;rich droplets facilitate the selective uptake of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures and allow the separation of the target structure. This study investigates the ability to purify DNA origami, DNA hydrogels, and DNA microtubes. The W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation allows the purification of structures of a broad size spectrum without changes to the protocol. By quantifying the activity of deoxyribozyme&#8208;modified DNA origami after W/W&#8208;droplet purification, this study demonstrates that this method sufficiently preserves the accessibility to the surface of a functional DNA nanostructure. It is considered that the W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation could become one of the standard methods for the purification of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures for biomedical and nanotechnology applications owing to its low cost and simplicity.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biogenic amine organocatalysts have transformed the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Yet despite their use in synthesis and to label biomolecules&#160;  in vitro  , amine organocatalysis&#160;  in vivo  &#160;has received comparatively little attention &#8211; despite the potential of such reactions to be interfaced with living cells and to modify cellular metabolites. Herein we report that biogenic amines derived from L&#8208;tyrosine catalyze the self&#8208;aldol condensation of butanal to 2&#8208;ethylhexenal &#8211; a key intermediate in the production of the bulk chemical 2&#8208;ethylhexanol &#8211; in the presence of living&#160;  Escherichia coli  &#160;and outperform many amine organocatalysts currently used in synthetic organic chemistry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell lysate from&#160;  E. coli  &#160;and the prolific amine overproducer&#160;  Corynebacterium glutamicum  &#160;ATCC 13032 catalyze this reaction&#160;  in vitro  , demonstrating the potential for microbial metabolism to be used as a source of organocatalysts for biocompatible reactions in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Survey of Psilocybe Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the magic: Psilocybe mushrooms are known for their psychotropic effects. Yet, some species are suspected to cause paralysis. A genomic survey revealed an unexpectedly diverse repertoire of natural product genes in these mushrooms, much more diverse than evident by chemical analyses. Knowledge on the realm of the Psilocybe secondary metabolome helps anticipate potential toxicities in this iconic fungal genus.







Abstract
Psilocybe magic mushrooms are best known for their main natural product, psilocybin, and its dephosphorylated congener, the psychedelic metabolite psilocin. Beyond tryptamines, the secondary metabolome of these fungi is poorly understood. The genomes of five species (P. azurescens, P. cubensis, P.&#8197;cyanescens, P. mexicana, and P. serbica) were browsed to understand more profoundly common and species&#8208;specific metabolic capacities. The genomic analyses revealed a much greater and yet unexplored metabolic diversity than evident from parallel chemical analyses. P. cyanescens and P. mexicana were identified as aeruginascin producers. Lumichrome and verpacamide A were also detected as Psilocybe metabolites. The observations concerning the potential secondary metabolome of this fungal genus support pharmacological and toxicological efforts to find a rational basis for yet elusive phenomena, such as paralytic effects, attributed to consumption of some magic mushrooms.

         <title>Seeking Citius: Photochemical Access of Reactive Intermediates for Faster Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An attractive strategy to increase reaction kinetics in bioorthogonal chemistry is to access highly reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ. This article discusses efficient photochemical generation of two reactive intermediates&#8212;nitrile imine and tetrazine&#8212;from their stable and unreactive precursors and their subsequent use in rapid bioorthogonal labeling of proteins in live cells.







Abstract
Fast bioorthogonal reactions are sought after because of their superior performance in labeling low&#8208;abundance biomolecules in native cellular environments. An attractive strategy to increase reaction kinetics is to access the reactive intermediates through photochemical activation. To this end, significant progress was made in the last few years in harnessing two highly reactive intermediates&#8212;nitrile imine and tetrazine&#8212;generated through photoinduced ring rupture and catalytic photooxidation, respectively. The efficient capture of these reactive intermediates by their cognate reaction partners has enabled bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling of biomolecules in live cells.

         <title>N&#8208;terminal Cationic Modification of Linear Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide Improves Its Binding to DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamides (PIPs) bind to double&#8208;stranded B&#8208;DNA with sequence specificity. Linear PIPs have low molecular weight and recognize long sequences, but have low affinities. In this study, using DNA denaturation, surface plasmon resonance, and circular dichroism, we demonstrate that the cationic N&#8208;terminus modification of linear PIPs improves the affinity to DNA.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamides (PIPs) bind to double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) with varied sequence selectivity. We synthesized linear PIPs that can bind to narrow minor grooves of polypurine/polypyrimidine sequences and target long recognition sequences but have lower molecular weights than commonly used hairpin PIPs. We modified the N&#8208;terminus of linear PIPs using several groups, including &#946;&#8208;alanine extension and acetyl capping. Melting curve analysis of dsDNA demonstrated that cationic modifications improved the binding affinity of the PIPs to the targeted dsDNA. In addition, circular dichroism assays revealed the characteristic spectra depending on the binding stoichiometry of the N&#8208;cationic linear PIP and dsDNA (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, monomeric; 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, dimeric). Surface plasmon resonance assays confirmed the high binding affinities of linear PIPs. These findings may aid in the design of effective linear PIPs.

         <title>Influence of Ring Modifications on Nucleolar Stress Caused by Oxaliplatin&#8208;Like Compounds
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A limited structure&#8208;function study of Pt(II) compounds bearing modifications at the 4&#8208;position of the 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ligand shows that compounds with methyl, ethyl, and propyl substituents induce nucleolar stress, while ones with isopropyl and acetamide substituents do not. These results suggest a more complex picture of nucleolar stress induction by Pt(II) compounds.







Abstract
Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound in broad clinical use, can induce cell death through a nucleolar stress pathway rather than the canonical DNA damage response studied for other Pt(II) compounds. Previous work has found that the oxaliplatin 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ring but not the oxalate leaving group is important to the ability to induce nucleolar stress. Here we study the influence of DACH ring substituents at the 4&#8208;position on the ability of DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds to cause nucleolar stress. We determine that DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds with 4&#8208;position methyl, ethyl, or propyl substituents induce nucleolar stress, but DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds with 4&#8208;isopropyl substituents do not induce nucleolar stress. This effect is independent of whether the substituent is in the axial or equatorial position relative to the trans diamines of the ligand. These results suggest that spatially sensitive interactions could be involved in the ability of platinum compounds to cause nucleolar stress.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A limited structure-function&lt;/b&gt; study of Pt(II) compounds bearing modifications at the 4-position of the 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ligand shows that compounds with methyl, ethyl, and propyl substituents induce nucleolar stress, while ones with isopropyl and acetamide substituents do not. These results suggest a more complex picture of nucleolar stress induction by Pt(II) compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound in broad clinical use, can induce cell death through a nucleolar stress pathway rather than the canonical DNA damage response studied for other Pt(II) compounds. Previous work has found that the oxaliplatin 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ring but not the oxalate leaving group is important to the ability to induce nucleolar stress. Here we study the influence of DACH ring substituents at the 4-position on the ability of DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds to cause nucleolar stress. We determine that DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds with 4-position methyl, ethyl, or propyl substituents induce nucleolar stress, but DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds with 4-isopropyl substituents do not induce nucleolar stress. This effect is independent of whether the substituent is in the axial or equatorial position relative to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; diamines of the ligand. These results suggest that spatially sensitive interactions could be involved in the ability of platinum compounds to cause nucleolar stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Versatility of IPP and DMAPP Methyltransferases Enables Synthesis of C6, C7 and C8 Terpenoid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nearly all known terpenes are built from the two C5 precursors DMAPP and IPP. This work characterizes several bacterial DMAPP and IPP methyltransferases that convert these building blocks in C6, C7 and C8 prenyl pyrophosphates with selectivity on deprotonation sites and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The natural substance class of terpenoids covers an extremely wide range of different structures, although their building block repertoire is limited to the C5 compounds DMAPP and IPP. This study aims at the characterization of methyltransferases (MTases) that modify these terpene precursors and the demonstration of their suitability for biotechnological purposes. All seven enzymes tested accepted IPP as substrate and altogether five C6 compounds and six C7 compounds were formed within the reactions. A high selectivity for the deprotonation site as well as high stereoselectivity could be observed for most of the biocatalysts. Only the enzyme from Micromonospora humi also accepted DMAPP as substrate, converting it into (2R)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;IPP in&#8197;vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated the production of a C8 compound and a hydride shift step within the MTase&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Our study presents IPP / DMAPP MTases with very different catalytic properties, which provide biosynthetic access to many novel terpene&#8208;derived structures.

         <title>The Dynamic Range of Acidity: Tracking Rules for the Unidirectional Penetration of Cellular Compartments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing color like lobsters during cooking, flipper probes with cationic acids are introduced to elucidate the mechanics of early endocytosis, and to reveal universal tracking rules for unidirectional penetration along transmembrane pH gradients. Consistent with a dynamic range of &#916;pKa=3.5 for temporary deprotonation, cationic acids with pKa=9.8 stay only within more acidic early endosomes (pH &#8764;6.3), while those with pKa=10.6 track also the less acidic ones (pH &#8764;6.5). For these early endosomes, cationic acids with pKa=7.4 are too acidic for retention, those with pKa=13.5 are too basic for penetration. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Matile et&#8197;al.

         <title>Context&#8208;Dependence of the Reactivity of Cysteine and Lysine Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cys reactivity towards a maleimide and Lys reactivity towards an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester can depend on the position of the residue in the protein sequence. Cys reactivity decreases markedly in the order N&#8208;terminal&gt;in&#8208;chain&gt;C&#8208;terminal due to modulation of the sulfhydryl pKa value by proximal charges and allowing for selective modification. In contrast, differences in Lys reactivity are too small to allow for site&#8208;selective modification with an NHS ester.







Abstract
The S&#8208;alkylation of Cys residues with a maleimide and the N&#1013;&#8208;acylation of Lys residues with an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester are common methods for bioconjugation. Using Cys and Lys derivatives as proxies, we assessed differences in reactivity depending on the position of Cys or Lys in a protein sequence. We find that Cys position is exploitable to improve site&#8208;selectivity in maleimide&#8208;based modifications. Reactivity decreases substantially in the order N&#8208;terminal&gt;in&#8208;chain&gt;C&#8208;terminal Cys due to modulation of sulfhydryl pKa by the &#945;&#8208;ammonium and carboxylate groups at the termini. A lower pKa value yields a larger fraction thiolate, which promotes selectivity while somewhat decreasing thiolate nucleophilicity in accord with 
=0.41. Lowering pH and salt concentration enhances selectivity still further. In contrast, differences in the reactivity of Lys towards an NHS ester were modest due to an appreciable decrease in amino group nucleophilicity with a lower pKa of its conjugate acid. Hence, site&#8208;selective Lys modification protocols will require electrophiles other than NHS esters.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of employing synthetically challenging macrocyclic supramolecular receptors, we have employed &#8216;dynamic molecular assemblies&#8217; as the host material for pentose sugar, d&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;ribose. Such supramolecular assemblies at proper dimensions can form a &#8216;suitable cleft&#8217; for specific sugar molecules, which further experience multi&#8208;point hydrogen bonding and CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions from the neighboring ligand molecules. The choice of a proper monomer unit and adjusting the shape and size of the nanoaggregates are crucial to improving selectivity and sensitivity towards guest molecules.

         <title>Investigation of &#946;&#8208;Substitution Activity of O&#8208;Acetylserine Sulfhydrolase from Citrullus vulgaris</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrolase from Citrullus vulgaris was explored. This enzyme does not have mimosine synthase activity, but it is capable of promiscuous C&#8722;O bond formation. The crystal structure of the enzyme, combined with spectroscopic analysis, provides key information for subsequent development of this enzyme as a practical biocatalyst.







Abstract
Pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes have garnered interest for their ability to synthesize non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs). One such class of enzymes, O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrylases (OASSs), catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of l&#8208;cysteine. Here, we examine the &#946;&#8208;substitution capability of the OASS from Citrullus vulgaris (CvOASS), a putative l&#8208;mimosine synthase. While the previously reported mimosine synthase activity was not reproducible in our hands, we successfully identified non&#8208;native reactivity with a variety of O&#8208;nucleophiles. Optimization of reaction conditions for carboxylate and phenolate substrates led to distinct conditions that were leveraged for the preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of nsAAs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reactivity&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylserine sulfhydrolase from &lt;i&gt;Citrullus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; was explored. This enzyme does not have mimosine synthase activity, but it is capable of promiscuous C&#8722;O bond formation. The crystal structure of the enzyme, combined with spectroscopic analysis, provides key information for subsequent development of this enzyme as a practical biocatalyst.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyridoxal-5&#8217;-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes have garnered interest for their ability to synthesize non-standard amino acids (nsAAs). One such class of enzymes, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylserine sulfhydrylases (OASSs), catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-cysteine. Here, we examine the &#946;-substitution capability of the OASS from &lt;i&gt;Citrullus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;OASS), a putative &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-mimosine synthase. While the previously reported mimosine synthase activity was not reproducible in our hands, we successfully identified non-native reactivity with a variety of &lt;i&gt;O-&lt;/i&gt;nucleophiles. Optimization of reaction conditions for carboxylate and phenolate substrates led to distinct conditions that were leveraged for the preparative-scale synthesis of nsAAs. We further show this enzyme is capable of C&#8722;C bond formation through a &#946;-alkylation reaction with an activated nitroalkane. To facilitate understanding of this enzyme, we determined the crystal structure of the enzyme bound to PLP as the internal aldimine at 1.55&#8197;&#197;, revealing key features of the active site and providing information that may guide subsequent development of &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;OASS as a practical biocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The convenient synthesis of a broad series of versatile alkyne&#8208;spacer derivatives from the well&#8208;known Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction on diazenyl&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amine compounds is reported. This new class of heterocycles makes a promising tool for optical sensors for albumins.







Abstract
A convenient synthesis of a broad series of thirteen examples of alkyne&#8208;spacer derivatives 2 from the well&#8208;known Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction on diazenyl&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amine compounds 1 is reported. The reactivity of heterocycles 1 due the presence of selected electron&#8208;donor (EDG) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) groups attached to different alkynes was evaluated. Also, the reactional versatility due the position variation of the bromo atom at the scaffolds 1 was also investigated. In general, derivatives presented strong absorption bands at the 250&#8211;500&#8197;nm optical window and UV to cyan emission properties. Also, the redox analysis was recorded by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry technique. For HSA biomacromolecule assays, spectroscopic studies by UV&#8208;Vis, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission fluorescence, and molecular docking calculations evidenced the ability of each compound to establish interactions with human serum albumin (HSA). Finally, the behavior presented for this new class of heterocycles makes them a promising tool as optical sensors for albumins.

         <title>Recovery of Hydroxytyrosol from Olive Mill Wastewater Using the Promiscuous Hydrolase/Acyltransferase PestE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use it all: Olive mill wastewater contains the majority of health&#8208;promoting olive phenols, but this resource has been little utilized. For the valorization of olive mill wastewater, the promiscuous acyltransferase PestE was engineered to acetylate hydroxytyrosol notably in an aqueous phase and to facilitate its extraction into the organic ethyl acetate phase.







Abstract
Olive mill wastewater (OMWW) is produced annually during olive oil extraction and contains most of the health&#8208;promoting 3&#8208;hydroxytyrosol of the olive fruit. To facilitate its recovery, enzymatic transesterification of hydroxytyrosol (HT) was directly performed in an aqueous system in the presence of ethyl acetate, yielding a 3&#8208;hydroxytyrosol acetate rich extract. For this, the promiscuous acyltransferase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 (PestE) was engineered by rational design. The best mutant for the acetylation of hydroxytyrosol (PestE_I208A_L209F_N288A) was immobilized on EziG2 beads, resulting in hydroxytyrosol conversions between 82 and 89&#8201;% in one hour, for at least ten reaction cycles in a buffered hydroxytyrosol solution. Due to inhibition by other phenols in OMWW the conversions of hydroxytyrosol from this source were between 51 and 62&#8201;%. In a preparative scale reaction, 13.8&#8197;mg (57&#8201;%) of 3&#8208;hydroxytyrosol acetate was extracted from 60&#8197;mL OMWW.

         <title>Why Omicron Variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is Less Fatal?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proteins of the Omicron variant possess numerous mutations. Multiple lysine residues newly found in these proteins build up chloride via ionic bonds, which solubilizes stressful, insoluble, and stiff calcium salts such as calcium oxalate that can trigger cell senescence.







Abstract
The article published by Nie et&#8197;al. addressed one of the two key questions regarding the Omicron variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, while the underpinning for the less deadly nature of the variant remains unexplained. The proteins of the Omicron variant have numerous mutations, notably several substitutions of other amino acids by lysine residues. Glycine and valine attract calcium and enhance the formation of stressful, insoluble, and stiff calcium oxalate. Lysine residues in proteins build up chloride via ionic bonds which solubilizes insoluble and rigid divalent salts. The aforementioned mutations have weakened the lethalness of the Omicron variant perhaps via a biochemical mechanism. Despite net gain in favorable mutations versus deleterious mutations, the overall valine plus glycine content is still high in the proteins of Omicron variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which remains a public health concern.

         <title>Chemical Diversity and Biosynthesis of Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpenes in the Fungal Kingdom</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fungal drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are emerging as a very interesting class of chemicals with many notable activities. Elucidation of DTS biosynthesis in fungi revealed that the two main precursors, drimenol and drim&#8208;8&#8208;ene&#8208;11&#8208;ol, are the preferred backbones. Hence, hundreds of different fungal DTS derivatives have been isolated and identified, suggesting that they are relevant secondary metabolites in the fungal kingdom.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes are a class of compounds produced by a wide range of organisms, initially isolated and characterized in plants. Meanwhile, in the past 20&#8211;30&#8197;years, a large number of novel structures from many divergent fungi have been elucidated. Recently, the biosynthesis of drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and their esters has been explained in two filamentous fungi, namely Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus calidoustus, disclosing the basic biosynthetic principles needed to identify similar pathways in the fungal kingdom.

A pyrimidine&#8208;based fluorescent probe, Z2, was designed to monitor the mitophagy process by detection of mitochondrial pH variation. This probe exhibits a strong turn&#8208;on fluorescence signal when detecting low pH without any interference, and achieves mitophagy monitoring in cells and visualization of the pH variation in Caenorhabditis elegans.







Abstract
Impaired mitophagy hinders the clearance of damaged mitochondria, inducing pathological states. Knowledge of this phenomenon is key to diagnosing certain diseases and understanding their pathogenesis. Mitophagy involves an acidization process that could serve as an ideal detection target. In this work, we designed and synthesized a mitochondrial&#8208;targeting fluorescence probe, Z2, for evaluating pH variation. This probe exhibited remarkable &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence under acidic conditions. In biological applications, Z2 showed a strong, specific pH detection capacity in Parkin&#8208;overexpressing HeLa cells during the mitophagy process. The &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence property of Z2 was also used to detect pH variations in Caenorhabditis elegans. This probe, as a novel pH assessment tool, may facilitate further research of mitophagy&#8208;associated pathological patterns.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and In Vivo Fluorescence Imaging Study of a Cytochrome P450 1B1 Targeted NIR Probe Containing a Chelator Moiety</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

A near infrared (NIR) probe with a chelator moiety targeting CYP1B1 was developed by conjugating &#945;&#8208;naphthoflavone (ANF) derivatives with both an NIR dye and a chelator for metal labelling.

Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 has been found to be overexpressed specifically in tumor tissues at an early stage, which makes it a potential cancer biomarker for molecular imaging. Multimodal imaging combines different imaging modalities and offers more comprehensive information. Thus, imaging probes bearing more than one kind of signal fragment have been extensively explored and display great promise. Herein, we developed a near infrared (NIR) probe with a chelator moiety targeting CYP1B1 by conjugating &#945;&#8208;naphthoflavone (ANF) derivatives with both an NIR dye and a chelator for potential application in bimodal imaging. Enzymatic inhibitory studies demonstrated inhibitory activity against CYP1B1 and selectivity among CYP1 were successfully retained after chemical modification. Cell&#8208;based saturation studies indicated nanomolar range binding affinity between the probe and CYP1B1 overexpressed cancer cells. In vitro competitive binding assays monitored by confocal microscopy revealed that the probe could specifically accumulate in tumor cells. In vivo and ex vivo imaging studies demonstrated that the probe could effectively light&#8208;up the tumor tissues as early as 2&#8197;hours post&#8208;injection. In addition, the fluorescence was significantly blocked by co&#8208;injection of CYP1B1 inhibitor, which indicated the probe accumulation in tumor sites was due to specific binding to CYP1B1.

         <title>Connecting Algal Polysaccharide Degradation to Formaldehyde Detoxification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative demethylation of 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose produces formaldehyde. Marine bacteria that utilize this sugar in the degradation of porphyran must therefore possess suitable formaldehyde detoxification pathways. The connection between the degradation of marine carbohydrates and the detoxification of formaldehyde has been demonstrated for the marine model organism Zobellia galactanivorans.







Abstract
Formaldehyde is a toxic metabolite that is formed in large quantities during bacterial utilization of the methoxy sugar 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose, an abundant monosaccharide in the red algal polysaccharide porphyran. Marine bacteria capable of metabolizing porphyran must therefore possess suitable detoxification systems for formaldehyde. We demonstrate here that detoxification of formaldehyde in the marine Flavobacterium Zobellia galactanivorans proceeds via the ribulose monophosphate pathway. Simultaneously, we show that the genes encoding the key enzymes of this pathway are important for maintaining high formaldehyde resistance. Additionally, these genes are upregulated in the presence of porphyran, allowing us to connect porphyran degradation to the detoxification of formed formaldehyde.

         <title>M379A Mutant Tyrosine Phenol&#8208;lyase from Citrobacter freundii Has Altered Conformational Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The M379A mutant tyrosine phenol&#8208;lyase is a good catalyst for synthesis of L&#8208;tyrosine analogues. The crystal structure and kinetic studies show that the mutation affects conformational changes coupled with the catalytic reaction.







Abstract
The M379A mutant of Citrobacter freundii tyrosine phenol&#8208;lyase (TPL) has been prepared. M379A TPL is a robust catalyst to prepare a number of tyrosines substituted at the 3&#8208;position with bulky groups that cannot be made with wild type TPL. The three dimensional structures of M379A TPL complexed with L&#8208;methionine and 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;DL&#8208;phenylalanine have been determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Methionine is bound as a quinonoid complex in a closed active site in 3 of 4 chains of homotetrameric M379A TPL. M379A TPL reacts with L&#8208;methionine about 8&#8208;fold slower than wild type TPL. The temperature dependence shows that the slower reaction is due to less positive activation entropy. The structure of the M379A TPL complex of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;DL&#8208;phenylalanine has a quinonoid complex in two subunits, with an open active site conformation. The effects of the M379A mutation on TPL suggest that the mutant enzyme has altered the conformational dynamics of the active site.

         <title>Recombinant Snail Sialic Acid Aldolase is Promiscuous towards Aliphatic Aldehydes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldolases reversibly catalyze the cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. A recombinant snail sialic acid aldolase (sNPL) differs significantly in its carbohydrate substrate promiscuity from other sialic aldolases described so far. In addition, sNPL was able to synthesize a series of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxoates using the corresponding aliphatic aldehyde substrates.







Abstract
Aldolases are enzymes that reversibly catalyze the cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Here we describe a recombinant sialic acid aldolase originating from the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata (sNPL), and compare its substrate spectrum with a sialic acid aldolase originating from chicken (chNPL). In contrast to vertebrate animals which can synthesize, degrade, and incorporate sialic acids on glycoconjugate ubiquitously, snails (as all mollusks) cannot synthesize sialic acids endogenously, and therefore the biological function and substrate scope of sNPL ought to differ significantly from vertebrate sialic aldolases such as chNPL. sNPL was active towards a series of sialic acid derivatives but was in contrast to chNPL unable to catalyze the cleavage of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid into N&#8208;acetylmannosamine and pyruvate. Interestingly, chNPL and sNPL showed contrasting C4(R)/(S) diastereoselectivity towards the substrates d&#8208;mannose and d&#8208;galactose in the presence of pyruvate. In addition, sNPL was able to synthesize a series of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxoates using the corresponding aliphatic aldehyde substrates in the presence of pyruvate, which could be not achieved by chNPL.

         <title>The Dynamic Range of Acidity: Tracking Rules for the Unidirectional Penetration of Cellular Compartments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal tracking rules for cationic fluorescent membrane tension probes are obtained around the edge of their dynamic range of acidity, focusing on early endosomes in comparison to late endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, and on practical relevance to image the mechanics at the very beginning of endocytosis.







Abstract
Labeled ammonium cations with pKa&#8764;7.4 accumulate in acidic organelles because they can be neutralized transiently to cross the membrane at cytosolic pH&#8197;7.2 but not at their internal pH&lt;5.5. Retention in early endosomes with less acidic internal pH was achieved recently using weaker acids of up to pKa 9.8. We report here that primary ammonium cations with higher pKa 10.6, label early endosomes more efficiently. This maximized early endosome tracking coincides with increasing labeling of Golgi networks with similarly weak internal acidity. Guanidinium cations with pKa 13.5 cannot cross the plasma membrane in monomeric form and label the plasma membrane with selectivity for vesicles embarking into endocytosis. Self&#8208;assembled into micelles, guanidinium cations enter cells like arginine&#8208;rich cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and, driven by their membrane potential, penetrate mitochondria unidirectionally despite their high inner pH. The resulting tracking rules with an approximated dynamic range of pKa change &#8764;3.5 are expected to be generally valid, thus enabling the design of chemistry tools for biology research in the broadest sense. From a practical point of view, most relevant are two complementary fluorescent flipper probes that can be used to image the mechanics at the very beginning of endocytosis.

         <title>Identification of Genes Essential for Sulfamate and Fluorine Incorporation During Nucleocidin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleocidin is an adenosine analogue containing rare fluorinated and sulfamated moieties from unknown biosynthetic origins. Using gene disruption, we have identified three genes essential for sulfamation, and three for sulfamation and fluorination. Additionally, two new acetylated nucleocidin derivatives were also discovered.







Abstract
Nucleocidin is an adenosine derivative containing 4&#8217;&#8208;fluoro and 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl substituents. In this study, nucleocidin biosynthesis is examined in two newly discovered producers, Streptomyces virens B&#8208;24331 and Streptomyces aureorectus B&#8208;24301, which produce nucleocidin and related derivatives at titers 30&#8208;fold greater than S. calvus. This enabled the identification of two new O&#8208;acetylated nucleocidin derivatives, and a potential glycosyl&#8208;O&#8208;acetyltransferase. Disruption of nucJ, nucG, and nucI, within S. virens B&#8208;24331, specifying a radical SAM/Fe&#8722;S dependent enzyme, sulfatase, and arylsulfatase, respectively, led to loss of 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl biosynthesis, but not fluoronucleoside production. Disruption of nucN, nucK, and nucO specifying an amidinotransferase, and two sulfotransferases respectively, led to loss of fluoronucleoside production. Identification of S. virens B&#8208;24331 as a genetically tractable and high producing strain sets the stage for understanding nucleocidin biosynthesis and highlights the utility of using 16S&#8208;RNA sequences to identify alternative producers of valuable compounds in the absence of genome sequence data.

         <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effects on the Mechanistic Pathways for Dioxygen Activation by a Ferritin: Involvement of a Tyr Radical and the Identification of a Cation Binding Site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional calculations on ferritin implicate novel features in the catalytic cycle for H2O2 synthesis from dioxygen on a diiron center including a cation&#8208;binding site held by Glu62 and Asp65. The reaction is stepwise with the involvement of an active site Tyr residue that delivers a hydrogen atom through proton&#8208;coupled&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer.







Abstract
Ferritins are ubiquitous diiron enzymes involved in iron(II) detoxification and oxidative stress responses and can act as metabolic iron stores. The overall reaction mechanisms of ferritin enzymes are still unclear, particularly concerning the role of the conserved, near catalytic center Tyr residue. Thus, we carried out a computational study of a ferritin using a large cluster model of well over 300 atoms including its first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination sphere. The calculations reveal important insight into the structure and reactivity of ferritins. Specifically, the active site Tyr residue delivers a proton and electron in the catalytic cycle prior to iron(II) oxidation. In addition, the calculations highlight a likely cation binding site at Asp65, which through long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions, influences the electronic configuration and charge distributions of the metal center. The results are consistent with experimental observations but reveal novel detail of early mechanistic steps that lead to an unusual mixed&#8208;valent iron(III)&#8208;iron(II) center.

         <title>Hybrid Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of C7&#8208;Sugars for Molecular Evidence of in&#8197;vivo Shikimate Pathway Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;sedoheptulose is a cyanobacterial antimetabolite of the 3&#8208;dehydroquinate synthase, second enzyme of the shikimate pathway. Design of a hybrid synthesis of chemical and chemoenzymatic steps using heterologously expressed transketolase efficiently yielded the heptulose family. In vivo and in&#8197;vitro studies on Anabaena variabilis and Arabidopsis thaliana gave a profound understanding of the mode of action.







Abstract
The design of distinctive chemical synthesis strategies aims for the most efficient routes towards versatile compounds in drug target studies. Here, we establish a powerful hybrid synthetic approach of total chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis to efficiently obtain various 7&#8208;deoxy&#8208;sedoheptulose (7dSh, 1) analogues, unique C7 sugars, for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. 7dSh (1) is a rare microbial sugar with in planta herbicidal activity. As natural antimetabolite of 3&#8208;dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS), 7dSh (1) inhibits the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria, fungi, and plants, but absent in mammals. As glyphosate, the most used chemical herbicide faces restrictions worldwide, DHQS has gained more attention as valid target of herbicides and antimicrobial agents. In vitro and in&#8197;vivo analyses of the C7&#8208;deoxysugars confirm DHQS as enzymatic target, highlight the crucial role of uptake for inhibition and add molecular aspects to target mechanism studies of C7&#8208;sugars as our contribution to global efforts for alternative weed&#8208;control strategies.

         <title>Synthetic Activity of Recombinant Whole Cell Biocatalysts Containing 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate Aldolase from Pectobacterium atrosepticum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using whole cells of E. coli BL21 (PaDERA C&#8208;His AA C49M) as biocatalyst, a 99% yield of both 2&#8208;deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate and 2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hexapyranose was obtained. Furthermore, this enzyme is capable of tolerating up to 500 mM acetaldehyde in a whole&#8208;cell experiment, making it suitable for industrial applications.







Abstract
In nature 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) catalyses the reversible formation of 2&#8208;deoxyribose 5&#8208;phosphate from D&#8208;glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate and acetaldehyde. In addition, this enzyme can use acetaldehyde as the sole substrate, resulting in a tandem aldol reaction, yielding 2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hexapyranose, which spontaneously cyclizes. This reaction is very useful for the synthesis of the side chain of statin&#8208;type drugs used to decrease cholesterol levels in blood.

Under optimized conditions, E.&#8201;coli BL21 (PaDERA C&#8208;His AA C49M) whole cells yields 99&#8201;% of both products. Furthermore, this enzyme is able to tolerate 500&#8197;mM acetaldehyde in a whole&#8208;cell experiment which makes it suitable for industrial applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature 2-deoxy-D-ribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) catalyses the reversible formation of 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate from D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and acetaldehyde. In addition, this enzyme can use acetaldehyde as the sole substrate, resulting in a tandem aldol reaction, yielding 2,4,6-trideoxy-D-erythro-hexapyranose, which spontaneously cyclizes. This reaction is very useful for the synthesis of the side chain of statin-type drugs used to decrease cholesterol levels in blood. One of the main challenges in the use of DERA in industrial processes, where high substrate loads are needed to achieve the desired productivity, is its inactivation by high acetaldehyde concentration.

         <title>Assessment of Bioactivity&#8208;Modulating Pseudo&#8208;Ring Formation in Psilocin and Related Tryptamines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Psychedelic pharmacology: Psilocin is a powerful psychoactive tryptamine and candidate medication against therapy&#8208;resistant depression. We demonstrate a pseudo&#8208;ring structure in psilocin via an intramolecular hydrogen bond that masks this molecule's polar groups. This feature is a key prerequisite of psilocin's ability to cross the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier and cause intensely colored visuals and other perceptual and psychedelic effects.







Abstract
Psilocybin (1) is the major alkaloid found in psychedelic mushrooms and acts as a prodrug to psilocin (2, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine), a potent psychedelic that exerts remarkable alteration of human consciousness. In contrast, the positional isomer bufotenin (7, 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine) differs significantly in its reported pharmacology. A series of experiments was designed to explore chemical differences between 2 and 7 and specifically to test the hypothesis that the C&#8208;4 hydroxy group of 2 significantly influences the observed physical and chemical properties through pseudo&#8208;ring formation via an intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB). NMR spectroscopy, accompanied by quantum chemical calculations, was employed to compare hydrogen bond behavior in 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxylated tryptamines. The results provide evidence for a pseudo&#8208;ring in 2 and that sidechain/hydroxyl interactions in 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamines influence their oxidation kinetics. We conclude that the propensity to form IMHBs leads to a higher number of uncharged species that easily cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier, compared to 7 and other 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamines, which cannot form IMHBs. Our work helps understand a fundamental aspect of the pharmacology of 2 and should support efforts to introduce it (via the prodrug 1) as an urgently needed therapeutic against major depressive disorder.

         <title>Click Bioconjugation: Modifying Proteins Using Click&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioconjugation deals with the chemical modification of proteins. For the establishment of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and other bioconjugates, many click&#8208;type reactions have been applied, providing novel drugs that have entered clinical phases and also the market over recent years. Recent developments to broaden the chemical toolbox to meet the challenge of selective, bioorthogonal modification of biomolecules are showcasing new ways to apply novel click chemistry in the bioconjugation context.







Abstract
Bioconjugation deals with the chemical modification of proteins. The reactions used exploit either the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the biomolecule or introduce functionalities that can then be subsequently reacted without interfering with other functional groups of the biological entity. Perfectly selective, high yielding chemical transformations are needed that can be run in aqueous environment under mild pH conditions. Requirements that have an obvious overlap with the definition of click chemistry. This review shows a selection of successfully applied click&#8208;type reactions in bioconjugation as well as some recent developments to broaden the chemical toolbox to meet the challenge of selective, bioorthogonal modification of biomolecules.

         <title>Synthesis of 6,6&#8208; and 7,7&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;1&#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidines and Their Oxidation Catalyzed by the Nonheme Fe Oxygenase LolO</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two difluorinated analogues of 1&#8208;exo&#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidine (AcAP), an intermediate in loline alkaloid biosynthesis, were prepared and subjected to LolO, the enzyme that naturally hydroxylates and cycloetherifies AcAP. LolO (2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent nonheme Fe oxygenase) hydroxylates and cycloetherifies 6,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP, but it only hydroxylates 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP. The resulting 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP may be useful for studying the LolO&#8208;catalyzed cycloetherification of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP.







Abstract
LolO, a 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent nonheme Fe oxygenase, catalyzes both the hydroxylation of 1&#8208;exo&#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidine (AcAP), a pathway intermediate in the biosynthesis of the loline alkaloids, and the cycloetherification of the resulting alcohol. We have prepared fluorinated AcAP analogues to aid in continued mechanistic investigation of the remarkable LolO&#8208;catalyzed cycloetherification step. LolO was able to hydroxylate 6,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP (prepared from N,O&#8208;protected 4&#8208;oxoproline) and then cycloetherify the resulting alcohol, forming a difluorinated analogue of N&#8208;acetylnorloline and providing evidence for a cycloetherification mechanism involving a C(7) radical as opposed to a C(7) carbocation. By contrast, LolO was able to hydroxylate 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP (prepared from 3&#8208;oxoproline) but failed to cycloetherify it, forming (1R,2R,8S)&#8208;7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP as the sole product. The divergent LolO&#8208;catalyzed reactions of the difluorinated AcAP analogues provide insight into the LolO cycloetherification mechanism and indicate that the 7,7&#8208;difluorinated compound, in particular, may be a useful tool to accumulate and characterize the iron intermediate that initiates the cycloetherification reaction.

         <title>Tetraphenylporphyrin Enters the Ring: First Example of a Complex between Highly Bulky Porphyrins and a Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallotetraphenylporphyrins (metalloTPPs) are exceedingly hydrophobic, rendering them insoluble in aqueous solvents. Upon introduction of the bacterial haem&#8208;acquisition protein, HasA, which can incorporate bulky metalloTPPs in its haem&#8208;binding pocket, a stable, water&#8208;soluble HasA&#8211;TPP complex can be formed. This permits the utilisation of metalloTPPs, in the form of a HasA&#8211;TPP complex, with biological systems, as antimicrobial agents targeting the critical pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa or as biocatalysts. The picture was created by Yuma Shisaka and Mami Yoshimura. More information can be found in the Research Article by O. Shoji et&#8197;al.

DNA&#8208;enabled nanorobotics: DNA nanotechnology advances the development of the rational design of DNA nanorobots capable of executing programmable functions. Integrating the sensory, controller, and actuation modules, distinct types of designer DNA nanorobots can automatically perform various mechanical motions (one&#8208;step, multi&#8208;step, or continuously stepping) in response to certain stimuli, realizing versatile functionalities in accurate biosensing, targeted drug delivery, even autonomous operations to trigger desired cellular behavior.







Abstract
The advent of DNA nanotechnology has paved the way for the development of nanoscale robotics capable of executing smart and sophisticated tasks in a programmed and automatic manner. The programmability and customizable functionality of designer DNA nanorobots interfacing with biology would offer great potential for basic and applied research in the interdisciplinary fields of chemistry, biology, and medicine. This review aims to summarize the latest progress in designer DNA nanorobotics enabling programmable functions. We first describe the state&#8208;of&#8208;art engineering principles and the functional modules used in the rational design of a dynamic DNA nanorobot. Subsequently, we summarize the distinct types of DNA nanorobots performing sensing tasks, sensing&#8208;and&#8208;actuation, or continuous actuation, highlighting the versatility of designer DNA nanorobots in accurate biosensing, targeted drug delivery, and autonomous molecular operations to promote desired cellular behavior. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the development of functional DNA nanorobotics for biomedical applications. We envision that significant progress in DNA&#8208;enabled nanorobotics with programmable functions will improve precision medicine in the future.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Recognition Involved in the Intermodular Transacylation Reaction in Modular Polyketide Synthase in the Biosynthesis of Vicenistatin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protein&#8208;protein recognition between ketosynthase (KS) and the upstream module acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain in modular polyketide synthases is important for maintaining polyketide biosynthetic fidelity. In vicenistatin biosynthesis, the VinP2 module 4 KS domain could distinguish the cognate VinP1 module 3 ACP domain from other ACPs in addition to docking domain&#8208;based interactions during intermodular transacylation.







Abstract
The ketosynthase (KS) domain is a core domain found in modular polyketide synthases (PKSs). To maintain the polyketide biosynthetic fidelity, the KS domain must only accept an acyl group from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain of the immediate upstream module even when they are separated into different polypeptides. Although it was reported that both the docking domain&#8208;based interactions and KS&#8208;ACP compatibility are important for the interpolypeptide transacylation reaction in 6&#8208;deoxyerythronolide B synthase, it is not clear whether these findings are broadly applied to other modular PKSs. Herein, we describe the importance of protein&#8208;protein recognition in the intermodular transacylation between VinP1 module 3 and VinP2 module 4 in vicenistatin biosynthesis. We compared the transacylation activity and crosslinking efficiency of VinP2 KS4 against the cognate VinP1 ACP3 with the noncognate one. As a result, it appeared that VinP2 KS4 distinguishes the cognate ACP3 from other ACPs.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This cover image is composed of a Tai Chi symbol containing the two significant small molecules H2S and HNO, which are simultaneously produced by the donor molecule contained in the center. H2S and HNO operate within a complex scheme of interdependencies that are not fully understood. Exploration of these interactions termed &#8216;crosstalk&#8217; are one application of this work. H2S and HNO are small gaseous molecules which are highly mobile, so they are shown speeding away from the donor. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Xian et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthetic Supramolecular Host for D&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Ribose: Ratiometric Fluorescence Response via Multivalent Lectin&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive as well as pH&#8208;sensitive fluorescent nanoaggregates, composed of carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles, showed changes in fluorescence signal from greenish yellow to cyan, specifically in the presence of D&#8208;ribose. The mechanistic studies indicate dissociation of the preformed molecular assembly in the presence of ribose, probably due to multipoint hydrogen bonding as well as CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions involving the acyl hydrazone units and pyridyl residues.







Abstract
Easily synthesizable, carbazole&#8208;based organic nanoaggregates have been designed for selective detection of D&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;ribose at physiological pH. The addition of D&#8208;ribose results in a ratiometric change in fluorescence color from green to cyan (LOD: &#8764;12&#8197;&#956;M). The mechanistic studies indicate the presence of multipoint noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between D&#8208;ribose and acyl hydrazone and terminal pyridyl units of the probe molecule. However, such multipoint interactions dissociate the preformed self&#8208;assembled nanoclusters and induce change in optical response. The probe molecule was further exploited in analyzing D&#8208;ribose content in biological fluids (diluted human urine and blood serum) and oral supplements. The small standard deviation values (2&#8211;3.8&#8201;%) with nearly quantitative recovery (93.5&#8211;105.5&#8201;%) indicate the high accuracy of the presented method. Further, low&#8208;cost portable device based coated paper strips were designed for &#8216;on&#8208;location&#8217; rapid, detection of D&#8208;ribose even at remote locations.

         <title>Antibody&#8208;Recruitment as a Therapeutic Strategy: A Brief History and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibody recruitment to the surface of pathogens or malignant cells can lead to selective clearance or destruction of these unwanted guests by various immune system&#8208;dependent mechanisms. Small molecule, peptide, protein, and polymer&#8208;based antibody&#8208;recruiting technologies have been reported and represent an exciting therapeutic approach. Here, we review seminal and recent contributions to this drug discovery approach.







Abstract
Antibodies are a significant and growing sector within the global pharmaceutical industry. The popularity of antibodies as therapeutics derives from &#8211; at least in part &#8211; evolvable affinity for virtually any disease&#8208;relevant cell surface receptor, as well as unique immunotherapeutic mechanisms of action, including neutralization, antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). While advances in the large&#8208;scale expression and purification of therapeutic antibodies have been made, these remain costly and laborious tasks. Agents that redirect endogenous antibodies to target a pathogen or malignant cell obviate the need for new antibody discovery and production. Chimeric antibody&#8208;recruiting technologies consist of a target cell surface receptor binding domain, and an endogenous antibody&#8208;binding domain. By design, these agents bring endogenous antibodies to the surface of a target pathogen or diseased cell, which can result in targeted cytotoxicity by antibody&#8208;dependent mechanisms. This review highlights seminal contributions and recent advances in this growing and important therapeutic field.

         <title>Combination of Immunotherapy and Photo&#8208;pyroptosis as Novel Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyroptosis is programmed cell death, and can significantly improve the immunogenicity of tumors and enhance the effect of anticancer drugs. Designing pyroptosis&#8208;inducing photosensitizers open a novel anticancer strategy. Photodynamic immunotherapy provides a new way to fight against cancer.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has made great progress in clinical cancer treatment in recent years, but its therapeutic efficacy is significantly limited by the lack of immunogenicity in the tumor microenvironment. Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death in which the dying cancer cells produce inflammatory cytokines to relieve the immuno&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and thus increase anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during photodynamic therapy (PDT) are one of the efficient activators that induce pyroptosis. Recently, a few photosensitizers have emerged with the ability to induce immunogenic cancer cell death via pyroptosis, opening a new field for PDT. This highlight introduces the latest research on antitumor strategies achieved by the combination of immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy through photo&#8208;pyroptosis.

         <title>N4&#8208;Allyldeoxycytidine: A New DNA Tag with Chemical Sequencing Power for Pinpointing Labelling Sites, Mapping Epigenetic Markers, and In Situ Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N4&#8208;allyldeoxycytidine (a4dC) can be encoded into DNA as regular deoxycytidine and decoded as mutant bases upon chemical sequencing. We explored the applications of the a4dC tag the in identification of DNA labelling sites, mapping epigenetic DNA marker N4&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine, and fixing and imaging of DNA in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
DNA tagging with base analogues has found numerous applications. To precisely record the DNA labelling information, it would be highly beneficial to develop chemical sequencing tags that can be encoded into DNA as regular bases and decoded as mutant bases following a mild, efficient and bioorthogonal chemical treatment. Here we reported such a DNA tag, N4&#8208;allyldeoxycytidine (a4dC), for labeling and identifying DNA by in&#8197;vitro assays. The iodination of a4dC led to fast and complete formation of 3, N4&#8208;cyclized deoxycytidine, which induced base misincorporation during DNA replication and thus could be located at single base resolution. We explored the applications of a4dC in pinpointing DNA labelling sites at single base resolution, mapping epigenetic marker N4&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine, and imaging nucleic acids in&#8197;situ. In addition, mammalian cellular DNA could be metabolically labelled with a4dC. Our study sheds light on the design of next generation DNA tags with chemical sequencing power.

         <title>Photoaffinity Labeling&#8208;Based Chemoproteomic Strategy Reveals RBBP4 as a Cellular Target of Protopanaxadiol against Colorectal Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCT116 cells were treated with the cell permeable probe AD&#8208;PPD, and irradiated with UV in&#8197;situ. Labelled proteomes were further conjugated to biotin&#8208;PEG3&#8208;azide via click chemistry, and the target of protopanaxadiol (PPD) was identified as RBBP4 by LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis.







Abstract
Protopanaxadiol (PPD), a main ginseng metabolite, exerts powerful anticancer effects against multiple types of cancer; however, its cellular targets remain elusive. Here, we synthesized a cell&#8208;permeable PPD probe via introducing a bifunctional alkyne&#8208;containing diazirine photo&#8208;crosslinker and performed a photoaffinity labeling&#8208;based chemoproteomic study. We identified retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4), a chromatin remodeling factor, as an essential cellular target of PPD in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. PPD significantly decreased RBBP4&#8208;dependent trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a crucial epigenetic marker that correlates with histologic signs of colorectal cancer aggressiveness, and PPD inhibition of proliferation and migration of HCT116 cells was antagonized by RBBP4 RNA silencing. Collectively, our study highlights a previously undisclosed anti&#8208;colorectal cancer cellular target of the ginseng metabolite and advances the fundamental understanding of RBBP4 functions via a chemical biology strategy.

         <title>Chemical Modifications for a Next Generation of Nucleic Acid Aptamers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cubane aptamer (cubamer) is a chemically modified nucleic acid aptamer incorporating cubane moieties into the nucleotide bases. The Figure shows a cubamer in complex with the malaria biomarker Plasmodium vivax lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH), with high specificity relative to Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH). Such specificity has not been possible with conventional DNA aptamers. This example demonstrates the enhanced functionality of modified aptamers. Herein, we review the chemistry, synthesis, selection, and application of such modified aptamers.







Abstract
In the past three decades, in&#8197;vitro systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has yielded many aptamers for translational applications in both research and clinical settings. Despite their promise as an alternative to antibodies, the low success rate of SELEX (&#8764;30&#8201;%) has been a major bottleneck that hampers the further development of aptamers. One hurdle is the lack of chemical diversity in nucleic acids. To address this, the aptamer chemical repertoire has been extended by introducing exotic chemical groups, which provide novel binding functionalities. This review will focus on how modified aptamers can be selected and evolved, with illustration of some successful examples. In particular, unique chemistries are exemplified. Various strategies of incorporating modified building blocks into the standard SELEX protocol are highlighted, with a comparison of the differences between pre&#8208;SELEX and post&#8208;SELEX modifications. Nucleic acid aptamers with extended functionality evolved from non&#8208;natural chemistries will open up new vistas for function and application of nucleic acids.

         <title>Making Enzymes Suitable for Organic Chemistry by Rational Protein Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of enzymes did not attract the attention of organic chemists until the control of stereoselectivity was successfully achieved 25&#8197;years ago. Traditionally, semi&#8208;rational directed evolution based on focused saturation mutagenesis at sites lining the binding pocket and rational enzyme design were considered to be two different approaches, especially when evolving stereoselectivity. However, because the former has become more and more rational, the two approaches have merged with the development of focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM).







Abstract
This review outlines recent developments in protein engineering of stereo&#8208; and regioselective enzymes, which are of prime interest in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry as well as biotechnology. The widespread application of enzymes was hampered for decades due to limited enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity, which was the reason why most organic chemists were not interested in biocatalysis. This attitude began to change with the advent of semi&#8208;rational directed evolution methods based on focused saturation mutagenesis at sites lining the binding pocket. Screening constitutes the labor&#8208;intensive step (bottleneck), which is the reason why various research groups are continuing to develop techniques for the generation of small and smart mutant libraries. Rational enzyme design, traditionally an alternative to directed evolution, provides small collections of mutants which require minimal screening. This approach first focused on thermostabilization, and did not enter the field of stereoselectivity until later. Computational guides such as the Rosetta algorithms, HotSpot Wizard metric, and machine learning (ML) contribute significantly to decision making. The newest advancements show that semi&#8208;rational directed evolution such as CAST/ISM and rational enzyme design no longer develop on separate tracks, instead, they have started to merge. Indeed, researchers utilizing the two approaches have learned from each other. Today, the toolbox of organic chemists includes enzymes, primarily because the possibility of controlling stereoselectivity by protein engineering has ensured reliability when facing synthetic challenges. This review was also written with the hope that undergraduate and graduate education will include enzymes more so than in the past.

&lt;p&gt;This review outlines recent developments in protein engineering of stereo- and regioselective enzymes, which are of prime interest in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry as well as biotechnology. The widespread application of enzymes was hampered for decades due to limited enantio-, diastereo- and regioselectivity, which was the reason why most organic chemists were not interested in biocatalysis. This attitude began to change with the advent of semi-rational directed evolution methods based on focused saturation mutagenesis at sites lining the binding pocket. Screening constitutes the labor-intensive step (bottleneck), which is the reason why various research groups are continuing to develop techniques for the generation of small and smart mutant libraries. Rational enzyme design, traditionally an alternative to directed evolution, provides small collections of mutants which require minimal screening. This approach first focused on thermostabilization, and did not enter the field of stereoselectivity until later. Computational guides such as the Rosetta algorithms, HotSpot Wizard metric, and machine learning (ML) contribute significantly to decision making. The newest advancements show that semi-rational directed evolution such as CAST/ISM and rational enzyme design no longer develop on separate tracks, instead, they have started to merge. Indeed, researchers utilizing the two approaches have learned from each other. Today, the toolbox of organic chemists includes enzymes, primarily because the possibility of controlling stereoselectivity by protein engineering has ensured reliability when facing synthetic challenges. This review was also written with the hope that undergraduate and graduate education will include enzymes more so than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Enantiomeric Fragment Pair (EFP) Approach for the Study of Cellular Uptake of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the cellular uptake of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides poses many challenges derived from the aggregation&#8208;prone nature of the system. We developed an enantiomeric fragment pair (EFP) approach to facilitate the study of the interactions with the cellular environment. The generated fragments are short and soluble, yet retain the biological activity of the full&#8208;length protein. This method allows aggregation&#8208;dependent mechanisms to be discerned from aggregation&#8208;independent mechanisms, and applies stereo&#8208;differentiation as a tool for the identification of receptors involved in cellular uptake of amyloids.







Abstract
The study of intrinsically disordered and amyloidogenic proteins poses a major challenge to researchers due to the propensity of the system to aggregate and to form amyloid fibrils and deposits. This intrinsic nature limits the way amyloids can be studied and increases the level of complexity of the techniques needed to study the system of interest. Recent reports suggest that cellular recognition and internalization of pre&#8208;fibrillary species of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins may initiate some of its toxic actions. Therefore, developing novels tools to facilitate the understanding and determination of the interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and the cellular membrane is becoming increasingly valuable. Here, we present and propose an approach for the study of the interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins with the cellular surface based on the use of enantiomeric fragment pairs (EFPs). By following a stepwise methodology in which the amyloidogenic peptide or protein is fragmented into specific segments, we show how this approach can be exploited to differentiate between different types of cellular uptake, to determine the degree of receptor&#8208;mediated cellular internalization of intrinsically disordered peptides and proteins, and to pinpoint the specific regions within the amino acid sequence responsible for the cellular recognition. Adopting this approach overcomes aggregation&#8208;related challenges and offers a particularly well&#8208;suited platform for the elucidation of receptor&#8208;intermediated recognition, uptake, and toxicity.

         <title>Omicron: Understanding the Latest Variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8201;and Strategies for Tackling the Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Omicron variant can be calssified as BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. Due to mutations in genes encoding its S protein and other parts of the virus, concerns have been raised regarding the effectiveness of existing vaccines and diagnostic tools to fight against Omicron infection.







Abstract
The new variant of concern of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, namely Omicron, has triggered global fear recently. To date, our knowledge of Omicron, particularly of how S glycoprotein mutations affect the infectivity of the virus and the severity of the infection, is far from complete. This hinders our ability to treat the disease and to predict the future state of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 threats to well&#8208;being and economic stability. Despite this, efforts have been made to unveil the routes of transmission and the efficiency of existing vaccines in tackling Omicron. This article reviews the latest understanding of Omicron and the current status of the use of vaccines and drugs for infection control. It is hoped that this article can offer insights into the development of more effective measures to tackle the pandemic.
