         <title>Practical Tips for Intentional and Inclusive Recruiting and Hiring for Academic Research Laboratories</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hiring is one of the most crucial decisions made in a lab group. Herein, straightforward, practical, actionable advice is provided for a more equitable and inclusive approach to hiring. These tips should be impactful for new labs looking to establish their hiring processes, as well as for established labs who want to improve their processes.

Hiring decisions are some of the most important choices PIs make for their research groups. Whether it is undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, or other research assistants, trainees are pivotal for the success of a research group. Choosing an effective team can lead to synergy amongst researchers, high creativity, and groundbreaking science. Choosing an ineffective team can lead to infighting, toxicity, low morale, and scientific stagnation. These same hiring decisions are critical in creating an equitable and inclusive lab environment. Importantly, the challenges for creating productive and inclusive lab groups align: both can be achieved by 1) advertising broadly to ensure a high number of qualified potential researchers apply and 2) removing unconscious selection bias in the hiring process such that these highly qualified researchers are hired. Intentionally and deliberately incorporating these steps into the recruiting and selection processes aids in the recruitment of a more effective and inclusive research team. Herein, practical advice for recruiting for academic research labs are described. We focus on three areas: advertising your research positions, assessing candidates for research positions, and assessing your hiring practices. In each, we give guiding principles and practical tips for designing an equitable and inclusive hiring process .

         <title>Multifaceted Effects of a Multiple Nitric Oxide Photoreleaser and its Photoproducts on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light&#8208;activatable NO photodonor sequentially releases two NO molecules accompanied by two stable photoproducts, showing differentiated effects on the &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation.

Aberrant aggregation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides into insoluble fibrils is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the post&#8208;translational modifications influencing A&#946; behavior, nitration and nitrosation by nitric oxide (NO) derivatives play a key role, though their impact on aggregation and toxicity remains unclear. This contribution explores the effects on A&#946; aggregation induced by an NO photodonor (NOPD) releasing two NO molecules via a stepwise mechanism under the control of visible blue light. Significant reduction of protein aggregation is observed when a considerable amount NO (&#8776;120&#8201;&#181;M) is photoreleased during the early stages of the protein aggregation. In contrast, long&#8208;term release of a similar NO concentration is ineffective. On the other hand, proaggregative effect is induced by the NOPD kept in the dark. The stable photoproducts formed after the release of the first and the second molecule of NO also show a protein aggregation inhibitory effect both individually and in combination. Dynamic simulation studies are also reported to shed light on the binding of NOPD and its photoproducts with key A&#946;1&#8211;40 residues.

         <title>Dynamic Anchoring of Peptides to the Extracellular Matrix Enabled by Boronic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides are developed for reversible binding to sugar&#8208;rich structures (glycans) in cell&#8208;derived extracellular matrix models using boronic acid chemistry. By attaching a carboxy&#8208;phenyl&#8208;boronic acid group to the N&#8208;terminus of peptides, a modified myostatin inhibitor is synthesized that retaines biological activity comparable to standard inhibitors. This modification may improve how these peptides interact with tissues, offering potential benefits for drug delivery in future pharmacological studies.

Given the extracellular matrix (ECM) essential role in tissue development, maintenance, and repair, exploiting its glycan structures offers new opportunities for dynamic drug storage and targeted delivery of peptides via injectable solutions. This study investigates the reversible, pH&#8211;driven interaction between boronic acid&#8208;functionalized compounds and diol&#8208;rich glycans within cell&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrices (CDMs). An N&#8208;terminally functionalized model peptide was produced using carboxy&#8208;phenyl&#8208;boronic acid (CPBA), and its pH&#8208;dependent binding to the diol&#8208;rich structures of CDMs was demonstrated. A CPBA&#8208;conjugated myostatin inhibitor maintained its full potency as a prerequisite for future therapeutic application. The findings suggest N&#8208;terminally boronic acid&#8208;modified peptides as drug candidates for targeted delivery and storage to diol&#8208;rich glycans of the natural ECM.

         <title>Immobilized Enzymes for ABO&#8208;Independent Blood Cell Transfusions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is developed to generate universal red blood cells and platelets using suitable glycosidases immobilized to polymethacrylate microparticles. This approach allows the efficient removal of the enzymes converting the A and B antigens before transfusion to avoid immune reactions and illustrates a promising method to counteract the demand for blood products.

The transfusion of blood products requires ABO compatibility due to A and B antigens on blood cells and their corresponding antibodies in plasma. The supply of red cell concentrates (RCCs) and platelet concentrates (PCs) is challenged by rising demand and declining numbers of donors. To counteract the supply limitations, a method is developed to generate universal RCCs and PCs. For this, the A antigen is enzymatically removed by two enzymes from Flavonifractor plautii working in concert and the B antigen is removed by galactosidases from Pedobacter panaciterrae (PpaGal_WT or the variant PpaGal_W260Y) and Akkermansia muciniphila (AmGH110A or AmGH110B). The glycosidases are immobilized on polymethacrylate microparticles and are removed by the 200&#8201;&#181;m filter of the mandatory transfusion set before the transfusion to avoid a possible immune reaction by the enzymes. B&#8208;positive red cells in RCCs are reduced below a 4% background signal within 48&#8201;h at 2&#8211;6&#8201;&#176;C. Pooled PCs showed a 34&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14% reduction in B&#8208;positive cells and a residual A&#8208;positive platelet population of 4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1% after 4&#8201;h of treatment at 20&#8211;24&#8201;&#176;C. This approach efficiently generates ABO&#8208;universal RCCs and PCs while preserving blood quality and reducing incompatibility risks.

         <title>Discovery and Tuning of RNA Editing Guides via High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Chemical Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput screening platform (EMERGe) uncovered a noncanonical GUG&#8208;centered loop that supports ADAR2&#8208;mediated RNA editing at otherwise refractory 5&#8242;GA sites. Through systematic structure&#8211;activity studies and motif&#8208;specific chemical optimization, a fully stabilized guide RNA was developed that retains activity in&#8201;vitro and in cells, establishing a pipeline for guide RNA discovery and design.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) catalyze the deamination of adenosine to inosine in double&#8208;stranded RNA. Because inosine is read as guanosine during translation, this process enables programmable A&#8208;to&#8208;G recoding at the transcript level. ADARs can be harnessed for therapeutic correction of pathogenic mutations through site&#8208;directed RNA editing with guide RNAs. To expand the design space of editing&#8208;enabling guides, we applied EMERGe, a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, to identify motifs targeting a premature termination codon in the MeCP2 transcript associated with Rett syndrome. This uncovered a guide RNA motif that supported efficient ADAR2&#8208;mediated editing in&#8201;vitro, featuring a 5&#8242;&#8208;GUG&#8208;3' sequence predicted to form an asymmetric loop. To enable therapeutic application, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies and chemical optimization were performed, yielding a fully modified guide RNA with 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl, 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro, and phosphorothioate linkages. This stabilized guide retained the activity of unmodified RNA and showed enhanced nuclease resistance. The optimized guide induces dose&#8208;dependent editing at two MECP2 loci in reporter assays in HEK293T cells, demonstrating that EMERGe&#8208;selected motifs can be rendered viable in cells through targeted chemical modification. These findings highlight the utility of EMERGe as a discovery platform and establish a pipeline for identifying and optimizing editing&#8208;enabling guide RNA features beyond traditional design rules.

Because inosine is read as guanosine during translation, this process enables programmable A-to-G recoding at the transcript level. ADARs can be harnessed for therapeutic correction of pathogenic mutations through site-directed RNA editing with guide RNAs. To expand the design space of editing-enabling guides, we applied EMERGe, a high-throughput screening platform, to identify motifs targeting a premature termination codon in the &lt;i&gt;MeCP2&lt;/i&gt; transcript associated with Rett syndrome. This uncovered a guide RNA motif that supported efficient ADAR2-mediated editing &lt;i&gt;in&#8201;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, featuring a 5&#8242;-GUG-3' sequence predicted to form an asymmetric loop. To enable therapeutic application, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies and chemical optimization were performed, yielding a fully modified guide RNA with 2&#8242;-O-methyl, 2&#8242;-fluoro, and phosphorothioate linkages. This stabilized guide retained the activity of unmodified RNA and showed enhanced nuclease resistance. The optimized guide induces dose-dependent editing at two MECP2 loci in reporter assays in HEK293T cells, demonstrating that EMERGe-selected motifs can be rendered viable in cells through targeted chemical modification. These findings highlight the utility of EMERGe as a discovery platform and establish a pipeline for identifying and optimizing editing-enabling guide RNA features beyond traditional design rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanoglycobiology: The Roles of Cell Surface Glycans in Mechanosensing and Mechanotransduction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycans in the cell glycocalyx play an important role in sensing and transducing biophysical cues, for example, mechanical forces applied to cells, to provoke cellular responses and mediate various physiological and pathological processes, which is the research subject of mechanoglycobiology and may have a wide range of biological and biomedical applications.

Mechanoglycobiology has emerged as a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field that involves chemistry, biology, and engineering. Despite the great advancements in this field, in&#8208;depth investigation of mechanoglycobiology remains challenging due to the complex nature of glycans and cell glycocalyx, as well as the difficulty to mechanically target these biomolecules. To address the issues, novel methods and models have been established to facilitate the investigation of glycan&#8208;mediated mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. Recently, a new, metabolic glycoengineering&#8208;based approach has been developed to selectively label cell surface glycans. This enables the application of molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry to exert targeted mechanical forces to understand how mechanical actuation of glycans influences cellular activities. This approach is applicable to different glycans and cell types and, therefore, can have a broad impact. The current perspective highlights how recent developments in mechanoglycobiology may improve the knowledge and appreciation of the significance of glycans in&#160;mechanotransduction as well as the potential applications of mechanoglycobiology in medicine.

         <title>Regulation of Gene Expression of Mouse D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover illustration shows the transcriptional regulation of the mouse D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) gene. Key TFs act on the core promoter to stimulate DAO expression, leading to D&#8208;serine metabolism and influencing neurotransmission. This reflects the study's discovery of conserved regulatory elements in DAO gene control.

D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) catalyzes oxidative deamination of D&#8208;amino acids, producing 2&#8208;oxo acids, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. In mammals, DAO is essential for metabolizing both endogenous and exogenous D&#8208;amino acids. Previous studies on human DAO identify two promoter regions (P1 and P2), a negative regulatory element in intron 1, and several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of mouse DAO gene expression is investigated to compare with the human system. To determine the promoter activity in the upstream region of the initiation site, plasmids containing mouse DAO gene fragments inserted into the pGL4 [luc2P/Hygro] vector and assessed luciferase activity in LLC&#8208;PK1 cells are constructed. A series of deletion constructs is analyzed, revealing promoter activity in all tested fragments. The highest promoter activity is detected in the &#8722;333/&#8722;87 subregion, with residual activities in the &#8722;87/&#8201;+&#8201;111 region. Bioinformatics analysis identifies TFs, including NEUR, EGRF, ZF07, ZF11, KLFS, SP1F, and ZF02, which bind to both the human and mouse DAO genes at conserved positions, suggesting their critical role in regulating DAO promoter activity.

         <title>Covalent Stabilization of Collagen Mimetic Triple Helices and Assemblies by Dopa Crosslinking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen mimetic peptides that fold into triple helices can be covalently stabilized through a lysine&#8208;levodopa crosslink. By varying the relative amino acid positions, the stabilization degree can be tuned. This approach effectively stabilizes both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric triple helices and higher&#8208;order, collagen&#8208;mimetic fibers.

Creating thermally stable collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) is a persistent challenge. Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagen's signature triple helical tertiary structure and higher&#8208;order assemblies. Herein, crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine can covalently stabilize the triple helix in CMPs is demonstrated. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, it is hypothesized that this reaction can be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This covalent capture strategy successfully stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC&#8208;type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine&#8208;Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation&#8211; &#960;$\pi$ pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self&#8208;assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, Dopa&#8211;Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37&#8201;&#176;$^\circ$C is demonstrated. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.

         <title>Design and Characterization of Prodrugged Anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Masking an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites is explored as a way of mitigating undesirable activity in nontarget tissues. This prodrugged antibody exhibits reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors, demonstrated high stability, and had an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model, potentially improving the pharmacokinetic profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.

Therapeutic antibodies are widely used to treat diseases like cancer and inflammatory conditions by binding with high specificity to their molecular targets. Masking is a strategy to mitigate undesirable activity in nontarget tissues, improving safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles by reducing target&#8208;mediated drug disposition. In this article, masking of an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites on the antibody is explored. While anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 immunotherapy benefits solid tumor treatment, its adverse events limit its utility. Multiple conjugation sites within the complementarity&#8208;determining regions and adjacent framework regions are evaluated to attenuate CTLA&#8208;4 binding. The optimal site for maximizing masking efficiency is identified, allowing for efficient bioconjugation and functional restoration upon exposure to a cleaving enzyme in the tumor microenvironment. The prodrugged antibody exhibits reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors, high stability, and an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model. This technology has the potential to improve the PK profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.

GA: Cross&#8208;linking of hyaluronic acid modified by a strained alkyne with a photosensitive crosslinker terminating in azides gives hydrogels with tuneable mechanical properties. By tuning the wavelength of employed light, the hydrogel can either be fully degraded allowing harvesting of cultured cells or softened resulting in notable changes in cell morphology.

Properties of semisynthetic hydrogels can be fine&#8208;tuned, making these attractive for various applications in regenerative medicine. Herein, a hydrogel platform based on hyaluronic acid (HA) modified by (1R, 8S,9S)&#8208;bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) and a cross&#8208;linker composed of light&#8208;sensitive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains terminating in azides is described. The two components can undergo strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition resulting in rapid gel formation. First, adipose&#8208;derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are incorporated in the hydrogel and it is demonstrated that the cells can be easily retrieved by UV light&#8208;mediated degradation, maintaining viability and retaining spindle&#8208;like shape when the cells are replated. Next, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of inducing light&#8208;mediated softening of the hydrogel to modulate the morphology of the encapsulated cells is provided. A co&#8208;culture of endothelial cells (cord blood&#8208;derived endothelial colony forming cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived MSCs), which is commonly studied for their ability to form capillary&#8208;like vascular networks, is cultured in the regular and light&#8208;induced softened hydrogels. Nonphotoexposed hydrogels show cells with a prevalently rounded morphology, whereas stretched cells connecting into a primitive capillary network are observed in the light&#8208;softened hydrogels. Photo&#8208;induced softening offers potential to locally control cell shape and self&#8208;organization capacity.

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Flexibility of GrsB Thioesterase Leads to the Structural Reassignment of a Gramicidin S Variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the substrate specificity of gramicidin S synthetase B&#8208;thioesterase reveals stereochemical flexibility, enabling the production of gramicidin S (GS) analogs with L&#8208; or D&#8208;Ser(Allyl). Structural reassignment of a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA) obtained from precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis is achieved using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and antimicrobial assays.

Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide derived from two pentapeptides. The C&#8208;terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of gramicidin S synthetase B (GrsB) dimerizes precursor pentapeptides and cyclizes the resulting linear decapeptide. Recently, a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA), in which a single D&#8208;Phe is replaced by L&#8208;Ser(Allyl), is reported via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis in a native GS producer. To understand how GrsB&#8208;TE processes such modified precursors, its substrate specificity using synthetic linear peptides is investigated. GrsB&#8208;TE cyclizes a substrate containing L&#8208;Ser(Allyl) at position 6 but not at position 1. However, the enzymatically synthesized GS&#8208;SA shows a different high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography retention time than that of the reported GS variant. Further structural and functional analyses, including 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, antimicrobial assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, reveal that the reported GS&#8208;SA contained D&#8208;Ser(Allyl) rather than L&#8208;Ser(Allyl). These findings reveal a previously unrecognized stereochemical flexibility in GrsB&#8208;TE and support the structural revision of the reported GS variant.

         <title>Enhancing Antigen Recognition of Living Cells by Site&#8208;Specific VHH Antibody Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of azido&#8208;phenylalanine (AzF) into antibodies enables precise conjugation, allowing anti&#8208;mCherry variable domains of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies (VHHs) to be aligned and immobilized on dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;coated glass via click chemistry. The mCherry&#8208;expressing HeLa cells adhered to the VHH&#8208;coated glass, whereas unmodified HeLa cells did not.

Biosensors and microdevices using living cells have gained significant attention in recent years, including methods for cell immobilization on antibody&#8208;coated surfaces. Random antibody fixation may lead to suboptimal exposure of recognition sites, reducing interaction efficiency. In contrast, aligned antibody immobilization enhances antigen recognition and binding capacity during cell immobilization. Site incorporation of azido&#8208;phenylalanine (AzF) into antibodies facilitates site&#8208;specific conjugation, enabling aligned antibody immobilization. In this study, we expressed and purified anti&#8208;mCherry variable domains of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies (VHHs), incorporating AzF at the C&#8208;terminus using an unnatural amino acid system to ensure its placement away from the antigen&#8208;binding site for mCherry. Anti&#8208;mCherry VHH&#8208;AzF was conjugated to dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;coated glass via click chemistry, followed by incubation with HeLa cells expressing mCherry on their surfaces (mCherry&#8208;coated cells). This resulted in increased immobilization of mCherry&#8208;coated cells on the VHH&#8208;coated glass, whereas normal HeLa cells did not adhere.

         <title>Interactions of Neurodegenerative Disease Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Probe Candidates with the C&#8208;Terminus of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Fibrils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding studies of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) fibril ligands using photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer show that the multiple system atrophy (MSA)&#8208;selective lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the &#945;S C&#8208;terminus, unlike Parkinson's disease (PD)&#8208;selective lead, M503. Thus, often&#8208;ignored interactions with the disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils may be important in the development of positron emission tomography imaging probes and other therapeutic small molecules for PD and MSA.

Fibrillar aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders, including multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Herein, the fibril interactions of two candidate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging ligands, M503 and HY&#8208;215, being developed for imaging of PD/DLB and MSA, respectively, are investigated. Photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry is used to determine the sites of their binding to in&#8201;vitro fibrils, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer with fluorescently labeled proteins is used to analyze conformational changes in the disordered &#945;S C&#8208;terminus. Taken together, these studies show that the MSA&#8208;selective PET lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the C&#8208;terminus, unlike the PD&#8208;selective lead M503. This study indicates that interactions with the often&#8208;ignored disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils should be considered in the development of PET probes and other therapeutic small molecules.

         <title>Improving the Gastric Resilience of Ferritin Nanocages by Fabrication with Gelatin for the Development of Oral Iron Supplements</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelatin fabrication improved the structural stability and iron retention capacity of frog M ferritins under simulated gastric conditions.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, particularly affecting children and women. The first&#8208;line treatment for IDA is oral iron supplementation, preferred for its cost&#8208;effectiveness and convenience of administration but is often accompanied by side effects like oxidative stress, infections, and low&#8208;solubility/precipitation. This study explores the use of ferritins&#8212;self&#8208;assembled nanocage proteins serving as soluble cellular&#8208;iron reservoirs&#8212;as a safer alternative for oral iron intervention. Ideal oral iron supplements must withstand gastric conditions, not trigger oxidative stress, and reach the absorption site intact. DNA protection assays and microbial growth studies demonstrate the antioxidative properties of ferritin, contrary to ferrous salts, underscoring its potential as a safer iron supplement. While ferritin shows commendable gastric tolerance, prolonged exposure can hamper its structural integrity/mineral retention. To further enhance its stability, ferritin is fabricated with gelatins, which preserved its structure/iron content under simulated gastric conditions. The combination of inherent antioxidant and controlled iron release properties of ferritin with gelatin's protective effect could help overcome the limitations of the commercial supplements. The findings of this study could pave the way for the development of "gelatin&#8208;coated iron&#8208;loaded ferritin"&#8208;based oral formulations as a safer option for IDA management.

Ideal oral iron supplements must withstand gastric conditions, not trigger oxidative stress, and reach the absorption site intact. DNA protection assays and microbial growth studies demonstrate the antioxidative properties of ferritin, contrary to ferrous salts, underscoring its potential as a safer iron supplement. While ferritin shows commendable gastric tolerance, prolonged exposure can hamper its structural integrity/mineral retention. To further enhance its stability, ferritin is fabricated with gelatins, which preserved its structure/iron content under simulated gastric conditions. The combination of inherent antioxidant and controlled iron release properties of ferritin with gelatin's protective effect could help overcome the limitations of the commercial supplements. The findings of this study could pave the way for the development of "gelatin-coated iron-loaded ferritin"-based oral formulations as a safer option for IDA management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>5&#8208;Thiohistidine N&#8208;Acetyltransferase from Proteiniphilum Saccharofermentans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans, a Gram&#8208;negative facultative anaerobe, produces an N&#8208;acetyl transferase (5THNAT) that acetylates 5&#8208;thiohistidine using acetyl&#8208;CoA. This reaction competes with OvoC&#8208;mediated N&#960;&#8208;methylation of the same substrate. The production ratio of ovothiol to N&#945;&#8208;acetyl 5&#8208;thiohistidine is likely regulated by the relative availability of SAM and acetyl&#8208;CoA.

Ovothiol A is a 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivative biosynthesized by a broad range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its redox&#8208;active mercaptoimidazole side chain is believed to protect cells from oxidative stress. The three enzymes that produce ovothiol A from histidine, cysteine, and S&#8208;adenosyl methionine have been identified and characterized. In contrast, no enzymes are known that produce other 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivatives. Here, a small family of acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A&#8208;dependent transferases is described that produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiohistidine. The discovery of these enzymes from Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans and related Bacteroidota provides evidence that the 5&#8208;thiohistidine class may be structurally and functionally more diverse than previously thought.

         <title>Internal Ubiquitin Electrophiles for Covalent Trapping and Inhibition of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>

GA: Genetically encoded internal electrophiles in ubiquitin (Ub) enable the profiling of multivalent interaction interfaces, addressing a key limitation of current Ub&#8208;based activity&#8208;based probes. In this study, these probes capture a Ub&#8211;deubiquitinase interaction with minimal structural perturbation and serve as selective diUb probes that covalently target the catalytic cysteines of Met1&#8208;specific Dubs. 

The ubiquitin (Ub) system governs vital cellular processes in eukaryotic biology through an intricate network of Ub&#8211;protein interactions. While semisynthetic C&#8208;terminal Ub electrophiles (UbEs) are widely used to study Ub transfer and deubiquitinase (Dub) activity, they are limited to probing the active site while leaving other functionally important sites unexplored. Building on previously identified multivalent interaction interfaces and potential allosteric sites which are key to understanding their dynamic nature, here we report the development of genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to covalently tether Ub&#8208;protein interactions in a proximity&#8208;driven manner at distal locations away from the active site. This study demonstrates that UbEs with internal electrophiles maintain conformational changes observed with their C&#8208;terminal counterparts while circumventing their limitations in capturing distal binding&#8208;site complexes, an emerging feature in Ub&#8208;mediated regulation. Genetically encoding these electrophiles further demonstrate rational variation as activity&#8208;based probes (ABP), leading to a Met1&#8208;diUb ABP showing preference for OTULIN over other Met1 cleaving Dubs. Taken together, our study introduces genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to explore the structural and biochemical significance of Ub&#8208;Dub interactions beyond the canonical S1 site, overcoming some limitations of traditional Ub C&#8208;terminal electrophiles.

         <title>Dominant&#8208;Negative Effects of p53 R337 Variants in Li&#8211;Fraumeni Syndrome: Impact on Tetramer Formation and Transcriptional Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;tetramer dysfunction: Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the TP53 gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53. It is shown that p53 variants R337C and R337H, found in LFS, impair wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function by forming heterotetramers with reduced transcriptional activity. This dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect may explain tissue&#8208;specific tumor susceptibility in LFS.

Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by heterozygous TP53 mutations. Among these, missense mutations at Arg337&#8212;such as R337C and R337H&#8212;are common in LFS patients. Although many studies have characterized individual p53 variants in LFS, the impact of tetramerization domain (TD) mutations on wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function remains unclear. Herein, a novel FRET&#8208;based assay system that enables the simultaneous detection of heterotetramer formation and p53&#8208;dependent transcriptional activity in live cells is developed. These results show that the heteromultimerization of the R337C variant with WT p53 is only slightly reduced compared to WT homotetramers, yet its transcriptional activity is diminished by over 50%. In contrast, the R337H variant forms heterotetramers at near&#8208;normal levels but exhibits markedly compromised transcriptional activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect, suggesting reduced p53 function is due not only to decreased tetramer formation but also to diminished heterotetramer stability. Moreover, the LFS&#8208;associated p53TD variants show a greater loss of activity against the low&#8208;affinity, apoptosis&#8208;inducing bax response element than against the high&#8208;affinity, cell cycle arrest&#8208;related CDKN1A response element. Collectively, this study demonstrates that p53TD mutations can exert dominant&#8208;negative effects, advancing the understanding of p53 heteromultimer function in LFS pathogenesis. These mechanistic insights into p53 heterotetramer stability may not only inform genetic screening strategies for LFS but also support future therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring p53 function by stabilizing mutant tetramers.

Bioactivity Profiles of Progressively Ring&#8208;Fluorinated Cyclohexyl Motifs in the WKYMVm Peptide as Formylpeptide FPR2 Agonists and in Keto&#8208;Piperazines as Antitrypanosome Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;cis&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs with progressively increasing levels of fluorine are introduced into the WKYMVm peptide and a class of keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives and assayed against the FPR2 receptor or the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. Increasing fluorination, reduced Log P's, however it generally results in poorer bioactivities, indicating an inverse relationship between cyclohexane ring polarity and bioactivity in each case.

A series of all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine is introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G&#8208;protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring cyclohexylalanines of this class are also incorporated into a keto&#8208;piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp3&#8208;rich derivatives for assays against the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. For these cyclohexylalanine analogs bioactivity trends correlate progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all&#8208;cis pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analog of the W&#8208;peptide is least active perhaps correlating with the well&#8208;known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend is also apparent in the anti&#8208;trypanosomal assays of the keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives, it is less so and some compounds are more active than the previously reported phenylalanine&#8208;derived analog.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized LRAD3&#8208;D1 Interacts with N&#8208;Terminal Domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis, calcium&#8208;templated in&#8208;vitro folding and competitive ELISA assay reveal that only domain 1 of the LRAD3 ectodomain interacts with the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) spike NTD, while domains 2 and 3 do not, providing valuable insight into ACE2&#8208;independent viral entry pathways that may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains associated with severe neurological complications.

Growing evidence of post&#8208;COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID&#8208;19. Importantly, the low&#8208;density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2&#8208;independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein is reported. It is observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. The results reveal that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N&#8208;terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.

         <title>Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation&#8208;Based Analysis of Advanced Small&#8208;Molecule Kinase Inhibitors Identified pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA Binders</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated computational approach evaluating the binding between pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 microRNA and small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) revealed varied pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 binding affinities among the advanced SMKIs. The results justified the characterization of potential RNA targets for kinase inhibitors and small molecules with protein targets in general.

RNAs play crucial roles in various cellular actions, and the uncontrolled expression or improper folding of RNAs is a cause of many diseases. Certain oncogenic phenotypes stem from the overexpression of regulatory microRNAs that contain secondary structural elements. Thus, targeting disease&#8208;related microRNAs with small molecules is a potential therapeutic&#160;strategy that has attracted growing interest. To probe the RNA&#8208;binding chemical space held in advanced small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, in this work, we screened the 78 FDA&#8208;approved small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) as representatives of the most advanced kinase inhibitors for their binding affinity with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA via a combination of computational methods and biophysical measurement. The best&#8208;ranked SMKIs based on docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by analysis of different computational parameters. Collectively, it provided reliable information on the binding affinity for the top&#8208;performed SMKI in the formation of SMKI&#8211;miRNA complexes with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7. Furthermore, the identification of the predicted most promising SMKI&#8211;miRNA interactions was validated by microscale thermophoresis, measuring direct binding affinities. This study evaluating the binding landscapes of the 78 FDA&#8208;approved SMKIs with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA served as an example highlighting the necessity to characterize the biological targets of SMKIs, many of which are FDA&#8208;approved cancer agents, at the transcriptomic level with RNAs. The study also illustrates the possibility that the interaction with RNA targets may contribute to the observed biological and clinical performance of these approved SMKIs.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Dithiocarbamato Glycoconjugates as Potential Anticancer Agents: Design, Physico&#8208;Chemical Characterization, and In Vitro Biological Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates based on gold(III), gold(I)&#8208;phosphino, and gold(I)&#8208;carbene scaffolds are here investigated as potential anticancer agents. Contrary to expectations, they induce cell death by acting at the extracellular level rather than targeting overexpressed glucose transporters.

To develop new metal&#8208;based glycoconjugates as potential anticancer agents, three gold(III)&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates of the type [AuIIIBr2(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)] (Au3&#8208;5), their gold(I)&#8208;phosphine counterparts [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(PPh3)] (AuP3&#8208;5), and gold(I)&#8208;carbene analogs [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(Et2BzImy)] (AuC3&#8208;5) (Inp: isonipecotic moiety; GlcN: amino&#8208;glucose scaffold; Et2BzImy: 1,3&#8208;diethylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene moiety), as well as the corresponding non&#8208;glycosylated counterparts (Au1&#8208;2, AuP1&#8208;2, and AuC1&#8208;2) bearing a terminal ester or amide function, are generated and characterized by means of several analytical techniques (FT&#8208;IR, 1H&#8208;/13C&#8208;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X&#8208;ray crystallography). Their stability under physiologically relevant conditions (phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution) has also been evaluated. Contrary to the gold(III)&#8208;glycoconjugates, the glucose&#8208;functionalized gold(I) derivatives show a significant antiproliferative effect against colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29), metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF&#8208;7) cells, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, the gold(I)&#8208;phosphine derivatives turning up to be the best performers. Cell uptake studies show no evident correlation between cell growth inhibition and cellular uptake, and the use of glucose&#8208;free cell culture media and a GLUT1 inhibitor rules out the involvement of glucose transporters in cell internalization, thus suggesting alternative cell death pathways such as acting at extracellular level (especially for the gold(I) derivatives).

This cover highlights the dominant negative effects of Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome&#8211;associated germline TP53 variants at Arg337. Using a novel single&#8208;cell assay to visualize p53 heterotetramers and their transcriptional activities, the study reveals that R337H and R337C variants, despite forming heterotetramers with wild&#8208;type p53, drastically reduce its activity&#8211; especially at apoptosis&#8208;related response elements&#8211;uncovering a new mechanism underlying p53 dysfunction in cancer predisposition.

         <title>Precision Delivery of CRISPR/Cas Systems via DNA Nanostructures for Gene Therapy and Intracellular Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technology has catalyzed a paradigm shift in life science research, with the CRISPR/Cas system emerging as a cornerstone tool in modern biology due to its transformative capabilities. This review systematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems (Cas9, Cas12, Cas13), with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles.

The CRISPR/Cas system represents a transformative breakthrough in genome editing technology, featuring three principal effector proteins with distinct functionalities: Cas9, which induces site&#8208;specific double&#8208;strand breaks guided by a single guide RNA, enabling precise gene knockout and knock&#8208;in modifications; Cas12, which mediates targeted DNA cleavage through cis&#8208;activity while exhibiting nonspecific trans&#8208;cleavage of single&#8208;stranded DNA, a property exploited for ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection in molecular diagnostics; and Cas13, an RNA&#8208;guided RNase that specifically degrades complementary RNA transcripts, demonstrating significant potential for antiviral therapies and transcriptome regulation. Despite these advances, the clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas systems faces substantial challenges, particularly in achieving efficient and controllable delivery. This reviewsystematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems, with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles. The integration of multifunctional DNA nanostructures with diverse CRISPR/Cas systems may facilitate the development of integrated theranostic platforms, thereby advancing precision medicine through synergistic bioengineering approaches.

         <title>Engineering Glucagon via Molecular and Formulation Strategies: From Natural Hormone to Effective and Stable Therapeutics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic application of glucagon starts as a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;use emergency hormone and is now evolving into a next&#8208;generation metabolic therapy through advances in understanding its physiological functions. This review highlights how engineering strategies enhance glucagon usability, stability, and delivery, and expand its application from hypoglycemia rescue to the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases.

Glucagon, a 29&#8208;amino acid pancreatic hormone, plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). While clinically essential for hypoglycemia rescue, its broader therapeutic applications face limitations due to challenging biophysical properties, including poor solubility, strong aggregation tendency, and chemical instability, which currently require lyophilized formulations. Recent advances in peptide engineering and formulation science have enabled the development of next&#8208;generation glucagon analogs with enhanced stability and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use profiles. Moving beyond its classical role in glucose elevation, glucagon is now recognized as a multifunctional metabolic regulator influencing lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and cardiorenal function. This expanded understanding has driven the development of innovative GCGR&#8208;targeting therapies, including multireceptor agonists such as glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R)/GCGR co&#8208;agonists for metabolic disorders and advanced dual&#8208;hormone delivery systems. This review examines the evolving pharmacology of glucagon by analyzing: 1) structural optimization and formulation strategies to address physicochemical challenges, 2) innovative delivery technologies, and 3) emerging therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases. Through critical assessment of translational challenges, this work bridges molecular insights with clinical innovation in glucagon&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are essential enzymes for glycan biosynthesis and exhibit varying specificity toward glycoprotein&#8208; and glycolipid&#8208;based acceptors. This review highlights the molecular basis of GT acceptor promiscuity with its impact on disease progression in humans and potential implications in glycobiotechnology.

Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability, and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, current insights into GT promiscuity are discussed, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.

Advanced Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates Design: Innovation in Linker Chemistry and Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Technologies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the importance of linker and conjugation technology in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). The schematic shows an antibody with a payload attached via a linker. The linker ensures stable attachment, enabling targeted drug delivery to specific cells, minimizing off&#8208;target effects, and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This research underscores the critical role of precise conjugation in ADC efficacy and safety.

Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising class of targeted cancer therapies, with the potential to improve treatment precision because of their unique mechanism of selectively delivering cytotoxic payloads (PLs) to tumor cells. ADCs combine a monoclonal antibody directed against a tumor&#8208;associated antigen with a potent cytotoxic PL via a covalent linker which connects the PL to the antibody. Several ADCs have been approved for clinical use in oncology, including Mylotarg, Adcetris, Kadcyla, Besponsa, Polivy, Lumoxiti, Padcev, Enhertu, Trodelvy, Aidixi, Zynlonta, Tivdak, Elahere, Datroway, and Emrelis. This review focuses on recent advances in linker chemistry and site&#8208;specific conjugation technologies, which are critical for optimizing ADC design and improving therapeutic indices. The development of next&#8208;generation ADCs has focused on overcoming challenges related to linker stability, efficiency of target antigen internalization, and pharmacokinetics. Traditional conjugation methods, such as lysine or cysteine conjugation, have been widely used but are associated with inherent issues of heterogeneity and instability. Advances in linker chemistry, such as the development of novel cleavable linkers, have significantly contributed to the clinical success of ADCs. In this review, different linker components are discussed, including chemical handles for conjugation, spacers to improve hydrophobicity, and triggers for PL release. In addition, innovative conjugation strategies are highlighted, which enhance ADC homogeneity and stability. The site&#8208;specific conjugation and therapeutic performance benefits of technologies such as THIOMAB, SMARTag, microbial transglutaminase, glycan remodeling, and AJICAP are discussed. The toxicity profiles of ADCs and strategies are also addressed to mitigate off&#8208;target effects and systemic toxicity. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of linker and conjugation technologies in ADC development.

         <title>In Vivo Biosynthesis and Direct Incorporation of Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 22, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review evaluates engineered (semi)autonomous cell systems for the biosynthesis and incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. While semi&#8208;autonomous cells convert supplied precursors into ncAAs autonomous cells integrate biosynthetic pathways that produce these building blocks intracellularly. Such integrated approaches significantly reduce process costs, can increase protein yields, and overcome challenges such as the limited membrane permeability of ncAAs.

Autonomous cells are engineered biological systems capable of biosynthesising and directly incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. These systems have the potential to extend the applicability of the genetic code to enable large&#8208;scale fermentative production of proteins carrying ncAAs. This work evaluates approaches for the generation of autonomous and semi&#8208;autonomous cells. Semi&#8208;autonomous cells rely on the external addition of a precursor, which is enzymatically converted in&#8201;vivo to an ncAA that is directly incorporated. In contrast, autonomous cells have a metabolic system that produces and directly incorporates an ncAA in&#8201;vivo. Through a critical evaluation of the state of the art, the reader is provided with an opinion on the future development of the field.

         <title>Development of Granzyme a Turn&#8208;ON Fluorescent Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quenched activity&#8208;based probe, featuring the Ile&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asn&#8211;Arg recognition sequence, a phenyl phosphinate ester warhead, and a near&#8208;infrared sulfo&#8208;Cy5/QSY21 fluorophore/quencher pair, generates a fluorescence signal only upon reaction with active granzyme A (GzmA). With its high reactivity, selectivity, and cell permeability, this turn&#8208;ON probe enables a robust detection of GzmA activity in complex proteomes.

Granzyme A (GzmA), a serine protease highly expressed in cytotoxic immune cells, plays complex roles in antitumor immunity and inflammation. While elevated GzmA levels correlate with favorable outcomes in certain cancers, extracellular GzmA has been implicated in promoting tumorigenesis via inflammatory pathways. These contrasting functions highlight the need for selective tools that can detect GzmA activity with high spatiotemporal resolution in native biological contexts. A series of quenched activity&#8208;based probes that fluoresce only upon covalent binding to active GzmA have been developed. The lead probe, featuring the Ile&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asn&#8211;Arg recognition sequence, a phenyl phosphinate ester warhead, and a near&#8208;infrared sulfo&#8208;Cy5/QSY21 fluorophore/quencher pair, exhibits high reactivity, selectivity, and cell permeability. It enables robust detection of GzmA in vitro and in cells, with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. These activatable probes will support downstream activity&#8208;based protein profiling and enable noninvasive imaging of the enzyme activity, offering a powerful means for dissecting the multifaceted biology of GzmA within the tumor immune microenvironment.

         <title>Introducing Quantitative Assessment of Michaelis Constant (Km) Accuracy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Michaelis constant (Km) is often reported with misleading confidence when only standard errors are considered. The accuracy confidence interval (ACI) framework is adapted to Km by recasting velocity&#8211;substrate data as a binding isotherm, propagating systematic uncertainties in enzyme and substrate concentrations. A free web tool (https://aci.sci.yorku.ca) implements ACI&#8208;Km for more reliable Km determination.

The Michaelis constant (Km) is central to enzyme kinetics, guiding variant selection, inhibitor screening, and metabolic modeling. However, Km obtained by nonlinear regression can be substantially inaccurate even when the reported standard error (SE) appears small. Common software reports SE but provides no accuracy metric. This gap is addressed by extending the accuracy confidence interval (ACI) framework to Km (ACI&#8208;Km) through a binding&#8208;isotherm formulation of the velocity&#8211;substrate fit. Given confidence intervals for concentration accuracy, the method quantifies how residual systematic uncertainties in enzyme and substrate concentrations ( E0 and S0) propagate into the determined Km values and provides a probabilistic interval expected to enclose the accurate value. The approach requires no additional kinetic experiments and is directly applicable to existing datasets. Concentration&#8208;accuracy intervals can be estimated from calibration data, reagent specifications, or quality&#8208;control records. ACI&#8208;Km is valid across a wide range of E0/Km conditions, including relatively high E0. A free web application (https://aci.sci.yorku.ca) implements ACI&#8208;Km. Tests on synthetic and experimental datasets show that Km &#177; SE can severely underestimate uncertainty, whereas ACI provides more reliable accuracy bounds for decision&#8208;making, complementing rather than replacing traditional precision metrics by providing quantitative diagnostic bounds for concentration&#8208;related uncertainties in Km determination.

         <title>Development of a Genetically Encoded and Potent PDE6D Inhibitor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PDE6D is a trafficking chaperone of prenylated proteins. Current small molecule PDE6D inhibitors target its hydrophobic pocket, rendering them typically poorly water soluble. Herein, PDE6D binders are generated by combining parts of the K&#8208;Ras4B and INPP5E C&#8208;termini. The genetically encoded high&#8208;affinity PDE6D inhibitor SNAP&#8208;STI is thus generated. Like in natural PDE6D cargo, high affinity is achieved at the entrance of the hydrophobic pocket.

PDE6D is a trafficking chaperone of prenylated proteins, such as small GTPases. Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed against it, given that the oncogene K&#8208;Ras is one of the cargo proteins. Inhibitor development suffers from the fact that inhibitors against the hydrophobic pocket of PDE6D are typically poorly water&#8208;soluble. Herein, the development of genetically encoded inhibitors that are inspired by high&#8208;affinity natural cargo of PDE6D is described. The most potent inhibitor, SNAP&#8208;STI, encodes merely a farnesylated tetra&#8208;peptide, which efficiently blocks PDE6D binding of farnesylated cargo. Direct comparison with small molecule PDE6D inhibitors suggests its higher potency. It is shown that inhibition of K&#8208;Ras membrane anchorage and K&#8208;RasG12C&#8208;dependent MAPK signaling by SNAP&#8208;STI is weak, consistent with what is observed after PDE6D knockdown. The data therefore further support that PDE6D is not a suitable surrogate target for efficient inhibition of K&#8208;Ras membrane anchorage and MAPK&#8208;activity. Nonetheless, by exploiting contacts at the pocket entry, a generalizable strategy to design high&#8208;affinity PDE6D inhibitors is established, providing powerful tools for PDE6D biology and target validation.

DNA&#8208;Based Ultrasensitive Cu(II) Sensor: Troponyl&#8208;Thymidine Oligo (T*4T) Forms Copper&#8208;Mediated Duplex Structure</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report describes the development of a novel DNA&#8208;based Cu(II) sensor utilizing naturally occurring nonbenzenoid aromatic scaffold Tropolone. Biophysical studies confirmed the formation of self&#8208;assembled duplex&#8208;like dimer structure of the synthesized troponyl&#8208;DNA T*4T with Cu(II) ion, which is further utilized to develop a conductometric&#8208;based Cu(II) sensing device.

DNA&#8208;metal complexes provide new dimensions in synthesizing DNA&#8208;based conducting biomaterials such as aptamers, DNAzymes, and their metal base pairing duplex structure. Structural modifications in the native DNA generate metal&#8208;specific binding sites in addition to phosphate backbone and nucleobase sites. One of the natural nonbenzenoid aromatic molecules, Tropolone, exhibits ion&#8208;specific binding with Cu(II) ion. In the repertoire of DNA metal sensors, troponyl&#8208;DNA can be explored for developing DNA&#8208;based Cu&#8208;sensors owing to the excellent Cu2+ binding affinity of Tropolone ligand. This report describes the synthesis of DNA penta&#8208;oligomer containing the repeated sequence of tr&#8208;dTnucleoside (T*) as (5&#8242;&#8208;T*T*T*T*T&#8208;3&#8242;) and its binding affinity with Cu(II) ions. Its Cu(II) mediated duplex&#8208;like dimer structure shows promising electrical conductivity at pico&#8208;molar [Cu2+] in acetonitrile. Hence, troponyl&#8208;DNA can be applied for making Cu(II) ion sensing devices.

         <title>Synthesis of the Abiraterone Derivatives 5&#945;&#8208; and 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;Abiraterone and Structural Determination of an Unknown Metabolite in Human Serum Derived from Oral Abiraterone Acetate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiraterone (Abi) acetate, a prostate cancer treatment, is orally administered and hydrolyzed, and multiple metabolites are produced in serum by various enzymes. Two novel Abi derivatives, 5&#945;&#8208; and 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone, are synthesized. Then, an unknown metabolite in serum is identified to be 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone based on its extracted ion chromatogram retention time.

Abiraterone (Abi) acetate, an anticancer drug, produces metabolites in the serum of patients with prostate cancer. Three unknown metabolites of Abi are previously discovered and the structures of two of these compounds are determined by comparing their LC&#8208;based retention times with those of synthesized compounds. However, the structure of the third metabolite is not identified. Herein, two new Abi derivatives, 5&#945;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone (5&#945;&#8208;D1A) and 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone (5&#946;&#8208;D1A), with a molecular weight of 348, are successfully synthesized as candidates for the third unknown metabolite. 5&#946;&#8208;D1A is confirmed as this third metabolite based on its retention time in the extracted ion chromatogram. The metabolic pathway may have formed 5&#946;&#8208;D1A rather than 5&#945;&#8208;D1A because of the higher activity of steroid 5&#946;&#8208;reductase compared with that of 5&#945;&#8208;reductase. These findings are expected to lead to the discovery of new metabolic pathways.

Molecular Sensing Using Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted attention due to several advantages, such as optical properties and easy functionalization. In particular, aggregation of AuNPs induced by target molecules can be monitored via optical or electrochemical methods for molecular sensing. This review aims to highlight molecular sensing strategies focusing on aggregation mechanisms of AuNPs and detection methods, including one using dark&#8208;field microscopy.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as powerful tools in the molecular sensing field for developing highly sensitive and selective molecular detection methods due to their unique properties, such as optical features and ease of surface modification. The core principle of AuNP&#8208;based sensors involves target molecule&#8208;induced aggregation, dispersion, or assembly of AuNPs through specific interactions with target molecules. These interactions cause changes in optical or electrochemical properties, which can be monitored through visible color shifts, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals, electrochemical techniques, and changes in scattering intensity. This review aims to highlight molecular detection strategies focusing on surface modification and aggregation mechanisms of AuNPs. It also introduces representative applications using colorimetric methods, SERS, electrochemical assays, and dark&#8208;field microscopy.

         <title>Chemical Surface Modification Tolerance of Primary and Immortalized Macrophages and Stem Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary and immortalized stem cells and macrophages are chemically modified via reactions with N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide&#8208;esters and hydrazides to display small molecule fluorophores or avidin proteins. Evaluation of the conjugation extents, uniformity, and persistence, and effects on cell morphology, viability, and chemotaxis is presented.

Cells are being utilized across various applications, including as self&#8208;regenerating materials, imaging and/or therapeutic entities, and delivery vehicles, and have the potential to do more. In biological and medical applications, specific cell types, including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have often been used on account of their recruitment to disease sites and desirable biodistribution properties. Typically, delivery applications involve the internalization of substrates within the cell, however, this approach presents drawbacks and is not amenable to some uses. Alternatively, chemically modifying cell surfaces using the toolbox of biocompatible chemistries has been broadly applied, but with few direct comparisons, including regarding assessment(s) of effects on the cells. In this work, we sought to compare commonly utilized N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester and hydrazide&#8208;based conjugations to immortalized and primary macrophages and MSCs. We incorporated both small molecules and avidin proteins using each approach, finding that cargo size plays a substantial role in modifications. Overall, conjugations were well&#8208;tolerated by primary and immortalized macrophages and MSCs; we observed no major impacts on viability and chemotactic response, but found some slight changes and trends depending on cell and modification type. This foundational work directly comparing the results and effects of multiple conjugation strategies across different cell types will benefit their use across a variety of applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the C&#63743;C Desaturation Catalyzed by an Fe(II) and &#945;KG&#8208;Dependent Oxygenase AndA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations, the mechanism of the C&#63743;C desaturation in anditomin biosynthesis is elucidated, catalyzed by the nonheme iron enzyme AndA. The results unveil a CO2&#8208;mediated dual hydrogen atom transfer pathway, where CO2 insertion suppresses hydroxyl rebound and generates a reactive Fe(III)&#8208;bicarbonate species to drive selective desaturation.

Fungal meroterpenoids, bioactive natural products with complex molecular frameworks, acquire their structural diversity partially through nonheme Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate(&#945;KG)&#8208;dependent enzymes. These enzymes use a high&#8208;valent Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate to drive diverse oxidative transformations. AndA, an Fe(II)/&#945;KG oxygenase pivotal to anditomin biosynthesis, catalyzes regioselective C1&#63743;C2 desaturation followed by skeletal rearrangement. While the isomerization step has been characterized, the mechanistic basis for desaturation over competing hydroxylation pathways remains enigmatic. Herein, molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations are employed to unravel how AndA avoids hydroxylation to achieve regioselective desaturation. The findings reveal the Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate, adopting two distinct coordination modes, a pentacoordinate (5C) and hexacoordinate (6C) geometry, differentiated by succinate coordination. The more reactive 5C species selectively abstracts the C2&#63743;H hydrogen, initiating desaturation. Crucially, CO2 generated in&#8201;situ from &#945;KG decarboxylation reacts with the resultant Fe(III)&#8211;OH complex, forming an Fe(III)&#8208;bicarbonate complex. This species sterically and electronically blocks OH rebound to the substrate. The Fe(III)&#8208;bicarbonate then abstracts a C1 hydrogen atom, completing the formation of the C1&#63743;C2 double bond. These insights resolve the mechanism of AndA&#8208;catalyzed regioselective desaturation and demonstrate how CO2&#8208;mediated coordination modulates oxidative fate, advancing mechanistic understanding of product control in this enzyme class.

         <title>Enzymatic Oxidation of Carbohydrate Byproducts for Use in Formation of Chitosan Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbohydrates, i.e., xylooligosaccharides derived from corn cobs and lactose derived from dairy byproducts, were selectively oxidized using fungal oxidoreductases AbPDH1 (pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus bisporus) and FgrGalOx (galactose oxidase from Fusarium graminearum). The resulting oxidized carbohydrates then crosslink chitosan, a crustacean shell biopolymer, to produce bio&#8208;based hydrogels for agricultural or biomedical applications.

Chitosan hydrogels are used in diverse applications ranging from pharmaceuticals and biomedical materials to food and agriculture. This study introduces a biology&#8208;inspired approach to create fully bio&#8208;based hydrogels by combining chitosan with bio&#8208;based di/polycarbonyl crosslinkers produced through the enzymatic oxidation of carbohydrates. Two such crosslinkers, Ox&#8208;XOS and Ox&#8208;Lac, were synthesized by oxidizing carbohydrates: Ox&#8208;XOS was produced by oxidizing xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus bisporus (AbPDH1), and Ox&#8208;Lac was produced by oxidizing lactose (Lac) with galactose oxidase from Fusarium graminearum (FgrGalOx). The efficacy of enzymatic oxidation of lactose and XOS was analyzed using liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, showing high degrees of oxidation, and carbonyl groups were confirmed using ATR&#8208;FTIR and 1H NMR. Compared with unmodified XOS, Ox&#8208;XOS showed a lower reaction temperature towards hexamethylenediamine by differential scanning calorimetry and demonstrated stronger gel formation ability with polyallylamine and chitosan. Rheological measurements showed O(10)$O(10)$&#8211;O(103)$O(10^{3})$ increases in the storage moduli (G&#8242;$G&amp;#x00026;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;prime;$) of chitosan hydrogels formed with Ox&#8208;Lac and Ox&#8208;XOS compared with unmodified lactose and XOS, indicating considerable increases in the hydrogels&#8217; resistance to deformation. These findings demonstrate the potential of enzymatically oxidized carbohydrates as crosslinkers to enhance chitosan hydrogels with potential utility in both high&#8208;value and large&#8208;volume sectors.

&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates, i.e., xylooligosaccharides derived from corn cobs and lactose derived from dairy byproducts, were selectively oxidized using fungal oxidoreductases &lt;i&gt;Ab&lt;/i&gt;PDH1 (pyranose dehydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Agaricus bisporus&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Fgr&lt;/i&gt;GalOx (galactose oxidase from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium graminearum&lt;/i&gt;). The resulting oxidized carbohydrates then crosslink chitosan, a crustacean shell biopolymer, to produce bio-based hydrogels for agricultural or biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Spontaneous Fusion of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Droplets: Effect of Coexisting Phospholipids on Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding phospholipid lecithin above the critical micelle concentration to ATPS droplets is reported to significantly slow down the processes of fusion, approaching migration, and merging. These findings highlight a simple yet effective strategy for stabilizing ATPS droplets, providing new insights into how lipid adsorption enhances droplet stability.

The stability of aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS) droplets is a key requirement for extending their utility beyond conventional applications, particularly as minimal models of biological cells and reaction compartments. However, the mechanisms by which their dynamic process in droplet size growth remain poorly understood. In this study, lecithin is demonstrated to effectively stabilize ATPS droplets by modulating two fundamental processes that determine their size evolution: 1) approaching migration driven by thermal motion and inter&#8208;droplet attraction and 2) the coalescence initiation time, defined as the delay between first contact and the onset of merging. Using dextran&#8208;rich droplets dispersed in a polyethylene glycol phase, significant suppression of both processes is shown that occurs only when lecithin concentrations exceed its critical micelle concentration. The findings indicate that lecithin coats droplet surfaces spontaneously to form a membrane&#8208;like layer, thereby reducing inter&#8208;droplet attraction and strongly inhibiting coalescence. This stabilization strategy offers a simple yet powerful means to control droplet dynamics, thereby opening up new possibilities for engineering ATPS droplets as versatile platforms for biochemical reactions and synthetic cell research.

         <title>From Structure to Function: Development of Relaxin&#8208;3 Analogs and their Role in RXFP3 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the current understanding of the relaxin&#8208;3/the relaxin family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) system and recent developments in peptidomimetics and small&#8208;molecule ligands targeting the system.

Relaxin&#8208;3 is a two&#8208;chain neuropeptide of the insulin/relaxin superfamily and the cognate ligand for the G protein&#8208;coupled receptor RXFP3. Since its discovery, the relaxin&#8208;3/RXFP3 signaling system has emerged as a key regulator of feeding behavior, stress responses, arousal, addiction, and cognitive function. Recent structural studies, including the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy structures of RXFP3 bound to relaxin&#8208;3 and small molecules, have provided significant insights into ligand&#8211;receptor interactions. Together with mutagenesis and pharmacological studies, these advances have facilitated the design of diverse RXFP3 ligands, ranging from simplified and/or stapled single&#8208;chain analogs of relaxin&#8208;3 to grafted scaffolds and small&#8208;molecule modulators. Such tools have been instrumental for probing relaxin&#8208;3 biology in&#8201;vivo and highlight the system's therapeutic potential for treating anxiety, depression, obesity, binge eating, and alcohol use disorder. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, receptor subtype selectivity, pharmacokinetic optimization, and safe long&#8208;term modulation. This review summarizes current knowledge of relaxin&#8208;3 structure, receptor interactions, and pharmacology and highlights how advances in peptide chemistry, structural biology, and small&#8208;molecule design are enabling the rational development of RXFP3&#8208;targeted therapeutics.

         <title>A Novel Electrochemical Aptasensors Utilizing AuNW/AuNC/PAA Nanocomposite for Label&#8208;Free Detection of IL&#8208;6 in Human and Mammalian Culture Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reports the development of a novel label&#8208;free electrochemical aptasensor based on a gold nanowire/gold nanocolloid/polyacrylamide (AuNW/AuNC/PAA) nanocomposite platform, enabling sensitive and specific detection of the pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6). The aptasensor demonstrates a wide detection range (0.1&#8211;1000&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1), high reproducibility, excellent selectivity, and strong performance in both spiked human serum and mammalian cell culture.

A versatile and highly sensitive sensing platform has been developed by incorporating a nanocomposite of gold nanowire (AuNW), gold nanocolloid (AuNC), and polyacrylamide (PAA) onto the surface of a screen&#8208;printed carbon electrode (SPCE). This innovative approach is designed for the efficient detection of interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6) in human serum and mammalian cell culture. The synthesized gold nanocomposite enhanced the SPCE's electrochemical signal via high conductivity, increased the electroactive surface for efficient electron transfer, and enabled thiolated aptamer immobilization through Au&#63743;S bonds. In this regard, the AuNW/AuNC/PAA nanocomposite and thiolated IL&#8208;6 aptamers were used to construct an IL&#8208;6 aptasensor for sensitive and selective detection of IL&#8208;6 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in 5&#8201;mM [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; as a redox probe. The fabricated aptasensor demonstrated sensitive detection of IL&#8208;6, with a detection range of 0.1&#8211;1000&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1. Moreover, the developed IL&#8208;6 aptasensor exhibited excellent stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. Its applicability was validated by IL&#8208;6 detection in human serum, showing 93.9%&#8211;104.8% recovery. Additionally, IL&#8208;6 levels in cell culture media were tested using both the aptasensor and a commercial ELISA kit, showing only a 1.38% difference, further confirming its reliability.

         <title>A Tetrasaccharide Containing a Galactofuranosyl Determinant of Mucins from Trypanosoma cruzi Inhibits the Parasite Adhesion on Triatoma infestans Rectum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the tetrasaccharide &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galp&#8208;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]&#8208;D&#8208;GlcNAc bearing the Galf(&#946;1&#8211;4)[Galp(&#946;1&#8211;6)]GlcNAc motif, a structural element of Trypanosoma cruzi core&#8208;2 mucin glycans is reported. The &#945;&#8208;benzyl glycoside inhibits epimastigote parasite adhesion to the vector Triatoma infestans rectal ampoule emphasizing this motif as a key adhesion determinant. It also acts as a sialic acid acceptor in TcTS&#8208;catalyzed assays.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite transmitted to humans via the feces of blood&#8208;sucking triatomine vectors such as Triatoma infestans. It has been shown that galactofuranose&#8208;containing oligosaccharides present in mucins of T. cruzi are involved in parasite adhesion to the T. infestans rectal ampoule, a key step in the differentiation programme from dividing epimastigote to nondividing mammal&#8208;infective metacyclic forms of the parasite. To further characterize this process, the &#945;&#8208;benzyl glycoside of &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galp&#8208;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]&#8208;D&#8208;GlcNAc is synthesized and its alditol derivative is spectroscopically characterized. The tetrasaccharide component of this glycoside is a substructure of the O&#8208;linked pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures found in the T. cruzi epimastigote mucins. The tetrasaccharide glycoside inhibits parasite adhesion to the rectal ampoule of T. infestans, suggesting that some or all of the binding capacity of T. cruzi epimastigotes resides within this O&#8208;glycan tetrasaccharide substructure. Since T. cruzi mucin O&#8208;linked glycans are known to be acceptors for T. cruzi trans&#8208;sialidase, it is investigated whether the tetrasaccharide substructure acts as an acceptor substrate for this activity. The successful transfer of sialic acid to the tetrasaccharide glycoside indicates that further elaboration to the pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures is not essential for sialic acid transfer.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of the tetrasaccharide &#946;-D-Gal&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)-&#946;-D-Gal&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)-[&#946;-D-Gal&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]-D-GlcNAc bearing the Gal&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&#946;1&#8211;4)[Gal&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;(&#946;1&#8211;6)]GlcNAc motif, a structural element of &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; core-2 mucin glycans is reported. The &#945;-benzyl glycoside inhibits epimastigote parasite adhesion to the vector &lt;i&gt;Triatoma infestans&lt;/i&gt; rectal ampoule emphasizing this motif as a key adhesion determinant. It also acts as a sialic acid acceptor in TcTS-catalyzed assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite transmitted to humans via the feces of blood-sucking triatomine vectors such as &lt;i&gt;Triatoma infestans.&lt;/i&gt; It has been shown that galactofuranose-containing oligosaccharides present in mucins of &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt; are involved in parasite adhesion to the &lt;i&gt;T. infestans&lt;/i&gt; rectal ampoule, a key step in the differentiation programme from dividing epimastigote to nondividing mammal-infective metacyclic forms of the parasite. To further characterize this process, the &#945;-benzyl glycoside of &#946;-D-Gal&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)-&#946;-D-Gal&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)-[&#946;-D-Gal&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]-D-GlcNAc is synthesized and its alditol derivative is spectroscopically characterized. The tetrasaccharide component of this glycoside is a substructure of the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-linked pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures found in the &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt; epimastigote mucins. The tetrasaccharide glycoside inhibits parasite adhesion to the rectal ampoule of &lt;i&gt;T. infestans&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that some or all of the binding capacity of &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt; epimastigotes resides within this &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycan tetrasaccharide substructure. Since &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt; mucin &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-linked glycans are known to be acceptors for &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt; trans-sialidase, it is investigated whether the tetrasaccharide substructure acts as an acceptor substrate for this activity. The successful transfer of sialic acid to the tetrasaccharide glycoside indicates that further elaboration to the pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures is not essential for sialic acid transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide Arginases from Cryptic Pathways Install Ornithine Residues in Uncharacterized Members of Orphan RiPP Families</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid ornithine into antibiotic peptides has shown potential in influencing antibacterial efficacy. Novel peptide arginases from cryptic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) pathways are identified and found to&#160; incorporate ornithine residues into various peptide sequences, complementing the existing peptide arginases and offering new opportunities for drug discovery.

Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are remarkable natural products with interesting chemical structures and potent bioactivities. RiPP pathways are abundant in all domains of life and harbor a large biosynthetic potential in the form of post&#8208;translationally acting enzymes. A relatively small number of RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters encode peptide arginases, a recently discovered maturase family capable of hydrolyzing arginine residues of RiPP core peptides to ornithines. In this study, members of the peptide arginase family (FlmR and OhkR), which are associated with uncharacterized precursors from orphan RiPP families, are identified. In&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro activity of FlmR and OhkR with the five associated precursor peptides (FlmA1&#8208;3 and OhkA1&#8208;2) is demonstrated and kinetic studies to biochemically characterize the enzymes are performed. Furthermore, in&#8201;silico structural analysis with AlphaFold 3 is used to predict precursor&#8211;arginase complexes, providing insights into how peptide arginases could bind their precursor substrates. In the case of OhkA&#8211;OhkR complexes, this analysis also allows a hypothesis as to which of the arginine residues of the core peptide is modified first, which is confirmed experimentally. This detailed biochemical and structural enzyme characterization is a prerequisite for the application of peptide arginases in peptide&#8208;based drug discovery platforms.

         <title>An Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Mechanism&#8208;Based Reactive Probe for Ratiometric Fluorescence Detection of Epinephrine in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epinephrine (EPI) or adrenaline is involved in various physiological processes of the sympathetic nervous system and may be linked to the progression of different serious diseases. An excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer mechanism&#8208;based reactive probe has been successfully developed for the selective ratiometric fluorescent detection of EPI in live cells.

Epinephrine (EPI), also known as adrenaline, is involved in various physiological processes of the sympathetic nervous system and may be linked to the progression of different serious diseases, including cancers, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases etc. There is an urgency in developing a fluorescence probe for the detection of EPI. An excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer mechanism (ESIPT)&#8208;based reactive probe HBT&#8208;EPI has been successfully developed for ratiometric fluorescent detection of EPI in physiological conditions. EPI undergoes a cascade of nucleophilic attack at the carbonothioate site of the probe using the secondary amine and &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl group to release the ESIPT&#8208;active 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) fluorophore. Thus, a ratiometric fluorescence response is obtained. The probe is highly selective for EPI detection compared to other catecholamine&#8208;based neurotransmitters. A minimum of 1&#8201;&#181;M of EPI can be easily detected using this probe. HBT&#8208;EPI has been successfully demonstrated for ratiometric fluorescence detection of EPI in live cells via confocal imaging.

         <title>Investigation on the Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Co3O4 Nanoparticles Adsorbed with Diverse DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the regulatory effect of diverse DNA on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Co3O4 NPs was investigated for the first time, offering a novel perspective for the application of Co3O4 NPs in photometric detection.

In recent years, nanozymes have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers due to their low cost, high stability, and straightforward preparation when compared with natural enzymes. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of nanozymes has been enhanced through surface adsorption, hence broadening their application scope. In this work, Co3O4 nanozyme was adsorbed with diverse DNA, and the catalytic performance was significantly boosted compared with the pure Co3O4 nanozyme. Peroxidase&#8208;like activity assays revealed three key findings. First, the adsorption of single&#8208;stranded DNA proved to be more effective than that of double&#8208;stranded DNA. Second, the 50&#8208;nucleotide single&#8208;stranded DNA sequence yielded the stronger catalytic signal. Ultimately, guanine rich nucleotide exhibited the higher catalytic efficiency in single&#8208;stranded DNA and cytosine&#8208;guanine rich nucleotide exhibited the stronger catalytic efficiency in double&#8208;stranded DNA. The kinetic results of its catalytic activity showed that the catalysis of the adsorbed Co3O4 nanozyme followed the Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics. In parallel, the Km value of 50&#8208;nucleotide single&#8208;stranded DNA adsorption was the lowest of diverse DNA, which was 6.11&#8201;mM and 54.8% of the pure Co3O4 nanozyme. These findings establish DNA adsorption as an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of Co3O4 nanozymes, presenting significant potential for applications in medical diagnostics and antioxidant&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Rational Design of a Selective Hydrolase Inhibitor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus&#8208;2 Nsp3 Macrodomain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided design of a sulfamoyl&#8208;modified analog of GS&#8208;441524 yielded a selective, high&#8208;affinity inhibitor of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 macrodomain Nsp3b. The compound occupies the phosphate&#8208;binding pocket, forming a stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bond network that enhances binding affinity (K_D&#8201;=&#8201;0.86&#8201;&#956;M). This study establishes sulfamoyl substitution as an effective phosphate bioisostere for rational antiviral macrodomain inhibitor design.

Viral macrodomains, which hydrolyze mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteins to evade host immunity, represent emerging antiviral targets, yet their druggability remains underexplored. GS&#8208;441524, the active metabolite of remdesivir, has been identified as an inhibitor of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) macrodomain (Nsp3b). Herein, the structure&#8211;activity relationship governing macrodomain recognition by the ribosylated moiety using a panel of nucleoside analogs, revealing that phosphate configuration and nucleobase identity critically modulate binding affinity. GS&#8208;441524 derivatives exhibit up to 200&#8208;fold higher affinity compared to adenosine&#8208;based ligands. A novel sulfamoyl derivative demonstrates superior inhibitory potency, attributable to its occupation of the phosphate subsite and formation of a stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bond network. These findings provide molecular insights into Nsp3b&#8211;ligand interactions and establish a rational framework for the development of high&#8208;affinity, structure&#8208;guided inhibitors targeting viral macrodomains.

         <title>Regulation of Supramolecular Interactions: RNA:DNA Folding and Nanopore Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea regulates the folding of RNA:DNA hybrids through supramolecular interactions, enhances their structural rigidity, and reduces folding events during nanopore translocation. This significantly improves the signal distinguishability and decoding efficiency for the detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA at the single&#8208;molecule level, providing a novel technical approach for the accurate detection of pathogenic RNA and the analysis of drug metabolism.

The intersection of DNA/RNA nanotechnology and single&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state nanopore sensing enables precise detection of low&#8208;abundance biomolecules. However, a significant challenge persists that nucleic acid molecules readily fold during nanopore translocation, which gives rise to ambiguous current signatures, reduces the number of usable data points, and compromises detection accuracy. Herein, a recent advancement by the Platnich group is highlighted, wherein urea is employed as a noncovalent modulator to participate in the isothermal assembly of MS2 bacteriophage RNA with DNA barcodes. This modulator stably binds to the RNA:DNA hybrids through supramolecular interactions after removal of free urea by buffer exchange. Nanopore assays showed a &#8776;50% reduction in fold&#8208;shift events in the urea&#8208;treated group. Atomic force microscopy characterization shows that the persistence length of the hybrids is enhanced by &#8776;40%. This strategy provides a new noncovalent regulatory tool for nucleic acid nanotechnology and pushes the nanopore sensing technology toward the precision detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA.

         <title>Isolable Cysteine Sulfenyl Iodide: Stabilization by a Molecular Cradle, Crystal Structure, and Biologically Relevant Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isolable cysteine sulfenyl iodide (Cys&#8211;SI) stabilized by a molecular cradle is reported. X&#8208;ray analysis and reactivity studies reveal hydrolysis to sulfenic acid, electrophilic substitution with indoles, and high reactivity toward amines and dimedone, providing direct evidence for long&#8208;standing proposals on iodine&#8208;mediated protein modification.

Cysteine sulfenyl iodides (Cys&#8211;SIs) have long been recognized as important intermediates in the oxidative modification of cysteine thiols since 1950s, implicated in pathways such as hydrolysis to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys&#8211;SOH) and electrophilic aromatic substitution with an indole ring of tryptophan to form Cys&#8211;Trp thioether linkages. Despite their proposed significance in both biological and chemical contexts, direct examination of Cys&#8211;SIs has been precluded by their intrinsic instability. Herein, the first isolation of a small&#8208;molecule Cys&#8211;SI, stabilized using a nanosized molecular cradle at the N&#8208;terminus of cysteine, is reported. The structure of the isolable Cys&#8211;SI is determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and its reactivity is investigated with a range of nucleophiles. Hydrolysis to Cys&#8211;SOH and reaction with an indole derivative provide direct chemical evidence for long&#8208;standing mechanistic proposals. Furthermore, rapid formation of sulfenamides with amines and high&#8208;yield adduct formation with dimedone, a canonical sulfenic&#8208;acid probe, reveal that Cys&#8211;SI possesses even greater electrophilicity than Cys&#8211;SOH. These results deliver a structurally defined reference for Cys&#8211;SI and inform mechanisms of iodine&#8208;mediated protein oxidation and peptide modification.

         <title>Polyvalent Thioesters as Multifunctional Chemical Anchors: Toward Synthesis of Homo/Hetero Peptide or Miniprotein Multimers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of multimeric peptides/miniproteins using polyvalent thioesters as chemical core units, beginning with polyvalent NHS&#8208;esters and employing native chemical ligation (NCL). Moreover, homo/hetero branching multimers were also synthesized by combining reverse thioether ligation with NCL. This modular approach should give access to peptide dendrimers with unique biological implications.

In this work, we develop a platform for multimerizing peptides/miniproteins using various polyvalent thioester cores derived from easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters. We employed native chemical ligation to attach multiple copies of peptide/miniprotein around a fixed multi&#8208;armed thioester core in a one&#8208;pot fashion, leading to the first&#8208;generation multimers. Further, using a reverse thioether ligation strategy, we synthesized second&#8208;generation branched homo/hetero multimers. The reactions proceed under an aqueous environment that closely mimics physiological conditions, forming multimeric products with yields ranging from 30% to 90%. The general utility of this strategy is showcased by the synthesis of multimeric linear and bicyclic peptides, bicyclic peptide&#8208;cell penetrating peptide conjugates, and multimeric miniproteins which show picomolar affinity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain. We believe that this modular approach of generating multimeric molecules should find broad applicability in peptide chemistry and chemical biology.

         <title>Strategies for the Generation of Bispecific Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispecific antibodies can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or epitopes, thereby exhibiting cooperative therapeutic effects in various diseases. This review summarizes the genetic engineering and chemical conjugation strategies that have been developed to facilitate the preparation of bispecific antibodies. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods, as well as the technical challenges that currently remain in the preparation of bispecific antibodies are also discussed.

Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are engineered immunoglobulins that can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or two distinct epitopes on the same antigen. They exhibit cooperative therapeutic effects surpassing those of natural monoclonal antibodies, such as bridging the immune cells and tumor cells to stimulate targeted immune response, or blocking codependent signaling pathways. These advantages make them attractive therapeutic reagents for various diseases such as cancers, immunodeficiency syndromes, and ophthalmic disorders. However, the unique structural characteristics of BsAbs pose various challenges to their preparation. In the past few decades, various types of BsAbs have been designed and prepared through genetic engineering or chemical conjugation strategies, many of which have been approved as drugs or entered clinical trials. This review provides a systematic summary of these strategies and their corresponding principles, and focuses on the application of modern genetic engineering and chemical conjugation methods in the generation of BsAbs.

         <title>The APEXTAC System for Ligand&#8208;Guided Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbiased identification of drug&#8208;targets in live cells is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action and potential off&#8208;target effects of drugs. Herein, the APEXTAC system, a small&#8208;molecule&#8208;guided proximity labeling platform is introduced based on the APEX2 peroxidase proximity labeling enzyme. This system facilitates rapid live cell target&#8208;ID across numerous targets and molecules, highlighting its potential application to the targeted protein degradation field.&#160;

Unbiased identification of drug&#8208;targets in live cells is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action and potential off&#8208;target effects of drugs. The BioTAC system to measure these effects is previously developed. However, BioTAC has limitations, including lysine&#8208;directed biotinylation chemistry, and relatively long biotin labeling times. Herein, the development of the APEXTAC system, a small molecule guided proximity labeling platform based on the APEX2 peroxidase proximity labeling enzyme, is described as a complementary tool. A head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison is performed between the APEXTAC system and the BioTAC system for (+)&#8208;JQ1 target&#8208;ID and demonstrated that APEXTAC can label E3&#8208;ligases via their ligands without requiring a proteasome inhibitor which can significantly perturb cell state. The APEXTAC system supports live cell target&#8208;ID across numerous molecules and targets, including components of the protein homeostasis machinery, without degradation of the labeling system, highlighting its potential application to the targeted protein degradation field.

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Bicyclic Competitive Inhibitors of Zika Virus Protease from Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Phage Display Screening</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
De novo peptide inhibitors targeting the Zika virus protease active site are discovered using phage display and Bi(III)&#8208;mediated bicyclization. Competitive elution of bound phages with a boronate inhibitor enriches dibasic peptide sequences that resemble the substrate recognition motif, yielding a micromolar bicyclic inhibitor with high proteolytic stability.

No specific vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infections. The viral protease NS2B&#8208;NS3 is essential for the replication of Zika and other orthoflaviviruses, making it a target for antiviral drug development. Traditional discovery of competitive inhibitors has relied on substrate recognition sequences, typically yielding multibasic peptides. Herein, a de novo strategy is presented for identifying competitive inhibitors using peptide phage display in combination with Bi(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8201;situ formation of bicyclic peptides. In an initial screening, phages displaying a library of randomized peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles are eluted by interrupting the phage&#8208;target interactions at low pH. This approach yields a small number of peptides biased toward the active site, characterized by dibasic motifs, but only one low&#8208;ranking sequence shows modest inhibitory activity. To enhance specificity, a second screening campaign employs competitive phage elution using the dibasic boronate inhibitor CN&#8208;714 that covalently binds to the catalytically active serine residue S135 of NS2B&#8208;NS3. This strategy enriches a larger pool of competitive inhibitors sharing the characteristic dibasic substrate recognition motif. The most potent peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycle identified and synthesized features a completely novel sequence, exhibits an inhibition constant of 3.9&#8201;&#181;M and displays remarkable proteolytic stability over 24&#8201;h.

         <title>8&#8208;Oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;Dihydroguanine can Improve Aptamer Affinity Toward Argininamide and its Selective Oxidation Promotes Crosslinks Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of incorporating 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroguanine (OG) in the DNA aptamer selected against argininamide are investigated. The presence of one OG is found, depending on its position in the recognition site, to increase, not affect, or decrease the affinity of the aptamer for its target. In addition, selective OG oxidation is shown to promote the efficient formation of aptamer&#8208;target crosslinks.

The effects of the substitution of a guanine (G) base by the oxidative lesion 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroguanine (OG) on the affinity of the DNA aptamer selected against L&#8208;argininamide (L&#8208;Rm) are studied. Results indicate that, depending on the position of the modified base located in the recognition site, the substitution of only one G by OG could either reduce, not affect, or increase such an affinity. In addition, attempts are carried out to promote chemical crosslinks between the aptamer and its target following selective oxidation of OG. Results show that such crosslinks could be produced with a high efficacy through nucleophilic addition of L&#8208;argininamide, presumably onto the C5 position of the oxidized OG base inserted into the aptamer in any position, and that no crosslink is generated for the original aptamer (not containing any OG). However, such reaction being very efficient, crosslinks are also produced between L&#8208;argininamide and oligonucleotides (including scramble sequences) that are not supposed to bind to that amino acid. Such an effect could be explained by the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged oligonucleotides and the protonated amino acid, which favor the formation of crosslinks upon OG oxidation. Efforts to decrease formation of such nonspecific crosslinks are only partly successful.

         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered bond cleavage is an essential biotechnology in chemical biology research. This concept highlights three photocleavable modalities&#8212;proteins, small molecules, and metal complexes&#8212;distilling design principles for wavelength tuning, cleavage efficiency, and biocompatibility. By comparing strengths/limits, we discuss the next generation of photo&#8208;responsive tools for biological research.

The spatiotemporal control of biomolecular functions via light&#8208;triggered bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful approach in chemical biology and cell biology. In this concept review, three major modalities of photo&#8208;cleavable systems&#8212;proteins, small molecules, and metal complexes&#8212;are classified and discussed, highlighting their design principles, biological applicability, and remaining challenges. Emphasis is placed on recent efforts to address key design challenges&#8212;such as balancing functional performance, biological compatibility, and optical responsiveness&#8212;across different molecular modalities, offering perspectives for the next generation of photo&#8208;responsive tools for biological research.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ultra&#8208;Fast Duplex Invasion Targeting Long&#8208;Range Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Using Artificial Nucleotide</title>

Photo&#8208;induced ultra&#8208;fast duplex invasion via ultra&#8208;fast photo&#8208;crosslinker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK), aiming for fast high&#8208;efficiency invasion.

Genomic DNA stores genetic information and regulates functions of various biological processes. Genetic diseases can be caused by abnormal gene expression. Genetic manipulation requires sequence&#8208;selective recognition of double&#8208;stranded DNAs, various chemical approaches for double&#8208;duplex invasion have been developed. In the previous research, a photo&#8208;induced double&#8208;duplex invasion (pDDI) is introduced that uses artificial nucleotides, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK) as photo&#8208;crosslinker and 5&#8208;cyanouridine (CU) as inter&#8208;probe photo&#8208;crosslinking inhibitor. In this study, while investigating the invasion mechanism of the pDDI, the invasion independence of pDDI probes is discovered and proposed a photo&#8208;induced duplex invasion (pDI) that achieves fast invasion using only CNVK while still maintaining a high invasion efficiency. This rapid pDI approach provides a powerful new tool for site&#8208;specific manipulation of genomic DNA.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Transcription Factor&#8208;Targeted Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras Nanomachine for Targeted Degradation of Transcription Factors</title>

Transcription factors (TFs) are important gene regulators whose abnormal expression or function is involved in the occurrence of various diseases. The emergence of transcription factor&#8208;targeted proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (TF&#8208;PROTACs) using DNA with a specific sequence as the targeting ligand of TFs provides a promising strategy to overcome the difficulties of using small molecules to inhibit TFs without well&#8208;defined ligand&#8208;binding pockets. A smart nanomachine is reported to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered release and activation of TF&#8208;PROTAC using upconversion nanoparticles loaded with caged TF&#8208;PROTAC targeting the transcriptional factor NF&#8208;&#954;B. The release of the active TF degrader (dNF&#8208;&#954;B) under 980&#8201;nm NIR irradiation is demonstrated in a controlled manner, enabling precise control of the degradation of the transcriptional factor NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 in live cells. The construction of the NIR&#8208;responsive nanomachine makes it possible to load and release various TF&#8208;PROTACs to degrade different transcriptional factors on demand with spatial and temporal resolution.

A smart nanomachine is reported to realize near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered release and activation of TF-PROTAC using upconversion nanoparticles loaded with caged TF-PROTAC targeting the transcriptional factor NF-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;B. The release of the active TF degrader (dNF-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;B) under 980&#8201;nm NIR irradiation is demonstrated in a controlled manner, enabling precise control of the degradation of the transcriptional factor NF-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;B p65 in live cells. The construction of the NIR-responsive nanomachine makes it possible to load and release various TF-PROTACs to degrade different transcriptional factors on demand with spatial and temporal resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Gelatin Methacrylate Coating on 3D&#8208;Printed Poly(esterurethane) Scaffolds Improves Cell Adhesion and Proliferation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the dip&#8208;coating of poly(esterurethane) (SPEU) scaffolds with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) successfully transform them from cell&#8208;repellent surfaces into bioactive platforms that support cellular proliferation and metabolic activity. An innovative system is developed that combines 3D printing and photopolymerization strategies to fabricate biofunctional GelMA&#8208;SPEU60 scaffolds.

A key challenge in tissue engineering is developing scaffolds that balance mechanical strength and bioactivity. Segmented poly(esterurethanes) (SPEU) are versatile polymers widely used in biomedical applications, particularly in the fabrication of elastomeric scaffolds for tissue engineering. Their mechanical properties and degradation rates can be tailored by modifying their chemical composition and morphology. However, the inherent hydrophobicity of SPEU often limits cell adhesion and proliferation, affecting their biocompatibility. To address this issue, surface modification, such as controlled dip&#8208;coating in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), was explored in this work to enhance cell&#8208;material interactions. 3D&#8208;printed SPEU60 structures (with 60% hard segment content) are fabricated, surface&#8208;modified, and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and goniometry. The ability of these scaffolds to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and viability, is evaluated in&#8201;vitro using lentivirus transfected green fluorescent 3T3&#8208;L1 murine preadipocyte cells. Results from these biological activity assays demonstrate that the GelMA coating significantly enhances the cellular response. In conclusion, these GelMA&#8208;SPEU60 structures can be considered extracellular matrices suitable for tissue engineering applications.

         <title>A Drug Screening Targeting Upregulation of Syk Gene Identifies Neochlorogenic Acid and L&#8208;Arabinitol Capable of Inducing the M2 Phenotype of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microglial reporter screening identified neochlorogenic acid and L&#8208;arabinitol as spleen tyrosine kinase&#8208;upregulating compounds that promote microglial M2 polarization and Amyloid&#8208;&#946; phagocytosis, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

Despite numerous therapeutic attempts of Alzheimer's disease (AD), treatment options remain limited. Targeting microglia (MG) polarization from M1 to M2 is considered a promising approach, yet no drug specifically modulating this transition has been identified. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target due to its role in regulating AD risk genes and promoting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) clearance. Herein, a microglial reporter gene screening model targeting Syk is developed and two small molecules, neochlorogenic acid (NCGA) and L&#8208;arabinitol (L&#8208;Ara), that can upregulate Syk gene expression, leading to the activation of MG M2 phenotype, are identified. Furthermore, these compounds markedly enhance the capacity of MG to migrate toward A&#946; and phagocytose A&#946;. However, when Syk expression is silenced using shRNA, the ability of these small molecules to induce the MG M2 phenotype and promote A&#946; phagocytosis by MG is substantially attenuated. These findings offer new insights into AD therapy development.

         <title>Optimizing the Cell Number and Size for Tumor Spheroid Modeling Using Amyloid Hydrogel</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;based functional amyloid hydrogel is fabricated for an in vitro 3D breast cancer spheroid model with epithelial and stromal cell lines. Viable and proliferative mono as well as co&#8208;culture tumor spheroids are developed within 7 days using this technology, even at low cell densities, which also display angiogenic potential.

One of the leading reasons of female mortality on a global scale is breast cancer. Tumor size has been a crucial parameter in predicting the rate of tumor growth and metastasis. Regular core biopsy techniques usually result in a low yield of cancer cells. Hence, developing an in vitro platform with low cell numbers can be an invaluable tool for studying breast cancer. 3D spheroid culture is a promising alternative to animal models for applications such as drug testing and personalized medicine. The self&#8208;assembling KLMEI peptide amyloid hydrogel can be used as a matrix to support tumor spheroid formation for MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7 cells across various cell numbers. Over 7 days, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 spheroids exhibited higher proliferation than MCF&#8208;7, even at low cell numbers. Overall, the study shows that by adjusting the cell&#8208;to&#8208;gel ratios, viable spheroids can be developed to mimic different&#8208;sized in vivo tumors. The ability of the hydrogel to support co&#8208;culture spheroids formation is also examined by introducing fibroblasts with MCF&#8208;7 cells to induce angiogenesis and mimic the heterogeneous cell environment typical of in vivo tumors. Therefore, this platform possesses a promising potential for developing 3D spheroids to study the different aspects of breast cancer.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Photocleavable Oligonucleotides Containing 1,2&#8208;Diol&#8208;Conjugated Phosphotriester</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 1,2&#8208;diol&#8208;conjugated phosphotriesters are designed and synthesized. The ONs containing cyclic 1,2&#8208;diol show efficient self&#8208;cleavage in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation and can form stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced by photocleavage. In addition, the photocleavable ON is applied to DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.

Photocleavable oligonucleotides (ONs) containing a nonnucleosidic photocleavable spacer have been applied in a variety of chemical and biological tools. In this study, novel photocleavable ONs containing 1,2&#8208;diol&#8208;conjugated phosphotriesters without an extra spacer are designed and synthesized. The ONs containing cyclic 1,2&#8208;diol efficiently self&#8208;cleave in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation, forming stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced after photoirradiation. This characteristic is applied to DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.

         <title>Characterization of BRCA1&#8208;Associated Protein&#8208;1 (BAP1) Aggregation Properties Induced by Cancer&#8208;Associated Mutations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BAP1 is a master regulator of oncogenesis with many cancer&#8208;associated mutations within its N&#8208;terminal ubiquitin C&#8208;terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain. We analytically demonstrated that BAP1&#8208;UCH harboring the N78S, C91W, F81V, and G128R mutations aggregate into amyloid fibrils following a secondary nucleation aggregation model. Our study provides valuable insights into how single mutations can affect cancer progression through protein aggregation.

BRCA1&#8208;associated protein&#8208;1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates DNA transcription through its deubiquitinase activity. Cancer&#8208;associated missense mutations within its ubiquitin C&#8208;terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain result in structural destabilization and aggregation, contributing to various malignancies such as malignant mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. In this study, we investigated the aggregation mechanisms of highly destabilized BAP1&#8208;UCH variants, including N78S, C91W, F81V, and G128R, using Thioflavin T (ThT) binding assays and AmyloFit analysis. Our results reveal that all BAP1&#8208;UCH variants follow a secondary nucleation&#8208;dominated aggregation model, exhibiting strong concentration dependence and significantly higher aggregation rates, which may be responsible for their impaired nuclear import, leading to increased cytosolic retention. These findings provide critical insights into how specific mutations in BAP1 drive aggregation and compromise its tumor&#8208;suppressing functions inside the nucleus, thereby contributing to cancer progression.

         <title>Method Overview for Discovering ATE1 Substrates and their Arginylation Sites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arginylation is a decades&#8208;old post&#8208;translational modification but is inherently difficult to study. A plurality of methods have been developed and deployed to uncover the biology and substrates of this modification. This review covers the history, major advancements, and substrates discovered over the course of six decades.

Arginylation is a protein modification event in which cellular machinery recognizes a conserved N&#8208;terminal or side&#8208;chain motif and post&#8208;translationally installs an arginine residue to signal a protein for degradation. This modification affects protein function, stability, and half&#8208;life and is essential to proper functions in mammalian systems. Since its discovery in the early 1960s, scientists have struggled to broadly characterize this modification in its canonical function outside of a handful of specific cases. It is known to be an essential cellular mark, as loss of the installation enzyme is embryonically lethal. However, the discovery of the substrates regulated by this mark has been slow and has required some creativity by the scientists who have chased it. Over the course of roughly six decades, the library of substrates has consistently grown through various applications. Here, we seek to summarize all approaches that have been applied to discovering and studying arginylation.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Near&#8208;Infrared Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Selective Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyma is a novel water&#8208;soluble near&#8208;infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe with high selectivity for monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A). Cyma enables sensitive, real&#8208;time detection of MAO&#8208;A activity via a distinct fluorescence shift, exhibits excellent selectivity and good performance in live&#8208;cell imaging, and holds great potential for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.

Monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A) plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter metabolism and oxidative stress regulation and is implicated in various neurological disorders and cancer progression. However, its detection is hindered by high structural similarity to its isoform MAO&#8208;B and limitations of conventional methods, which exhibit poor specificity, low sensitivity, and spectral crosstalk. To overcome these challenges, Cyma, a water&#8208;soluble near&#8208;infrared ratiometric probe engineered on a cyanine platform, is developed. Cyma integrates a sulfonated cyanine core for improved water solubility, a clorgyline&#8208;derived recognition unit to confer MAO&#8208;A selectivity, and a propylamine moiety to enable enzymatic activation. Upon interaction with MAO&#8208;A, Cyma undergoes a specific 1,6&#8208;elimination and Smiles rearrangement, yielding a distinct fluorescence shift from 805&#8201;nm to 740&#8201;nm. Cyma demonstrates excellent selectivity for MAO&#8208;A over MAO&#8208;B and exhibits high sensitivity (detection limit: 0.0035&#8201;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), with a strong linear correlation between ratiometric fluorescence intensity and MAO&#8208;A concentration. Furthermore, excellent biocompatibility and MAO&#8208;A detection ability of Cyma are demonstrated in SH&#8208;SY5Y cells. These findings establish Cyma as a powerful tool for selectively detecting MAO&#8208;A activity, offering significant potential for disease diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and intraoperative imaging.

         <title>A Non&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Hemin Aptamer Forms a Better Peroxidase Mimicking DNAzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer exhibits peroxidase&#8208;like activity when binding to hemin, forming a DNAzyme. This DNAzyme displays a pH&#8208;rate profile similar to horseradish peroxidase, whereas a G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;based DNAzyme shows an opposite trend. These two aptamers also show distinct hemin&#8208;dependent nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy behaviors. 

G&#8208;quadruplex DNA is known to bind to hemin, forming a complex that exhibits peroxidase&#8208;like activity. A non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer named Hem1&#8208;2T also exhibits horseradish peroxidase (HRP) like activity upon binding to hemin. Herein, the catalytic characteristics of the Hem1&#8208;2T aptamer are studied and compared with PS2.M, an extensively studied G&#8208;quadruplex. From pH 6&#8211;8, the activity of Hem1&#8208;2T decreases with the increase in pH, which is similar to HRP, whereas the activity of PS2.M increases with pH, suggesting that Hem1&#8208;2T might be a better mechanistic mimic of HRP. Additionally, Hem1&#8208;2T is more effective at protecting hemin from degradation by H2O2, as evidenced by a slower decrease in the absorbance at 404&#8201;nm compared to PS2.M and more sustained catalysis. NMR spectroscopy indicates that hemin promotes ligand&#8208;induced structure formation in the Hem1&#8208;2T aptamer and forms a specific complex, whereas hemin interacts with the PS2.M G&#8208;quadruplex in a way leading to the disappearance of NMR peaks. Overall, the Hem1&#8208;2T&#8208;hemin complex is a better and more stable HRP mimic, supporting its potential applications in bioanalysis and biocatalysis.

         <title>Research Progress of Functional Nucleic Acids&#8208;Based Biosensor in the Sensitive Detection of Foodborne Pathogens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nucleic acids, such as aptamers and DNAzymes, enable programable, high&#8208;specificity biosensors for rapid detection of foodborne pathogens. This article summarizes sensing principles and amplification strategies that advance portable and ultrasensitive food safety detection.

Foodborne pathogen contamination is a major global public health issue, highlighting the need for rapid, sensitive, and portable detection technologies. Conventional methods such as microbial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay are limited by complexity, low sensitivity, and high cost, restricting on&#8208;site use. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular recognition elements for next&#8208;generation biosensors. Their programmability, stability, and specificity enable reliable real&#8208;time food monitoring. Moreover, nucleic acid&#8208;based signal amplification methods greatly enhance detection sensitivity. This review summarizes recent advances in FNA&#8208;based biosensors for foodborne pathogen detection, covering screening strategies like systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, sensing mechanisms with various readouts (fluorescence, colorimetry, electrochemistry), and innovative amplification strategies for improving practical application in food safety monitoring. Representative biosensor designs, mechanisms, and performances are highlighted. Finally, existing challenges and future perspectives for enhancing detection accuracy are discussed. FNA&#8208;driven biosensors hold great promise for preventing foodborne diseases and advancing portable, high&#8208;sensitivity detection platforms.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Glucosides and Aminoglycosides to Combat Resistant Resistance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photocatalysts to alkylate monosaccharides, polysaccharides, and biomolecules containing glucose motifs&#8212;including the aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin and amikacin&#8212;are used and their biological activity, resulting in a kanamycin derivative with a 30&#8208;fold improved minimal inhibitory concentrations, is tested.

The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria and the scarcity of the antibiotic pipeline have been a persistent threat to global health. To expand the antibiotic pipeline,the strategy has focused on revitalizing the current antibiotic via novel site&#8208;specific derivatization. Aminoglycosides (AGs), once considered effective therapeutics for treating clinical infections, are now used to a limited extent due to drug&#8208;induced toxicity and AG&#8208;resistant bacteria. Challenges in the synthesis and modification of AGs impede their potential for regain efficacy. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed late&#8208;stage modification of glucosides including AGs is discussed. The chemistry can selectively install an alkyl group at the 3&#8208;position of unprotected glucoside with a broad substrate scope and high yields. Among the products, a series of compounds are characterized that can overcome drug resistance caused by APH(3&#8242;) and one of them achieves 30&#8208;fold potency compared to kanamycin against sensitive strains. The chemistry described here opens a new avenue for discovering new AG antibiotics that overcome drug resistance and may also serve as the basis for understanding their structure&#8211;activity relationships.

Synthesis of an N&#8208;Galactosyl Norbornane Aziridine and its Potent Mixed Inhibition of Aspergillus oryzae &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;galactosyl aziridine is found to have &#956;M range mixed inhibition constants (Ki and Ki&#8217;) for a fungal &#946;&#8208;galactosidase.

Aziridine&#8208;bearing cyclic polyols are established as irreversible covalent inhibitors of glycosyl hydrolases and have been employed as activity&#8208;based probes. In the present study, the stereoselective synthesis of a novel N&#8208;galactosyl aziridine derivative on a norbornane scaffold and its subsequent evaluation as an inhibitor of glycosyl hydrolase activity are described. The diastereoselective Huisgen cycloaddition between 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranosyl azide and norbornene yields exo&#8208;triazoline intermediates of norbornane. Following the removal of the acetyl protecting groups and a silica gel&#8208;mediated decomposition of the triazoline intermediates, exo N&#8208;galactopyranosyl norbornane aziridine (N&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranosyl)&#8208;exo&#8208;3&#8208;azatricyclo[3.2.1.02,4]octane, NGNA) is obtained. Enzymatic assays demonstrate that NGNA exerts potent mixed&#8208;mode inhibition of Aspergillus oryzae &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, while exhibiting significant selectivity over green coffee bean &#945;&#8208;galactosidase.

         <title>Developing FGF2 Mutants with Selectively Reduced Heparan Sulfate Affinity to Explore their Impact on FGFR1 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism by which the coreceptor heparan sulfate (HS) contributes to Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling remains unclear. In this study, FGF2 mutants with selectively reduced HS affinity were rationally designed through in silico analysis. Analyses of designed mutants provided important insights, suggesting that the contribution of FGF2/HS interaction to FGF2/FGFR signaling may be limited.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)regulates signal transduction by forming complexes with its receptors, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and heparan sulfate (HS), playing a crucial role in biological systems. Although HS has been suggested to modulate FGF/FGFR signaling as a coreceptor, multiple hypotheses exist regarding how HS affects FGF/FGFR signaling and the mechanism remains unclear. Herein, to highlight the role of FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling, FGF2 mutants with reduced HS&#8208;binding affinity are rationally designed through in silico analysis. These FGF2 mutants exhibit reduced HS affinity by more than two orders of magnitude while maintaining binding affinity to FGFR1. In addition, these mutants retain their thermal stability. Cellular assays using the FGF2 mutant suggest that, contrary to previous reports, the contribution of the FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling may be limited. The mutant FGFs that specifically alter the interaction with HS, achieved in this study, would contribute to an understanding of the role of FGF/HS interaction in FGF/FGFR signaling.

         <title>From Molecule to Meaning: Click and Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters for Plant Systems, Biological Imaging, and Artistic Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of chemical biology, plant imaging, and contemporary art, this review introduces the concept of chembioart. By tracing how chemical reporters illuminate plant biomolecules in vivo, their role not only in advancing scientific understanding but also in inspiring transdisciplinary collaborations and visual expression&#160;is highlighted.

Chemical biology has reshaped the ability to investigate complex biological systems at the molecular level. In this context, chemical reporters have become important tools for labeling and tracking biomolecules in living systems with spatial and temporal precision. In plant biology, they provide an alternative to genetic approaches and allow the study of dynamic processes in species or organs that are not easily accessible. Through the use of click and bioorthogonal chemistry, small&#8208;molecule probes can be metabolically incorporated into specific molecular scaffolds such as sugars, monolignols, amino acids, and lipids. These probes make it possible to follow events like glycosylation, lignification, lipid turnover, or protein synthesis in living plant tissues. This review presents an overview of current chemical reporter strategies, from molecular design and synthetic considerations to their application in plant imaging. Herein, how these tools have contributed to the development of plant chemical biology by enabling precise and modular investigations of plant structure and metabolism is described. Herein, it is also examined how chemical reporters have entered interdisciplinary contexts, including collaborations between science and the arts. By converting molecular&#8208;level information into visual and sensory formats, these approaches open new perspectives for research, education, and communication across scientific and creative disciplines.

Advances in Hydrocarbon Stapled Peptides via Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis: Synthetic Strategies, Structural Diversity, and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrocarbon stapled peptides, including single, multiple, and stitched stapling strategies, improve &#945;&#8208;helical conformation, enhance resistance to proteolytic degradation, and increase biological activity. These structural modifications significantly broaden the therapeutic potential of peptides across cancer, infectious diseases, and other biomedical applications.

Peptide stapling has emerged as a powerful strategy to stabilize &#945;&#8208;helical structures in peptides, thereby enhancing their proteolytic resistance, membrane permeability, and biological activity. Among the various stapling methodologies, hydrocarbon stapling via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis remains the most widely adopted due to its robust chemical efficiency and synthetic compatibility with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. This review summarizes key advancements in hydrocarbon stapling technologies, including mono&#8208; and multiple&#8208;stapling, solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase approaches, and newer developments such as stitched and aza&#8208;stapled peptides. The integration of rigidified anchoring residues (e.g., cyclobutane or carbocyclic &#945;, &#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids) and orthogonal metathesis strategies has significantly expanded the structural diversity and functional potential of stapled peptides. Furthermore, novel bioorthogonal modifications and imaging capabilities, such as Raman&#8208;active diyne bridges, have opened new directions in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Together, these innovations underscore the growing utility of stapled peptides in modulating protein&#8211;protein interactions and advancing peptide drug discovery.

         <title>Biocompatible Metal Sulfide&#8208;Based Nanomaterials for Antimicrobial and Wound Healing Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of metal sulfides for antimicrobial and wound healing applications.

The progress of innovative antimicrobial coatings and therapeutic approaches is becoming increasingly important for effective wound healing. Due to their unique properties, chalcogenides, particularly metal sulfides, have gained significance in antibacterial and wound healing applications. By promoting tissue regeneration and lowering scarring, these materials can improve wound healing and treat bacterial infections. This review summarizes recent advancements in metal sulfides for antimicrobial and wound healing applications, aiming to combat infections, diseases, and facilitate healing. The different antimicrobial mechanisms of metal sulfides are also highlighted. The prospects and limitations for eventual translation to a real&#8208;life application are also discussed. Thus, metal sulfide&#8208;based materials offer promising insight into the development of novel antimicrobial materials and wound dressings.

         <dc:description>
The &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; nature of biocompatible chemistry makes it a powerful toolbox for investigating complicated biological systems and producing drug leads for clinical usages. This review summarizes the commonly used biocompatible reactions and the recent advances of their representative applications in chemical biology research, thus highlighting the diverse potential of biocompatible chemistry as a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; toolbox for future basic and translational studies.

Chemistry is referred to as the central science that has been widely applied in biological, material, and clinical research. Specifically, chemical biology is an interdisciplinary subject, where well&#8208;designed chemical tools and approaches are employed to solve complex biological questions. In the past few decades, the development of biocompatible reactions, which include click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, is one of the most significant advances in the chemical biology field. In short, biocompatible chemistry enables the cleavage and formation of chemical bonds under physiological conditions, which can be thus utilized for specific labeling of cellular biomacromolecules of interest, biomarker/target validation, signaling pathway identification, drug discovery, and so on. The plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nature of biocompatible chemistry makes it a powerful toolbox for investigating complicated biological systems and producing drug leads for clinical usages. In this article, the commonly used biocompatible reactions and the recent advances of their representative applications in chemical biology research is summarized, thus highlighting the diverse potential of biocompatible chemistry as a plug&#8208;and&#8208;play toolbox for future basic and translational studies.

         <title>A Review of Polyhydroxybutyrate Biosynthesis by Different Microorganisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in microbial polyhydroxybutyrate biosynthesis as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based plastics. It emphasizes cost&#8208;effective production strategies using engineered microbial systems, low&#8208;cost carbon sources, and waste&#8208;derived feedstocks, supporting circular economy goals. The work also discusses bioprocess innovations that reduce energy use, avoid harsh chemicals, and enhance resource efficiency.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production from renewable biomass feedstocks using microorganisms provides a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based plastics, addressing critical challenges such as plastic pollution and fossil fuel consumption. Unlike previous reviews that primarily focus on single genera or metabolic mechanisms, this review provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple microbial platforms, emphasizing strain selection strategies, genetic engineering approaches, and substrate flexibility, particularly for waste valorization. Bacterial systems, while efficient, are limited by the high cost of sterile conditions. Engineered yeasts and fungi offer resilience to industrial stresses but face metabolic constraints. In addition, haloarchaeal extremophiles have gained attention for PHB synthesis under high&#8208;salinity, nonsterile conditions, offering unique advantages for cost&#8208;effective bioprocessing. Photosynthetic microorganisms integrate CO2 capture with PHB synthesis but face challenges like slow growth rates and low yields. Mixed microbial cultures provide a cost&#8208;effective approach by utilizing low&#8208;cost substrates under nonsterile conditions, though optimizing enrichment strategies remain essential to improving productivity. Future directions highlight the significance of evaluating strain selection strategies, advancing genetic engineering approaches, and scaling up production processes. Additionally, assessing technoeconomic viability and life&#8208;cycle environmental impact is crucial to support the development of PHB as a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly solution for the circular economy.

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>
