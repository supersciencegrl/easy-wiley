         <title>Preferential Binding of a Red Emissive Julolidine Derivative to a Promoter G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we show that a julolidine based compound displays emission in the red region of the spectrum and interacts preferentially with G&#8208;quadruplexes of certain topology having a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 binding stoichiometry and ability to thermally stabilize the G&#8208;quadruplex (Pu22).







Abstract
The therapeutic potential of G&#8208;quadruplexes has increased significantly with the growing understanding of their functional roles in pathogens apart from human diseases such as cancer. Here, we report the synthesis of three julolidine&#8208;based molecules and their binding to nucleic acids. Among the synthesized molecules, compound 1 exhibited red emissive fluorescence with a distinct preference for Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex. The binding of compound 1 to Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex, initially identified through a fluorescence&#8208;based screening, was further confirmed by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism&#8208;based experiments. Thermal denaturation of compound 1 in the presence of Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex revealed a concentration&#8208;dependent stabilization (~10.0&#8201;&#176;C at 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 stoichiometry). Fluorescence&#8208;based experiments revealed 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry of the interaction and an association constant (Ka) of 5.67&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. CD experiments displayed that the parallel conformation of the G&#8208;quadruplex was retained on compound 1&#8217;s binding and signs of higher order binding/complex formation were observed at high compound 1 to DNA ratio. Molecular docking studies revealed the dominance of stacking and van der Waals interactions in the molecular recognition which was aided by some close&#8208;distance interactions involving the quinolinium nitrogen atom.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Protein Engineering for Improving Catalytic Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning approaches allow the creation of protein adaptive landscapes and the identification of catalytic modes using limited experimental data to establish relationships between enzyme, substrate and catalytic performance, and have been used for data&#8208;driven protein engineering to improve their catalytic activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Protein engineering is essential for altering the substrate scope, catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes for applications in biocatalysis. However, traditional approaches, such as directed evolution and rational design, encounter the challenge in dealing with the experimental screening process of a large protein mutation space. Machine learning methods allow the approximation of protein fitness landscapes and the identification of catalytic patterns using limited experimental data, thus providing a new avenue to guide protein engineering campaigns. In this concept article, we review machine learning models that have been developed to assess enzyme&#8208;substrate&#8208;catalysis performance relationships aiming to improve enzymes through data&#8208;driven protein engineering. Furthermore, we prospect the future development of this field to provide additional strategies and tools for achieving desired activities and selectivities.

         <title>Histone globular domain epigenetic modifications: The regulators of chromatin dynamics in malaria parasite</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmodium species adapt a complex lifecycle with multiple phenotypes to survive inside various cell types of humans and mosquitoes. Stage&#8208;specific gene expression in the developmental stages of parasites is tightly controlled in Plasmodium species; however, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be explored. Genome organization and gene expression for each stage of the malaria parasite need to be better characterized. Recent studies indicated that epigenetic modifications of histone proteins play a vital role in chromatin plasticity. Like other eukaryotes, Plasmodium species N&#8208;terminal tail modifications form a distinct "histone code," which creates the docking sites for histone reader proteins, including gene activator/repressor complexes, to regulate gene expression. The emerging research findings shed light on various unconventional epigenetic changes in histone proteins' core/globular domain regions, which might contribute to the chromatin organization in different developmental stages of the malaria parasite. The malaria parasite lost many transcription factors during evolution, and it is proposed that the nature of local chromatin structure essentially regulates the stage&#8208;specific gene expression. This review highlights recent discoveries of unconventional histone globular domain epigenetic modifications and their functions in regulating chromatin structure dynamics in various developmental stages of malaria parasites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A designed platform based on SpyCatcher/SpyTag system to promote the degradation of exogenous proteins in live cells. We used Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein tagged with SpyCatcher was conjugated to a SpyTag peptide bearing a Von Hippel&#8208;Lindau E3 ligand, and the semi&#8208;synthetic construct was delivered to live cells to promote its degradation.







Abstract
We designed a platform for monitoring the degradation of exogenous proteins in live cells. We engineered a semi&#8208;synthetic platform, which consists of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein tagged with SpyCatcher to enable its conjugation to a SpyTag peptide bearing a Von Hippel&#8211;Lindau E3 ligand, which was delivered to live cells to promote its degradation. This platform lays the ground for studying the degradation of endogenous proteins equipped with SpyTag and for tracking the degradation of post&#8208;translationally modified proteins in live cells.

         <title>Bacterial Isothiocyanate Biosynthesis by Rhodanese&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfur Transfer onto Isonitriles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biosynthetic pathway towards isothiocyanate natural products is identified. In vivo and in&#8197;vitro biotransformation show that rhodanese&#8208;like proteins (Rhd), known for the detoxification of cyanide, have been recruited and neofunctionalized to catalyze sulfur incorporation into isonitriles in bacteria. This so far unknown function of rhodanese&#8208;like proteins is highly specific and plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the antifungal sinapigladioside from Burkholderia gladioli.







Abstract
Natural products bearing isothiocyanate (ITC) groups are an important group of specialized metabolites that play various roles in health, nutrition, and ecology. Whereas ITC biosynthesis via glucosinolates in plants has been studied in detail, there is a gap in understanding the bacterial route to specialized metabolites with such reactive heterocumulene groups, as in the antifungal sinapigladioside from Burkholderia gladioli. Here we propose an alternative ITC pathway by enzymatic sulfur transfer onto isonitriles catalyzed by rhodanese&#8208;like enzymes (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferases). Mining the B. gladioli genome revealed six candidate genes (rhdA&#8211;F), which were individually expressed in E. coli. By means of a synthetic probe, the gene products were evaluated for their ability to produce the key ITC intermediate in the sinapigladioside pathway. In vitro biotransformation assays identified RhdE, a prototype single&#8208;domain rhodanese, as the most potent ITC synthase.

     alt="Bacterial Isothiocyanate Biosynthesis by Rhodanese-Catalyzed Sulfur Transfer onto Isonitriles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel biosynthetic pathway towards isothiocyanate natural products is identified. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; biotransformation show that rhodanese-like proteins (Rhd), known for the detoxification of cyanide, have been recruited and neofunctionalized to catalyze sulfur incorporation into isonitriles in bacteria. This so far unknown function of rhodanese-like proteins is highly specific and plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the antifungal sinapigladioside from &lt;i&gt;Burkholderia gladioli&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural products bearing isothiocyanate (ITC) groups are an important group of specialized metabolites that play various roles in health, nutrition, and ecology. Whereas ITC biosynthesis via glucosinolates in plants has been studied in detail, there is a gap in understanding the bacterial route to specialized metabolites with such reactive heterocumulene groups, as in the antifungal sinapigladioside from &lt;i&gt;Burkholderia gladioli&lt;/i&gt;. Here we propose an alternative ITC pathway by enzymatic sulfur transfer onto isonitriles catalyzed by rhodanese-like enzymes (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferases). Mining the &lt;i&gt;B. gladioli&lt;/i&gt; genome revealed six candidate genes (&lt;i&gt;rhdA&#8211;F&lt;/i&gt;), which were individually expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. By means of a synthetic probe, the gene products were evaluated for their ability to produce the key ITC intermediate in the sinapigladioside pathway. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; biotransformation assays identified RhdE, a prototype single-domain rhodanese, as the most potent ITC synthase. Interestingly, while RhdE also efficiently transforms cyanide into thiocyanate, it shows high specificity for the natural pathway intermediate, indicating that the sinapigladioside pathway has recruited a ubiquitous detoxification enzyme for the formation of a bioactive specialized metabolite. These findings not only elucidate an elusive step in bacterial ITC biosynthesis but also reveal a new function of rhodanese-like enzymes in specialized metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microbial Biomanufacturing Using Chemically Synthesized Non&#8208;Natural Sugars as the Substrate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bioproduction of valuable materials using biomass sugars is attracting attention as an environmentally friendly technology. However, its ability to fulfil the enormous demand to produce fuels and chemical products is limited. With a view towards the future development of a novel bioproduction process that addresses these concerns, this study investigated the feasibility of bioproduction of valuable substances using Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) with a chemically synthesized non&#8208;natural sugar solution. Cells were grown using the synthesized sugar solution as the sole carbon source and they produced lactate under oxygen&#8208;limited conditions. It was also found that some of the sugars produced by the series of chemical reactions inhibited cell growth since prior removal of these sugars increased the cell growth rate. The results obtained in this study indicate that chemically synthesized sugars have the potential to resolve the concerns regarding future biomass sugar supply in microbial biomanufacturing.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) are major cell membrane components. Although various phosphorylated molecules are attached to lipid moieties as their headgroups, GPLs are biosynthesized from phosphatidic acid (PA) via its derivatives, diacylglycerol (DAG) or cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP&#8208;DAG). A variety of molecular probes capable of introducing detection tags have been developed to investigate biological events involved in GPLs. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel analytical tools suitable to monitor the activity of GPL biosynthetic enzymes in vitro. Our synthetic targets, namely, azide&#8208;modified PA, azide&#8208;modified DAG, and azide&#8208;modified CDP&#8208;DAG, were successfully obtained from solketal as their common starting material. Moreover, using CDP&#8208;diacylglycerol&#8208;inositol 3&#8208;phosphatidyltransferase (CDIPT), an enzyme that catalyzed the final reaction step in synthesizing phosphatidylinositol, we demonstrated that azide&#8208;modified CDP&#8208;DAG worked as a substrate for CDIPT.</dc:description>

         <title>New Dipterocarpol&#8208;Based Molecules with &#945;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibitory and Hypoglycemic Activity</title>

Abstract
Dammarane triterpenoids are affordable and bioactive natural metabolites with great structural potential, which makes them attractive sources for drug development. The aim of the study was to investigate the potency of new dipterocarpol derivatives for the treatment of diabetes. Two dammaranes (dipterocarpol and its 20(24)&#8208;diene derivative) were modified by a Claisen&#8208;Schmidt aldol condensation to afford C2(E)&#8208;arylidenes in good yields. The majority of the synthesized compounds exhibited an excellent&#8208;to&#8208;moderate inhibitory effect toward &#945;&#8208;glucosidase (from S. saccharomyces), among them eight compounds showed IC50 values less than 10&#8197;&#956;M. 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;dammarane&#8208;2(E)&#8208;benzylidenes (holding p&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; 3&#8201;l and p&#8208;carbonyl&#8208; 3&#8201;m substituents) demonstrated the most potent &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition with IC50 0.753 and 0.204&#8197;&#956;M, being 232&#8208; and 857&#8208;times more active than acarbose (IC50 174.90&#8197;&#956;M), and a high level of NO inhibition in Raw 264.7 cells with IC50 of 1.75 and 4.57&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. An in&#8197;vivo testing of compound 3&#8201;m (in a dose of 20&#8197;mg/kg) on a model of streptozotocin&#8208;induced T1DM in rats showed a pronounced hypoglycemic activity, the ability to reduce effectively the processes of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue and decrease the excretion of glucose and pyruvic acid in the urine. Compound 3&#8201;m reduced the death of diabetic rats and preserved their motor activity.

         <title>Promiscuity of Omphalotin A Biosynthetic Enzymes&#160;Allows de novo Production of Non&#8208;natural Multiply Backbone N&#8208;Methylated Peptide Macrocycles in Yeast</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple backbone N&#8208;methylation and macrocyclization improve the proteolytic stability and oral availability of therapeutic peptides. Chemical synthesis of such peptides is challenging, in particular for the generation of peptide libraries for screening purposes. Enzymatic backbone N&#8208;methylation and macrocyclization occur as part of both non&#8208;ribosomal and ribosomal peptide biosynthesis, exemplified by the fungal natural products cyclosporin A and omphalotin A, respectively. Omphalotin A, a ninefold backbone N&#8208;methylated dodecamer isolated from the agaricomycete Omphalotus olearius, can be produced in Pichia pastoris by coexpression of the ophMA and ophP genes coding for the peptide precursor protein harbouring an autocatalytic peptide &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;methyltransferase domain, and a peptide macrocyclase, respectively. Since both OphMA and OphP were previously shown to be relatively promiscuous in terms of peptide substrates, we expressed mutant versions of ophMA, encoding OphMA variants with altered core peptide sequences, along with wildtype ophP and assessed the production of the respective peptide macrocycles by the platform by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC&#8208;MS/MS). Our results demonstrate the successful production of fifteen non&#8208;natural omphalotin&#8208;derived macrocycles, containing polar, aromatic and charged residues, and, thus, suggest that the system may be used as biotechnological platform to generate libraries of non&#8208;natural multiply backbone N&#8208;methylated peptide macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Sulfotyrosine&#160;and Negatively Charged Amino Acid of Leech&#8208;Derived Peptides on Binding and Inhibitory Activity Against Thrombin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hirudins, natural sulfo(glyco)proteins, are clinical anticoagulants that directly inhibit thrombin, a key coagulation factor. Their potent thrombin inhibition primarily results from antagonistic interactions with both the catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic sites of thrombin. Hirudins often feature sulfate moieties on Tyr residues in their anionic C&#8208;terminus region, enabling strong interactions with thrombin exosite&#8208;I and effectively blocking its engagement with fibrinogen. Although sulfotyrosines have been identified in various hirudin variants, the precise relationship between sulfotyrosine and the number of negatively charged amino acids within the anionic&#8208;rich C&#8208;terminus peptide domain for the binding of thrombin has remained elusive. By using Fmoc&#8208;SPPS, hirudin dodecapeptides homologous to the C&#8208;terminus of hirudin variants from various leech species were successfully synthesized, and the effect of sulfotyrosine and the number of negatively charged amino acids on hirudin&#8208;thrombin interactions was investigated. Our findings did not reveal any synergistic effect between an increasing number of sulfotyrosines or negatively charged amino acids and their inhibitory activity on thrombin or fibrinolysis in the assays, despite a higher binding level toward thrombin in the sulfated dodecapeptide Hnip_Hirudin was observed in SPR analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Development of Cyclic Peptide Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The proteasome degrades proteins, which is essential for cellular homeostasis. Ubiquitin independent proteolysis degrades highly disordered and misfolded proteins. A decline of proteasomal activity has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. In this work, cyclic peptide proteasome stimulators (CyPPSs) that enhance the clearance of misfolded proteins were discovered. In the initial screen of predicted natural products (pNPs), several cyclic peptides were found to stimulate the 20S core particle (20S CP).&#160; Development of a robust structural activity relationship led to the identification of potent, cell permeable CyPPSs. In&#8208;vitro assays revealed that CyPPSs stimulate degradation of highly disordered and misfolded proteins without affecting ordered proteins. Furthermore, using a novel flow&#8208;based assay for proteasome activity, several CyPPSs were found to stimulate the 20S CP in&#8208;cellulo. Overall, this work describes the development of CyPPSs as chemical tools capable of stimulating the proteasome and provides strong support for proteasome stimulation as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Strategies for the Biosynthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Amino Acid Amides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bond&#8208;containing biomolecules are functionally significant and useful compounds with diverse applications. For example, N&#8208;acyl amino acids (NAAAs) are an important class of lipoamino acid amides with extensive use in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Their conventional chemical synthesis involves the use of toxic chlorinating agents for carboxylic acid activation. Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed biotransformation for the green synthesis of these amides is therefore highly desirable. Here, we review a range of enzymes suitable for the synthesis of NAAA amides and their strategies adopted in carboxylic acid activation. Generally, ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes for NAAA biosynthesis are acyl&#8208;adenylating enzymes that couple the hydrolysis of phosphoanhydride bond in ATP with the formation of an acyl&#8208;adenylate intermediate. In contrast, ATP&#8208;independent enzymes involve hydrolases such as lipases or aminoacylases, which rely on the transient activation of the carboxylic acid. This occurs either through an acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate or by favorable interactions with surrounding residues to anchor the acyl donor in a suitable orientation for the incoming amine nucleophile. Recently, the development of an alternative pathway involving ester&#8208;amide interconversion has unraveled another possible strategy for amide formation through esterification&#8208;aminolysis cascade reactions, potentially expanding the substrate scope for enzymes to catalyze the synthesis of a diverse range of NAAA amides.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenic Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes with Yellow and Red Fluorescence for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An orange&#8208; and a red&#8208;emitting tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. Both dyes use the concept of the &#8220;two&#8208;factor&#8221; fluorogenicity for nucleic acids: (i) The dyes are nucleic&#8208;acid sensitive by their non&#8208;covalent binding to DNA, and (ii) their covalently attached tetrazine moiety quench the fluorescence. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208; and spirohexene&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to k2=280,000&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 305. Both dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with spirohexene&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The fluorescence is enhanced in vivo to such an extent that washing procedures before cell imaging are not required. Their large Stokes shifts (up to 0.77 eV) also makes them well suited for imaging because the wavelength ranges for excitation and emission can be best possible separated. Furthermore, the spirohexene&#8208;modified nucleosides and DNA extend and improve the toolbox of already existing &#8220;clickable&#8221; dyes for live cell imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lateral Flow Assay Based on Streptavidin&#8208;biotin Amplification System with Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Rapid and Quantitative Detection of Salmonella enteritidis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptavidin&#8208;biotin amplification system alone can be used as a reporter protein probe for rapid quantitative identification of salmonella. Quantitative results are captured via a smartphone and transmitted to computer software to precisely calculate the target amount. This diagnostic method accommodates both lower limits of detection and quantitative specifications and permits testing of additional pathogens merely through the inclusion of primer design steps.







Abstract
Salmonella constitutes a prevalent alimentary pathogen, instigating zoonotic afflictions. Consequently, the prompt discernment of Salmonella in sustenance is of cardinal significance. Lateral flow assays utilizing colorimetric methodologies adequately fulfill the prerequisites of point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics, however, their detection threshold remains elevated, generally permitting only qualitative discernment, an impediment to the preliminary screening of nascent pathogens. In response to this conundrum, we propose a lateral flow diagnostic predicated upon a streptavidin&#8208;biotin amplification system with recombinase polymerase amplification engineered for the expeditious and quantitative discernment of Salmonella enteritidis. Trace nucleic acids within a sample undergo exponential amplification via recombinase polymerase amplification to a level discernable, constituting the initial signal amplification. Subsequently, along the test line (T&#8208;line) of the lateral flow strip, the chromatic signal undergoes augmentation by securing a greater quantity of AuNPs through the magnification capacity of the streptavidin&#8208;biotin mechanism, affecting the second signal amplification. Quantitative results are procured via smartphone capture and transferred to computer software for precise calculation of the targeted quantity. The lateral flow strip exhibits a LOD at 19.41&#8197;CFU/mL for cultured S. enteritidis. The RSD of three varying concentrations were respectively 3.74&#8201;%, 5.96&#8201;%, and 4.25&#8201;%.

         <title>Hoechst&#8208;Modification on Oligodeoxynucleotides for Efficient Transport to the Cell Nucleus and Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have been developed for regulating gene expression, however, few ODNs are actively transported into the cell nucleus, even though antisense function in the cell nucleus. Herein, we successfully designed and characterized ODNs modified with Hoechst molecule for accumulation and transport into the cell nucleus.







Abstract
Various artificial oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that contribute to gene regulation have been developed and their diversity and multifunctionality have been demonstrated. However, few artificial ODNs are actively transported to the cell nucleus, despite the fact that gene regulation also takes place in both the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. In this study, to prepare ODNs with the ability to accumulate in the cell nucleus, we introduced Hoechst molecules into ODNs that act as carriers of functional molecules to the cell nucleus (Hoe&#8208;ODNs). We synthesized Hoe&#8208;ODNs and confirmed that they bound strongly to DNA duplexes. When single&#8208;stranded Hoe&#8208;ODNs or double&#8208;stranded ODNs consisting of Hoe&#8208;ODNs and its complementary strand were administered into living cells, both ODNs were efficiently accumulated in the cell nucleus. In addition, antisense ODNs, which were tethered with Hoechst unit, were delivered into the cell nucleus and efficiently suppressed the expression of their target RNA. Thus, we constructed a delivery system that enables the transport of ODNs into cell nucleus.

         <title>Dimer Stabilization by SpyTag/SpyCatcher Coupling of the Reductase Domains of a Chimeric P450 BM3 Monooxygenase from Bacillus spp. Improves its Stability, Activity, and Purification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction prevents dissociation of the dimeric, self&#8208;sufficient P450 BM3 monooxygenase CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. The covalent isopeptide bond was incorporated at the C&#8208;terminus of a representative P450 BM3 chimera bearing a homologous reductase domain of the CYP102A3 from Bacillus subtilis. As a consequence, enzyme stability and catalysis have been affected positively.







Abstract
The vast majority of known enzymes exist as oligomers, which often gives them high catalytic performance but at the same time imposes constraints on structural conformations and environmental conditions. An example of an enzyme with a complex architecture is the P450 BM3 monooxygenase CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. Only active as a dimer, it is highly sensitive to dilution or common immobilization techniques. In this study, we engineered a thermostable P450BM3 chimera consisting of the heme domain of a CYP102A1 variant and the reductase domain of the homologous CYP102A3. The dimerization of the hybrid was even weaker compared to the corresponding CYP102A1 variant. To create a stable dimer, we covalently coupled the C&#8208;termini of two monomers of the chimera via SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003 interaction. As a result, purification, thermostability, pH stability, and catalytic activity were improved. Via a bioorthogonal two&#8208;step affinity purification, we obtained high purity (94&#8201;%) of the dimer&#8208;stabilized variant being robust against heme depletion. Long&#8208;term stability was increased with a half&#8208;life of over 2&#8197;months at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8211;90&#8201;% residual activity after 2&#8197;months at 5&#8201;&#176;C. Most catalytic features were retained with even an enhancement of the overall activity by ~2&#8208;fold compared to the P450BM3 chimera without SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction&lt;/b&gt; prevents dissociation of the dimeric, self-sufficient P450 BM3 monooxygenase CYP102A1 from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt;. The covalent isopeptide bond was incorporated at the C-terminus of a representative P450 BM3 chimera bearing a homologous reductase domain of the CYP102A3 from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;. As a consequence, enzyme stability and catalysis have been affected positively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of known enzymes exist as oligomers, which often gives them high catalytic performance but at the same time imposes constraints on structural conformations and environmental conditions. An example of an enzyme with a complex architecture is the P450 BM3 monooxygenase CYP102A1 from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt;. Only active as a dimer, it is highly sensitive to dilution or common immobilization techniques. In this study, we engineered a thermostable P450&lt;sub&gt;BM3&lt;/sub&gt; chimera consisting of the heme domain of a CYP102A1 variant and the reductase domain of the homologous CYP102A3. The dimerization of the hybrid was even weaker compared to the corresponding CYP102A1 variant. To create a stable dimer, we covalently coupled the C-termini of two monomers of the chimera via SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003 interaction. As a result, purification, thermostability, pH stability, and catalytic activity were improved. Via a bioorthogonal two-step affinity purification, we obtained high purity (94&#8201;%) of the dimer-stabilized variant being robust against heme depletion. Long-term stability was increased with a half-life of over 2&#8197;months at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8211;90&#8201;% residual activity after 2&#8197;months at 5&#8201;&#176;C. Most catalytic features were retained with even an enhancement of the overall activity by ~2-fold compared to the P450&lt;sub&gt;BM3&lt;/sub&gt; chimera without SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in RNA&#8208;Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA interference (RNAi) that can specifically regulate the expression and function of certain genes by accurately delivering siRNA to disease lesions, blocking RNAs by small molecules, or covalently modifying the nucleotides has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in gene regulation and protein biosynthesis. Interfering the physiological function of key RNAs to induce cell apoptosis holds great promise for cancer treatment. Many RNA&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;cancer strategies have emerged continuously. Among them, RNA interference (RNAi) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic modality for various disease treatments. Nevertheless, the primary obstacle in siRNA delivery&#8208;escaping the endosome and crossing the plasma membrane severely impedes its therapeutic potential. Thus far, a variety of nanosystems as well as carrier&#8208;free bioconjugation for siRNA delivery have been developed and employed to enhance the drug delivery and anti&#8208;tumor efficiency. Besides, the use of small molecules to target specific RNA structures and disrupt their function, along with the covalent modification of RNA, has also drawn tremendous attention recently owing to high therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we will provide an overview of recent progress in RNA&#8208;targeted cancer therapy including various siRNA delivery strategies, RNA&#8208;targeting small molecules, and newly emerged covalent RNA modification. Finally, challenges and future perspectives faced in this research field will be discussed.

         <title>Quantitative Analysis of 2D EXSY NMR Spectra of Strongly Coupled Spin Systems in Transmembrane Exchange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative interpretation of cross&#8208;peaks in 2D EXSY spectra of compounds with strongly coupled spins undergoing transmembrane exchange required brute&#8208;force numerical fitting to extract rate constants.







Abstract
Solute translocation by membrane transport proteins is a vital biological process that can be tracked, on the sub&#8208;second timescale, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Fluorinated substrate analogues facilitate such studies because of high sensitivity of 19F&#8197;NMR and absence of background signals. Accurate extraction of translocation rate constants requires precise quantification of NMR signal intensities. This becomes complicated in the presence of J&#8208;couplings, cross&#8208;correlations, and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) that alter signal integrals through mechanisms unrelated to translocation. Geminal difluorinated motifs introduce strong and hard&#8208;to&#8208;quantify contributions from non&#8208;exchange effects, the nuanced nature of which makes them hard to integrate into data analysis methodologies. With analytical expressions not being available, numerical least squares fitting of theoretical models to 2D spectra emerges as the preferred quantification approach. For large spin systems with simultaneous coherent evolution, cross&#8208;relaxation, cross&#8208;correlation, conformational exchange, and membrane translocation between compartments with different viscosities, the only available simulation framework is Spinach. In this study, we demonstrate GLUT&#8208;1 dependent membrane transport of two model sugars featuring CF2 and CF2CF2 fluorination motifs, with precise determination of translocation rate constants enabled by numerical fitting of 2D EXSY spectra. For spin systems and kinetic networks of this complexity, this was not previously tractable.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Immobilization of TCEP on Silica Beads for Efficient Disulfide Reduction and Thiol Alkylation in Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TCEP immobilized on agarose is widely used for efficient reduction of cysteines in peptides and proteins, but the reducing capacity is rather low. Herein, we have compared different solid supports for TCEP immobilization and found that silica&#8208;TCEP has an 8&#8208;fold higher reduction capacity, allowing thiol reduction of peptides at millimolar concentrations.







Abstract
Tris&#8208;(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) linked to agarose beads is widely used for reducing disulfide bridges in proteins and peptides. The immobilization of TCEP on beads allows efficient removal after reduction to prevent its reaction with alkylating reagents and thus interference with conjugation reactions. However, a limitation of agarose TCEP is its relatively low reduction capacity per milliliter of wet beads (about 15&#8197;&#956;mol/ml), making it unsuitable for the reduction of disulfides from molecules at millimolar concentrations. In this work, we tested the immobilization of TCEP to a range of different solid supports and found that conjugation to silica gel offers TCEP beads with about 8&#8208;fold higher reduction capacity (129&#177;16&#8197;&#956;mol/ml wet beads). We show that it allows reducing disulfide&#8208;cyclized peptides at millimolar concentrations for subsequent cyclization by bis&#8208;electrophile linker reagents. Given the substantially higher reduction capacity, the robust performance in different solvents, the low cost of the silica gel, and the ease of functionalization with TCEP, the silica gel&#8208;TCEP is suited for reducing disulfide bridges in essentially any peptide and is particularly useful for reducing peptides at higher concentrations.

         <dc:description>Zinc homeostasis, which allows optimal zinc utilization in diverse life processes, is responsible for the general well&#8208;being of human beings. This paper describes developing and validating an easily accessible indole&#8208;containing zinc&#8208;specific probe in the cellular milieu. The probe was synthesized from readily available starting materials and was subjected to steady&#8208;state fluorescence studies. It showed selective sensing behavior towards Zn2+ with reversible binding. The suppression of PET (Photoinduced Electron Transfer) and ESIPT (Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer) elicited selectivity, and the detection limit was 0.63 &#181;M (LOQ 6.8 &#181;M). The zinc sensing capability of the probe was also screened in the presence of low molecular weight ligands [LMWLs] and showed interference only with GSH and ATP. It is non&#8208;toxic and can detect zinc in different cell lines under various stress conditions such as inflammation, hyperglycemia, and apoptosis. The probe could stain the early and late stages of apoptosis in PAN&#8208;2 cells by monitoring the zinc release. Most experiments were conducted without external zinc supplementation, showing its innate ability to detect zinc.</dc:description>

Lipopolysaccharides from the commensal gut&#8208;associated microbiota are interesting biomolecules for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. The recent synthesis of lipopolysaccharides from gut&#8208;associated lymphoid&#8208;tissue&#8208;resident Alcaligenes faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus are highlighted.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharides from the commensal gut&#8208;associated microbiota are interesting biomolecules for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. Different from pathogenic lipopolysaccharides, commensal lipopolysaccharides have distinct chemical structures and mediate beneficial homeostasis with the immune system of the host. However, the accessibility issues of homogenous and pure commensal lipopolysaccharides hampered the in&#8208;depth studies of their functions. In this concept article, we highlight the recent synthesis of lipopolysaccharides from gut&#8208;associated lymphoid&#8208;tissue&#8208;resident Alcaligenes faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus, which hopes to inspire the more efforts devoting to these fantastic biomolecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipopolysaccharides from the commensal gut-associated microbiota are interesting biomolecules for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. Different from pathogenic lipopolysaccharides, commensal lipopolysaccharides have distinct chemical structures and mediate beneficial homeostasis with the immune system of the host. However, the accessibility issues of homogenous and pure commensal lipopolysaccharides hampered the in-depth studies of their functions. In this concept article, we highlight the recent synthesis of lipopolysaccharides from gut-associated lymphoid-tissue-resident &lt;i&gt;Alcaligenes faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;, which hopes to inspire the more efforts devoting to these fantastic biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biotransformation of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids to Trioxilins by Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sajor&#8208;caju</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Usually, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are converted to trioxylins (TrXs) by lipoxygenase (LOX) along with epoxide hydrolase. Here, LOX from Pleurotus sajor&#8208;caju directly converts PUFAs to TrXs with catalytic activities of hydroxylation, epoxidation, and hydrolysis of the epoxy group as an efficient TrXs&#8208;producing enzyme.







Abstract
A lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sajor&#8208;caju (PsLOX) was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified as a soluble protein with a specific activity of 629&#8197;&#956;mol/min/mg for arachidonic acid (AA). The native PsLOX exhibited a molecular mass of 146&#8197;kDa, including a 73&#8208;kDa homodimer, as estimated by gel&#8208;filtration chromatography. The major products converted from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were identified as trioxilins (TrXs), namely 13,14,15&#8208;TrXB3, 13,14,15&#8208;TrXB4, and 15,16,17&#8208;TrXB5, respectively, through high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS/MS) analyses. The enzyme displayed its maximum activity at pH&#8197;8.0 and 20&#8201;&#176;C. Under these conditions, the specific activity and catalytic efficiency of PsLOX for PUFAs exhibited the following order: AA&gt;EPA&gt;DHA. Based on HPLC analysis and substrate specificity, PsLOX was identified as an arachidonate 15&#8208;LOX. PsLOX efficiently converted 10&#8197;mM of AA, EPA, and DHA to 8.7&#8197;mM of 13,14,15&#8208;TrXB3 (conversion rate: 87&#8201;%), 7.9&#8197;mM of 13,14,15&#8208;TrXB4 (79&#8201;%), and 7.2&#8197;mM of 15,16,17&#8208;TrXB5 (72&#8201;%) in 15, 20, and 20&#8197;min, respectively, marking the highest conversion rates reported to date. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PsLOX is an efficient TrXs&#8208;producing enzyme.

         <title>A Degron Blocking Strategy Towards Improved CRL4CRBN Recruiting PROTAC Selectivity
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of CRL4CRBN recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is currently still a largely empirical process and the design principles are still to be deciphered. Herein, a design strategy to generate CRL4CRBN PROTACs selective for a target of interest by dialling&#8208;out the molecular glue function of thalidomide derivatives is reported.







Abstract
Small molecules inducing protein degradation are important pharmacological tools to interrogate complex biology and are rapidly translating into clinical agents. However, to fully realise the potential of these molecules, selectivity remains a limiting challenge. Herein, we addressed the issue of selectivity in the design of CRL4CRBN recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). Thalidomide derivatives used to generate CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTACs have well described intrinsic monovalent degradation profiles by inducing the recruitment of neo&#8208;substrates, such as GSPT1, Ikaros and Aiolos. We leveraged structural insights from known CRL4CRBN neo&#8208;substrates to attenuate and indeed remove this monovalent degradation function in well&#8208;known CRL4CRBN molecular glues degraders, namely CC&#8208;885 and Pomalidomide. We then applied these design principles on a previously published BRD9 PROTAC (dBRD9&#8208;A) and generated an analogue with improved selectivity profile. Finally, we implemented a computational modelling pipeline to show that our degron blocking design does not impact PROTAC&#8208;induced ternary complex formation. We believe that the tools and principles presented in this work will be valuable to support the development of targeted protein degradation.

         <title>Covalent Targeting of Glutamate Cysteine Ligase to Inhibit Glutathione Synthesis
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have discovered a covalent inhibitor of glutamate&#8208;cysteine ligase (GCL) that targets an allosteric C114 in the regulatory subunit GCLM to inhibit GCL activity, lower GSH levels, and impair cell viability in ARID1A&#8208;negative cancer cells.







Abstract
Dysregulated oxidative stress plays a major role in cancer pathogenesis and some types of cancer cells are particularly vulnerable to inhibition of their cellular antioxidant capacity. Glutamate&#8208;cysteine ligase (GCL) is the first and rate&#8208;limiting step in the synthesis of the major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Developing a GCL inhibitor may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for certain cancer types that are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress. In this study, we reveal a cysteine&#8208;reactive ligand, EN25, that covalently targets an allosteric cysteine C114 on GCLM, the modifier subunit of GCL, and leads to inhibition of GCL activity. This interaction also leads to reduced cellular GSH levels and impaired cell viability in ARID1A&#8208;deficient cancer cells, which are particularly vulnerable to glutathione depletion, but not in ARID1A&#8208;positive cancer cells. Our studies uncover a novel potential ligandable site within GCLM that can be targeted to inhibit GSH synthesis in vulnerable cancer cell types.

         <title>Effect of Hyaluronic Acid on the Self&#8208;Assembly of a Dipeptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Gel</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;component hydrogel made of a dipeptide amphiphile and hyaluronic acid (HA) is reported. A minimal amount of HA is enough to control polymorphism and rheological performance of the material. The hydrogel has been studied for suspended cell growth avoiding cell sedimentation even in the presence of competing cell&#8208;adhesive surfaces, which can be of interest for advanced cell delivery techniques.







Abstract
The combination of polymers and low molecular weight (LMW) compounds is a powerful approach to prepare new supramolecular materials. Here we prepare two&#8208;component hydrogels made by a well&#8208;known and biologically active polymer, hyaluronic acid (HA), and a dipeptide&#8208;based supramolecular gelator. We undertake a detailed study of materials with different compositions including macroscopic (hydrogel formation, rheology) and micro/nanoscopic characterization (electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction). We observe that the two components mutually benefit in the new materials: a minimum amount of HA helps to reduce the polymorphism of the LMW network leading to reproducible hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; the LMW component network holds HA without the need for an irreversible covalent crosslinking. These materials have a great potential for biomedical application as, for instance, extracellular matrix mimetics for cell growth. As a proof of concept, we have observed that this material is effective for cell growth in suspension and avoids cell sedimentation even in the presence of competing cell&#8208;adhesive surfaces. This may be of interest to advanced cell delivery techniques.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Chemistry on Glycoside Hydrolases &#8211; A Proof of Concept Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report ligand&#8208;directed chemistry for covalent proximity labelling of two model &#946;&#8208;glucosidases employing small molecule iminosugar based probes in a proof of concept study. Successful enzyme labelling with respective designed and synthesized probes was determined by fluorescent readout of SDS page. Catalytic enzyme activity was maintained after the labelling process.







Abstract
Selective covalent labelling of enzymes using small molecule probes has advanced the scopes of protein profiling. The covalent bond formation to a specific target is the key step of activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP), a method which has become an indispensable tool for measuring enzyme activity in complex matrices. With respect to carbohydrate processing enzymes, strategies for ABPP so far involve labelling the active site of the enzyme, which results in permanent loss of activity. Here, we report in a proof of concept study the use of ligand&#8208;directed chemistry (LDC) for labelling glycoside hydrolases near &#8211; but not in &#8211; the active site. During the labelling process, the competitive inhibitor is cleaved from the probe, departs the active site and the enzyme maintains its catalytic activity. To this end, we designed a building block synthetic concept for small molecule probes containing iminosugar&#8208;based reversible inhibitors for labelling of two model &#946;&#8208;glucosidases. The results indicate that the LDC approach can be adaptable for covalent proximity labelling of glycoside hydrolases.

         <title>Towards Copper(I) Clusters for Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Biological Thiols in Living Cells
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim of developing compounds capable of specifically inducing fatal in&#8197;cellulo redox reactions upon light irradiation, we have prepared, characterized, and studied a series of copper(I) clusters with thiopyrimidine ligands. The clusters display high photooxidation capacity towards cysteine &#8211; an essential amino acid &#8211; upon light irradiation in the visible range (450&#8197;nm), while remaining completely inactive in the dark.







Abstract
The cell redox balance can be disrupted by the oxidation of biological peptides, eventually leading to cell death, which provides opportunities to develop cytotoxic drugs. With the aim of developing compounds capable of specifically inducing fatal redox reactions upon light irradiation, we have developed a library of copper compounds. This metal is abundant and considered essential for human health, making it particularly attractive for the development of new anticancer drugs. Copper(I) clusters with thiol ligands (including&#8197;5 novel ones) have been synthesized and characterized. Structures were elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and showed that the compounds are oligomeric clusters. The clusters display high photooxidation capacity towards cysteine &#8211; an essential amino acid &#8211; upon light irradiation in the visible range (450&#8197;nm), while remaining completely inactive in the dark. This photoredox activity against a biological thiol is very encouraging for the development of anticancer photoredox drugs.The in&#8197;vitro assay on murine colorectal cancer cells (CT26) did not show any toxicity &#8211; whether in the dark or when exposed to 450&#8197;nm light, likely because of the poor solubility of the complexes in biological medium.

         <title>Bispidine as a Versatile Scaffold: From Topological Hosts to Transmembrane Transporters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We delineate a highly versatile strategy for the synthesis of topologically intriguing molecule and self&#8208;assembling macrocycles. The self&#8208;assembly of the macrocycle to nanotube displays unconventional interactions such as dihydrogen bonding. The nanotubular assembly acts as a channel for transmembrane ion transport as evident from patch clamp experiments.







Abstract
The development of designer topological structures is a synthetically challenging endeavor. We present herein bispidine as a platform for the design of molecules with various topologies and functions. The bispidine&#8208;based acyclic molecule, which shows intriguing S&#8208;shape topology, is discussed. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that this molecule exists in the solid state as two conformational enantiomers. In addition, bispidine&#8208;based designer macrocycles were synthesized and investigated for ionophoric properties. Patch clamp experiments revealed that these macrocycles transport both anions and cations non&#8208;specifically with at least tenfold higher chloride conductance over the cations under the given experimental conditions. Ultramicroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies indicated that the self&#8208;assembling macrocycle forms a tubular assembly. Our design highlights the use of unconventional dihydrogen interactions in nanotube fabrication.

         <title>Biotransamination of Furan&#8208;Based Aldehydes with Isopropylamine: Enzyme Screening and pH Influence</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biotransamination of furfural, 5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) and 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) with isopropylamine has been studied at different substrate and amine donor concentrations with a series of amine transaminases. These processes have been thoroughly optimized taking into account several parameters, being the pH a key factor due to its influence on the in&#8197;situ formation of undesired (poly)imines.







Abstract
Furan&#8208;based amines are highly valuable compounds which can be directly obtained via reductive amination from easily accessible furfural, 5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) and 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF). Herein the biocatalytic amination of these carbonyl derivatives is disclosed using amine transaminases (ATAs) and isopropylamine (IPA) as amine donors. Among the different biocatalysts tested, the ones from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv&#8208;TA), Arthrobacter citreus (ArS&#8208;TA), and variants from Arthrobacter sp. (ArRmut11&#8208;TA) and Vibrio fluvialis (Vf&#8208;mut&#8208;TA), afforded high levels of product formation (&gt;80&#8201;%) at 100&#8211;200&#8197;mM aldehyde concentration. The transformations were studied in terms of enzyme and IPA loading. The pH influence was found as a key factor and attributed to the imine/aldehyde equilibrium that can arise from the high reactivity of the carbonyl substrates with a nucleophilic amine such as IPA.

         <title>The Conversion of UDP&#8208;Glc to UDP&#8208;Man: In Silico and Biochemical Exploration To Improve the Catalytic Efficiency of CDP&#8208;Tyvelose C2&#8208;Epimerases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promiscuous CDP&#8208;tyvelose 2&#8208;epimerase (TyvE) converts NDP&#8208;glucose to NDP&#8208;mannose. We present the sequence fingerprints that are indicative of this conversion in TyvE&#8208;like enzymes. Eleven TyvE&#8208;like enzymes were identified, and the top two wild&#8208;type candidates and a quadruple mutant were characterized. The improved catalytic efficiency of these enzymes might help the design of new nucleotide production pathways starting from a cheap sugar substrates like sucrose.







Abstract
A promiscuous CDP&#8208;tyvelose 2&#8208;epimerase (TyvE) from Thermodesulfatator atlanticus (TaTyvE) belonging to the nucleotide sugar active short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (NS&#8208;SDRs) was recently discovered. TaTyvE performs the slow conversion of NDP&#8208;glucose (NDP&#8208;Glc) to NDP&#8208;mannose (NDP&#8208;Man). Here, we present the sequence fingerprints that are indicative of the conversion of UDP&#8208;Glc to UDP&#8208;Man in TyvE&#8208;like enzymes based on the heptagonal box motifs. Our data&#8208;mining approach led to the identification of 11 additional TyvE&#8208;like enzymes for the conversion of UDP&#8208;Glc to UDP&#8208;Man. We characterized the top two wild&#8208;type candidates, which show a 15&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency, respectively, on UDP&#8208;Glc compared to TaTyvE. In addition, we present a quadruple variant of one of the identified enzymes with a 70&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency on UDP&#8208;Glc compared to TaTyvE. These findings could help the design of new nucleotide production pathways starting from a cheap sugar substrate like glucose or sucrose.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promiscuous CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase&lt;/b&gt; (TyvE) converts NDP-glucose to NDP-mannose. We present the sequence fingerprints that are indicative of this conversion in TyvE-like enzymes. Eleven TyvE-like enzymes were identified, and the top two wild-type candidates and a quadruple mutant were characterized. The improved catalytic efficiency of these enzymes might help the design of new nucleotide production pathways starting from a cheap sugar substrates like sucrose.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promiscuous CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase (TyvE) from &lt;i&gt;Thermodesulfatator atlanticus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ta&lt;/i&gt;TyvE) belonging to the nucleotide sugar active short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (NS-SDRs) was recently discovered. &lt;i&gt;Ta&lt;/i&gt;TyvE performs the slow conversion of NDP-glucose (NDP-Glc) to NDP-mannose (NDP-Man). Here, we present the sequence fingerprints that are indicative of the conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-Man in TyvE-like enzymes based on the heptagonal box motifs. Our data-mining approach led to the identification of 11 additional TyvE-like enzymes for the conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-Man. We characterized the top two wild-type candidates, which show a 15- and 20-fold improved catalytic efficiency, respectively, on UDP-Glc compared to &lt;i&gt;Ta&lt;/i&gt;TyvE. In addition, we present a quadruple variant of one of the identified enzymes with a 70-fold improved catalytic efficiency on UDP-Glc compared to &lt;i&gt;Ta&lt;/i&gt;TyvE. These findings could help the design of new nucleotide production pathways starting from a cheap sugar substrate like glucose or sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Biocatalytic &#945;&#8208;Deuteration of L&#8208;Amino Acids by a Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;Phosphate&#8208;Dependent Mannich Cyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PLP&#8208;dependent Mannich cyclase LolT is repurposed for &#945;&#8208;deuteration of amino acids. Complete deuteration can be achieved with diverse L&#8208;amino acids bearing assorted functional groups, e.&#8201;g. from lysine to glutamic acid. The broad substrate scope and strict stereoselectivity make LolT a powerful biocatalyst for preparation of &#945;&#8208;deuterated L&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Deuterated amino acids are valuable building blocks for developing deuterated drugs, and are important tools for studying biological systems. Biocatalytic deuteration represents an attractive strategy to directly access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;deuterated amino acids. Here, we show that a PLP&#8208;dependent Mannich cyclase, LolT, involved in the biosynthesis of loline alkaloids, is capable of deuterating a diverse range of L&#8208;amino acids, including basic and acidic, nonpolar and polar, aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. Furthermore, complete deuteration of many amino acids can be achieved within minutes with exquisite control on the site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. During the course of this investigation, we also unexpectedly discovered that LolT exhibits &#946;&#8208;elimination activity with L&#8208;cystine and O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;serine, confirming our previous hypothesis based on structural and phylogenetic analysis that LolT, a C&#945;&#8722;C bond forming enzyme, is evolved from a primordial C&#946;&#8722;S lyase family. Overall, our study demonstrates that LolT is an extremely versatile biocatalyst, and can be used for not only heterocyclic quaternary amino acid biosynthesis, but also biocatalytic amino acid deuteration.

         <title>Development of Multivalent Conjugates with a Single Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of a sequential preparation of multivalent bioconjugates using a single non&#8208;canonical amino acid. Through the genetic incorporation of a halogenated alkynyl amino acid a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditon followed by a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling can facilitate the introduction of two unique moieties to a protein in a site&#8208;specific fashion.







Abstract
Proteins represent powerful biomacromolecules due to their unique functionality and broad utility both in the cell and in non&#8208;biological applications. The genetic encoding of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) facilitates functional diversification of these already powerful proteins. Specifically, ncAAs have been demonstrated to provide unique functional handles to bioorthogonally introduce novel functionality via conjugation reactions. Herein we examine the ability of a single ncAA to serve as a handle to generate multivalent bioconjugates to introduce two or more additional components to a protein, yielding a multivalent conjugate. To accomplish this aim, p&#8208;bromopropargyloxyphenyalanine (pBrPrF) was genetically encoded into both superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) and ubiquitin model proteins to serve as a conjugation handle. A sequential bioconjugation sequence involving a copper&#8208;assisted cycloaddition reaction coupled with a subsequent Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling was then optimized. The linkage of two additional molecules to the model protein via these reactions yielded the desired multivalent bioconjugate. This domino approach using a single ncAA has a plethora of applications in both therapeutics and diagnostics as multiple unique moieties can be introduced into proteins in a highly controlled fashion.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Binding of Adenosine by Aptamers Selected Using Theophylline</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly selected DNA aptamer for theophylline can also bind adenosine, whereas the classical RNA aptamer cannot. Theophylline and adenosine are related molecules in regulating sleep, suggesting that nucleic acids also have the chemical basis for a similar function.







Abstract
We recently reported that some adenosine binding aptamers can also bind caffeine and theophylline with around 20&#8208;fold lower affinities. This discovery led to the current work to examine the cross&#8208;binding of adenosine to theophylline aptamers. For the DNA aptamer for theophylline, cross&#8208;binding to adenosine was observed, and the affinity was 18 to 38&#8208;fold lower for adenosine based on assays using isothermal titration calorimetry and ThT fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding complexes were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, and both adenosine and theophylline showed an overall similar binding structure to the DNA theophylline aptamer, although small differences were also observed. In contrast, the RNA aptamer did not show binding to adenosine, although both aptamers have very similar relative selectivity for various methylxanthines including caffeine. After a negative selection, a few new aptamers with completely different primary sequences for theophylline were obtained and they did not show binding to adenosine. Thus, there are many ways for aptamers to bind theophylline and some can have cross&#8208;binding to adenosine. In biology, theophylline, caffeine, and adenosine can bind to the same protein receptors to regulate sleep, and their binding to the same DNA motifs may suggest an early role of nucleic acids in similar regulatory functions.

         <title>Biotransformation Of l&#8208;Tryptophan To Produce Arcyriaflavin A With Pseudomonas putida KT2440</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arcyriaflavin A was produced in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 using genes from Lentzea aerocolonigenes. Cultivation conditions and supply of the precursor l&#8208;tryptophan were optimized. Genetic engineering of outer membrane vesicle release and cultivation with polyurethane adsorbent resulted in product enrichment in the supernatant. Overall, 4.7&#8197;mg arcyriaflavin A were obtained from 1&#8197;L bacterial culture representing a ten&#8208;fold increase in productivity.







Abstract
Natural products such as indolocarbazoles are a valuable source of highly bioactive compounds with numerous potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Arcyriaflavin A, isolated from marine invertebrates and slime molds, is one representative of this group and acts as a cyclin D1&#8208;cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 4 inhibitor. To date, access to this compound has mostly relied on multi&#8208;step total synthesis. In this study, biosynthetic access to arcyriaflavin A was explored using recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440 based on a previously generated producer strain. We used a Design of Experiment approach to analyze four key parameters, which led to the optimization of the bioprocess. By engineering the formation of outer membrane vesicles and using an adsorbent in the culture broth, we succeeded to increase the yield of arcyriaflavin A in the cell&#8208;free supernatant, resulting in a nearly eight&#8208;fold increase in the overall production titers. Finally, we managed to scale up the bioprocess leading to a final yield of 4.7&#8197;mg arcyriaflavin A product isolated from 1&#8197;L of bacterial culture. Thus, this study showcases an integrative approach to improve biotransformation and moreover also provides starting points for further optimization of indolocarbazole production in P. putida.

Thus, this study showcases an integrative approach to improve biotransformation and moreover also provides starting points for further optimization of indolocarbazole production in &lt;i&gt;P. putida&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Case of Convergent Evolution: The Bacterial Sesquiterpene Synthase for 1&#8208;epi&#8208;Cubenol from Nonomuraea coxensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high yielding sesquiterpene synthase for (+)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;cubenol from the actinomycete Nonomuraea coxensis was investigated for its cyclisation mechanism by isotopic labelling experiments. Several derivatives of (+)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;cubenol and of the plant derived compounds (&#8722;)&#8208;cubenol and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;cubenol have been prepared, including an epoxide that is known as a natural product from brown algae.







Abstract
A terpene synthase from Nonomuraea coxensis was identified as (+)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;cubenol synthase. The enzyme is phylogenetically unrelated to the known enzyme of the same function that is widespread in streptomycetes. Isotopic labelling experiments were performed to unambiguously assign the NMR data and to investigate hydrogen migrations during terpene cyclisations. Epoxidations of (+)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;cubenol and of the plant derived compounds (&#8722;)&#8208;cubenol and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;cubenol confirmed the structure of a natural product isolated from the brown alga Dictyopteris divaricata and allowed to conclude on its absolute configuration. The crystal structures of the epoxides from (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;cubenol and the acid catalysed conversion into an isomeric ketone are reported.

         <title>Improving the Enantioselectivity of CHMOBrevi1 for Asymmetric Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Precursor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;rational design of the cyclohexanone monooxygenase CHMOBrevi1 generated the L145A mutant with improved enantioselectivity (96.8&#8201;% ee) for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;piperonyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, a precursor of anti&#8208;cancer drug podophyllotoxin, compared with the wild type (75&#8201;% ee). Coupled with the cofactor regeneration system, 9.3&#8197;mM substrate was converted completely in a 100&#8208;mL scale reaction.







Abstract
(R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;piperonyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones are key building blocks for the synthesis of podophyllotoxin, which have demonstrated remarkable potential in cancer treatment. Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs)&#8208;mediated asymmetric oxidation is a green approach to produce chiral lactones. While several BVMOs were able to oxidize the corresponding cyclobutanone, most BVMOs gave the (S) enantiomer while Cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) from Brevibacterium sp. HCU1 gave (R) enantiomer, but with a low enantioselectivity (75&#8201;% ee). In this study, we use a strategy called &#8220;focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis&#8221; (FRISM) at residues ranging from 6&#8197;&#197; from substrate. The mutations by using a restricted set of rationally chosen amino acids allow the formation of a small mutant library. By generating and screening less than 60 variants, we achieved a high ee of 96.8&#8201;%. Coupled with the cofactor regeneration system, 9.3&#8197;mM substrate was converted completely in a 100&#8208;mL scale reaction. Therefore, our work reveals a promising synthetic method for (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;piperonyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone with the highest enantioselectivity, and provides a new opportunity for the chem&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of podophyllotoxin.

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Switch Motif of Aromatic Ammonia Lyases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified novel substrate switch motifs of aromatic ammonia lyases. These alternative amino acids were introduced into a tyrosine ammonia lyase (TALrpc). The characterization of these enzyme variants revealed a significant (up to 20&#8208;fold) improvement in the activity for phenylalanine. A computational analysis could explain these experimental results.







Abstract
Aromatic ammonia lyases (AALs) are important enzymes for biocatalysis as they enable the asymmetric synthesis of chiral l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated precursors. AALs have very similar protein structures and active site pockets but exhibit strict substrate specificity towards tyrosine, phenylalanine, or histidine. Herein, through systematic bioinformatics and structural analysis, we discovered eight new motifs of amino acid residues in AALs. After introducing them &#8211; as well as four already known motifs &#8211; into different AALs, we learned that altering the substrate specificity by engineering the substrate switch motif in phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs), phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyases (PTALs), and tyrosine ammonia lyases (TALs) was only partially successful. However, we discovered that three previously unknown residue combinations introduced a substrate switch from tyrosine to phenylalanine in TAL, which was converted up to 20&#8208;fold better compared to the wild&#8208;type TAL enzyme.

E3 ligase mediated targeted protein degradation is an ever more important area in drug discovery. In the case of cereblon two avenues exist; either heterobifunctional PROTACs, or discrete cereblon ligands that induce a specific neosubstrate degron association to the complex. Here we present a degron blocking approach, whereby structural and in silico understandings of degron association has directed ligand design to block IMiD&#8208;like binding of degron containing neosubstrates, thus enhancing PROTAC selectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Bouguenina, J. J. Caldwell et al.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 23, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioorthogonal toolbox comprises reaction handles for click reactions (CuAAC), strain&#8208;promoted reactions (IEDDA cycloaddition), and enzymatic reactions (Staudinger ligation). These reactions have revolutionized the field of chemical biology by providing researchers with powerful tools to investigate and manipulate biomolecules within living systems with precision and control.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry is a rapidly expanding field of research that involves the use of small molecules that can react selectively with biomolecules in living cells and organisms, without causing any harm or interference with native biochemical processes. It has made significant contributions to the field of biology and medicine by enabling selective labeling, imaging, drug targeting, and manipulation of bio&#8208;macromolecules in living systems. This approach offers numerous advantages over traditional chemistry&#8208;based methods, including high specificity, compatibility with biological systems, and minimal interference with biological processes. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advancements in bioorthogonal chemistry and their current and potential applications in translational research. We present an update on this innovative chemical approach that has been utilized in cells and living systems during the last five years for biomedical applications. We also highlight the nucleic acid&#8208;templated synthesis of small molecules by using bioorthogonal chemistry. Overall, bioorthogonal chemistry provides a powerful toolset for studying and manipulating complex biological systems, and holds great potential for advancing translational research.

         <title>Targeted Preparation and NMR Spectroscopic Characterization of Lys11&#8208;Linked Ubiquitin Trimers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homotypic K11&#8208;linked Ub trimers were prepared by a targeted click&#8208;chemistry approach using a specific isotopic labeling scheme. The trimers were structurally and dynamically characterized by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and compared to corresponding monomers and dimers. This analysis revealed a robust overall conformation of Ub moieties used for assembly as well as conserved structural and dynamical properties of the assembled chains that vary in length.







Abstract
Ubiquitylation refers to the attachment of mono&#8208; or poly&#8208;ubiquitin molecules to a substrate protein. To shield ubiquitin chains against potential hydrolysis, a facile, click&#8208;chemistry based approach was recently established for the generation of site&#8208;specifically conjugated ubiquitin dimers relying on triazole&#8208;linkage. Here, the preparation of such ubiquitin chains was advanced by the generation of homotypic Lys11&#8208;linked ubiquitin trimers considering an isotopic labeling scheme in a moiety&#8208;wise manner. The structural and dynamical impact on the ubiquitin unit at proximal, central, or distal position that is potentially invoked by the respective other two moieties was systematically probed by heteronuclear high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopic approaches. As a result, conjugating a third ubiquitin moiety to the proximal or distal site of a ubiquitin dimer does not alter structural and dynamical characteristics as it has been seen for ubiquitin dimers. This observation suggests that recognition of a homotypically assembled ubiquitin chain by a potential substrate is primarily done by screening the length of a ubiquitin chain rather than relying on subtle changes in structure or dynamic properties of single ubiquitin moieties composing the chain.

         <title>Enlighting Electron Routes In Oxyfunctionalizing Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron routes to an Acidovorax CYP450 (CYPAv) in Synechocystis (Syn). Transfer from PS I via CYPAv&#8208;specific ferredoxin (FdAv) to CYPAv was identified as main route possibly assisted by minor transfer via Synechocystis ferredoxins (FdSyn), ferredoxin&#8208;NADP+ reductase of Syn (FNRSyn), and FdAv. Lower rate transfer from PS I via FdSyn directly to CYPAv was found as well. NAD(H) specific FNRAv is dispensable.







Abstract
Phototrophic microorganisms, like cyanobacteria, are gaining attention as host organisms for biocatalytic processes with light as energy source and water as electron source. Redox enzymes, especially oxygenases, can profit from in&#8208;situ supply of co&#8208;substrates, i.&#8201;e., reduction equivalents and O2, by the photosynthetic light reaction. The electron transfer downstream of PS I to heterologous electron consuming enzymes in principle can involve NADPH, NADH, and/or ferredoxin, whereas most direct and efficient transfer is desirable. Here, we use the model organism Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to investigate, to what extent host and/or heterologous constituents are involved in electron transfer to a heterologous cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Acidovorax sp. CHX100. Interestingly, in this highly active light&#8208;fueled cycloalkane hydroxylating biocatalyst, host&#8208;intrinsic enzymes were found capable of completely substituting the function of the Acidovorax ferredoxin reductase. To a certain extent (20&#8201;%), this also was true for the Acidovorax ferredoxin. These results indicate the presence of a versatile set of electron carriers in cyanobacteria, enabling efficient and direct coupling of electron consuming reactions to photosynthetic water oxidation. This will both simplify and promote the use of phototrophic microorganisms for sustainable production processes.

         <title>Exploiting the Photo&#8208;Physical Properties of Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite nanomaterials have recently been exploited for bioimaging applications due to their unique photo&#8208;physical properties, including high absorbance, good photostability, narrow emissions, and nonlinear optical properties. These attributes outperform conventional fluorescent materials such as organic dyes and metal chalcogenide quantum dots and endow them with the potential to reshape a wide array of bioimaging modalities. Yet, their full potential necessitates a deep grasp of their structure&#8208;attribute relationship and strategies for enhancing water stability through surface engineering for meeting the stringent and unique requirement of each individual imaging modalities. This review delves into this evolving frontier, highlighting how their distinctive photo&#8208;physical properties can be leveraged and optimized for various bioimaging modalities, including visible light imaging, near&#8208;infrared imaging, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Metabolic Pathways in Non&#8208;Photosynthetic Biohybrid Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;activated core&#8208;shell quantum dots (QDs) can selectively hybridize with desired intracellular enzymes and supply redox equivalents to affect bacterial metabolism. Both catabolic (pentose phosphate) and anabolic (isobutanol biosynthesis) pathways can be targeted by site&#8208;specific coupling CZSe QDs to G6PD and ilvC enzymes, respectively, yielding an increase of biomass by 1.7&#8208;fold or biofuel production by 3.9&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Biomanufacturing via microorganisms relies on carbon substrates for molecular feedstocks and a source of energy to carry out enzymatic reactions. This creates metabolic bottlenecks and lowers the efficiency for substrate conversion. Nanoparticle biohybridization with proteins and whole cell surfaces can bypass the need for redox cofactor regeneration for improved secondary metabolite production in a non&#8208;specific manner. Here we propose using nanobiohybrid organisms (Nanorgs), intracellular protein&#8208;nanoparticle hybrids formed through the spontaneous coupling of core&#8208;shell quantum dots (QDs) with histidine&#8208;tagged enzymes in non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria, for light&#8208;mediated control of bacterial metabolism. This proved to eliminate metabolic constrictions and replace glucose with light as the source of energy in Escherichia coli, with an increase in growth by 1.7&#8208;fold in 75&#8201;% reduced nutrient media. Metabolomic tracking through carbon isotope labeling confirmed flux shunting through targeted pathways, with accumulation of metabolites downstream of respective targets. Finally, application of Nanorgs with the Ehrlich pathway improved isobutanol titers/yield by 3.9&#8208;fold in 75&#8201;% less sugar from E. coli strains with no genetic alterations. These results demonstrate the promise of Nanorgs for metabolic engineering and low&#8208;cost biomanufacturing.

Glutamylation yields N&#8208;functionalized amino acids in several natural pathways. &#947;&#8208;Glutamylated amino acids may exhibit improved properties for their industrial application, e.&#8201;g., as taste enhancers or in peptide drugs. &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl&#8722;isopropylamide (GIPA) can be synthesized from isopropylamine (IPA) and l&#8208;glutamate. In Pseudomonas sp. strain KIE171, GIPA is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of l&#8208;alaninol (2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol), a precursor of the fluorochinolone antibiotic levofloxacin and of the chloroacetanilide herbicide metolachlor. In this study, fermentative production of GIPA with metabolically engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440 using &#947;&#8208;glutamylmethylamide synthetase (GMAS) from Methylorubrum extorquens was established. Upon addition of IPA during growth with glycerol as carbon source in shake flasks, the recombinant strain produced up to 21.8&#8197;mM GIPA. In fed&#8208;batch bioreactor cultivations, GIPA accumulated to a titer of 11&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with a product yield of 0.11&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 glycerol and a volumetric productivity of 0.24&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fermentative production of GIPA.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Host&#8208;Guest Assembly/Disassembly for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the superior biocompatibility and specificity for specific substrates, enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies have wide biomedical applications. Herein, we provide a review concerning the concept of enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies, illustrate and discuss several recent relative works, and analyze its ongoing challenges and possible solutions in the future.







Abstract
Compared with the normal assembly/disassembly approaches, enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies due to their superior biocompatibility and specificity for specific substrates, can more effectively and precisely release molecules at lesions for reflecting in&#8197;vivo biological events. Specifically, due to the over&#8208;expression of enzymes in specific tissues, the assembly/disassembly processes can directly occur on the pathological sites (or regions of interest), thus these enzyme&#8208;instructed processes are widely and effectively used for disease treatment or precise bioimaging. Based on it, we introduce the concept and major strategies of enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly, illustrate their importance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and review their advances in biomedical applications. Further, the challenges of these strategies in the clinic and future tendencies are also prospected.

         <title>TAC&#8208;tics for Leveraging Proximity Biology in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically induced proximity (CIP) refers to co&#8208;opting naturally occurring biological pathways using synthetic molecules to recruit neosubstrates that are not normally encountered or to enhance the affinity of naturally occurring interactions. Leveraging proximity biology through CIPs has become a rapidly evolving field and has garnered considerable interest in basic research and drug discovery. PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) is a well&#8208;established CIP modality that induces the proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, causing target protein degradation via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. Inspired by PROTACs, several other induced proximity modalities have emerged to modulate both proteins and RNA over recent years. In this review, we summarize the critical advances and opportunities in the field, focusing on protein degraders, RNA degraders and non&#8208;degrader modalities such as post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) modulators. We envision that these emerging proximity&#8208;based drug modalities will be valuable resources for both biological research and therapeutic discovery in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Heme Active Site by Covalent Modifications: Two Case Studies of Myoglobin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using myoglobin (Mb) as a model protein, we herein developed a facial approach to modifying the heme active site. A cavity was first generated in the heme distal site by F46C mutation, and the thiol group of Cys46 was then used for covalently linked to exogenous ligands, 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiol and 1&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione. The engineered proteins, termed F46C&#8208;triazole Mb and F46C&#8208;phenol Mb, respectively, were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopic and stopped&#8208;flow kinetic studies. The results showed that both the heme coordination state and the protein function such as H2O2 activiation and peroxidase activity could be efficiently regulated, which suggests that this approach might be generally applied to the design of functional heme proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tight Contact: The Expanding Application of Salicylaldehydes in Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylaldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands can bind the protein targets forming imines with lysine&#8208;amino groups. This drug design improves the affinity and selectivity for specific biological targets. Given the abundance of lysine residues in proteins and the reversible covalent (RC) nature of ligand&#8208;protein interaction, SA&#8208;bearing ligands hold significant promise for future pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
The installation of aldehydes into synthetic protein ligands is an efficient strategy to engage protein lysine residues in remarkably stable imine bonds and augment the compound affinity and selectivity for their biological targets. The high frequency of lysine residues in proteins and the reversibility of the covalent ligand&#8208;protein bond support the application of aldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands, holding promises for their future use as drugs. This review highlights the increasing exploitation of salicylaldehyde modules in various classes of protein binders, aimed at the reversible&#8208;covalent engagement of lysine residues.

         <title>ThermoBRET: A Ligand&#8208;Engagement Nanoscale Thermostability Assay Applied to GPCRs
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ThermoBRET assay detects unfolding of detergent solubilised non&#8208;purified GPCRs with genetically encoded N&#8208;terminus tsNluc. As the protein unfolds in the gradient PCR thermocycler due to thermal denaturation, sulfo&#8208;Cy3 maleimide (SCM) reacts with newly exposed cysteine residues putting the sulfo&#8208;Cy3 acceptor fluorophore in proximity with the tsNluc donor. Fitting the melting curve to a Boltzmann sigmoidal equation yields a melting point (Tm), that is increased in the presence of ligands that bind the receptor.







Abstract
Measurements of membrane protein thermostability reflect ligand binding. Current thermostability assays often require protein purification or rely on pre&#8208;existing radiolabelled or fluorescent ligands, limiting their application to established targets. Alternative methods, such as fluorescence&#8208;detection size exclusion chromatography thermal shift, detect protein aggregation but are not amenable to high&#8208;throughput screening. Here, we present a ThermoBRET method to quantify the relative thermostability of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), using cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the &#946;2&#8208;adrenoceptor (&#946;2AR) as model systems. ThermoBRET reports receptor unfolding, does not need labelled ligands and can be used with non&#8208;purified proteins. It uses Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) between Nanoluciferase (Nluc) and a thiol&#8208;reactive fluorescent dye that binds cysteines exposed by unfolding. We demonstrate that the melting point (Tm) of Nluc&#8208;fused GPCRs can be determined in non&#8208;purified detergent solubilised membrane preparations or solubilised whole cells, revealing differences in thermostability for different solubilising conditions and in the presence of stabilising ligands. We extended the range of the assay by developing the thermostable tsNLuc by incorporating mutations from the fragments of split&#8208;Nluc (Tm of 87&#8201;&#176;C versus 59&#8201;&#176;C). ThermoBRET allows the determination of GPCR thermostability, which is useful for protein purification optimisation and drug discovery screening.

It uses Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) between Nanoluciferase (Nluc) and a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye that binds cysteines exposed by unfolding. We demonstrate that the melting point (T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of Nluc-fused GPCRs can be determined in non-purified detergent solubilised membrane preparations or solubilised whole cells, revealing differences in thermostability for different solubilising conditions and in the presence of stabilising ligands. We extended the range of the assay by developing the thermostable tsNLuc by incorporating mutations from the fragments of split-Nluc (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 87&#8201;&#176;C versus 59&#8201;&#176;C). ThermoBRET allows the determination of GPCR thermostability, which is useful for protein purification optimisation and drug discovery screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances and Challenges in Enzymatic Depolymerization and Recycling of PET Wastes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein engineering technologies enabled enzymatic depolymerization to be part of the circular polymer economy. This concept provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date summary of protein engineering of PET hydrolytic enzymes for improving catalytic activity and thermostability, and discusses extrinsic factors influencing enzymatic depolymerization efficiency as well as closed&#8208;loop bio&#8208;recycling and bio&#8208;upcycling solutions for PET wastes.







Abstract
Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most commonly used plastics in daily life and various industries. Enzymatic depolymerization and recycling of post&#8208;consumer PET (pc&#8208;PET) provides a promising strategy for the sustainable circular economy of polymers. Great protein engineering efforts have been devoted to improving the depolymerization performance of PET hydrolytic enzymes (PHEs). In this review, we first discuss the mechanisms and challenges of enzymatic PET depolymerization. Subsequently, we summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art engineering of PHEs including rational design, machine learning, and directed evolution for improved depolymerization performance, and highlight the advances in screening methods of PHEs. We further discuss several factors that affect the enzymatic depolymerization efficiency. We conclude with our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in bio&#8208;recycling and bio&#8208;upcycling of PET wastes.

         <title>Inhibition of Aurora&#8208;A/N&#8208;Myc Protein&#8211;Protein Interaction Using Peptidomimetics: Understanding the Role of Peptide Cyclization
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A maleimide constraint predisposes an N&#8208;Myc derived peptidomimetic towards Aurora&#8208;A recognition by restricting the accessible conformational landscape of the unbound peptide, promoting a more stable helical bound state and making additional non&#8208;covalent contacts with Aurora&#8208;A.







Abstract
Using N&#8208;Myc61&#8208;89 as a starting template we showcase the systematic use of truncation and maleimide constraining to develop peptidomimetic inhibitors of the N&#8208;Myc/Aurora&#8208;A protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI); a potential anticancer drug discovery target. The most promising of these &#8211; N&#8208;Myc73&#8208;94&#8208;N85C/G89C&#8208;mal &#8211; is shown to favour a more Aurora&#8208;A compliant binding ensemble in comparison to the linear wild&#8208;type sequence as observed through fluorescence anisotropy competition assays, circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Further in&#8197;silico investigation of this peptide in its Aurora&#8208;A bound state, by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, imply (i)&#8197;the bound conformation is more stable as a consequence of the constraint, which likely suppresses dissociation and (ii)&#8197;the constraint may make further stabilizing interactions with the Aurora&#8208;A surface. Taken together this work unveils the first orthosteric N&#8208;Myc/Aurora&#8208;A inhibitor and provides useful insights on the biophysical properties and thus design of constrained peptides, an attractive therapeutic modality.

         <title>CoFeSe2@DMSA@FA Nanocatalyst for Amplification of Oxidative Stress to Achieve Multimodal Tumor Therapy
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present our groundbreaking design of the CoFeSe2@DMSA@FA nanocatalyst with Se vacancies. Fe2+ and Co2+ underwent a Fenton&#8208;like reaction with excess H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment, generating highly toxic hydroxyl radical(&#8901;OH). This innovative nanocatalyst exhibits a synergistic combination of CDT and PTT, resulting in amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced photothermal effects.







Abstract
Nanomedicine has significantly advanced precise tumor therapy, providing essential technical blessing for active drug accumulation, targeted consignment, and mitigation of noxious side effects. To enhance anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, the integration of multiple therapeutic modalities has garnered significant attention. Here, we designed an innovative CoFeSe2@DMSA@FA nanocatalyst with Se vacancies (abbreviated as CFSDF), which exhibits synergistic chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), leading to amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced photothermal effects. The multifunctional CFSDF nanocatalyst exhibits the remarkable ability to catalyze the Fenton reaction within the acidic tumor microenvironment, efficiently converting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly harmful hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). Moreover, the nanocatalyst effectively diminishes GSH levels and ameliorates intracellular oxidative stress. The incorporation of FA modification enables CFSDF to evade immune detection and selectively target tumor tissues. Numerous in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo investigations have consistently demonstrated that CFSDF optimizes its individual advantages and significantly enhances therapeutic efficiency through synergistic effects of multiple therapeutic modalities, offering a valuable and effective approach to cancer treatment.

         <title>Virtual Screening Assisted Search for Inhibitors of the Translocated Intimin Receptor of Enteropathogenic Escherichia Coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Virtual screening methods were used to search for inhibitors of the bacterial virulence molecule intimin and its receptor Tir. Compounds were selected for biological study using an imaging&#8208;based method.







Abstract
This study aimed to identify inhibitors of the translocated intimin receptor (Tir) of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). EPEC is an intestinal pathogen that causes diarrhea and is a major health concern worldwide. Because Tir is a key virulence factor involved in EPEC pathogenesis, inhibiting its function is a potential strategy for controlling EPEC infections. Virtual screening was applied to chemical libraries to search for compounds that inhibit Tir&#8208;mediated bacterial adherence to host cells. Three sites were targeted using the cocrystal structure published earlier. A selection of compounds was then assessed in a cell&#8208;based infection model and fluorescence microscopy assay. The results of this study provide a basis for further optimization and testing of Tir inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for EPEC infections.

         <title>Coenzyme A Thioester Intermediates as Platform Molecules in Cell&#8208;Free Chemical Biomanufacturing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coenzyme A thioesters are key intermediates for the biosynthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones. Cell&#8208;free biosynthetic cascades are reviewed and cataloged. CoA&#8208;dependent enzymes are classified in the context of biomanufacturing and their UniProt IDs are given. Finally, the most relevant cascades are analyzed and discussed regarding their TTNCoA and Atom Economy.







Abstract
The in&#8197;vitro synthesis of Coenzyme A (CoA)&#8208;thioester intermediates opens new avenues to transform simple molecules into more complex and multifunctional ones by assembling cell&#8208;free biosynthetic cascades. In this review, we have systematically cataloged known CoA&#8208;dependent enzyme reactions that have been successfully implemented in&#8197;vitro. To faciliate their identification, we provide their UniProt ID when available. Based on this catalog, we have organized enzymes into three modules: activation, modification, and removal. i) The activation module includes enzymes capable of fusing CoA with organic molecules. ii) The modification module includes enzymes capable of catalyzing chemical modifications in the structure of acyl&#8208;CoA intermediates. And iii) the removal module includes enzymes able to remove the CoA and release an organic molecule different from the one activated in the upstream. Based on these reactions, we constructed a reaction network that summarizes the most relevant CoA&#8208;dependent biosynthetic pathways reported until today. From the information available in the articles, we have plotted the total turnover number of CoA as a function of the product titer, observing a positive correlation between both parameters. Therefore, the success of a CoA&#8208;dependent in&#8197;vitro pathway depends on its ability to regenerate CoA, but also to regenerate other cofactors such as NAD(P)H and ATP.

And iii) the removal module includes enzymes able to remove the CoA and release an organic molecule different from the one activated in the upstream. Based on these reactions, we constructed a reaction network that summarizes the most relevant CoA-dependent biosynthetic pathways reported until today. From the information available in the articles, we have plotted the total turnover number of CoA as a function of the product titer, observing a positive correlation between both parameters. Therefore, the success of a CoA-dependent &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; pathway depends on its ability to regenerate CoA, but also to regenerate other cofactors such as NAD(P)H and ATP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrin Facilitates the Internalization of TAT Peptide Conjugated to RGD Motif in Model Lipid Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TAT peptide is a cell penetrating peptide which can be used as vector to deliver a plethora of cargoes inside cells but it doesn&#8242;t exhibit specificity toward any cell. In this paper we aimed to enhance the capabilities of the linear TAT peptide as targeted drug delivery tool with selectivity properties for integrin receptors.







Abstract
In recent years, targeted drug delivery has attracted a great interest for enhanced therapeutic efficiency, with diminished side effects, especially in cancer therapy. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) like HIV1&#8722;TAT peptides, appear to be the perfect vectors for translocating drugs or other cargoes across the plasma membrane, but their application is limited mostly due to insufficient specificity for intended targets. Although these molecules were successfully used, the mechanism by which the peptides enter the cell interior still needs to be clarified. The tripeptide motif RGD (arginine&#8722;glycine&#8722;aspartate), found in extracellular matrix proteins has high affinity for integrin receptors overexpressed in cancer and it is involved in different phases of disease progression, including proliferation, invasion and migration. Discovery of new peptides with high binding affinity for disease receptors and permeability of plasma membranes is desirable for both, development of targeted drug delivery systems and early detection and diagnosis. To complement the TAT peptide with specific targeting ability, we conjugated it with an integrin&#8208;binding RGD motif. Although the idea of RGD&#8722;CPPs conjugates is not entirely new,[1] here we describe the permeability abilities and specificity of integrin receptors of RGD&#8722;TAT peptides in model membranes. Our findings reveal that this novel RGD sequence based on TAT peptide maintains its ability to permeate lipid membranes and exhibits specificity for integrin receptors embedded in giant unilamellar vesicles. This promising outcome suggests that the RGD&#8722;TAT peptide has significant potential for applications in the field of targeted drug delivery systems.

         <title>Environmentally Friendly Degradation and Detoxification of Rifampicin by a Bacterial Laccase and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally friendly two&#8208;step process has been developed to effectively transform the antibiotic rifampicin into non&#8208;antimicrobial compounds. The process involves an enzymatic oxidation step by the bacterial CotA&#8208;laccase and a hydrogen peroxide bleaching step. NMR identified rifampicin quinone as the main product of the enzymatic oxidation.







Abstract
Antibiotics are micropollutants accumulating in our rivers and wastewaters, potentially leading to bacterial antibiotic resistance, a worldwide problem to which there is no current solution. Here, we have developed an environmentally friendly two&#8208;step process to transform the antibiotic rifampicin (RIF) into non&#8208;antimicrobial compounds. The process involves an enzymatic oxidation step by the bacterial CotA&#8208;laccase and a hydrogen peroxide bleaching step. NMR identified rifampicin quinone as the main product of the enzymatic oxidation. Growth of Escherichia coli strains in the presence of final degradation products (FP) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements confirmed that FP are non&#8208;anti&#8208;microbial compounds, and bioassays suggest that FP is not toxic to eukaryotic organisms. Moreover, competitive fitness assays between susceptible and RIF&#8208;resistant bacteria show that susceptible bacteria is strongly favoured in the presence of FP. Our results show that we have developed a robust and environmentally friendly process to effectively remediate rifampicin from antibiotic contaminated environments.

         <title>Antibacterial Photodynamic Therapy by Zn(II)&#8208;Curcumin Complex: Synthesis, Characterization, DFT Calculation, Antibacterial Activity, and Molecular Docking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the synthesis and characterization of three Zn(II)&#8208;complexes is presented. DFT calculations are used to insight into their electronic structures, photophysical properties, and photoactivity. The synthesized complexes presented an antibacterial effect upon low&#8208;energy visible light exposure via singlet oxygen generation. The molecular docking study indicated the binding of the complexes to DNA gyrase B. Overall, this research offers insights into a potential new approach for antibacterial photodynamic therapy with Zn(II) complexes.







Abstract
The increase in antibacterial drug resistance is threatening global health conditions. Recently, antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has emerged as an effective antibacterial treatment with high cure gain. In this work, three Zn(II) complexes viz., [Zn(en)(acac)Cl] (1), [Zn(bpy)(acac)Cl] (2), [Zn(en)(cur)Cl] (3), where en=ethylenediamine (1 and 3), bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (2), acac=acetylacetonate (1 and 2), cur=curcumin monoanionic (3) were developed as aPDT agents. Complexes 1&#8211;3 were synthesized and fully characterized using NMR, HRMS, FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis. and fluorescence spectroscopy. The HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap (Eg), and adiabatic splittings (&#916;S1&#8722;T1 and &#916;S0&#8722;T1) obtained from DFT calculation indicated the photosensivity of the complexes. These complexes have not shown any potent antibacterial activity under dark conditions but the antibacterial activity of these complexes was significantly enhanced upon light exposure (MIC value up to 0.025&#8197;&#956;g/mL) due to their light&#8208;mediated 1O2 generation abilities. The molecular docking study suggested that complexes 1&#8211;3 interact efficiently with DNA gyrase B (PDB ID: 4uro). Importantly, 1&#8211;3 did not show any toxicity toward normal HEK&#8208;293 cells. Overall, in this work, we have demonstrated the promising potential of Zn(II) complexes as effective antibacterial agents under the influence of visible light.

         <title>Fluorimetric Cell Analysis with 9&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Berberine Derivatives as DNA&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staining subcompartments of eukaryotic cells: The high affinity of 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted berberine derivatives to DNA and the resulting fluorescent light&#8208;up effect were used for fluorimetric staining of eukaryotic cells, specifically for the distinct visualization of the heterochromatin or the nucleoli.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;sensitive fluorescent light&#8208;up probes based on berberine are presented. This biogenic fluorophore was chosen as central unit to use its potential biocompatibility and its DNA&#8208;binding properties. To provide predictable fluorescence quenching in aqueous solution and a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect upon DNA binding, aryl substituents were attached at the 9&#8208;position by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions. The 9&#8208;arylberberine derivatives have a very low fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl=&lt;0.02), which is caused by the radiationless deactivation of the excited state by torsional relaxation about the biaryl axis. In addition, these berberine derivatives intercalate into DNA with high affinity (Kb=2.0&#8722;22&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1). Except for the nitrophenyl&#8208; and hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, all tested compounds exhibited a pronounced fluorescence light&#8208;up effect upon association with DNA, because the deactivation of the excited&#8208;state by torsional relaxation is suppressed in the DNA binding site. Most notably, it was shown exemplarily with the 9&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208; and the 9&#8208;(6&#8208;methoxynaphthyl)&#8208;substituted derivatives that these properties are suited for fluorimetric cell analysis. In particular, these probes generated distinct staining patterns in eukaryotic cells (NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts), which enabled the identification of nuclear substructures, most likely heterochromatin or nucleoli, respectively.

         <title>Lipid Droplets Specific Fluorophore for Demarcation of Normal and Diseased Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing high&#8208;permeability fluorescent probes with large Stokes shifts, this study successfully differentiated between diseased and healthy tissues in liver, adipose, and small intestine.







Abstract
Using high&#8208;fidelity, permeable, lipophilic, and bright fluorophores for imaging lipid droplets (LDs) in tissues holds immense potential in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic or alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this work, we utilized linear and &#923;&#8208;shaped polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes for imaging LDs in both cellular and tissue environments, specifically in rats with diabetic and alcoholic fatty liver disease. The fluorescent probes possess several key characteristics, including high permeability, lipophilicity, and brightness, which make them well&#8208;suited for efficient LD imaging. Notably, the probes exhibit a substantial Stokes shift, with 143&#8197;nm for DCS and 201&#8197;nm for DCN with selective targeting of the lipid droplets. Our experimental investigations successfully differentiated morphological variations between diseased and normal tissues in three distinct tissue types: liver, adipose, and small intestine. They could help provide pointers for improved detection and understanding of LD&#8208;related pathologies.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a New Germacrene Derivative Named Germacrene F</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the course studies on the promiscuity sesquiterpene cyclases, it was found that the protoillude synthase (Omp7) and the viridiflorene synthase (Tps32) and the FPP derivative with shifted double bond (C6&#8208;C7 to C7&#8208;C8) are able to generate a so far unknown germacrene derivative, that we name germacrene F. It must have been formed via 1&#8594;10 instead of 1&#8594;11 cyclization commonly conducted by these enzymes.







Abstract
The new farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) derivative with a shifted olefinic double bond from C6&#8208;C7 to C7&#8208;C8 is accepted and converted by the sesquiterpene cyclases protoilludene synthase (Omp7) as well as viridiflorene synthase (Tps32). In both cases, a so far unknown germacrene derivative was found to be formed, which we name &#8220;germacrene F&#8221;. Both cases are examples in which a modification around the central olefinic double bond in FPP leads to a change in the mode of initial cyclization (from 1&#8594;11 to 1&#8594;10). For Omp7 a rationale for this behaviour was found by carrying out molecular docking studies. Temperature&#8208;dependent NMR experiments, accompanied by NOE studies, show that germacrene F adopts a preferred mirror&#8208;symmetric conformation with both methyl groups oriented in the same directions in the cyclodecane ring.

         <title>Increasing the Stability of Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases by Disulfide Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together we are strong: Covalent homodimerization by disulfide engineering of the tryptophan halogenases Thal and PyrH leads to a significant increase in thermostability while retaining activity.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases allow halogenation of electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds under mild reaction conditions even at electronically unfavored positions with high regioselectivity. In order to expand the application of halogenases, the enzymes need to be improved in terms of stability and efficiency. A previous study with the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal demonstrated that thermostable Thal variants tend to form dimers in solution while the wild type is present as a monomer. Based on this a dimeric Thal variant was generated that is covalently linked by disulfide bonds. Introducing two cysteine residues at the dimer interface resulted in the variant Thal&#8197;CC with significantly increased thermostability (&#9653;T50=15.7&#8197;K) and stability over time at elevated temperature compared to the wild type. By introducing the homologous mutations into the tryptophan 5&#8208;halogenase PyrH, we were able to show that the stabilization by covalent dimerization can also be transferred to other halogenases. Moreover, it was possible to further increase the thermostability of PyrH by inserting cysteine mutations at alternative sites of the dimer interface.

         <title>Drug Encapsulation via Peptide&#8208;Based Polyelectrolyte Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we show how tuning hydrophobicity and charge density via peptide design can be used to control the encapsulation of small molecule drugs, doxorubicin, and methylene blue. We find that sequences with both higher charge density and higher hydrophobicity are better at encapsulation. In some cases, drug encapsulation can significantly alter the material properties of the polyelectrolyte complexes from liquid coacervates to solid precipitates.







Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based polyelectrolyte complexes are biocompatible materials that can encapsulate molecules with different polarities due to their ability to be precisely designed. Here we use UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and infrared spectroscopy to investigate the encapsulation of model drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and methylene blue (MB) using a series of rationally designed polypeptides. For both drugs, we find an overall higher encapsulation efficiency with sequences that have higher charge density, highlighting the importance of ionic interactions between the small molecules and the peptides. However, comparing molecules with the same charge density, illustrated that the most hydrophobic sequence pairs had the highest encapsulation of both DOX and MB molecules. The phase behavior and stability of DOX&#8208;containing complexes did not change compared to the complexes without drugs. However, MB encapsulation caused changes in the stabilities of the complexes. The sequence pair with the highest charge density and hydrophobicity had the most dramatic increase in stability, which coincided with a phase change from liquid to solid. This study illustrates how multiple types of molecular interactions are required for efficient encapsulation of poorly soluble drugs and provides insights into the molecular design of delivery carriers.

         <title>Shedding Light on the D1&#8208;Like Receptors: A Fluorescence&#8208;Based Toolbox for Visualization of the D1 and D5 Receptors
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report the identification of UR&#8208;NR435 (25), a SCH&#8208;23390&#8208;based fluorescent ligand bearing a 5&#8208;TAMRA dye, as suitable for fluorescence microscopy at the D1R. Single&#8208;digit nanomolar binding affinity could be determined in radioligand competition binding and molecular brightness studies at D1&#8208;like receptors.







Abstract
Dopamine D1&#8208;like receptors are the most abundant type of dopamine receptors in the central nervous system and, even after decades of discovery, still highly interesting for the study of neurological diseases. We herein describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands, structurally derived from D1R antagonist SCH&#8208;23390 and labeled with two different fluorescent dyes, as tool compounds for the visualization of D1&#8208;like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR&#8208;NR435 (25) as a high&#8208;affinity ligand for D1&#8208;like receptors (pKi (D1R)=8.34, pKi (D5R)=7.62) with excellent selectivity towards D2&#8208;like receptors. Compound 25 proved to be a neutral antagonist at the D1R and D5R in a Gs heterotrimer dissociation assay, an important feature to avoid receptor internalization and degradation when working with whole cells. The neutral antagonist 25 displayed rapid association and complete dissociation to the D1R in kinetic binding studies using confocal microscopy verifying its applicability for fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, molecular brightness studies determined a single&#8208;digit nanomolar binding affinity of the ligand, which was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. For this reason, this fluorescent ligand is a useful tool for a sophisticated characterization of native D1 receptors in a variety of experimental setups.

         <title>Fluorescent Tools for the Imaging of Dopamine D2&#8208;Like Receptors
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we have identified UR&#8208;MN212 (20), a spiperone&#8208;based fluorescent ligand bearing a 5&#8208;TAMRA dye, as suitable for fluorescence microscopy at the D2R. The binding affinity in the single&#8208;digit nanomolar range could be determined in radioligand competition binding and molecular brightness studies at D2&#8208;like receptors.







Abstract
The family of dopamine D2&#8208;like receptors represents an interesting target for a variety of neurological diseases, e.&#8201;g. Parkinson's disease (PD), addiction, or schizophrenia. In this study we describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands as tools for visualization of dopamine D2&#8208;like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR&#8208;MN212 (20) as a high&#8208;affinity ligand for D2&#8208;like receptors (pKi (D2longR)=8.24, pKi (D3R)=8.58, pKi (D4R)=7.78) with decent selectivity towards D1&#8208;like receptors. Compound 20 is a neutral antagonist in a Go1 activation assay at the D2longR, D3R, and D4R, which is an important feature for studies using whole cells. The neutral antagonist 20, equipped with a 5&#8208;TAMRA dye, displayed rapid association to the D2longR in binding studies using confocal microscopy demonstrating its suitability for fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, in molecular brightness studies, the ligand's binding affinity could be determined in a single&#8208;digit nanomolar range that was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. Therefore, the fluorescent compound can be used for quantitative characterization of native D2&#8208;like receptors in a broad variety of experimental setups.

         <title>Chimeric Small Molecules for Detouring Drugs into Mitochondria to Engender Apoptosis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric Small Molecules (CSMs) were designed and synthesized in a concise strategy. One of the CSMs localized into the mitochondria, damaged them and generated ROS, leading to remarkable cancer cell killing in different cancer cell lines. These CSMs can be useful tools to understand organelle chemical biology in diseased states.







Abstract
Mitochondrion has appeared as one of the important targets for anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Subsequently, small molecule anti&#8208;cancer drugs are directed to the mitochondria for improved therapeutic efficacy. However, simultaneous imaging and impairing mitochondria by a single probe remained a major challenge. To address this, herein Chimeric Small Molecules (CSMs) encompassing drugs, fluorophore and mitochondria homing moiety were designed and synthesized through a concise strategy. Screening of the CSMs in a panel of cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF7, A549, and HCT&#8208;116) revealed that one of the CSMs comprising Indomethacin V exhibited remarkable cervical cancer cell (HeLa) killing (IC50=0.97&#8197;&#956;M). This lead CSM homed into the mitochondria of HeLa cells within 1&#8197;h followed by mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This novel Indomethacin V&#8208;based CSM&#8208;mediated mitochondrial damage induced programmed cell death (apoptosis). We anticipate these CSMs can be used as tools to understand the drug effects in organelle chemical biology in diseased states.

         <title>Discovery of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI Stabilizers by Extension of an Amidine&#8208;Substituted Thiophene Fragment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilizers were discovered through a fragment extension approach. The stabilizer exhibited moderate stabilization effect and selectivity towards a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; peptide complex.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) modulation is a promising approach in drug discovery with the potential to expand the &#8216;druggable&#8217; proteome and develop new therapeutic strategies. While there have been significant advancements in methodologies for developing PPI inhibitors, there is a relative scarcity of literature describing the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; development of PPI stabilizers (Molecular Glues). The hub protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and its interactome provide an excellent platform for exploring conceptual approaches to PPI modulation, including evolution of chemical matter for Molecular Glues. In this study, we employed a fragment extension strategy to discover stabilizers for the complex of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein and an Estrogen Receptor alpha&#8208;derived peptide (ER&#945;). A focused library of analogues derived from an amidine&#8208;substituted thiophene fragment enhanced the affinity of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; complex up to 6.2&#8208;fold. Structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) analysis underscored the importance of the newly added, aromatic side chain with a certain degree of rigidity. X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a unique intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking binding mode of the most active analogues, resulting in the simultaneous binding of two molecules to the PPI binding pocket. Notably, analogue 11 displayed selective stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; complex.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Octacosamicin A: Uncommon Starter/extender Units and Product Releasing via Intermolecular Amidation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of octacosamicin A requires uncommon starter and extender units and likely employs an unusual mechanism for product release by catalysing an intermolecular amidation reaction.







Abstract
Octacosamicin A is an antifungal metabolite featuring a linear polyene&#8208;polyol chain flanked by N&#8208;hydroxyguanidine and glycine moieties. We report here that sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations of streptomycin elicited the production of octacosamicin A in Amycolatopsis azurea DSM 43854T. We identified the biosynthetic gene cluster (oca BGC) that encodes a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) system for assembling the polyene&#8208;polyol chain of octacosamicin A. Our analysis suggested that the N&#8208;hydroxyguanidine unit originates from a 4&#8208;guanidinobutyryl&#8208;CoA starter unit, while the PKS incorporates an &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone moiety using a (2R)&#8208;hydroxymalonyl&#8208;CoA extender unit. The modular PKS system contains a non&#8208;canonical terminal module that lacks thioesterase (TE) and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains, indicating the biosynthesis is likely to employ an unconventional and cryptic off&#8208;loading mechanism that attaches glycine to the polyene&#8208;polyol chain via an intermolecular amidation reaction.

         <dc:description>
Catcher/Tag pairs enable protein conjugation via an isopeptide&#8208;bond mediated biological Click&#8208;reaction. In this review, we summarize the existing toolbox of Catcher/Tag pairs as well as the currently existing versatile applications of the Catcher/Tag pairs. Finally, we review the pH sensitivity of the reaction and discuss future outlooks towards further improved control and efficiency of the reactions.







Abstract
Manipulating protein architectures beyond genetic control has attracted widespread attention. Catcher/Tag systems enable highly specific conjugation of proteins in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro via an isopeptide&#8208;bond. They provide efficient, robust, and irreversible strategies for protein conjugation and are simple yet powerful tools for a variety of applications in enzyme industry, vaccines, biomaterials, and cellular applications. Here we summarize recent development of the Catcher/Tag toolbox with a particular emphasis on the design of Catcher/Tag pairs targeted for specific applications. We cover the current limitations of the Catcher/Tag systems and discuss the pH sensitivity of the reactions. Finally, we conclude some of the future directions in the development of this versatile protein conjugation method and envision that improved control over inducing the ligation reaction will further broaden the range of applications.

         <dc:description>Demand for biocompatible, non&#8208;invasive, and continuous real&#8208;time monitoring of organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip has driven the development of a variety of novel sensors. However, highest accuracy and sensitivity can arguably be achieved by integrated biosensing, which enables in situ monitoring of the in vitro microenvironment and dynamic responses of tissues and miniature organs recapitulated in organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip. This paper reviews integrated electrical, electrochemical, and optical sensing methods within organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices and platforms. By affording precise detection of analytes and biochemical reactions, these methods expand and advance the monitoring capabilities and reproducibility of organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip technology. The integration of these sensing techniques allows a deeper understanding of organ functions, and paves the way for important applications such as drug testing, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. By consolidating recent advancements and highlighting challenges in the field, this review aims to foster further research and innovation in the integration of biosensing in organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenolic Substitution in Fidaxomicin: A Semisynthetic Approach to Antibiotic Activity Across Species
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow&#8208;spectrum antibiotic fidaxomicin is active against a small number of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. New antibiotics were synthesized through modification the two phenolic hydroxy groups of fidaxomicin. The authors studied how switching the modification site influenced activity against different bacteria. The cover image depicts an antibiotic exploring a cave filled with stylized bacteria (Clostridioides difficile in blue, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in red, Caulobacter crescentus in green) and was designed by Erik Jung. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Gademann et&#8197;al.

         <title>Structural Analyses of DP&#8208;1, a Protein with the Ability To Bind Gold Nanoparticles, by Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting hold of gold: We have identified the DP&#8208;1 fragment (GHAATPEQYGVVTANK), which binds AuNPs and disperses them in solution. Structural analyses by solution NMR spectroscopy indicated that gold&#8208;binding peptide interacted with AuNPs through negatively charged residues and controlled the growth of the gold crystals.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), consisting of metallic gold, are applied in various fields owing to their characteristic physical properties. Collimonas sp. D&#8208;25 (D&#8208;25) is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium obtained from soil, compost, and other environmental materials in the Akita Prefecture. DP&#8208;1 is a water&#8208;soluble protein found in D&#8208;25 that binds specifically to AuNPs and retains them with high stability. This study aimed to identify the part of DP&#8208;1 that interacts with AuNPs and determine its 3D structure in solution using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Peptide fragments obtained by trypsin digestion were examined for their AuNP&#8208;binding capacity to determine the key Au&#8208;binding domain of DP&#8208;1. A fragment consisting of 16 amino acid residues (GHAATPEQYGVVTANK) was identified as the peptide with the highest binding activity. Structural analyses of this peptide indicated that the main chain was elongated, and negatively charged residues in the side chain were exposed on the surface by incorporating AuNPs. These results suggest that DP&#8208;1 interacts with AuNPs through negatively charged residues and extended hydrophobic residues for protein&#8211;protein interactions. The structural data also provide new insights into biomimetic technologies.

         <title>Unlocking The Mysteries of DNA Adducts with Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the experimental approaches are evolving, parallel computational efforts are indispensable to decode DNA adducts. This review accentuates AI's potential in various adduct biology aspects, including novel adduct identification, parent genotoxin associations, formation mechanisms, site of metabolism prediction, and genomic positioning.







Abstract
Cellular genome is considered a dynamic blueprint of a cell since it encodes genetic information that gets temporally altered due to various endogenous and exogenous insults. Largely, the extent of genomic dynamicity is controlled by the trade&#8208;off between DNA repair processes and the genotoxic potential of the causative agent (genotoxins or potential carcinogens). A subset of genotoxins form DNA adducts by covalently binding to the cellular DNA, triggering structural or functional changes that lead to significant alterations in cellular processes via genetic (e.&#8201;g., mutations) or non&#8208;genetic (e.&#8201;g., epigenome) routes. Identification, quantification, and characterization of DNA adducts are indispensable for their comprehensive understanding and could expedite the ongoing efforts in predicting carcinogenicity and their mode of action. In this review, we elaborate on using Artificial Intelligence (AI)&#8208;based modeling in adducts biology and present multiple computational strategies to gain advancements in decoding DNA adducts. The proposed AI&#8208;based strategies encompass predictive modeling for adduct formation via metabolic activation, novel adducts&#8217; identification, prediction of biochemical routes for adduct formation, adducts&#8217; half&#8208;life predictions within biological ecosystems, and, establishing methods to predict the link between adducts chemistry and its location within the genomic DNA. In summary, we discuss some futuristic AI&#8208;based approaches in DNA adduct biology.

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA with DNAzyme Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNAzymes (Dz) 10&#8211;23 were optimized to cleave three RNA targets having different folding energies. The optimized Dzs can have RNA&#8208;binding arms with a melting temperature much higher than the reaction temperature. The article discusses this phenomenon and suggests changes in the Dz optimization workflow to achieve optimal Dz catalytic activity in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Cleavage of biological mRNA by DNAzymes (Dz) has been proposed as a variation of oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT). The design of Dz&#8208;based OGT agents includes computational prediction of two RNA&#8208;binding arms with low affinity (melting temperatures (Tm) close to the reaction temperature of 37&#8201;&#176;C) to avoid product inhibition and maintain high specificity. However, RNA cleavage might be limited by the RNA binding step especially if the RNA is folded in secondary structures. This calls for the need for two high&#8208;affinity RNA&#8208;binding arms. In this study, we optimized 10&#8211;23 Dz&#8208;based OGT agents for cleavage of three RNA targets with different folding energies under multiple turnover conditions in 2&#8197;mM Mg2+ at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Unexpectedly, one optimized Dz had each RNA&#8208;binding arm with a Tm &#8805;60&#8201;&#176;C, without suffering from product inhibition or low selectivity. This phenomenon was explained by the folding of the RNA cleavage products into stable secondary structures. This result suggests that Dz with long (high affinity) RNA&#8208;binding arms should not be excluded from the candidate pool for OGT agents. Rather, analysis of the cleavage products&#8217; folding should be included in Dz selection algorithms. The Dz optimization workflow should include testing with folded rather than linear RNA substrates.

In this study, we optimized 10&#8211;23 Dz-based OGT agents for cleavage of three RNA targets with different folding energies under multiple turnover conditions in 2&#8197;mM Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Unexpectedly, one optimized Dz had each RNA-binding arm with a T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; &#8805;60&#8201;&#176;C, without suffering from product inhibition or low selectivity. This phenomenon was explained by the folding of the RNA cleavage products into stable secondary structures. This result suggests that Dz with long (high affinity) RNA-binding arms should not be excluded from the candidate pool for OGT agents. Rather, analysis of the cleavage products&#8217; folding should be included in Dz selection algorithms. The Dz optimization workflow should include testing with folded rather than linear RNA substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interrogating Aptamer Chemical Space Through Modified Nucleotide Substitution Facilitated by Enzymatic DNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically modified aptamers are typically obtained through SELEX with unnatural nucleotides. If binding affinity or specificity falls short, re&#8208;selection or post&#8208;SELEX methods that are often time&#8208;consuming or synthetically challenging become necessary. To address these issues, we present a chemoenzymatic method for further aptamer modification. Here, we substituted the cubane&#8208;side chains of a previously identified aptamer with bioisosteres and modified cubane moieties using polymerase&#8208;mediated synthesis. This method offers a practical way to streamline post&#8208;SELEX optimization efforts. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Hollenstein et al.

Trihydroxypiperidine iminosugars featured with orthoester moieties double the enzymatic activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) in L444P/L444P mutated fibroblasts, responsible for the neuropathic form of Gaucher Disease







Abstract
Engineering bioactive iminosugars with pH&#8208;responsive groups is an emerging approach to develop pharmacological chaperones (PCs) able to improve lysosomal trafficking and enzymatic activity rescue of mutated enzymes. The use of inexpensive l&#8208;malic acid allowed introduction of orthoester units into the lipophilic chain of an enantiomerically pure iminosugar affording only two diastereoisomers contrary to previous related studies. The iminosugar was prepared stereoselectively from the chiral pool (d&#8208;mannose) and chosen as the lead bioactive compound, to develop novel candidates for restoring the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. The stability of orthoester&#8208;appended iminosugars was studied by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy both in neutral and acidic environments, and the loss of inhibitory activity with time in acid medium was demonstrated on cell lysates. Moreover, the ability to rescue GCase activity in the lysosomes as the result of a chaperoning effect was explored. A remarkable pharmacological chaperone activity was measured in fibroblasts hosting the homozygous L444P/L444P mutation, a cell line resistant to most PCs, besides the more commonly responding N370S mutation.

         <title>An Enzymatic Cofactor Regeneration System for the in&#8208;Vitro Reduction of Isolated C=C Bonds by Geranylgeranyl Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferredoxin from Archaeoglobus fulgidus has been identified that regenerates the cofactor in the corresponding geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR) for the reduction of isolated C=C bonds. The reaction was coupled to an unspecific ferredoxin reductase from E.&#8197;coli and a glucose dehydrogenase/glucose regeneration system for NAD(P)+ to enable reactions with purified enzymes. Moreover, reactions can be performed in E.&#8197;coli cell&#8208;free extracts.







Abstract
Cofactor regeneration systems are of major importance for the applicability of oxidoreductases in biocatalysis. Previously, geranylgeranyl reductases have been investigated for the enzymatic reduction of isolated C=C bonds. However, an enzymatic cofactor&#8208;regeneration system for in&#8197;vitro use is lacking. In this work, we report a ferredoxin from the archaea Archaeoglobus fulgidus that regenerates the flavin of the corresponding geranylgeranyl reductase. The proteins were heterologously produced, and the regeneration was coupled to a ferredoxin reductase from Escherichia coli and a glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis, thereby enabling the reduction of isolated C=C bonds by purified enzymes. The system was applied in crude, cell&#8208;free extracts and gave conversions comparable to those of a previous method using sodium dithionite for cofactor regeneration. Hence, an enzymatic approach to the reduction of isolated C=C bonds can be coupled with common systems for the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactors, thereby opening new perspectives for the application of geranylgeranyl reductases in biocatalysis.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries were employed to screen billions of molecules against the histone methyltransferase NSD2. Hits were identified against the PWWP1 domain of NSD2. One chemotype was converted into a VHL1/EloB/EloC E3 ligase PROTAC, which demonstrated selective and on target degradation of NSD2 in cells. The binding MoA of compounds was elucidated by molecular docking and validated by subsequent single&#8208;point mutation studies. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. L.

         <title>Immunological Quantitation of the Glycation Site Lysine&#8208;414 in Serum Albumin in Human Plasma Samples by Indirect ELISA Using Highly Specific Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycation sites on human serum albumin (HSA) appear to be potential biomarkers for diabetes mellitus. In contrast to previous mass spectrometry techniques, immunoassays including ELISA using specific and sensitive antibodies directed against the glycation site (e.g. Lys414) are suitable for high&#8208;throughput screening and thus for routine laboratory analysis.







Abstract
Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder that is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, is common throughout the world and its prevalence is steadily increasing. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent acute complications and life&#8208;threatening long&#8208;term organ damage. Glycation sites in human serum albumin (HSA) are considered to be promising biomarkers of systemic glycemic status. This work aimed to develop a sensitive and clinically applicable ELISA for the quantification of glycation site Lys414 in HSA (HSAK414). The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated by immunizing mice with a glycated peptide. The established indirect ELISA based on mAb 50D8 (IgG1 isotype) yielded a limit of detection of 0.39&#8197;nmol/g HSA for HSAK414 with a linear dynamic range from 0.50 to 6.25&#8197;nmol/g glycated HSA. The inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;day assays with coefficients of variation less than 20&#8201;% indicated good assay performance and precision. Assay evaluation was based on plasma samples from diabetic and non&#8208;diabetic subjects with known HSAK414 glycation levels previously determined by LC&#8211;MS. Both data sets correlated very well. In conclusion, the generated mAb 50D8 and the established ELISA could be a valuable tool for the rapid quantitation of glycation site HSAK414 in plasma samples to evaluate its clinical relevance.

         <title>Inducin Triggers LC3&#8208;Lipidation and ESCRT&#8208;Mediated Lysosomal Membrane Repair</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Sinomenine&#8208;indole pseudo&#8208;natural product, termed Inducin, increases LC3 lipidation independently of canonical autophagy and impairs lysosomal function leading to Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)&#8208;dependent membrane repair ultimately leading to cell death.







Abstract
Lipidation of the LC3 protein has frequently been employed as a marker of autophagy. However, LC3&#8208;lipidation is also triggered by stimuli not related to canonical autophagy. Therefore, characterization of the driving parameters for LC3 lipidation is crucial to understanding the biological roles of LC3. We identified a pseudo&#8208;natural product, termed Inducin, that increases LC3 lipidation independently of canonical autophagy, impairs lysosomal function and rapidly recruits Galectin 3 to lysosomes. Inducin treatment promotes Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)&#8208;dependent membrane repair and transcription factor EB (TFEB)&#8208;dependent lysosome biogenesis ultimately leading to cell death.

         <title>Dissection of MKK6 and p38 Signaling Using Light&#8208;Activated Protein Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying stress&#8208;activated signaling is challenging, because stress conditions induce adaptation and impose selection pressure. Applying an optogenetic system to express light&#8208;activated p38&#945; or its upstream activator, MKK6, the functional roles of these kinases in dynamic signaling programs are clarified.







Abstract
Stress&#8208;activated signaling pathways orchestrate cellular behaviors and fates. Studying the precise role(s) of stress&#8208;activated protein kinases is challenging, because stress conditions induce adaptation and impose selection pressure. To meet this challenge, we have applied an optogenetic system with a single plasmid to express light&#8208;activated p38&#945; or its upstream activator, MKK6, in conjunction with live&#8208;cell fluorescence microscopy. In starved cells, decaging of constitutively active p38&#945; or MKK6 by brief exposure to UV light elicits rapid p38&#8208;mediated signaling, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and apoptosis with different kinetics. In parallel, light activation of p38&#945; also suppresses autophagosome formation, similarly to stimulation with growth factors that activate PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling. Active MKK6 negatively regulates serum&#8208;induced ERK activity, which is p38&#8208;independent as previously reported. Here, we reproduce that result with the one plasmid system and show that although decaging active p38&#945; does not reduce basal ERK activity in our cells, it can block growth factor&#8208;stimulated ERK signaling in serum&#8208;starved cells. These results clarify the roles of MKK6 and p38&#945; in dynamic signaling programs, which act in concert to actuate apoptotic death while suppressing cell survival mechanisms.

         <title>Application of Vitreoscilla Hemoglobin as a Green and Efficient Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of Benzoxazoles in Water</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new efficient and green biocatalysis system was reported for the synthesis of benzoxazoles catalyzed by Vitreoscilla hemoglobin. High yields of desired products (up to 94&#8201;%) were obtained under mild conditions within 1&#8197;h in water. A gram&#8208;scale reaction was also successfully conducted. This strategy also extends the application of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin in non&#8208;natural reactions and green biocatalysis.







Abstract
We report an efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method for the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of benzoxazoles in water at room temperature. tert&#8208;Butyl hydroperoxide and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy were used as oxidant and radical scavenger, respectively. A total of 27 functionally diverse benzoxazoles were prepared in moderate to high yields (62&#8201;%&#8208;94&#8201;%) by the annulation reaction of phenols with amines in the presence of VHb in 1&#8197;h. Thus, this method is highly viable for practical applications. This work broadens the application of hemoglobin to organic synthesis.

         <title>Orthogonal End Labelling of Oligonucleotides through Dual Incorporation of Click&#8208;Reactive NTP Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemoenzymatic method involving dual incorporation of &#947;&#8208; and 3&#8242;&#8208;modified NTPs allows sequential 5&#8242;&#8208; and 3&#8242;&#8208;end labelling of DNA and RNA molecules.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of nucleic acid structures with clickable functionality is a versatile tool that facilitates many emerging applications, including immune evasion, enhancements in stability, fluorescent labelling, chemical 5&#8242;&#8208;RNA&#8208;capping and the development of functional aptamers. While certain chemoenzymatic approaches for 3&#8242;&#8208;azido and alkynyl labelling are known, equivalent 5&#8242;&#8208;strategies are either inefficient, complex, or require harsh chemical conditions. Here, we present a modular and facile technology to consecutively modify DNA and RNA strands at both ends with click&#8208;modifiable functional groups. Our approach using &#947;&#8208;modified ATP analogues facilitates T4&#8197;PNK&#8208;catalysed 5&#8242;&#8208;modification of oligonucleotides, a process that is compatible with TdT&#8208;catalysed 3&#8242;&#8208;elongation using 3&#8242;&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;ddGTP. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for both oligo&#8208;oligo ligations, as well ssDNA circularization. We anticipate that such approaches will pave the way for the synthesis of highly functionalised oligonucleotides, improving the therapeutic and diagnostic applicability of oligonucleotides such as in the realm of next&#8208;generation sequencing.

         <title>Investigation Of The Biosynthesis Pathway That Generates cis&#8208;Jasmone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GC MS/MS experiments using deuterium&#8208;labelled methyl jasmonate, methyl 4,5&#8208;didehydro&#8208;jasmonate, and methyl 3,7&#8208;didehydro&#8208;jasmonate. The compounds were provided by air propagation, and the biosynthetic pathways identified to produce jasmonic acid and cis&#8208;jasmone were separate and independent in Mentha suavelons.







Abstract
Researchers have established that (+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid ((+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA) is an intermediate in the production of cis&#8208;jasmone (CJ); however, the biosynthetic pathway of CJ has not been fully described. Previous reports stated that CJ, a substructure of pyrethrin II produced by pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium), is not biosynthesized through this biosynthetic pathway. To clarify the ambiguity, stable isotope&#8208;labelled jasmonates were synthesized, and compounds were applied to apple mint (Mentha suaveolens) via air propagation. The results showed that cis&#8208;jasmone is not generated from intermediate (+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA, and (+)&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA is not produced from 3,7&#8208;dideydro&#8208;JA (3,7&#8208;ddh&#8208;JA); however, 3,7&#8208;didehydro&#8208;JA and 4,5&#8208;didehydro&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;JA were converted into CJ and JA, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Content Image&#8208;Based Screening and Deep Learning for the Detection of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drug Leads</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our screen, compound&#8208;treated macrophages are either stimulated with LPS or not, then fixed, stained, and imaged. Control images are used to train a deep learning algorithm to identify which compounds are associated with the unstimulated phenotype in the presence of LPS. Hits were explored with a single&#8208;cell linear classifier and cytokine panels.







Abstract
We developed a high&#8208;content image&#8208;based screen that utilizes the pro&#8208;inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and murine macrophages (RAW264.7) with the goal of enabling the identification of novel anti&#8208;inflammatory lead compounds. We screened 2,259 bioactive compounds with annotated mechanisms of action (MOA) to identify compounds that block the LPS&#8208;induced phenotype in macrophages. We utilized a set of seven fluorescence microscopy probes to generate images that were used to train and optimize a deep neural network classifier to distinguish between unstimulated and LPS&#8208;stimulated macrophages. The top hits from the deep learning classifier were validated using a linear classifier trained on individual cells and subsequently investigated in a multiplexed cytokine secretion assay. All 12 hits significantly modulated the expression of at least one cytokine upon LPS stimulation. Seven of these were allosteric inhibitors of the mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2) and showed similar effects on cytokine expression. This deep learning morphological assay identified compounds that modulate the innate immune response to LPS and may aid in identifying new anti&#8208;inflammatory drug leads.

         <dc:description>
Exploring Interactions: Catechol Molecules and Amyloid Proteins. This review delves into intricate mutual interactions between catechol&#8208;containing molecules and aggregation&#8208;prone proteins. While previous research has primarily focused on unidirectional interactions, we examine their multifaceted dynamics, shedding light on chemical insights and three&#8208;dimensional orientations that may unlock undiscovered roles in supramolecular structures.







Abstract
This review introduces multifaceted mutual interactions between molecules containing a catechol moiety and aggregation&#8208;prone proteins. The complex relationships between these two molecular species have previously been elucidated primarily in a unidirectional manner, as demonstrated in cases involving the development of catechol&#8208;based inhibitors for amyloid aggregation and the elucidation of the role of functional amyloid fibers in melanin biosynthesis. This review aims to consolidate scattered clues pertaining to catechol&#8208;based amyloid inhibitors, functional amyloid scaffold of melanin biosynthesis, and chemically designed peptide fibers for providing chemical insights into the role of the local three&#8208;dimensional orientation of functional groups in manifesting such interactions. These orientations may play crucial, yet undiscovered, roles in various supramolecular structures.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange Kinetics and Redox Potential of the Coenzyme M and Coenzyme B Heterodisulfide, an Electron Acceptor Coupled to Energy Conservation in Methanogenic Archaea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterodisulfide CoB&#8722;S&#8722;S&#8722;CoM is a central redox cofactor for energy conservation in methanogenesis and methane oxidation, and its redox potential is a key value to detangle the associated processes. We analysed its thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange kinetics and deduced its standard redox potentials from equilibrium mixtures that were quantified via 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea play important roles in the global carbon cycle by interconverting CO2 and methane. To conserve energy from these metabolic pathways that happen close to the thermodynamic equilibrium, specific electron carriers have evolved to balance the redox potentials between key steps. Reduced ferredoxins required to activate CO2 are provided by energetical coupling to the reduction of the high&#8208;potential heterodisulfide (HDS) of coenzyme M (2&#8208;mercaptoethanesulfonate) and coenzyme B (7&#8208;mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate). While the standard redox potential of this important HDS has been determined previously to be &#8722;143&#8197;mV (Tietze et&#8197;al. 2003 DOI: 10.1002/cbic.200390053), we have measured thiol disulfide exchange kinetics and reassessed this value by equilibrating thiol&#8208;disulfide mixtures of coenzyme M, coenzyme B, and mercaptoethanol. We determined the redox potential of the HDS of coenzyme M and coenzyme B to be &#8722;16.4&#177;1.7&#8197;mV relative to the reference thiol mercaptoethanol (E0&#8217;=&#8722;264&#8197;mV). The resulting E0&#8217; values are &#8722;281&#8197;mV for the HDS, &#8722;271&#8197;mV for the homodisulfide of coenzyme M, and &#8722;270&#8197;mV for the homodisulfide of coenzyme B. We discuss the importance of these updated values for the physiology of methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea and their implications in terms of energy conservation.

         <title>Interrogating Aptamer Chemical Space Through Modified Nucleotide Substitution Facilitated by Enzymatic DNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;SELEX modification of aptamers allows to improve their performance but comes at the cost of uncertain and labor&#8208;intensive structure activity relationship studies. Here, we have evaluated the possibility of improving a previously reported, chemically modified aptamer by combining enzymatic synthesis and nucleotides bearing bioisosteres of the parent cubane side&#8208;chains or substituted cubane moieties. This method lowers the synthetic burden associated with post&#8208;SELEX approaches and allowed to identify one additional sequence that maintains binding to the PvLDH target protein, albeit with reduced specificity.







Abstract
Chemical modification of aptamers is an important step to improve their performance and stability in biological media. This can be performed either during their identification (mod&#8208;SELEX) or after the in&#8197;vitro selection process (post&#8208;SELEX). In order to reduce the complexity and workload of the post&#8208;SELEX modification of aptamers, we have evaluated the possibility of improving a previously reported, chemically modified aptamer by combining enzymatic synthesis and nucleotides bearing bioisosteres of the parent cubane side&#8208;chains or substituted cubane moieties. This method lowers the synthetic burden often associated with post&#8208;SELEX approaches and allowed to identify one additional sequence that maintains binding to the PvLDH target protein, albeit with reduced specificity. In addition, while bioisosteres often improve the potency of small molecule drugs, this does not extend to chemically modified aptamers. Overall, this versatile method can be applied for the post&#8208;SELEX modification of other aptamers and functional nucleic acids.

         <title>Prodrug&#8208;Type Phosphotriester Oligonucleotides with Linear Disulfide Promoieties Responsive to Reducing Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prodrug&#8208;type phosphotriester&#8208;modified oligonucleotide bearing linear disulfide promoiety can be converted quickly into an unmodified oligonucleotide in a glutathione&#8208;based intracellular mimetic reducing environment. The modification enhances the stability in serum and promotes the cellular uptake of oligonucleotide. In addition, the gapmer bearing linear disulfide promoieties can exhibit gene silencing activity.







Abstract
Various chemical modifications have been developed to create new antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) for clinical applications. Our previously designed prodrug&#8208;type phosphotriester&#8208;modified oligonucleotide with cyclic disulfides (cyclic SS PTE ON) can be converted into unmodified ON in an intracellular&#8208;mimetic reducing environment. However, the conversion rate of the cyclic SS PTE ON was very low, and the AON with cyclic SS PTE modifications showed much weaker antisense activity than corresponding to the fully phosphorothioate&#8208;modified AON. In this study, we synthesized several types of PTE ONs containing linear disulfides (linear SS PTE ONs) and evaluated their conversion rates under reducing conditions. From the results, the structural requirements for the conversion of the synthesized linear SS PTE ONs were elucidated. Linear SS PTE ON with promising promoieties showed a nuclease resistance up to 4.8&#8208;fold compared to unmodified ON and a cellular uptake by endocytosis without any transfection reagent. In addition, although the knockdown activity of the linear SS PTE gapmer AON is weaker than that of the fully phosphorothioate&#8208;modified gapmer AON, the knockdown activity is slightly stronger than that of the cyclic SS PTE gapmer AON. These results suggest that the conversion rates may be related to the expression of the antisense activity.

Abstract
The development of light&#8208;triggered ruthenium (Ru) nanophotocages has revolutionized conventional methods of drug administration, thereby facilitating cancer therapy in a noninvasive and temperate manner. Ru nanophotocages employ a distinct approach known as photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT), wherein light&#8208;induced ligand dissociation yields a toxic metal complex or a ligand capable of performing other functions such as optically controlled protein degradation and drug delivery. Simultaneously, this process is accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which serve as an effective anticancer agent in combination with PACT and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Due to its exceptional attributes of extended tissue penetration, and minimized tissue damage, red light or near&#8208;infrared light is widely acknowledged as the &#8220;phototherapeutic window&#8221; (650&#8211;900&#8197;nm). In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent advancements in Ru nanophotocages within the phototherapeutic range. Diverse aspects, including design principles, photocaging efficacy, photoactivation mechanisms, and potential applications in the field of biomedical chemistry, are discussed. Questions and challenges regarding their synthesis, characterization, and applications are also discussed. This Concept would foster further exploration into the realm of Ru nanophotocages.
