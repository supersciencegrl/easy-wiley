         <title>Adding a C&#8208;terminal amino acid prevents the conformational interconversion of plecanatide analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The principle of structure dictating properties is illustrated by the direct correlation between cyclic peptide conformation and their biological efficacy.&#160;Plecanatide, a synthetic analogue of uroguanylin, has received FDA approval for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS&#8208;C).&#160;Nevertheless, our investigation has revealed that plecanatide undergoes slow conformational interconversion&#160;in slightly acidic conditions.&#160;In response, we strategically incorporated propargylglycine at the carboxyl terminal of plecanatide, a modification that not only facilitates additional functionalization and derivatization but also confers exceptional conformational stability.&#160;Remarkably, the resulting&#160;isomers not only maintained long&#8208;term conformational stability but also exhibited&#160;either preserved or slightly enhanced agonistic activity.&#160;This discovery represents a contribution to drug research focused on plecanatide, particularly in elucidating the relationship between its conformational properties and biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Flexibility of GrsB Thioesterase Leads to the Structural Reassignment of a Gramicidin S Variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide derived from two pentapeptides. The C&#8208;terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of gramicidin S synthetase B (GrsB) dimerizes precursor pentapeptides and cyclizes the resulting linear decapeptide. Recently, a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA), in which a single D&#8208;Phe was replaced by L&#8208;Ser(Allyl), was reported via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis in a native GS producer. To understand how GrsB&#8208;TE processes such modified precursors, we investigated its substrate specificity using synthetic linear peptides. GrsB&#8208;TE cyclized a substrate containing L&#8208;Ser(Allyl) at position 6 but not at position 1. However, the enzymatically synthesized GS&#8208;SA showed a different HPLC retention time than that of the reported GS variant. Further structural and functional analyses, including 1H NMR, antimicrobial assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, revealed that the reported GS&#8208;SA contained D&#8208;Ser(Allyl) rather than L&#8208;Ser(Allyl). These findings reveal a previously unrecognized stereochemical flexibility in GrsB&#8208;TE and support the structural revision of the reported GS variant.</dc:description>

The C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of gramicidin S synthetase B (GrsB) dimerizes precursor pentapeptides and cyclizes the resulting linear decapeptide.

         <title>Efficient Biosynthesis of Polyhydroxybutyrate from Xylose via an In Vitro Synthetic Enzymatic Biosystem with Self&#8208;Sustained Cofactor Regeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vitro biotransformation (ivBT) mediated by in vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystems (ivSEBs) represents a highly promising platform for sustainable biomanufacturing, offering enhanced reaction efficiency by circumventing cellular constraints. In this study, we developed an ivSEB comprising 17 enzymes for the cell&#8208;free biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from D&#8208;xylose via the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A. This ivSEB integrates partial glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, enabling self&#8208;sustained balance of several cofactors including coenzyme A (CoA), NADP+/NADPH and ATP/ADP. Stoichiometric analysis demonstrated a theoretical molar yield of PHB from xylose of 111.1%. Through optimizing concentrations of cofactors and enzymes, the one&#8208;pot reaction produced 44.0 mM (3.8 g/L) PHB from 44.8 mM (6.7 g/L) xylose, corresponding to a molar yield of 98.2%. Even at a higher substrate concentration (13.5 g/L), the yield remained robust (84.5%). This study demonstrated the potential of ivSEB as a scalable and efficient approach for the large&#8208;scale production of PHB and other xylose&#8208;based or acetyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel for 3D Culture and Cell Recovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Properties of semi&#8208;synthetic hydrogels can be fine&#8208;tuned making these attractive for various applications in regenerative medicine. Here, we describe a hydrogel platform based on hyaluronic acid (HA) modified by (1R,8S,9S)&#8208;bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) and a cross&#8208;linker composed of light sensitive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains terminating in azides. The two components can undergo strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) resulting in rapid gel formation. First, we incorporated adipose&#8208;derived mesenchymal stromal cells (aMSCs) in the hydrogel and demonstrated that the cells can be easily retrieved by UV light mediated degradation maintaining viability and retaining spindle&#8208;like shape when the cells were replated. Next, we provided a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of inducing light&#8208;mediated softening of the hydrogel to modulate the morphology of the encapsulated cells. A co&#8208;culture of endothelial cells (cord blood&#8208;derived endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bmMSCs), which are commonly studied for their ability to form capillary&#8208;like vascular networks, were cultured in the regular and light induced softened hydrogels. Non&#8208;photoexposed hydrogels showed cells with a prevalently rounded morphology, whereas stretched cells connecting into a primitive capillary network were observed in the light&#8208;softened hydrogels. Photo&#8208;induced softening offers potential to locally control cell shape and self&#8208;organization capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Matrix&#8208;Assisted Efficient Selection of a High&#8208;Affinity Circular Aptamer for Sensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Density Lipoprotein in Human Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate and rapid detection of&#160;human serum biomakers is crucial&#160;for the early diagnosis of related diseases. Circular aptamers emerge as promising candidates for the precise recognition of these&#160;biomakers due to their remarkable biological and structural stability. In this study, we successfully identified a high&#8208;affinity circular DNA aptamer for Low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL), a key biomarker for cardiovascular diseases, through matrix&#8208;assisted efficient selection strategy&#160;conducted directly in human serum.&#160;This circular aptamer demonstrated&#160;a dissociation constant (Kd) as low as 18 nM&#160;and exhibited exceptional specificity for LDL, showing&#160;negligible responses to closely related analogs such as&#160;high&#8208;density lipoprotein and other abunzaidant human serum substances. We subsequently developed a sensitive aptasensor that utilizes the superior recognition capability of the circular DNA aptamer, which performed&#160;well&#160;even in human serum&#160;(with a limit of detection&#160;down to 0.4 &#956;M and a wide&#160;linear concentration range of three orders of magnitude). This work underscores the feasibility of&#160;rapidly isolating&#160;highly functional circular DNA aptamers in one selection round, thereby&#160;accelerating the discovery of various circular DNA aptamers that are&#160;well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of a wide array&#160;of emerging human serum biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of DnaB&#8211;DnaG Interaction in M. tuberculosis Using Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering&#8208;Based Dissociation Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study characterizes interactions between DnaB helicase and DnaG primase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, surface plasmon resonance, and cross&#8208;linking. The findings reveal that DnaG forms dimers in solution, which are destabilized upon DnaB binding. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism in DNA replication as well as potential targets for antibacterial drug development.

The complex interactions between helicase and primase, two key components of the replisome involved in DNA replication in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are studied. Utilizing purified, complementary domains of these proteins, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and a cross&#8208;linking assay to characterize their binding dynamics are employed. The SPR analysis reveals a binding dissociation constant of 0.21&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.08&#8201;&#956;M, and the cross&#8208;linking assay suggests the possible formation of a heterodimer species. Importantly, a small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering dissociation assay to study the dynamic interactions between the proteins in solution is utilized.

     alt="Characterization of DnaB&#8211;DnaG Interaction in M. tuberculosis Using Small-Angle X-ray Scattering-Based Dissociation Assay"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study characterizes interactions between DnaB helicase and DnaG primase in &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; using small-angle X-ray scattering, surface plasmon resonance, and cross-linking. The findings reveal that DnaG forms dimers in solution, which are destabilized upon DnaB binding. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism in DNA replication as well as potential targets for antibacterial drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex interactions between helicase and primase, two key components of the replisome involved in DNA replication in &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; are studied. Utilizing purified, complementary domains of these proteins, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and a cross-linking assay to characterize their binding dynamics are employed. The SPR analysis reveals a binding dissociation constant of 0.21&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.08&#8201;&#956;M, and the cross-linking assay suggests the possible formation of a heterodimer species. Importantly, a small-angle X-ray scattering dissociation assay to study the dynamic interactions between the proteins in solution is utilized. The findings provide new opportunities for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at DNA replication in &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; by revealing the structural interplay between helicase and primase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Polymer Carrying Antimicrobial Peptide for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Infective Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CP&#8208;1 might be a valuable carrier for DGL 13K, improving its stability and promoting membrane disruption. This presents a viable approach to creating new antimicrobial treatments to fight drug resistance, especially against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a promising avenue for combating drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections, but their clinical utility is often limited by poor bioavailability and stability. This study presents the design and synthesis of a novel, enantiomerically pure 2D&#8208;coordination polymer, {[Cu(dUMP)(dpp)2]&#183;3(H2O)&#183;(NO3)]}n (CP&#8208;1), derived from Cu(II) ions, deoxy&#8208;uridine monophosphate, and 1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (dpp), as a potential delivery system for AMPs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a 2D double helical structure with square pyramidal Cu(II) coordination. Spectroscopic characterization (IR, UV&#8211;vis, thermogravimetric analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction, circular dichroism) confirms the successful synthesis and reveals chirality transfer to the achiral dpp ligand. Molecular docking studies identify DGL 13K as the AMP exhibiting the strongest binding affinity to CP&#8208;1 (&#916;G&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;13.03&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Critically, molecular dynamics simulations provide detailed insights into the mechanism of action of the CP&#8208;1&#8211;DGL 13K complex against a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial membrane. The simulations demonstrate that DGL 13K, stabilized by CP&#8208;1, undergoes conformational changes, penetrating the membrane and disrupting its integrity through pore formation. These findings highlight the potential of CP&#8208;1 as an effective carrier for AMPs, enhancing their stability and facilitating membrane disruption, offering a promising strategy for developing novel antimicrobial therapies to combat drug resistance.

         <title>Computational De Novo Design of Group II Introns Yields Highly Active Ribozymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Group II Introns (G2Is) are large self&#8208;splicing ribozymes with promising biotechnological applications. This study utilized RNA inverse folding to design three novel G2Is. The designed intron Arq.I2, an unexpectedly proficient ribozyme, self&#8208;splices not only in&#8201;vitro, but also in Escherichia coli cells. The results demonstrate that complex ribozyme variants can be designed de&#8201;novo using existing inverse folding algorithms.

Group II introns (G2Is) are large self&#8208;splicing ribozymes with emerging potential in biotechnological applications. Despite growing interest, their complexity has so far precluded efforts to design them from scratch. While computational approaches have enabled the design of small RNA catalysts, methods for engineering large ribozymes remain underdeveloped. Herein, the RNA inverse folding algorithm aRNAque is used to design G2Is from scratch, yielding three novel self&#8208;splicing ribozymes with unusually stable structures. The designed intron Arq.I2 is revealed to be an unexpectedly proficient ribozyme in&#8201;vitro, self&#8208;splicing at a rate comparable to the fastest known G2Is. While most G2Is are believed to be inactive under intracellular conditions in the absence of maturase proteins, it is shown that Arq.I2 self&#8208;splices in Escherichia coli cells. The results demonstrate that highly active variants of large and complex ribozymes can be designed de&#8201;novo with relative ease using existing inverse folding algorithms, paving the way for the design of bespoke ribozymes derived from G2Is for the development of biotechnological tools.

         <title>Hybrid Crosslinking of Collagen&#8208;Mimetic Peptides for Tunable Assembly and Enhanced Biopolymer Encapsulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating Lys&#8208;GTA crosslinking and Zn(II)&#8208;His coordination can induce the self&#8208;assembly of collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides into spherical hollow spheres capable of encapsulating biopolymers.

Collagen, the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix of mammals, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular structure. Collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (CMPs), synthetic biopolymers, have emerged as promising materials for biomedical applications because of their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable chemical and physical properties. In this study, a series of CMPs were designed using a Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly triplet&#8208;based template, incorporating lysine residues for Lys&#8208;glutaraldehyde (Lys&#8208;GTA) crosslinking and histidine residues for metal&#8208;His coordination to facilitate CMP assembly. To modulate the morphology of the assembled structures, peptides of varying lengths were&#160;synthesized and histidine residues within the CMP sequence were strategically positioned. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy confirmed that the designed CMPs assembled into distinct spherical structures under physiological conditions. The fluorescence measurements and confocal microscopy further demonstrated that these peptide&#8208;assembled spheres can encapsulate 40&#8201;K FITC&#8208;Dextran while forming large&#8208;scale structures. In summary, an effective strategy for assembling CMPs into higher&#8208;order spherical structures is developed by integrating Lys&#8208;GTA crosslinking with metal&#8208;His coordination. Notably, these assemblies exhibited the capability to encapsulate large biomolecules, offering valuable insights for the design of collagen&#8208;based biomaterials.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein Sequences from Long&#8208;Lived Animals Display Generally Diminished Aggregation Compared to Shorter&#8208;Lived Animals Including Humans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is no obvious evolutionary pressure in humans to avoid amyloid aggregation that contributes to neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. However, other animals have much longer lifespans. This study finds that &#945;&#8208;synuclein proteins from longer&#8208;lived animals are resistant to aggregation, while proteins from shorter&#8208;lived species are not, irrespective of evolutionary distance.

The overall process of protein aggregation from soluble species to amyloid fibrils is toxic to neurons and can propagate along neuronal connections in ways that potentially explain the pathological progression in most neurodegenerative diseases. One of these aggregation&#8208;prone proteins is &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn), which forms insoluble protein deposits in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. The majority of cases of Parkinson's disease occur fairly late in life, and even early&#8208;onset variants of the disease caused by mutations to &#945;&#8208;Syn occur toward the end of the lifespan for prehistoric man. This suggests a lack of evolutionary pressure to prevent protein aggregation in animals with similar or shorter lifespans. However, &#945;&#8208;Syn is also found in animals with notably longer lifespans. Here, this study tests the aggregation propensity of &#945;&#8208;Syn sequences from short&#8208; and longer&#8208;lived animals at a range of evolutionary distances from humans. This study finds that, in general, longer&#8208;lived animals display slower &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation kinetics and the formation of smaller and less uniform fibrils. Overall, data indicate that some evolutionary pressure may have existed for preventing &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation, but that pressure is lost in the more recent branch of shorter&#8208;lived animals containing humans.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Biology of Serotonin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neurotransmitter serotonin influences a wide range of behaviors and biological processes through a series of serotonin receptors and transporters. Recent photochemical tools have made it possible to follow this complicated web of interactions with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution.

Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5&#8208;HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8211;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross&#8208;linkers. This review examines the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5&#8208;HT, 5&#8208;HTRs, and SERT over the last &#8776;10&#8201;years, with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.

&lt;p&gt;The neurotransmitter serotonin influences a wide range of behaviors and biological processes through a series of serotonin receptors and transporters. Recent photochemical tools have made it possible to follow this complicated web of interactions with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5-HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8211;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross-linkers. This review examines the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5-HT, 5-HTRs, and SERT over the last &#8776;10&#8201;years, with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Antibody&#8208;Based Strategies&#160;for Targeted Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane and extracellular proteins are essential components in various biological processes that ensure cellular function and homeostasis. Their dysregulation is linked to a wide range of diseases, making them pivotal therapeutic targets. Recent innovations in therapeutic strategies have concentrated on targeted protein degradation, particularly via the endocytosis&#8208;lysosome pathway, offering a novel approach to restoring balance within cellular systems. This review elucidates recent advancements in antibody&#8208;based therapeutics designed for the targeted degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins, specifically emphasizing three key mechanisms: lysosomal targeting receptors, transmembrane E3 ligases, and lysosome&#8208;sorting signals that facilitate the degradation of disease&#8208;relevant proteins. We focus on various construction strategies for these antibody&#8208;based therapeutics, highlighting the potential of antibody&#8208;ligand conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and antibody fusion proteins. By leveraging the natural endocytic pathway for efficient protein internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, these antibody&#8208;based platforms hold significant promise for developing targeted therapies for a variety of diseases. Through this review, we aim to provide insights into the exciting field of antibody&#8208;enabled lysosomal degradation and its implications for future therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Growing evidence of post&#8208;COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID&#8208;19. Importantly, the low&#8208;density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2&#8208;independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, we report the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. We observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. Our results revealed that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N&#8208;terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromenone Derivatives as CRM1 Inhibitors for Targeting Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromenone derivatives are synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of chromosome region maintenance 1&#8208;mediated nuclear export, targeting glioblastoma cells. Active compounds demonstrate structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent inhibition, supported by structure&#8211;activity relationships and molecular docking studies. Selected analogs induce nuclear retention of endogenous proteins, show selective cytotoxicity against glioblastoma cell lines, and highlight promising potential for targeted cancer therapy.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers. Due to the complexity and redundancy within signaling networks in GBM, targeted inhibitors of specific pathways have shown only limited success. The nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target, as its inhibition can simultaneously disrupt multiple key oncogenic drivers. Herein, whether chromenone derivatives, known for detecting thiol&#8208;containing molecules, can function as CRM1 inhibitors is explored. Several chromenone&#8208;based derivatives are synthesized and it is demonstrated that they inhibit CRM1&#8208;driven nuclear export in a structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent manner. A preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship is established, providing a rationale for selective CRM1 binding based on molecular docking studies. Additionally, it is showed that the active chromenone derivatives effectively inhibit the nuclear export of endogenous nuclear export signal&#8208;containing substrates in GBM cells. Several of these compounds exhibit selective cytotoxicity against GBM cell lines, highlighting their potential as targeted therapies for GBM.

         <title>Enhancing Peptide Cyclization: Unveiling the Key Roles of Coupling Reagents and Heat for Optimal Results</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization of a de novo octapeptide composed of alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids is optimized by studying the influence of critical factors to improve efficiency, such as coupling reagents, temperature, heating method, chaotropic agents, solvent, and concentration. This work provides a valuable framework for the cyclization of challenging peptides.

Cyclic peptides offer several advantages over their linear counterparts, including enhanced structural stability due to their rigid conformation and increased resistance to enzymatic proteolysis. Additionally, their ring structure and constrained conformation reduce the entropic cost upon binding to receptors and other biological targets, leading to higher binding affinity and specificity. However, peptide macrocyclization is often synthetically challenging due to factors such as reduced entropy, oligomer formation, and C&#8208;terminal epimerization. The conventional approach for synthesizing cyclic peptides involves the direct coupling of amine and carboxyl termini in the solution phase, using protected side&#8208;chain peptides and coupling reagents. Despite this, improving the efficiency of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization remains a key challenge. In this study, the cyclization of a de&#8201;novo octapeptide composed of alternating l&#8208; and d&#8208;amino acids is optimized, in which the impact of various factors on the cyclization process is examined, including coupling reagents, temperature, heating method, chaotropic agents, solvent, and concentration. This investigation has not only led to the identification of efficient cyclization conditions, but also provides a valuable framework for the cyclization of other challenging peptide sequences. The insights gained in this study contribute to the field of peptide chemistry, expanding the understanding of peptide cyclization reactions.

         <title>A De Novo Designed Metalloprotein Displays Variable Thermal Stability and Binding Stoichiometry with Transition Metal Ions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8201;novo designed single&#8208;chain coiled coil protein is unfolded in apo&#8208;state but folds up upon addition of divalent transition metal ions Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II). The resulting metal&#8208;bound complexes exhibit distinct thermal stability and metal stoichiometry, making this protein a promising starting point for the design of fully metal&#8208;selective de&#8201;novo proteins.

Metal&#8208;binding selectivity in natural proteins is determined by multiple factors such as the protein's structure, metal concentration within cellular compartments, and the presence of metallochaperones. The in&#8201;vitro selectivity of proteins for transition metal ions is largely governed by the Irving&#8211;Williams series, which states protein&#8208;metal complex stability follows the order Co(II) &lt; Ni(II) &lt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II). A de&#8201;novo protein has been designed that folds in the presence of certain transition metal ions into a monomeric &#945;&#8208;helical bundle, with the least stable protein&#8208;metal complex being formed with Cu(II). Moreover, when increasing the metal concentration of Cu(II) or Zn(II), more metal ions are incorporated into the protein accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the amount of secondary structure. One reason may be that there is a balance between stability conferred by the coordination of the metal ion(s) and stability conferred by hydrophobic packing of the &#945;&#8208;helical bundle. Metals may therefore adopt distorted coordination geometries, or binding of multiple ions may cause distortion of the protein backbone, leading to compromised folding of the protein scaffold, or variable thermal stabilities of the metalloprotein complexes. This protein scaffold therefore contributes to the deciphering of design rules for metal selectivity in proteins.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 3&#8208;Halochromones via Oxidative &#945;&#8208;Halogenation of Enaminones in TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M Micelles</title>

         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Halochromones are useful intermediates that enable access to bioactive chromone derivatives. A chemoenzymatic method is reported to synthesize 3&#8208;halochromones catalyzed by an engineered vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis. The reactions are performed in an aqueous buffer containing a surfactant TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M and 10% acetone with moderate to excellent yields over a range of substrates.

Synthesis strategies of chromones have been widely investigated due to the abundance of chromone moiety in bioactive compounds and natural products. Of which, 3&#8208;halochromones are a versatile set of precursors to synthetically access valuable compounds with chromone frameworks. Generally, 3&#8208;halochromones are synthesized from o&#8208;hydroxy enaminones through oxidative &#945;&#8208;halogenation, a process that often uses toxic and corrosive chemicals. Herein, an alternative strategy is presented for oxidative &#945;&#8208;halogenation catalyzed by vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) with H2O2/KX (X&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br, and I) in an aqueous medium. With a micellar system from a surfactant TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, substrate concentration can be increased to 50&#8201;mM without compromising the yield, thereby, significantly reducing the use of organic solvents. Substrate scope investigation reveals that bromination and chlorination processes prefer electron&#8208;donating substituents although moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are tolerated (20 examples). Additionally, iodination processes can be performed under the optimized condition. However, slow conversion indicates that further optimization is needed. It is also found that iodination can occur without CiVCPO, albeit at a lower conversion. Further investigation suggests that such a conversion took place via I2 generated in&#8201;situ. Overall, this chemoenzymatic method can offer an environmentally friendly approach to access a variety of 3&#8208;bromo or 3&#8208;chlorochromones.

         <title>Pathological Disulfide Bond Crosslinking: Molecular Insights into Amyloidogenesis and Diseases Progression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores pathological disulfide&#8208;crosslinking as a key driver of amyloidogenic protein misfolding and aggregation. Oxidative and ER stress pathways contributing to disease progression are discussed and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting disulfide&#8208;linked aggregates in neurodegenerative and systemic amyloid diseases are examined.

Amyloidogenesis is a complex process in which normally soluble proteins misfold and assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates known as amyloid fibrils. This pathological process is implicated in a broad range of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and systemic amyloidosis. Recent studies indicate that disulfide&#8208;crosslinking plays a central role in promoting protein aggregation by stabilizing misfolded intermediates. This review highlights the cellular pathways leading to abnormal disulfide bond formation and examines their impact on disease progression. Additionally, a discussion is made on how disulfide&#8208;crosslinked oligomeric species resist degradation, overwhelm proteostasis systems, and serve as precursors for amyloid fibrils. By understanding the role of disulfide crosslinks in protein aggregation, insights into amyloid pathogenesis are gained and potential therapeutic targets for intervention are identified.

         <title>Fucose&#8208;based glycopolymeric nanomicelles for activated platelet&#8208;targeted photothermal thrombolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thrombotic disorders represent a significant global health burden, with conventional thrombolytic therapies often limited by systemic bleeding risks and inadequate thrombus specificity. To address these challenges, a biomimetic glycopolymer&#8208;based nanomicelle system was developed for precision thrombosis management. Utilizing reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization, a type of cationic glycopolymers was synthesized from dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and fucose monomers, which self&#8208;assembles into core&#8208;shell nanomicelles. The hydrophilic corona features multivalent fucose clusters that selectively bind to P&#8208;selectin on activated platelets within thrombi, enabling targeted accumulation, while the hydrophobic core encapsulates the photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG), enhancing its aqueous solubility and photostability. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the ICG&#8208;loaded glycopolymeric nanomicelle ICG@D20F20 exhibited efficient photothermal conversion, generating localized hyperthermia to disrupt fibrin networks. This platform offers several advantages, including precise targeting, synergistic thrombolysis, and enhanced biocompatibility, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional thrombolytics, providing a novel approach for minimally invasive, image&#8208;guided cardiovascular interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>5&#8208;thiohistidine N&#8208;acetyltransferase from Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ovothiol A is a 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivative biosynthesized by a broad range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its redox&#8208;active mercaptoimidazole side chain is believed to protect cells from oxidative stress. The three enzymes that produce ovothiol A from histidine, cysteine, and&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl methionine have been identified and characterized. In contrast, no enzymes are known that produce other 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivatives. Here, we describe a small family of acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A&#8208;dependent transferases that produce&#160;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiohistidine. The discovery of these enzymes from&#160;Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans&#160;and related Bacteroidota provides evidence that the 5&#8208;thiohistidine class may be structurally and functionally more diverse than previously thought.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of a L&#8208;threonine&#8208;utilizing hydrazine synthetase for thrazarine biosynthesis in Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazine synthetases (HSs), consisting of cupin and methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like domains, catalyze hydrazine formation in the biosynthesis of various nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8208;N) bond&#8208;containing secondary metabolites. The structural diversity of the N&#8208;N bond&#8208;containing secondary metabolites synthesized using this system is attributed to the diversity of amino acids (e.g., L&#8208;Glu, L&#8208;Ala, L&#8208;Tyr, L&#8208;Ser, and Gly) that are recognized by the MetRS domain. However, there are still many HS genes in the genome database whose substrates are unknown. In this study, we discovered a putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for thrazarine, a diazo group&#8208;containing secondary metabolite with antitumor activity, by whole&#8208;genome sequencing of the thrazarine producer Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5. In vivo and in vitro analyses showed that ThzN, an HS encoded by this BGC, synthesizes N&#8208;((5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;5&#8208;(amino)pentyl)amino)threonine from L&#8208;Thr and N6&#8208;hydroxylysine. This is the first example of L&#8208;Thr&#8208;utilizing HS. Sequence alignment analysis and structure prediction using Boltz&#8208;1 indicated that the space near Gly417 is important for accommodation of the threonine side chain. The comparison of thrazarine BGC with azaserine BGC indicated that the biosynthetic mechanism of the diazo group of thrazarine is different from that of azaserine. This study expands the diversity of HSs and provides new insights into the biosynthesis of diazo groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Antibiotic Efficacy of Azole Drugs against Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus by Coordination to Rhenium Carbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a library of rhenium di&#8208; and tricarbonyl complexes featuring various antimicrobial azoles as monodentate ligands was synthesized and characterized. Their antimicrobial activity was evaluated against both methicillin&#8208;sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin&#8208;resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus, and selected compounds were also assessed for cytotoxicity, yielding promising therapeutic indices. Notably, the complexation of antifungal azoles to the rhenium core enhanced antimicrobial efficacy, with a compound exhibiting up to a 32&#8208;fold improvement in MIC values relative to the parent azole. Structure&#8208;activity relationships indicated that cationic fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3]+ complexes consistently outperformed their cis&#8208;[Re(CO)2]+ counterparts, and mechanistic studies suggest that active complexes disrupt bacterial membrane integrity and interfere with the electron transport chain. Complementary small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and in silico analysis corroborate these findings, offering insights into the mechanism of action of this family of complexes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, a library of rhenium di- and tricarbonyl complexes featuring various antimicrobial azoles as monodentate ligands was synthesized and characterized. Their antimicrobial activity was evaluated against both methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus, and selected compounds were also assessed for cytotoxicity, yielding promising therapeutic indices. Notably, the complexation of antifungal azoles to the rhenium core enhanced antimicrobial efficacy, with a compound exhibiting up to a 32-fold improvement in MIC values relative to the parent azole. Structure-activity relationships indicated that cationic fac-[Re(CO)3]+ complexes consistently outperformed their cis-[Re(CO)2]+ counterparts, and mechanistic studies suggest that active complexes disrupt bacterial membrane integrity and interfere with the electron transport chain. Complementary small-angle X-ray scattering and in silico analysis corroborate these findings, offering insights into the mechanism of action of this family of complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pancatalytic tumor therapy by ultrasound activation of inorganic sonosensitizers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pancatalytic therapy (PCT) is a comprehensive framework for disease management through the holistic control of catalytic and quasi&#8208;catalytic processes, including preparation (P) of catalysts, activation (A) of specific bio&#8208;effects and nontoxic&#8208;treatment (N) of different diseases. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated inorganic sonosensitizers have emerged as a powerful platform for pancatalytic tumor therapy, enabling precise and non&#8208;invasive cancer treatment through localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the specific sonocatalytic mechanism. Upon exposure to US activation, inorganic sonosensitizers generate electron&#8208;hole pairs that produce sonocatalytic effect, generating cytotoxic ROS to induce oxidative damage in tumor cells. With ongoing advances in nanomaterial design and US technology, inorganic sonosensitizers represent a transformative approach for precision oncology, offering a versatile and clinically translatable solution for the emerging pancatalytic tumor eradication. This comprehensive review summarizes and highlights recent developments in different kinds of inorganic sonosensitizers and their specific application for pancatalytic tumor therapy. This review begins with providing an overview of inorganic sonosensitizers. The focus is then shifted to US&#8208;activated pancatalytic tumor therapy with high therapeutic efficacy. The biosafety and biospecificity of US&#8208;activated sonosensitizers on combating tumor were further discussed. Finally, the critical challenges and perspectives on potential directions for future clinical translation of this technology are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Biosynthesis and Direct Incorporation of Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids into Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autonomous cells are engineered biological systems capable of biosynthesising and directly incorporating non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. These systems have the potential to extend the applicability of the genetic code to enable large&#8208;scale fermentative production of proteins carrying ncAAs. This work evaluates approaches for the generation of autonomous and semi&#8208;autonomous cells. Semi&#8208;autonomous cells rely on the external addition of a precursor, which is enzymatically converted in vivo to an ncAA that is directly incorporated. In contrast, autonomous cells have a metabolic system that produces and directly incorporates an ncAA in vivo. Through a critical evaluation of the state of the art, the reader is provided with an opinion on the future development of the field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tailored Phospho&#8208;p53 Library Probes Antibody Specificity and Recognition Limitations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated isoforms of the tumor suppressor p53 &#8211; encompassing all seven known phosphorylation sites within the TAD1 domain &#8211;are created upon optimization of semisynthesis protocols. This &#8220;designer" p53 library enabled validation of phosphorylation&#8208;specific p53 antibodies and revealed epitope masking by phosphorylation in commonly used antibodies.

The tumor suppressor protein p53, known as the &#8220;guardian of the genome,&#8221; is regulated by a complex network of post&#8208;translational modifications. Phosphorylations at 7 Ser/Thr residues within the N&#8208;terminal transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) play a role in p53 activation, yet their precise mechanisms of action remain elusive due to challenges in accessing well&#8208;defined phosphorylated isoforms. To address this limitation, this study harnesses a recently developed approach for the semisynthesis of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated p53 to generate a comprehensive library of singly phosphorylated p53 including all TAD1 sites: Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Thr18, Ser20, Ser33, and Ser37. The library was then used to probe the specificity of common p53 antibodies in western blot analysis. This study's results confirm the specificity of the target site of most phosphorylation&#8208;specific anti&#8208;p53 antibodies, but also reveal wide&#8208;spread epitope masking by phosphorylation, which has implications for p53 research and diagnostics. This "designer" p53 library thus provides a toolkit to study the function of p53 phosphorylation directly and indirectly as a quality control agent for some of the most widely used reagents in the field.

         <title>Advancing the Exploration of the Ubiquitin&#8208;like Protein FUBI with Synthetic Chemical Tools</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a novel synthetic platform by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis for generating FUBI&#8208;based chemical tools to investigate FUBIylation, a poorly understood ubiquitin&#8208;like signaling process linked to cancer. By employing these innovative probes, we uncover novel FUBI interactors, paving the way for transformative insights into FUBI biology and its therapeutic potential.

The Ubiquitin&#8208;like protein FUBI is encoded in humans by the FAU gene, whose down&#8208;regulation in prostate, ovarian and breast cancer is significantly associated with poor prognosis. Despite its implications in disease progression, the regulatory mechanisms orchestrated by FUBI remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, a linear synthetic platform is developed to generate FUBI chemical tools, enabling the site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural building blocks and the introduction of fluorophores, tags, and reactive warheads. Using this platform, activity&#8208;based probes are created for FUBI conjugation and deconjugation enzymes, validating them in cell lysate&#8208;based assays and proteomics. Additionally, a triazole&#8208;linked Di&#8208;FUBI is synthesized to investigate FUBI chain modulators. Among the proteomics hits, IMPDH1 and the deubiquitinase UCHL3 are identified as novel Di&#8208;FUBI specific interactors. Further characterization revealed that Di&#8208;FUBI inhibits UCHL3 cleavage activity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, suggesting a novel regulatory interplay between UCHL3 and FUBI. Collectively, these tools demonstrate the versatility of the synthetic FUBI platform, advancing the characterization of FUBI&#8208;related enzymes in the ongoing efforts to decipher the complex code of ubiquitin&#8208;like signaling.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Ephedrine Initiated by Pyridoxal Phosphate&#8208;Dependent Formation of Cathinone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative pathway to ephedra alkaloids via (S)&#8211;cathinone is investigated in plants. This pathway circumvents the formation of 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione as an intermediate, which has been part of the predominantly postulated biosynthetic pathway for the last decades. This alternative pathway involves an enzymatic pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent carboligation of benzoyl&#8208;CoA and L&#8208;alanine in a single step.

Ephedra alkaloids possess some of the most basic structures of alkaloids. Despite their importance for human use and their commercial relevance, the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids has remained enigmatic. The predominant biosynthetic pathway in the literature proposes a thiamin&#8208;dependent carboligation followed by a transaminase, although no candidate enzymes have yet been identified in ephedra alkaloid producers. In this work, an alternative pathway in plants to ephedra alkaloids via (S)&#8211;cathinone is investigated that circumvents the formation of 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione as an intermediate and is in full agreement with previous biosynthetic studies. This alternative pathway involves the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent carboligation of &#8211;benzoyl&#8208;CoA&#8211; and L&#8208;alanine in a single step. The PLP&#8208;dependent formation of labeled and unlabeled (S)&#8211;cathinone is detected in the plant lysate of young stem tissue of various Ephedra species that contain Ephedra alkaloids, as well as in young leaf tissue of Catha edulis. The incorporation of labeled nitrogen from L&#8208;alanine into (S)&#8208;cathinone supports the hypothesis that an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase (AOS) catalyzes the formation of (S)&#8208;cathinone, bypassing the dione as an intermediate. These results demonstrate the involvement of a PLP&#8208;dependent AOS as a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids.

         <title>Catalytic Characterization of &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Halohydrin Dehalogenase from Novosphingobium resinovorum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halohydrin dehalogenase from Novosphingobium resinovorum (HHDHnsr) is characterized with high &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity in azide&#8208;mediated epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions. Phylogenetic analysis classifies HHDHnsr as a G&#8208;type enzyme, designated as HheG4. By combining HheG4 with &#946;&#8208;regioselective HHDHs, a parallel kinetic resolution strategy is proposed for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;azidoalcohols from racemic epoxides.

Halohydrin dehalogenases are highly valuable biocatalysts for chiral compound synthesis due to their diverse catalytic capabilities and inherent stereoselectivity. Historically, research on halohydrin dehalogenases is confined to a limited number of enzymes. However, with the advent of advanced gene mining methods, a growing number of halohydrin dehalogenases have been discovered and characterized, revealing a diverse array of new structures and catalytic functions. While halohydrin dehalogenases predominantly exhibit &#946;&#8208;regioselectivity in the ring&#8208;opening of styrene oxides, a few &#945;&#8208;regioselective halohydrin dehalogenases have also been identified. In this study, a new &#945;&#8208;regioselective halohydrin dehalogenase, HHDHnsr, is purified and analyzed, and its application in the azide&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;regioselective azidolysis of styrene oxide is explored. The findings highlight the potential of HHDHnsr as &#945;&#8208;regioselective biocatalyst for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;azidoalcohols, offering valuable insights for the future identification of &#945;&#8208;regioselective HHDHs in enzyme mining.

         <title>Hijacking the MDM2 E3 Ligase with Novel BRD4&#8208;Targeting Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of novel ligands recruiting less explored E3 ligases remains challenging.&#160; Herein, the discovery of a novel Mouse double minute 2&#8208;recruiting Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera is reported, which shows preferential degradation of the Bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 short isoform (BRD4 S) and c&#8208;Myc compared with MZ1, a validated Von&#8208;Hippel Lindau&#8208;based PROTAC.

The phenotypic effect induced by a Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) can depend on several factors, including the E3 ligase recruited. For the discovery of a first&#8208;in&#8208;class PROTAC for a target of interest, the E3 ligases commonly hijacked remain the Von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL) and Cereblon (CRBN) since potent and accessible ligands are readily available to recruit them. Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) E3 ligase stands out because it regulates p53 levels to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, the synthesis of the most potent MDM2 ligands remains very complex. Herein, the discovery of novel MDM2&#8208;recruiting PROTACs incorporating rac&#8208;Nutlin&#8208;3 as a ligand with an easier synthetic tractability is reported, further demonstrating its potential in this technology. The most promising degrader, PROTAC 3, showed preferential degradation of the BRD4 short&#160;isoform (BRD4 S) and c&#8208;Myc compared with MZ1, a validated VHL&#8208;based PROTAC.

         <title>2&#8208;oxoglutarate analogue&#8208;based biomolecular tools for exploring structure&#8208;activity relationships in non&#8208;heme iron enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme iron (NHFe) enzymes constitute a family of enzymes that use 2OG and oxygen to catalyze the hydroxylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. These enzymes are of biological importance and therapeutic interest due to their role in regulating various cellular processes. Herein, we have rationally designed two classes of 2OG analogues and have used them as tools to investigate the active site of a 2OG&#8208;dependent NHFe enzyme, prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2). Using an activity assay in conjunction with steady&#8208;state kinetics, we identify a new class of aryl&#8208;conjugated 2OG analogues that exhibit 12&#8208;fold varied inhibition and compete with 2OG for the PHD2 active site. Immunoblot studies suggest that these analogues are biologically active and could target PHD2 intracellularly. Furthermore, computational modelling studies reveal that the analogues bind to the active site in a &#8220;flipped&#8221; conformation relative to 2OG, and functional group placement is responsible for their different inhibition capabilities. Our mutagenesis studies further validate this unique binding mode and suggest several interactions that are crucial for inhibition. Overall, these studies provide a toolkit of 2OG analogues to establish structure&#8208;activity relationships and identify interactions that could be useful for PHD2 inhibitor design.</dc:description>

         <title>An Oxyprenylated Phenylpropanoid Pharmacologic Scaffold for SelU Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MnmH, better known as 2&#8208;selenouridine synthase (SelU), is a member of the Mnm family of enzymes that work in concert to modify uridine at the wobble position.&#160; Instrumental in maintaining base pair fidelity and exclusive to bacteria, SelU is a promising drug target and insights into this enzyme&#8217;s mechanism of catalysis have been empirically gleaned and proven useful in our ligand&#8208;based drug design. In this study, we selected a small library of natural products and semisynthetic oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids based on their compositional resemblance to the purported SelU ligands.&#160; Specifically, these compounds contained one or more geranyl groups branching from aromatic frameworks, all of which were believed to heighten affinity to SelU. &#160;Meticulous screening of each compound against an N&#8208;terminal SelU construct via fluorescence quenching of W83 further revealed details on the enzyme&#8208;substrate binding mode.&#160; Conformational flexibility of residues around W83 was suggested by the slow bimolecular quenching constants calculated for each compound.&#160; This was consistent with the single binding site and the blend of interaction&#8208;types calculated at the active site. Lastly, we established this general oxyprenylated chain framework, along with a cinnamic acid moiety, as a pharmacologic scaffold that can be further optimized into an antibiotic.</dc:description>

A Cyclized Helix&#8208;Loop&#8208;Helix Peptide as a Molecular Scaffold for Cell&#8208;Membrane Permeable Inhibitors for the Interaction Between Estrogen Receptor &#945; and Coactivator SRC1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclized helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (cHLH) peptide is used as a molecular scaffold to generate cell&#8208;permeable protein&#8211;protein interactions inhibitors by bifunctional grafting. The steroid receptor coactivator&#8208;1 (SRC1) epitope (red) was grafted onto the C&#8208;terminal helix, and six arginine residues (cyan) were grafted onto the other helix. The designed peptide cHLH&#8208;ER&#945; inhibited the&#160;estrogen receptor &#945; (ER&#945;)&#8211;SRC1 interaction and showed cell membrane permeability.

The molecular design of inhibitors against intracellular protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) is of interest for drug discovery and chemical biology. Herein, a novel cyclized helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (cHLH) peptide that inhibited the intracellular PPI between estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) and coactivator SRC1 are designed. The peptide, cHLH&#8208;ER&#945;, bound to ER&#945; and inhibited the interaction between ER&#945; and the coactivator SRC1. Cellular imaging and yeast reporter assays showed that cHLH&#8208;ER&#945; penetrated the cell membrane and exhibited antagonistic activity against ER&#945;&#8208;SRC1 to inhibit the growth of a breast cancer cell.

         <title>Designing an Entactin&#8208;Inspired Short Bioactive Hydrogel as Biofunctional Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembling behavior of a novel bioactive peptide sequence derived from the G3 domain of the entactin protein is explored. The structural modifications leading to differential nanofibrous entanglement of these entactin&#8208;inspired peptide hydrogels at physiological pH upon cell culture media perfusion further prove the potential of these hydrogels in effectively controlling the cellular behavior.

Self&#8208;assembled peptide hydrogels developed from bioactive domains of extracellular matrix (ECM) have shown great capabilities to mimic the structural and functional aspects of ECM. In this direction, the&#160;self&#8208;assembling potential of a minimalist bioactive sequence (YWTD) derived from one of the essential bridging proteins of ECM, i.e., entactin, is explored. However, at physiological pH, the negative charge of the aspartate residue induces strong intermolecular repulsion that prevents the self&#8208;assembly of the peptide monomers. Interestingly, the peptide forms self&#8208;supporting hydrogels at a slightly acidic pH, i.e., pH 6.2, through surface charge neutralization, thereby minimizing the repulsive interaction. Since it is aimed to explore its use in controlling cellular adhesion and proliferation, the buffering capacity of the media is utilized to adjust the pH of the gel to physiological levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on self&#8208;assembly of a novel bioactive sequence derived from the G3 domain of entactin protein. These hydrogels self&#8208;assembled at physiological pH display a nanofibrous structure with tuneable mechanical stiffness, which are biocompatible toward fibroblast cells. An improved cellular adhesion and proliferation are evident within this novel matrix, thus proving it as a suitable biomaterial with future potential in the field of biomedicine.

         <title>Synthesis of Nucleoside Derivatives by Biomimetic Ester Migration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tRNA aminoacylated nucleosides represent the central transfer unit of amino acids. An occurring 2&#8242;&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;transaminoacylation is biomimetically exploited to successfully synthesize nucleosidic acid esters. This approach can be further expanded on sulfonic acid esters, which has the potential of a broad range of stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;controlled modifications of nucleosides, resulting in precursors or target molecules in medicinal chemistry.

Modified nucleosides play important roles as agents in medicinal chemistry due to their anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and antiproliferative properties, as well as in biochemical processes like protein biosynthesis. Aminoacylated nucleosides in tRNA represent the central transfer unit of amino acids in the biosynthesis of peptides. Consequently, their synthesis in a prebiotic context is of great significance for further elucidations regarding the origin of life. To verify the formation of these structures in complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers, reference structures and their synthesis are of fundamental importance. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of monomeric tRNA nucleoside derivatives frequently result in the production of regioisomeric mixtures or encounter challenges related to isomerization. In this context, a concise and comprehensive approach for the chemical synthesis of nucleosidic amino acid esters is presented. The three&#8208;step reaction sequence exploits the phenomenon of 2&#8242;&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;transaminoacylation in nucleosides providing the desired compounds in high yields. This biomimetic approach is further expanded to the activation of hydroxy groups by application of sulfonic acid esters. This has the potential to facilitate extensive modification via substitution or cross&#8208;coupling reactions, enabling the stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;controlled transformation of nucleosides into valuable target molecules or precursors in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Photoinduced Ene&#8208;Reductase Catalysis via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights the use of ene&#8208;reductases under visible light to trigger single&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction&#8208;initiated radical reactions, enabling controlled C&#63743;C, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;O, and C&#63743;S bond formations. These reactions provide significant assistance in addressing long&#8208;standing challenges in chemical synthesis.

Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) have emerged as powerful biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of various substrates. This review focuses on the recent advances in light&#8208;induced electron transfer and subsequent reduction reactions mediated by EREDs. Upon photoexcitation, the flavin cofactor transitions to an excited state, significantly enhancing its reduction potential. Mechanistic insights into how light activation alters the redox properties of EREDs are discussed, leading to more efficient catalysis. The review also highlights the broadened application scope of photoexcited EREDs in organic synthesis. Additionally, the challenges and future directions in optimizing these light&#8208;driven biocatalytic processes are explored. This overview provides a foundation for developing novel, light&#8208;controlled enzymatic systems with enhanced catalytic performance.

         <title>Mammalian Tolerance to Amino Acid Heterochirality</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organisms preferentially use l&#8208;amino acids (l&#8208;AAs). However, de&#8201;novo synthesized l&#8208;AAs are in part converted to d&#8208;AAs. The ribosome has a robust system to use l&#8208;AAs for protein synthesis, whereas non&#8208;ribosomal synthesis can also use d&#8208;AAs. Furthermore, some AA residues can be post&#8208;translationally isomerized through enzymatic or spontaneous processes. This review discusses how organisms, especially mammals, manage the heterochiral AA environment.

Organisms use amino acids predominantly in l&#8208;configuration. In contrast, a series of studies show that a variety of d&#8208;amino acids also occur in mammals, and amino acid homochirality is not complete. Mammals de&#8201;novo synthesize most amino acids with l&#8208;configuration, but serine and aspartate are converted from l&#8208; to d&#8208;configuration by endogenous enzymes. In addition to endogenous syntheses of d&#8208;amino acids, symbiotic bacteria in mammals chiral&#8208;convert amino acids, including alanine, glutamate, proline, and leucine in the intestine, creating a heterochiral inner environment. d&#8208;amino acids are distributed in distinctive patterns among organs and have physiological roles in the central nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. Mammals manage such diverse d&#8208;amino acids with catabolism and excretion into urine at individual levels. In contrast, at the cellular levels an enantioselection mechanism to regulate chiral homeostasis of amino acids has remained unclear. In protein synthesis, the ribosome has a sophisticated system to eliminate d&#8208;amino acids, whereas non&#8208;ribosomal synthesis also utilizes d&#8208;amino acids. Furthermore, amino acid residues in proteins/peptides can be isomerized post&#8208;translationally through enzymatic or spontaneous processes. This manuscript overviews how the chiral balance of free amino acids or residues in proteins is maintained in mammals at the individual and cellular levels.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Monomeric and Tetrameric Amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 Peptides with d&#8208;Aspartic Acid Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate effects of stereoisomerization of aspartic acid residues in the amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 peptide on aggregation, molecular dynamics simulations of monomers and tetramers using implicit and explicit solvent models are performed. Explicit solvent models are necessary to accurately model peptide&#8211;peptide interactions, and multimer simulations are essential for investigating structural characteristics in proteins containing d&#8208;amino acids.

Amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 (A&#946;1&#8208;42) peptide includes three aspartic acid (Asp) residues. It is known that these Asp residues undergo stereoinversion to d&#8208;Asp in ageing tissues, a process that promotes &#946;&#8208;sheet structure formation. In this study, the 3D structures of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers and tetramers containing d&#8208;Asp residues are analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Seven types of mutants are generated by stereoinverting the three Asp residues, and monomer MD simulations are performed using an implicit solvent model for all seven mutants and the wild type. Following these implicit solvent simulations, tetramer MD simulations using explicit water molecules are conducted for the wild type and three mutants previously reported to form secondary structures in experimental studies. The MD simulations of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers with implicit solvent successfully reproduced the trend of increased &#946;&#8208;structure formation caused by D&#8208;Asp7 and d&#8208;Asp23. However, the effects of d&#8208;Asp1 are only captured in tetramer simulations using explicit water. These findings suggest that explicit water is necessary to accurately model peptide&#8211;peptide interactions and that multimer simulations are essential for investigating structural features, such as &#946;&#8208;sheet formations and aggregation in proteins containing d&#8208;amino acids.

Following these implicit solvent simulations, tetramer MD simulations using explicit water molecules are conducted for the wild type and three mutants previously reported to form secondary structures in experimental studies. The MD simulations of A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; monomers with implicit solvent successfully reproduced the trend of increased &#946;-structure formation caused by &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;-Asp7 and &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp23. However, the effects of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp1 are only captured in tetramer simulations using explicit water. These findings suggest that explicit water is necessary to accurately model peptide&#8211;peptide interactions and that multimer simulations are essential for investigating structural features, such as &#946;-sheet formations and aggregation in proteins containing &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational Constraint for Prevention of Aging of Organophosphate&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging of organophosphate&#8208;inhibited acetylcholinesterase has been a barrier to treatments for toxicity from exposure. Unexpected results led &#160;to exploration of &#160;the use of allosteric effectors to regulate the inhibitor reaction pathway. In addition, an assay was developed to be used as a platform for screening for molecules that prevent or reverse aging.

The covalent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphate compounds (OPCs) prevents the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, and results in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leading to severe cholinergic crisis. To treat toxic exposure to OPCs, the focus has been on using reactivator compounds (e.g., oximes) to reverse the adduct formation in the enzyme's active site, and to release the regenerated, active form of AChE. However, the interaction between the OPC inhibitor and the enzyme is usually followed by a secondary dealkylative reaction in which the OPC &#8220;ages&#8221;, that is, produces an oxyanion on the phosphoryl group that cannot be recovered with standard reactivators. The unexpected discovey that immobilization of AChE prevented aging of OPC adducts led &#160;to the hypothesis that the inhibition and recovery pathways in AChE could be regulated by allosteric effectors that bind to the enzyme at a distance away from the site of inhibition. To demonstrate this, resistance to aging was replicated using bifunctional crosslinking of AChE in solution. This work provides the foundation to expand these principles to other potential effectors.

         <title>Tagatose&#8208;1,6&#8208;Bisphosphate Aldolases, the Unloved DHAP&#8208;Aldolases</title>

         <dc:description>
Tagatose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate aldolases (TagAs) have been understudied, with few available publications reporting poor stereoselectivity. This leads to their classification as the less promising aldolases. The aim of this concept is to revisit these findings and uncover inconsistencies to better understand their true potential. It is believed that, with further exploration, TagAs can prove as valuable as other aldolases in catalyzing stereoselective reactions.

Tagatose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate aldolases (TagA) have been understudied. The limited publications on the subject report a poor stereoselectivity, which quickly leads to their classification among the less interesting aldolases. This conclusion, which appears inadequate, discourages further investigation by other researchers. The objective here is to re&#8208;examine all these studies in detail to finally uncover inconsistencies and unexplained observations regarding the behavior of these enzymes. Ultimately, there is a significant lack of research that can deepen the understanding of TagA, which will likely reveal its potential to be as valuable as its counterparts: fructose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate, rhamnulose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate, and fuculose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate aldolases.

         <title>SAAP&#8208;148 Oligomerizes into a Hexamer Forming a Hydrophobic Inner Core</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly cationic and hydrophobic antimicrobial peptide SAP&#8208;148 effectively eradicates multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, persistent cells, and biofilms without inducing resistance. Its efficiency is likely due to its ability to disrupt bacterial membranes as an oligomer, forming a stable alpha&#8208;helical hexameric bundle with three parallel dimers that create a hydrophobic core.

Human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 derivative, the 24&#8208;mer SAAP&#8208;148, is highly effective in&#8201;vitro in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria without inducing resistance. SAAP&#8208;148 has a high cationic charge (+11) and 46% hydrophobicity, which, once the peptide folds into an alpha helix, forms a wide hydrophobic face. This highly amphipathic nature facilitates on the one hand its insertion into the membrane's fatty acyl chain region and on the other hand it&#180;s interaction with anionic membrane components, which aids in killing bacteria. However, the contributions of the secondary and quaternary structures have not been thoroughly investigated so far. To address this, we applied circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray scattering, AlphaFold 3 protein folding software, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that SAAP&#8208;148 adopts a stable hexameric bundle composed of three parallel dimers, that together form a hydrophobic core of aromatic side chain residues. The hexameric structure is retained at the membrane interface, whereby, MD simulation studies indicated the formation of a fiber&#8208;like structure in the presence of anionic membranes. This certainly seems plausible, as oligomers are stabilized by aromatic residues, and the exposure of positively charged side chains on the surface likely facilitates the transition of the peptide into fibrils on anionic membranes.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Turn Mimicking Crosslinking Provides Hyperstability and Fast Folding Kinetics for Short Collagen Triple Helices</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen triple helices and &#946;&#8208;turns are compatible chemical motifs to fuse based on their identical H&#8208;bond geometry. The resulting collagen triple helices are intramolecularly folded, exhibiting high stability and fast folding kinetics. Besides serving as a scaffold structure for designing short, stable, heterotrimeric collagen triple helices, the bis &#946;&#8208;turn collagen peptides were used to deconvolute a two&#8208;step collagen folding mechanism as a kinetic model.







Abstract
Creating stabilized peptide mimics of the collagen triple helix is challenging, especially for collagen heterotrimers. Interstrand sidechain crosslinking offers a useful approach, though this strategy can suffer from destabilizing structural perturbations, sequence limitations and synthetic complexity. Herein, we show that the geometry of hydrogen bonding in the collagen triple helix is compatible with installation of terminal &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;mimicking linkers at the N&#8208;terminal and C&#8208;terminal ends of the triple helix. These double&#8208;turn&#8208;containing collagen peptide mimics fold into highly stable, intramolecular triple helical structures, providing access to profoundly miniaturized triple helix mimics. Intramolecular triple helix formation exhibits significantly accelerated folding kinetics. Comprehensive kinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;limiting step of folding is distinct at low and high temperatures, affording unique insight into the mechanism.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Loop Dynamics in Reshaping the Conformation of YB&#8208;1 Cold Shock Domain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the regulatory role of the C&#8208;terminal loop in stabilizing the YB&#8208;1 cold shock domain (CSD). Through molecular dynamics simulations, NMR, and crosslinking, it identifies a critical interaction network formed by the loop. Phosphorylation at S102 disrupts this network, altering CSD dynamics, stability, and DNA binding affinity.







Abstract
The human Y&#8208;box binding protein 1 (YB&#8208;1) plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The cold shock domain (CSD) of YB&#8208;1 is responsible for specific nucleic acid recognition and exhibits a unique &#946;&#8208;barrel structure. While the CSD alone is unstable, the addition of 11 residues at the C&#8208;terminus significantly stabilizes the structure. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which this extended loop region influences the structure and dynamics of the CSD using all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by NMR and crosslinking experiments. Our simulations reveal that the extended loop forms a sandwich&#8208;like interaction network with the CSD, stabilizing the overall structure. This network involves hydrogen bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions, preventing the loop from collapsing due to electrostatic attractions. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of S102 within the loop region disrupts this network, leading to increased structural flexibility and conformational changes. This disruption weakens the interaction between CSD and DNA, explaining the experimentally observed decrease in binding affinity upon phosphorylation. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the role of loop dynamics in reshaping the conformation of the YB&#8208;1 CSD.

         <title>Ultraviolet Ozone Pretreatment Enhances Selective PETase Biodegradation of Textiles Compared to Sunlight and Alkali Treatments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research examines polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/cotton textiles biodegradation, using different stressors as enzymatic incubation. It reveals that aggressive chemical treatments (alkali conditions) cause nonspecific degradation, affecting both PET and cotton fibers. UV&#8211;ozone pretreatment synergizes with PETase activity, improving terephthalic acid yield, while natural sunlight shows minimal effects, emphasizing the effectiveness of stronger pretreatment methods for enhancing PET recycling processes.

The rapid growth of the fashion industry has led to increasing textile waste, exacerbating environmental pollution and climate change. To support sustainability and circular economy goals, this study investigates the enzymatic degradation of cotton/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mixed textiles using PETase, comparing wild&#8208;type and mutant (MUT S238F/W159H) variants. To improve enzyme accessibility, three pretreatment strategies are evaluated: alkali treatment, UV&#8211;ozone (UVO) exposure, and natural sunlight weathering. The effects are assessed by measuring textile weight loss, surface morphology (scanning electron microscopy), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and yields of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid. Alkali treatment produces the highest weight loss, while UVO pretreatment moderately degrades textiles and significantly enhances enzymatic TPA production. In contrast, prolonged sunlight exposure has negligible effects. 1H NMR analysis of supernatants confirms the formation of oxidized PET products following UVO exposure, indicating surface chemical modifications that increase enzymatic susceptibility. The results reveal differential effects on PET and cotton fibers, highlighting UVO as a promising, selective pretreatment for mixed textile waste. This study demonstrates the potential of combining photochemical oxidation and enzymatic processes for targeted PET degradation, contributing to more efficient textile recycling strategies.

         <title>Investigation of the Mechanism of Action of Natural and Synthetic Monoterpenoids: For a New Route in Antimycotic Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Bromothymol shows a stunning in&#8201;vivo antimycotic efficacy, even on resistant molds and yeast. Discrete Fourier transform and molecular dynamics approaches reveal that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a high affinity toward the bilayer. Noteworthy, it forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the phosphate in the lipid head, altering its structure and conceivably triggering a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; that affects the overall membrane stability.

Monoterpenoids are well&#8208;recognized natural antimycotic agents, but their mechanism of action is still unclear. Interestingly, synthetic derivatives, such as 4&#8208;bromothymol (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;5&#8208;methylphenol), are emerging as promising alternatives to natural molecules, due to their even greater biological activity. Herein, the antimycotic efficacy of 4&#8208;bromothymol is evaluated: in vivo experiments on species of acclaimed resistance demonstrate that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a minimum inhibitory concentration up to 6 times lower than thymol. In silico investigations, sweeping from partition coefficient (LogP) determination through density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations based on a minimum bias approach, support its improved antifungal activity with respect to thymol, carvacrol, and thymyl acetate. A structural insight of the mechanism of action is proposed. Even though all the analyzed compounds are able to penetrate the cellular membrane, 4&#8208;bromothymol shows a higher predicted affinity for the bilayer, and it causes a strong perturbation at the water/bilayer interface, altering the stability of the membrane, thus leading to cell death.

         <title>Avoiding Misreading during Genetic Reprogramming in mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology, but the in&#8201;vitro translation system it uses to create screening libraries is imperfect. This study examines the prevalence of errors during in&#8201;vitro translation and provides best practices for avoiding such errors to researchers who are designing mRNA display libraries.

mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology. It takes advantage of a reconstituted in&#8201;vitro transcription and translation system to generate highly diverse affinity screening libraries. However, this process relies on the faithful translation of genetically encoded peptides, a conversion that is imperfect. Errors in translational decoding of mRNA can occur, decoupling the produced library from its genetic code. Because mRNA display affinity selections are analyzed with sequencing of the encoding DNA, rather than direct detection of the peptides, misreading silently reduces library diversity and complicates analysis. Herein, the presence of significant translational misreading during the production of mRNA display libraries is confirmed, best practices for genetic reprogramming are developed, and those rules are deployed to minimize the disconnect between genotype and phenotype in peptide affinity selections.

         <title>Gas Microbubble Formation via Near&#8208;Infrared Femtosecond Laser Ablation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A focused femtosecond laser induces photochemical decomposition of intracellular molecules, generating gas microbubbles. The microbubbles form at lower energy inside cell monolayers than in the surrounding medium. This enables the creation of acellular zones for motility assays to evaluate anticancer drugs. Apigenin inhibits motility of A549 lung cancer cells and induces actin filament disassembly.

Focused near&#8208;infrared femtosecond laser irradiation induces efficient photochemical breakdown of intracellular molecules, resulting in the formation of gas microbubbles that ultimately lead to cell death and removal. This study characterizes these microbubbles using high&#8208;speed imaging. Microbubbles generated within cells by single&#8208;pulse irradiation are consistently larger than those formed in the surrounding culture medium across a broad pulse energy range. Notably, the energy threshold for intracellular microbubble formation is several tens of nanojoules lower than in the culture medium, enabling precise cell ablation without inducing extracellular bubbling. Repeated pulse irradiation at 1&#8201;kHz frequency further reduces the energy threshold and increases bubble size, with saturation observed after &#8776;30 pulses. Near&#8208;threshold pulse irradiation is then employed to develop a precise method for investigating cellular motility in&#8201;vitro. Cell&#8208;free zones are created within cell monolayers, enabling motile cells to migrate into the cleared zones. This method is validated using the A549 lung cancer cell line and the plant flavonoid apigenin, which exhibits dose&#8208;dependent reduction in A549 cell motility. These findings highlight the method's potential for evaluating cellular behaviors and screening chemical compounds.

Near-threshold pulse irradiation is then employed to develop a precise method for investigating cellular motility in&#8201;vitro. Cell-free zones are created within cell monolayers, enabling motile cells to migrate into the cleared zones. This method is validated using the A549 lung cancer cell line and the plant flavonoid apigenin, which exhibits dose-dependent reduction in A549 cell motility. These findings highlight the method's potential for evaluating cellular behaviors and screening chemical compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Postlabeling Reveals Nuclear Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Half&#8208;Sandwich Ir(III) Tetrazine Complex in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the synthesis of five tetrazine&#8208;coordinated, half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes and extensively describe their reactivity. Live cell fluorescent bioorthogonal labeling reveals the nuclear tropism of the most cytotoxic complex.

Intracellular imaging of anticancer metallodrugs often relies on prelabeling with organic fluorophores, which significantly affects their physicochemical properties and intracellular distribution. On the other hand, the reported postlabeling strategies based on click&#8208;chemistry reactions require cell fixation and permeabilization. Here, this study presents a postlabeling approach based on the catalyst&#8208;free, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (iEDDA) between a strained fluorescein&#8208;tagged bicyclononyne derivative (BCN&#8208;FAM) and half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes containing bidentate ligands comprising a tetrazine (Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;) entity. Five half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes with formula [Cp*Ir(Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;)Cl]0/+ have been synthesized and fully characterized, including the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of three of the five derivatives. Investigations of their stability and their reactivity in aqueous solution and in a model iEDDA reaction reveal the strong influence of the tetrazine ligand structure on the chemical properties of the corresponding complexes. A highly cytotoxic metallodrug candidate (Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me) is identified from biological studies, and chemical reactivity studies disclose an unusual preference for binding of methionine over cysteine. Postlabeling of Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me in live HeLa cells highlights its preferential accumulation within the nucleus, suggesting its retention through covalent modifications of nuclear proteins in good agreement with other half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Adapted Lipid A from Polaribacter sp. SM1127: A Study of Structural Heterogeneity and Immunostimulatory Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This analysis reveals structural heterogeneity in the lipopolysaccharide lipid A from the cold&#8208;adapted Gram&#8208;negative bacterium Polaribacter sp. SM1127, with variations in fatty acid chain number, length, branching, saturation, and hydroxylation degree, likely aiding bacterial adaptation to cold environmental stressors. Lipopolysaccharide is shown to be a weak activator of Toll&#8208;like receptor 4&#8208;mediated pathway, highlighting its potential as an immunomodulatory molecule.

Polaribacter sp. SM1127, a cold&#8208;adapted marine Gram&#8208;negative bacterium isolated from Laminaria in Arctic waters, plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and biopolymer degradation in cold environments. Additionally, its exopolysaccharide (EPS) exhibits promising biotechnological potential, including antioxidant and wound&#8208;healing properties. This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of lipid A, the glycolipid component of Polaribacter sp. SM1127 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by bypassing full LPS extraction and working directly with the ethanol precipitation product containing both EPS and bacterial cells. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals significant structural heterogeneity in the lipid A, with variations in fatty acid chain length, branching, saturation, and hydroxylation. These features likely enable the bacterium to fine&#8208;tune its response to fluctuating temperatures or other cold&#8208;related environmental stresses, contributing to resilience in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. Furthermore, immunological assays demonstrate that both LPS and EPS produced by Polaribacter sp. SM1127 induce weak Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 activation and, in general, poorly stimulate the nuclear factor kappa&#8208;light&#8208;chain&#8208;enhancer of activated B cells pathway, compared to Escherichia coli LPS. These findings suggest their potential as immunomodulatory agents, like vaccine adjuvants.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Cholane&#8211;Phenanthrene&#8211;Cholane Trimers for Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of phosphodiester&#8208;linked cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers is described. The morphology of the formed nanostructures depends on the phenanthrene isomer used and on the cooling rate during the assembly process leading to nanosheets, worm&#8208;like structures, or nanotubes. Doping with pyrene results in a strong increase in the quantum yield, demonstrating the potential of these assemblies as artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems.

The self&#8208;assembly of two isomeric amphiphilic cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers and the light&#8208;harvesting properties of the formed supramolecular assemblies in aqueous medium are presented. Distinct differences in the supramolecular nanostructures are observed based on the type of phenanthrene isomer used, as well as on the cooling rate applied during the thermal self&#8208;assembly process. A fast cooling rate results in the formation of 2D objects (nanosheets) with both trimers. In contrast, a slow cooling process results in the observation of 3D objects, with worm&#8208;like nanostructures for the self&#8208;assembled 3,6&#8208;disubstituted phenanthrene trimer and nanotubes for the 2,7&#8208;isomer. Upon doping with an acceptor chromophore, the supramolecular phenanthrene assemblies demonstrate efficient energy transfer. The presence of small quantities (6%) of a pyrene acceptor results in a fivefold increase in the quantum yield compared to the phenanthrene trimer alone, highlighting their potential as artificial light&#8208;harvesting complexes. This work underscores the versatility of amphiphilic phenanthrene derivatives as building blocks for light&#8208;harvesting supramolecular systems.

Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase&#8208;1 (IDO1) is a critical immunoregulatory enzyme responsible for the metabolism of tryptophan during inflammation and disease. Based on a 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran framework, examples of indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors containing a diverse set of boron&#8208;based functional groups (closo&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;carborane, boronic acids and esters, and benzoxaboroles) are reported. The novel boron derivatives display low micrometer affinity for the human recombinant enzyme, with IC50 values ranging from 8 to 60&#8201;&#956;M. Superior results are observed for the closo&#8208;carborane compounds which demonstrate a significant improvement in potency over their phenyl analogues, with inhibition of the IDO1 enzyme increasing by up to &#8776;80%.

         <title>Degradation of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Megasynthetases SrfAA and SrfAB by Acyldepsipeptide&#8208;Activated ClpP in Bacillus Subtilis</title>

         <dc:description>
FtsZ is the only target protein that has been biochemically confirmed to be hydrolyzed both in&#8201;vitro and in bacterial cells. Coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP1 proteolytic complex that degrades the surfactin synthetases SrfAA and SrfAB in cell lysates and bacterial cells is demonstrated.

Protein degradation is a tightly controlled biological process and is essential for maintaining bacterial proteostasis. ClpPs are a highly conserved family of serine proteases that interact with ATPases and play key roles in diverse cellular activities, including heat&#8208;shock response, expression of virulence factors, and protein turnover and homeostasis. Owing to their vital roles, drugs targeting ClpP&#8208;ATPases have attracted interest in treating bacterial infections. The mode of action of the antibiotic acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) is uncontrolled proteolysis by an ATPase&#8208;independent ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. The cell division protein FtsZ is the only bacterial protein confirmed to be hydrolyzed by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex in recombinant enzyme systems and cells. Here, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that causes degradation of the secondary metabolite nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) SrfAA and SrfAB in Bacillus subtilis is reported. Using in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro studies coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of NRPSs, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that degrades SrfAA and SrfAB is demonstrated. Furthermore, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex is reconstructed in cell lysates, confirming that SrfAA and SrfAB are sensitive to degradation by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. These findings demonstrate that SrfAA and SrfAB are protein substrates for the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex, providing novel insights into the ClpP degradation machinery.

         <title>Inhibition of Surfactin Biosynthesis in Bacillus Subtilis Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Adenylation Domain Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;based adenylation domain inhibitors with the modification of 2&#8242;&#8208;OH in the adenosine skeleton are synthesized. Coupled with affinity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), their activities toward surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in Bacillus subtilis are evaluated. Finally, the ability of inhibiting the production of surfactin in the bacterial cells is confirmed.

Several natural bacterial virulence factors are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, NRPSs producing such natural products have emerged as attractive antibiotic targets. N&#8208;(aminoacyl)sulfamoyladenosine (aminoacyl&#8208;AMS) derivatives with chemical modifications at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group of the adenosine skeleton are previously reported that inhibit NRPS amino acid adenylation (A) domains in recombinant enzyme systems, cellular lysates, and bacterial cells. The introduction of a couple of functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group preserves the binding affinity toward NRPS amino acid A&#8208;domains and improves cell permeability of the AMS scaffold. However, the effects of these compounds on secondary metabolism have not yet been explored. In this study, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) probe, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne, is validated for in&#8208;cell applications, including imaging of NRPS activities in bacteria. Next, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives incorporating methyl, benzyl, and cyanomethyl functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group are synthesized and their inhibitory activity toward intracellular surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in the surfactin&#8208;producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 are investigated using the AfBPP probe. Finally, the attenuation of surfactin production using a Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne probe and L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives in B. subtilis is demonstrated. These results indicate that chemical modifications at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group provide a way to develop cell&#8208;permeable and functional NRPS A&#8208;domain inhibitors.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Gapmer Oligonucleotides Containing 4&#8242;&#8208;Carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;Carbamoyl&#8208;Thymidine Analogs</title>

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs in the gap region are synthesized and evaluated. Derivatization of the ONs is performed via postsynthetic modification. The synthesized ONs can form a stable duplex with target RNA regardless of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents and elicit RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of the RNA, and the RNA degradation rate is depending on the type of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents.

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) contain a gap region consisting of DNA, whose heteroduplex with RNA can be a substrate for RNase H. Herein, the synthesis and properties of gapmer ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs at the gap region are reported. Synthesis of the ONs was performed by postsynthetic modification of 4&#8242;&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)thymidine through hydrolysis and nucleophilic substitution. Concerning the synthesis of ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;(propylcarbamoyl)thymidine, postsynthetic conversion of 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxythymidine or 4&#8242;&#8208;(phenoxycarbonyl)thymidine on the support is effective. The duplex stabilities of the modified ONs are comparable to those of the unmodified ON. Several types of modified ONs can elicit the RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of target RNA. Furthermore, modified ON containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208;thymidine at the gap region shows improved stability in fetal bovine serum solution. The analogs used in this study can be modified nucleosides for the gap region of gapmer ONs.

         <title>Proline Amide Catalyzes Formation of Toxic Crotonaldehyde from Acetaldehyde Under Physiologically Relevant Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crotonaldehyde&#8208;derived DNA lesions are reported in patients after ethanol exposure, which implies that crotonaldehyde is produced after ethanol ingestion. Here, we show that proline amide, which mimics N&#8208;terminal proline residues on human proteins, can catalyze crotonaldehyde formation from the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde under physiologically relevant conditions. The work therefore provides a chemically plausible mechanism for crotonaldehyde formation in humans.

Crotonaldehyde is a human toxin that reacts with nucleophilic groups on DNA and proteins. Putative crotonaldehyde&#8208;derived adducts on DNA are reported in cells and patients after ethanol exposure, which implies that crotonaldehyde is formed in cells. Here, we show that proline amide, which is a model of N&#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing proteins, catalyzes the aldol condensation of the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde to crotonaldehyde under physiologically relevant conditions. This reaction is more efficient at neutral pH than under acidic or basic conditions, but is inhibited by competing imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one formation. Crotonaldehyde formation is also slower than the analogous aldol condensation of propionaldehyde. Comparative studies additionally suggest that proline amide is a more efficient catalyst than other amino acid amides. Overall, the work evidences a biochemically plausible mechanism for intracellular crotonaldehyde formation and implies that proline amide derivatives can catalyze aldol chemistry in humans.

An expansion of the concept of pseudoglucosinolates (psGSLs) is reported introducing the first azoreductase&#8208;responsive psGSL&#8208;based probe releasing an isothiocyanate under simultaneous fluorescence turn&#8208;on in the presence of AzoR, an azoreductase from Escherichia coli. The synthesis, biochemical evaluation, application for protein labeling and conversion in the presence of Escherichia coli are reported.

Naturally occurring isothiocyanates (ITCs) display multiple interesting bioactivities, but their medicinal exploitation is very limited as ITCs are non&#8208;druglike compounds with problematic pharmacokinetic properties. The concept of pseudoglucosinolates provides a novel prodrug approach for the release of ITCs which can be adjusted to different triggers such as enzymatic and chemical microenvironments. Herein, the first adaptation of this concept toward the release of ITCs in the presence of azoreductases within a turn&#8208;on fluorescence probe is reported and its applicability in covalent protein labeling is underlined.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Multiplexing with Environment&#8208;Sensitive Chemigenetic Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence lifetimes of coumarin&#8208;pyridinium dyes are sensitive to the environment, with lifetimes decreasing as the polarity of the solvent increases. Herein, it is shown that this trend is preserved in the binding pockets of proteins, enabling multiplexed imaging of three targets in live cells with a single fluorophore, and informing the design of chemigenetic tools for fluorescence lifetime imaging.

HaloTag (HT) is a versatile self&#8208;labeling protein that has been widely adopted in fluorescence microscopy. Besides its established use as an intensity&#8208;based marker and sensor, interest in using HT for multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has recently arisen. Herein, the application of an environment&#8208;sensitive fluorophore was explored for FLIM multiplexing with the free dye and HT mutants. The extended coumarin pyridinium scaffold was selected due to its structural simplicity and the strong sensitivity of its photophysical properties to the environment. It was demonstrated that three&#8208;channel imaging is possible by taking advantage of the propensity of the dye to accumulate in mitochondria and vesicles and the efficient labeling of two distinct HT mutants. Further investigation was conducted on different dehalogenase proteins and their FLIM multiplexing capabilities when paired with an HT mutant. Finally, the polarity of the protein binding pocket was identified as a key feature that affects the lifetime of this kind of fluorescent molecule.

         <title>Probing Thrombosis Initiation with Lasso Peptide Variants as Inhibitors to the von Willebrand Protein&#8211;Collagen Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrangling the potential of natural product scaffolds: Lasso peptides, natural products of bacterial origin, have a unique interlocked [1]rotaxane peptide structure. The lasso peptide microcin J25&#160;can tolerate the substitution of several amino acids in the loop region to become tuned inhibitors that target protein&#8211;protein interactions, such as between von Willebrand factor and collagen, that initiate thrombosis.

Currently, there are no peptide&#8208;based therapeutics that safely target thrombosis initiation. Anticlot medications are mostly focused on platelet interactions, leading to side effects and complications. Herein, we utilize the unique [1]rotaxane architecture of&#160;lasso peptides as a scaffold for the development of new inhibitors to the protein&#8211;protein interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWF) and collagen, which is paramount to clot initiation. The microcin J25 lasso peptide tolerates the substitution of four contiguous amino acids within its loop, leading to two variants with LWEQ and FRSH sequences grafted within the loop. Each variant shows low micromolar activity in a fluorescently linked immunosorbent assay, an in vitro test for inhibition of the collagen&#8211;vWF interaction. In addition, the lasso peptides were treated with a panel of proteases and showed exceptional stability. These peptides launch a new class of potential antithrombosis agents and also help probe the connection between peptide structure and its inhibitory, drug&#8208;like characteristics.

Hydrocarbon Stapling Enables Improvement of Antimicrobial Activity and Proteolytic Stability of Host&#8208;Defense Peptide Ocellatin&#8208;3N</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a series of hydrocarbon&#8208;stable analogs of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 are synthesized and evaluated for their chemical and biological properties to improve potential application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 in the field of antimicrobial drug development. The stapled peptide Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;5 shows promising prospects for novel antimicrobial drug development. This study can provide a reference for the development of antimicrobial drugs.

Ocellatin&#8208;3N is a cationic, amphiphilic host&#8208;defense peptide with 19 residues, which is isolated from the Caribbean frog Leptodactylus nesiotus. Its analogue Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 shows potent inhibitory activity against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, and has great potential as a broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial agent. However, the application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 as an antimicrobial agent is limited due to its both unstable structure and susceptibility to degradation by proteases. In this research, a series of hydrocarbon&#8208;stable analogs of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 are synthesized and evaluated for their chemical and biological properties to improve potential application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 in the field of antimicrobial drug development. Some analogs show remarkable improvement not only in protease resistance but also in antimicrobial activity when compared to the parent peptide. In particular, the stapled peptide Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;5 shows promising prospects for novel antimicrobial drug development. This study can provide a reference for the development of antimicrobial drugs.

         <title>Visual Detection and Identification of Influenza A Viruses by Nucleic Acid Probe&#8208;Enabled Lateral Flow Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a nucleic acid probe&#8208;enabled lateral flow assay (NALFA) for visual influenza A virus detection. The assay utilizes padlock probe&#8208;based target recognition, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and enzymatic cleavage to generate short amplicons, enabling gold nanoparticle&#8208;mediated lateral flow readout with attomolar sensitivity and high specificity. NALFA demonstrates 100% accuracy in clinical samples, highlighting its potential for convenient viral diagnosis.

Diagnosis of influenza A viral infection is crucial for preventing disease transmission and providing effective clinical treatments. There is an increasing need for convenient detection methods to enable simple yet precise identification of viral infections. Herein, a nucleic acid probe&#8208;enabled lateral flow assay (NALFA) is developed to realize visual detection and identification of influenza A viral infections (H1N1 and H3N2) of high sensitivity and specificity. Viral RNA targets are recognized by a padlock probe, which is circularized to induce rolling circle amplification (RCA). RCA products are enzymatically cleaved into short amplicons to complex with capture DNA probes for gold colloidal&#8208;induced visual lateral flow assay. NALFA achieved attomolar (aM) sensitivity for both standard viral RNAs, along with high specificity. While applying clinical samples (16 H1N1 patients, 12 healthy controls), NALFA exhibited high detection accuracy to successfully discriminate infected samples from noninfected samples. NALFA represents a potent and convenient nucleic acid detection assay that shall find its applications in fields of viral detection and beyond.

This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy for the construction of bicyclic peptides containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. The bicyclization reaction in this strategy can occur under low concentrations of tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene, which shows little effect on the phage infectivity and will help maintain the diversity of phage displayed cyclic peptides.

This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy to prepare a unique type of bicyclic peptide molecules containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. Different from the conventional bicyclic peptide construction method, this study first utilizes peptide ligases (SrtA or OaAEP1) to introduce an arylthiol group into the parent peptides and then performs bicyclization of the peptides by using TBMB to generate the desired bicyclic peptides. Since the pKa of aryl thiols is lower than that of alkyl thiols, the bicyclization reaction of the peptides in our system can occur under low concentrations of TBMB or low pH conditions. The low concentrations of TBMB have little effect on the phage infectivity, which will help maintain the diversity of phage&#8208;displayed cyclic peptides. This study establishes a biocompatible ligase&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step strategy for the preparation of bicyclic peptides, which has potential applications in the discovery of bioactive cyclic peptide ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Adenosine Triphosphate Derivatives and their use in Enzymatic Synthesis and Postsynthetic Labelling of RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;substituted adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate derivatives is synthesized and tested as substrates for polymerases. In vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, primer extension with engineered DNA polymerases, or 3&#8242;&#8208;labelling with poly(A) polymerase are used for enzymatic synthesis of base&#8208;modified RNA. Further postsynthetic reactions with 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208; or 2&#8208;ethynyladenosine are used to attach fluorescent labels.

A series of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) derivatives bearing chloro, fluoro, amino, methyl, vinyl, and ethynyl groups at position 2 are synthesized and tested as substrates for RNA and DNA polymerases. The modified nucleotides work well in in&#8201;vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase and primer extension (PEX) using engineered DNA polymerases (TGK, 2M) except for the bulkier 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208; and 2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;ATP derivatives that give truncated products. However, in single nucleotide incorporation followed by PEX, they still can be used for site&#8208;specific incorporation of reactive modifications into RNA that can be further used for postsynthetic labeling through thiol&#8208;ene or Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloadditions reactions. All modified ATPs work in polyadenylation catalyzed by poly(A) polymerase to form long 3&#8242;&#8208;polyA tails containing the modifications that also can be used for labeling.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Cyclic Lipodepsipeptide Pleosporacin, a New Selective Inhibitor of the Phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioactivity&#8208;guided isolation led to the discovery of a potent and selective inhibitor of the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea, pleosporacin (1), from mycelia extracts of the fungal strain Pleosporales sp. IBWF 020&#8208;21. The biosynthesis of the nonribosomal cyclic lipodepsipeptide 1 was elucidated via heterologous reconstitution in Aspergillus oryzae.

Bioactivity&#8208;guided isolation led to the identification of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide pleosporacin (1) from the mycelia extract of fungal strain Pleosporales sp. IBWF 020&#8208;21, a potent selective inhibitor of the fungal phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea. The structure and stereochemistry of 1 were elucidated by NMR and Marfey analysis, respectively. Genome mining identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a hexamodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases, PleA, a fatty acyl&#8208;AMP ligase, PleB, and an aspartate decarboxylase, PleC. Reconstitution of pleABC allowed for heterologous production of 1 in Aspergillus oryzae and confirmed the identity of the ple cluster. Based on these&#160;findings a biosynthetic route is proposed, with PleB catalyzing lipoinitiation and PleC providing the nonproteinogenic amino acid &#946;&#8208;alanine for the assembly of 1.

         <title>Mining Thermophile Genomes for New PETases with Exceptional Thermostabilities Using Sequence Similarity Networks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted genome mining identified thermostable enzymes (PETases) that hydrolyze the commonly used plastic polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Thermostable enzymes are identified from thermophilic microbial sources. Experimental results reveal enzymatic activity on authentic PET films, highlighting potential for industrial application. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of one PETase is solved to understand its exceptional thermostability. These findings pave the way for engineering catalysts for a circular PET economy.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a promising technology for advancing a circular PET economy. Several PET&#8208;degrading &#945;/&#946; hydrolases have been identified, but the full potential of this enzyme family to catalyze PET hydrolysis remains largely unexplored. To address this, sequence similarity networks are employed to investigate the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold&#8208;5 subfamily (IPR029059) for new PETases. Priority is given to sequences from thermophiles, as thermostable enzymes are likely more suitable for industrial applications. Ten enzymes with &#8776;20% sequence identity to the well&#8208;known LCC&#8208;PETase are identified, and seven are successfully overexpressed and purified for in vitro characterization. Each enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl butyrate, a mimic of trimeric PET, and emulsified PET nanoparticles. Notably, three enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing PET films. Novel PETases exhibit melting temperatures (Tm) exceeding 55&#8201;&#176;C and only modest losses of activity after incubation at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;h. The crystal structure of AroC (Tm&#8201;=&#8201;85&#8201;&#176;C) is resolved to 2.2&#8201;&#197;, revealing several salt bridges that likely confer thermostability, and a unique loop that is conserved among the PETases described here. These novel enzymes will enable engineering campaigns to generate thermostable and catalytically efficient PETases for use as industrial biocatalysts.

         <title>Selective [9&#8208;15N] Guanosine for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies of Large Ribonucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small chemical shift anisotropy of nitrogen&#8208;15 at the 9&#8208;position in guanine (15N9&#8208;G) leads to long T2 values and narrow NMR lines, particularly &#160; attractive to probe structure and dynamics of large (&gt;200 nucleotide) ribonucleic acids (RNAs). 

RNAs regulate various cellular processes using malleable 3D structures, and understanding the factors that control RNA structure and dynamics is critical for understanding their mechanisms of action. To mitigate factors that have limited studies of large, functionally relevant RNAs by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have extended a recently described 2H&#8208;enhanced, 1H&#8208;15N correlation approach&#160;that used uniformly 15N&#8208;labeled guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by developing a chemoenzymatic labeling technology that grafts selectively labeled [9&#8208;15N]&#8208;Guanine on to any labeled ribose to make [9&#8208;15N]&#8208;GTP. The approach exploits advantageous NMR properties of the N9 nucleus which, when combined with extensive ribose deuteration and optimized NMR pulse sequences, affords sharp signals without complications that can arise using uniform [15N]&#8208;guanine labeling. The utility of the approach for NMR signal assignment and dynamics analysis is demonstrated for three large RNAs (20&#8211;78&#8201;kDa) that play critical roles in viral replication. With this approach, NMR studies of RNAs comprising 200&#8201;nt or more should now be feasible.

To mitigate factors that have limited studies of large, functionally relevant RNAs by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have extended a recently described &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-enhanced, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N correlation approach&#160;that used uniformly 15N-labeled guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by developing a chemoenzymatic labeling technology that grafts selectively labeled [9-&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-Guanine on to any labeled ribose to make [9-&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-GTP. The approach exploits advantageous NMR properties of the N9 nucleus which, when combined with extensive ribose deuteration and optimized NMR pulse sequences, affords sharp signals without complications that can arise using uniform [&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-guanine labeling. The utility of the approach for NMR signal assignment and dynamics analysis is demonstrated for three large RNAs (20&#8211;78&#8201;kDa) that play critical roles in viral replication. With this approach, NMR studies of RNAs comprising 200&#8201;nt or more should now be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Advancement of Prime Editing Technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 12, June 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes current optimization strategies for prime editing (PE), focusing on protein engineering, pegRNA modifications, cellular factor recruitment, and paired pegRNA approaches. The review evaluates their performance across applications, discusses existing limitations, and outlines future directions, providing a comprehensive framework to support the next&#8208;generation development of PE technologies.

The advent of CRISPR/Cas genome editing has spurred major breakthroughs across life sciences, offering vast potential across numerous research and application fields. Among the expanding toolkit of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;derived methods, prime editing (PE) stands out for its versatility and specificity, enabling precise point mutations and small insertions or deletions without requiring double&#8208;stranded DNA breaks. Since its introduction, PE has undergone multiple rounds of optimization to improve performance. In this review, the core components and mechanism of prime editors, followed by four key evolution strategies: protein engineering, pegRNA modifications, accessory protein recruitment, and paired pegRNA approaches are outlined. Further persistent challenges and outline possible refinements are discussed, highlighting how further innovations can expand PE's utility across diverse areas of research, biotechnology, and potential therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Regulation of Gene Expression of Mouse D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) catalyzes oxidative deamination of D&#8208;amino acids, producing 2&#8208;oxo acids, hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. In mammals, DAO is essential for metabolizing both endogenous and exogenous D&#8208;amino acids. Our previous studies on human DAO identified two promoter regions (P1 and P2), a negative regulatory element in intron 1, and several transcription factor binding sites. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of mouse DAO gene expression to compare with the human system. Poly (I:C) or Interleukin&#8208;1&#946;treatment induced DAO expression by 1.8&#8208;2.0 folds in the mouse brain, cerebellum and cerebral cortex. To determine the promoter activity in the upstream region of initiation site, we constructed plasmids containing mouse DAO gene fragments inserted into pGL4 [luc2P/Hygro] vector and assessed luciferase activity in LLC&#8208;PK1 cells. We analyzed a series of deletion constructs, revealing promoter activity in all tested fragments. The highest promoter activity was detected in the &#8208;333/&#8208;87 subregion, with residual activities in the &#8208;87/+111 region. Bioinformatics analysis identified transcription factors, including NEUR, EGRF, ZF07, ZF11, KLFS, SP1F and ZF02, which bind to both the human and mouse DAO genes at conserved positions, suggesting their critical role in regulating DAO promoter activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Amyloid Mimicking Peptide Modulating Side&#8208;Chain Polarity of Aromatic Amino Acid Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triggering higher order assembly, peptides form a number of nano&#8208;scale architectures. Peptide self&#8208;assembly depends on the sequence, folding and noncovalent interactions. Self&#8208;assembly of phenylalanine homopeptides and its derivatives have been studied extensively, but the supramolecular assembly of aromatic peptides in interplay with side chain polarity is yet to be understood. Herein, the H&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;OH, a chemically modified aromatic amino acid, has been shuffled in a highly aromatic peptide, Boc&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH resulting three mutated analogues having different polarity. Microscopic investigation reveal that except Boc&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH, all peptides aggregate into nanofibrils in aqueous solution. The long entangled nanofibrils formed by Boc&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH are able to arrest the solvent molecules leading to &#8216;sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel&#8217; phase transition. The hydrogel is mechanically robust and gel fibrils are amyloidogenic in nature. Conformational analysis reveals the presence of cross&#8208;&#946; arrangement of the gelator in the gel fibrils. The rheological studies explore the thixotropic property of the hydrogel. All peptides are nontoxic to McCoy cells. The studies establish that the supramolecular interactions can be tuned modulating side&#8208;chain polarity of the amino acid residues. Overall, the studies explore a chemically modified aromatic amino acid and its incorporation into the peptide backbone that paves a new paradigm to fabricate peptide based biomaterials for imminent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactivity profiles of progressively ring&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs in the WKYMVm peptide as formylpeptide FPR2 agonists and in keto&#8208;piperazines as anti&#8208;trypanosome agents.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of all&#8208;cis ring fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine were introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G&#8208;protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all&#8208;cis ring cyclohexylalanines of this class were also incorporated into a keto&#8208;piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp3 rich derivatives for assays against the parasite Trypanosoma. brucei. For these cyclohexylalanine analogues bioactivity trends correlated progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all&#8208;cis pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analogue of the W&#8208;peptide was least active perhaps correlating with the well&#8208;known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend was also apparent in the anti&#8208;trypanosomal assays of the keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives, it was less so and some compounds were more active than the previously reported phenylalanine derived analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based Peptidomimetics (Pegtides) of Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic amphipathic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based polymers were&#160;generated with synthetic efficiencies allowing their evaluation as Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) mimetics. Accordingly, statistical copolymers with cationic units consistently functionalised with guanyl groups, but different side&#8208;chain lengths, and hydrophobic units displaying long aliphatic, branched and/or aromatic side chains were produced and tested for their antimicrobial and hemolytic properties. The results obtained indicate that candidates with activities and selectivity commensurate to some AMPs can be obtained and that further development of this novel type of antimicrobial peptidomimetics, pegtides, is warranted for clinical and/or biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell Sensing via a Peptide/Single&#8208;Strand DNA Probe&#8208;Modified Au Screen&#8208;Printed Electrode</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed an electron&#8208;transfer/His&#8208;tag&#8208;peptid single strand(ss)&#8208;DNA probe for the detection of cancer cells. Human myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cells) are commonly used as a model for target cancer cells. An electron&#8208;transfer peptide played the role of a sensing moiety, and a His&#8208;tag moiety was introduced to purify the probe. We used a KK1B10 aptamer conjugated with the peptide sequence as a&#160;ss&#8208;DNA with target cell recognition properties. A probe with cysteine residue at the N&#8208;terminals was then immobilized on an Au screen&#8208;printed electrode (AuSPE). To evaluate the effect of the amino acid sequence in the probe, three types of probe were synthesized. The Acetylated(Ac)&#8208;CYYCYYCH6&#8208;amino Modifier C6 (AmC6)KK1B10 aptamer probe proved to be a superior version. The K562 cells interacted with the probe on the electrode, and the electrode responses of the probe were decreased with increases in the concentrations of the cells. The peak currents were proportional to the concentrations of the cells and ranged from 5 to 200 cells/mL with a detection limit of 2 cells/mL. The recoveriY(99&#8208;102%) of K562 cells in human serum &#160;and bovine blood were calculated using the probe&#8208;modified AuSPE . Consequently, the propsed method could be applied to the detection of target cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptidomimetics Targeting the Amyloidogenicity of Nucleophosmin 1 Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous studies reveal an unexpected tendency for amyloid aggregation in specific regions of the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), a nucleolar chaperone involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, several peptide analogs of NPM1264&#8208;277 (amyloid core) with conservative substitutions are designed and evaluated through biophysical and cellular assays as potential modulators of amyloid aggregation in AML.

Nucleophosmin 1(NPM1) is an abundant human protein endowed with many functions where whose dysregulation leads to various cancers and mutations are relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the wild&#8208;type form, pentameric NPM1 resides mainly in the nucleolus even if it shuttles toward the cytosol exerting its chaperon function; conversely in AML&#8208;mutated versions, it has mainly a cytoplasmic localization, hence the name NPMc+. All types of AML mutations determine an important amyloid aggregation propensity of the C&#8208;terminal domains (CTD) of NPMc+&#8201;and to exploit this amyloidogenicity for therapeutical purposes; herein, this study presents the design and structural and functional investigations of a series of peptides analogs of the sequence of the second helix of the three&#8208;helix bundle of the wt CTD as potential enhancers of amyloid aggregation. Peptides are designed by introducing conservative mutations in the native 264&#8722;277 fragment, and their structural features and amyloid propensities are assessed through ThT fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopies and scanning electron microscopy. Several &#8220;accelerator sequences&#8221; are employed in amyloid seeding assays (ASAs): The sequence NPM1264&#8208;277 K267R, with the single mutation Lys267/Arg, exhibits the greater ability to act as a promoter of the amyloid aggregation of NPM1264&#8208;277, limiting its toxicity and rescuing cell viability in OCI&#8208;AML3 cells.

         <title>Assembly of Branched Chain Amino Acids to Toxic Fibrils may be Related to Pathogenesis of Maple Syrup Urine Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of branched chain amino acids Ile, Leu, and Val is investigated and the findings indicate that their aggregation may follow an amyloidogenic pathway.

Inborn errors of metabolisms (IEMs) are group of diseases caused by mutations in single genes, leading to buildup of metabolites, toxic or disrupt normal cellular function. The etiological relation of metabolic disorders has been uncovered through study of metabolite amyloids. Various metabolites that accumulate in IEMs have been reported to self&#8208;assemble into organized structures. These structures exhibit similar physicochemical properties as proteinaceous amyloid fibrils. Our study illustrates the aggregation properties of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), isoleucine, leucine, and valine that accumulate in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) to investigate their propensities to assemble into amyloid&#8208;like fibrils. The structural morphologies of BCAAs are studied via microscopic techniques. Further, characterization techniques are employed to understand the physicochemical properties of the self&#8208;assemblies and their underlying mechanism. The amyloid&#8208;like nature of these aggregates is confirmed using thioflavin T and congo red assays. The (3&#8208;(4,5&#8208;Dimethylthiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay reveals BCAAs are cytotoxic and significantly decrease cell viability. This study plays a key role in understanding the physicochemical properties of MSUD in the context of amyloid diseases, possibly paving the way for the development of its therapeutic solutions in the future.

         <title>Comparative Function Analysis of Self&#8208;Amplifying mRNA and Self&#8208;Amplifying DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;amplifying mRNA can relieve the limitation of the mRNA degradability due to its self&#8208;replication property. However, it lacks sufficient valid information on the comparative analysis of self&#8208;amplifying DNA and mRNA. Various vectors and delivery methods are explored with different cell types. It provides valuable information and offers an option of selecting appropriate nucleic acid vectors for drug development.

A promising approach to address the transient translation mRNA drugs is the development of self&#8208;amplifying mRNA (SAM). Similarly, SAM's DNA template, self&#8208;amplifying DNA (SAD), can also play a role in self&#8208;amplifying the target mRNA. However, there is still a lack of sufficient valid information on the comparative analysis of SAM and SAD. Therefore, various vectors and delivery systems are selected to compare and analyze the transfection efficiency of SAM and SAD, and transfection conditions for SAM are optimized. It is found that SAD and SAM have obviously different preferences in transfection conditions, and there is also a gap in their transfection efficiencies under the same conditions. Furthermore, the optimal transfection dose of SAD and SAM and the optimal incubation time after transfection are also determined. This study provides valuable information on SAM transfection and its difference with SAD, and offers an option of selecting appropriate nucleic acid vectors for drug development.

         <title>Recent Advances in Structure, Biofunction, Detection, and Disease Therapeutic Targeting of Cytochrome P450</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450 (CYPs) are a type of heme monooxygenase mainly found in the liver and intestines, responsible for the catalysis of the oxidative metabolism of several endogenous and exogenous substances, playing a crucial role in the clinical drugs metabolism. Therefore, the development of highly sensitive and selective probes for rapid detection of CYP activity in complex living systems. This will contribute to the identification of disease targets and advance human health.

The heme monooxygenase cytochrome P450 (CYPs), which play a major role in human drug metabolism, is predominantly found in the liver and intestines. CYPs are essential for the metabolism of therapeutic drugs and the treatment of diseases. It catalyzes the oxidative metabolism of several endogenous and exogenous chemicals. The expression and biological functions of CYP are affected by environmental factors, genetic variations, and physiological conditions, which can lead to adverse effects and reduce the therapeutic efficacy of drugs in humans. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in the development of probes that can detect the activity of CYPs in complex living systems. This review explores the recent advancements in our understanding of the structure and function of CYPs. It highlights the need to develop specific probes for various CYP subtypes using nonoptical, fluorescent, and bioluminescent substrates.

         <title>Structural Basis of Regioselective Bromination of Tricyclic Tryptoline by the Tryptophan Halogenase Thal</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that the flavin&#8208;dependent tryptophan halogenase Thal also regioselectively halogenates the tricyclic non&#8208;native substrate tryptoline, a &#946;&#8208;carboline with various pharmacological activities. Interestingly, Thal brominates a different position of the shared pharmacophore indole in tryptoline than it does in tryptophan. A crystal structure of Thal in complex with tryptoline explains this different regioselectivity.

Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) carry out substrate&#8208;specific and regioselective halogenation reactions in the biosynthesis of various halogenated natural compounds. Several FDHs convert non&#8208;native substrates in&#8201;vitro. However, obtaining experimental structures of FDHs with non&#8208;native substrates remains challenging, and docking often produces ambiguous results. Hence, there is a lack of data on how non&#8208;native substrates bind to FDHs. Here, we show that the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal efficiently brominates the tricyclic indole derivative tryptoline (1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline) with high regioselectivity. The two point mutations G113S and G469S improve regioselectivity even further. A crystal structure reveals how tryptoline binds to the active site of Thal. The halogenated carbons are located close to the catalytic lysine, and the NH of tryptoline's tetrahydropyridine is positioned like the amino group of the native substrate tryptophan. The substrate binding loop of Thal is closed, again resembling the binding of tryptophan. Our work extends the range of non&#8208;native substrates accepted by Thal, confirming the versatility of this FDH. Moreover, it is a rare example of an FDH structure in complex with a non&#8208;native substrate.

         <title>Galactose&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles Targeting Membrane Transporters for the Glutathione Delivery to Brain Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glutathione&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles are shown to reduce radicals in SH&#8208;SY5Y and C6 cells. Conjugation of galactose to the outer shell improves internalization through the GLUT transporter, thus providing a smart multivalent system able to reduce oxidative stress in neuroblastoma and rat glioma cells.

Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide essential for maintaining redox balance in the human body, plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. A deficiency in GSH is linked to increased oxidative damage and the progression of various disorders, including cancer and neurological diseases. Herein, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) coated with GSH and further functionalized with galactose moieties are developed to selectively target glucose transporters (GLUT), which is overexpressed on the surface of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and could be exploited for the selective recognition and internalization of the Au@GSH&#8208;Gal NPs, that could then exert an antioxidant effect. As a proof of concept, brain cancer cells are treated with Au@GSH&#8208;Gal NPs, evidencing their increased internalization and a significant reduction of H2O2&#8208;induced oxidative stress.

         <title>Engineering Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Oxidase for Regeneration of Oxidized Non&#8208;natural Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD+) is a non&#8208;natural cofactor used for bio&#8208;orthogonal redox biochemistry. In order to regenerate NCD+ for driving oxidative reactions, this study engineers an H2O&#8208;forming NADH oxidase from Enterococcus faecalis to favor NCDH. This best mutant NADH oxidase (NOX)&#8208;KRGT mutant exhibits 107&#8208;fold higher selectivity for NCDH than EfNOX and can oxidize NCDH to form NCD+ in&#8201;vivo. The traceless and effective tool for regenerating NCD+ shall expand our capacity in developing NCD&#8208;linked redox subsystems.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form NADH are universal redox cofactors, and thus manipulating NAD(H) supply often leads to unpredictable outcome because of metabolic crosstalk. To overcome intrinsic limitations associated to natural cofactors, this study previously introduces nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD+) as a non&#8208;natural cofactor for redox biochemistry. While several enzymes have been devised to generate NCDH as driving force at the expense of cheap chemicals for reductive metabolic reactions, it remains inaccessible to generate NCD+ for oxidative reactions. In this study, it engineers an H2O&#8208;forming NADH oxidase (EfNOX) from Enterococcus faecalis to favor NCDH. Compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the best mutant NADH oxidase (NOX)&#8208;KRGT oxidizes NCDH with 14&#8208; and 107&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency and selectivity, respectively. Docking analysis shows that those mutations acquired a narrower cofactor binding cavity and positively charged environment contributing to the preference toward NCDH. Coupling NOX mutants with NCD&#8208;favoring phosphite dehydrogenase mutant enables Escherichia coli BW14329 to utilize phosphite as sole phosphorus source for growth. This work provides a traceless and effective tool to convert NCDH into NCD+, which should greatly expand our capacity in developing NCD&#8208;linked redox subsystems and further facilitate the implementation of non&#8208;natural cofactors in chemical biology and synthetic biology.

         <title>Reductant&#8208; or Light&#8208;Driven ATP&#8208;Independent Reduction of CO2 by Nitrogenase MoFe Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenase is a versatile metalloenzyme that activates and reduces small molecules like N2, CO and CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals at ambient conditions. Previously, we showed that the Monitrogenase could reduce CO2 to CO, but not to hydrocarbons, in an ATP&#8208;dependent reaction. Here we report the ability of the catalytic component of Monitrogenase (MoFe protein) to enable ATP&#8208;independent reduction of CO2 to up to C4 and C2 hydrocarbons, respectively, in room&#8208;temperature reactions driven by a chemical reductant (EuII&#8208;DTPA) or visible light (via CZS quantum dots). Moreover, we observe an opposite deuterium isotope effect on the EuII&#8208;DTPA driven reactions of CO2 reduction by MoFe protein and its Vcounterpart (VFe protein) in that the former displays higher activities in H2O, and the latter displays higher activities in D2O. These results provide an important foundation for further mechanistic exploration of the nitrogenase&#8208;enabled, atypical Fischer&#8208;Tropsch&#8208;type reaction that uses CO2 instead of CO as a substrate; moreover, they could serve as a potential template for the future development of nitrogenase&#8208;based applications that effectively recycle the greenhouse gas CO2 into valuable fuel products.</dc:description>

         <title>A self&#8208;sufficient&#160;&#946;&#8208;Methylarginine Biosynthetic Pathway in Planctomyces</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Methylamino acids (&#946;&#8208;MAAs) enhance the bioactivity of natural products and possess intrinsic pharmacological properties as free amino acids. While the biosynthetic capacity for this class of non&#8208;canonical amino acids has been established in certain bacterial lineages such as Gammaproteobacteria and Actinomycetes, other bacterial phyla remain largely unexplored. Here we report the genome&#8208;mining guided discovery of a novel biosynthetic gene cluster capable of producing &#946;&#8208;methylarginine, from the phylum Planctomycetes. We provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence that Planctomycetes employ a transaminase (PlaA) and a methyltransferase (PlaB) to synthesize this &#946;&#8208;MAA. Unlike previously described &#946;&#8208;methylarginine biosynthetic pathways, PlaA and PlaB function as a self&#8208;sufficient enzyme cascade that operates without the need for additional keto acid and amino acid partners.

While the biosynthetic capacity for this class of non-canonical amino acids has been established in certain bacterial lineages such as Gammaproteobacteria and Actinomycetes, other bacterial phyla remain largely unexplored. Here we report the genome-mining guided discovery of a novel biosynthetic gene cluster capable of producing &#946;-methylarginine, from the phylum Planctomycetes. We provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence that Planctomycetes employ a transaminase (PlaA) and a methyltransferase (PlaB) to synthesize this &#946;-MAA. Unlike previously described &#946;-methylarginine biosynthetic pathways, PlaA and PlaB function as a self-sufficient enzyme cascade that operates without the need for additional keto acid and amino acid partners. These findings expand the catalytic repertoire for &#946;-MAAs biosynthesis and establish Planctomycetes as a new source of secondary metabolites discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional characterization of a Diazo&#8208;forming enzyme in meroterpenoid biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Meroterpenoids are known for their distinct structure and hybrid biosynthetic origin. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of several well&#8208;characterized meroterpenoids contain three genes whose functions have remained elusive. Recent studies on nonmeroterpenoid pathways suggest that these genes may be involved in nitrite&#8208;dependent N&#8211;N bond formation. In this study, we show that one of these genes, fur5, is essential for the biosynthesis of the representative meroterpenoid furaquinocin M. By leveraging a CellFree Protein Synthesis (CFPS) platform, we found that Fur5 catalyzes the transformation of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;flaviolin (8&#8208;AF) into diazo&#8208;flaviolin, which subsequently undergoes non&#8208;enzymatic deamination to yield the downstream intermediate flaviolin. Our findings suggest that Fur5, together with the nitrite&#8208;generating enzymes Fur15 and Fur16, facilitates the deamination of 8&#8208;AF via diazotization in furaquinocin biosynthesis. We further identified the nitrite&#8208;binding pocket within Fur5 and proposed a catalytic mechanism in which nitrite is activated through adenylation. The findings unveil a diazo&#8208;forming enzyme that facilitates deamination in meroterpenoid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Robotic&#8208;assisted capture&#8208;SELEX of RNA aptamers binding to small molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their small size, stability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness compared to antibodies, aptamers developed by Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) are promising candidates for the detection of small molecules. In SELEX, a small target molecule is usually covalently immobilised on a surface to separate bound from unbound nucleic acid sequences. However, this immobilisation alters the molecule, i.e. additional chemical entities are added and the electron distribution is altered, compromising the enrichment properties. To overcome this problem, a capture SELEX method has been successfully developed in which the RNA or DNA libraries are bound to a surface via a complementary oligodeoxynucleotides and the soluble ligand is used to capture nucleic acids that bind to it from that surface. Here, we describe the development of an automated version of the capture SELEX method for the identification of RNA aptamers that bind small molecules. This method is fully automated and performs up to 12 iterative selection cycles without manual interference in 72 hours. The approach is therefore suitable as rapid route to aptamers and enables resource&#8208;efficient test selections to assess &#8216;aptamerogenicity&#8217; of a target.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Clozapine on N&#8208;Methyl&#8208;D&#8208;Aspartate Glutamate Receptor&#8208;Related Amino Acids in the Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

The results represent the means with standard error of the mean of the data obtained from 4 to 12 rats. The number of animals is shown in parentheses.

Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug used for schizophrenia with treatment&#8208;refractory symptoms to other antipsychotics. Since a body of evidence indicates the involvement of the dysfunction of the N&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) in the pathophysiology of antipsychotic&#8208;resistant and responsive symptoms of schizophrenia, we have evaluated the exact mechanisms underlying the superior clinical efficacy of clozapine by studying its effects on the extracellular signaling of NMDAR&#8208;related amino acids in the rat medial prefrontal cortex of freely moving rats using an in vivo dialysis technique. Intra&#8208;peritoneal injection of clozapine (5, 10 and 20&#8201;mg/kg) failed to affect the prefrontal extracellular levels of D&#8208;serine, a coagonist for the NMDAR acting at the glycine site, and its precursor, L&#8208;serine, from 20 to 160&#8208;min post&#8208;injection The cortical extracellular concentrations of glycine, another NMDAR coagonist, and L&#8208;arginine, a nitric oxide/NMDAR pathway&#8208;associated factor, were significantly reduced by 10&#8201;mg/kg of clozapine. Clozapine administration (20&#8201;mg/kg) elevated the prefrontal extracellular levels of L&#8208;glutamate (P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.027 by pairwise comparison with saline&#8208;injected controls), which was not statistically significant after multiple comparisons. The present findings support the view that clozapine could influence the NMDAR function, at least in part, through modulation of the prefrontal extracellular concentrations of glycine, L&#8208;arginine and/or L&#8208;glutamate.

         <title>Amino Acid&#8211;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Structures: From Pathological Implications to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present review aims to summarize the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research on amino acid&#8211;based self&#8208;assembly, highlighting its diverse nature&#8212;from its role in certain pathological conditions to its emerging advanced biomedical applications. Self&#8208;assembled amino acids can become advanced next&#8208;generation materials with broad applications in materials chemistry and biological sciences, making them a material of choice for many futuristic technological advances.

Self&#8208;assembly is defined as a spontaneous ordering of molecules into distinct supramolecular structures similar to the naturally occurring biomolecules such as DNA, lipids, and proteins. Interestingly, this strategy has gained huge importance in recent decades, leading to substantial advancements in the biomedical field, including drug delivery, biosensing, tissue engineering, etc. The unique role of &#8220;FF&#8221; moiety in promoting self&#8208;aggregation in larger proteins is well established owing to its frequent occurrence in amyloids. This finding comes as a breakthrough in peptide nanotechnology research leading to the exploration of various peptide&#8208;based supramolecular structures demonstrating exceptional functional roles with futuristic applications. In this regard, since amino acids are the building blocks of peptides, the detailed investigation and discussion regarding their self&#8208;assembly behavior are expected to provide important insights into designing advanced functional materials from amino acids and peptides. This review provides a systematic overview of various latest findings on amino acid&#8211;based self&#8208;assembly and its pathological as well as functional role. The review also highlights the importance of emerging applications from self&#8208;assembled amino acid&#8211;based nanomaterials in the field of material science and biomedicine.

         <title>Methods for Controlling Small GTPase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept highlights recent and emerging methods for controlling small GTPase activity, encompassing both small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based approaches and protein engineering strategies. The use of these approaches to advance the understanding of small GTPase function, current limitations, and future outlook is discussed.

Small GTPases comprise a diverse class of signaling proteins in mammalian cells and regulate a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, cell movement, vesicle formation, and nuclear transport. Due to their involvement in critical cellular pathways, changes in the activation state of small GTPases due to genetic mutations or alterations in gene expression can lead to human diseases. As such, the ability to control the activity of small GTPases is paramount in understanding the precise role these proteins play in human biology and in reducing their impacts on related diseases. Herein, important advances made in the development of small&#8208;molecule&#8208; and protein engineering&#8208;based strategies to control the activity of small GTPases are presented. Current approaches within each area are discussed within their historical contexts along with commentary on the importance that each technology has had on improving the ability to regulate small GTPase activity. Given this ever&#8208;evolving toolbox for controlling small GTPase signaling, continued growth in the study of this protein class is anticipated.

         <title>Spatiotemporal analysis of proteins in single live cells: methods and applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatiotemporal detection of proteins within living cells presents a persistent challenge. This complexity arises from the dynamic nature of cellular environments, where proteins interact in a highly regulated manner. Some innovative methodologies collectively represent significant strides toward overcoming the challenges associated with spatiotemporal protein detection in living cells. They are crucial for elucidating cellular biology and advancing theranostic technologies. Nonetheless, the spatial and temporal organization of organelles within living cells remains inadequately characterized. Currently, there is a lack of review articles that comprehensively survey the progress made in recent years. This review aims to fill this gap by providing an extensive overview of recent advancements in protein analysis within individual living cells, along with their significant applications. In this review, we survey the recent technical advances in protein spatio&#8208;temporal analysis in single live cells and briefly discuss the prospects and challenges of this direction.</dc:description>

         <title>Activity&#8208;enhancing mutations in an LmrR&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme destabilize the protein scaffold and alter its conformational plasticity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes (ArM) hold great potential for the sustainable catalysis of complex new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions. To efficiently improve the catalytic efficacy of ArMs a rational approach is desirable, requiring detailed molecular insight into their conformational landscape. Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) is a multi&#8208;purpose ArM scaffold protein that when bound to the Cu(II)&#8208;phenanthroline cofactor catalyzes the Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation (FCA) of indoles. Previously, the M8D and A92E mutations were found to increase the efficiency of this reaction, but a molecular explanation has been lacking. We here determined the impact of these two activating mutations on the conformational landscape of LmrR in its apo, cofactor&#8208; and substrate&#8208;bound state. We found that the mutations cause a marked destabilization of the dimerization interface, resulting in a more opened central hydrophobic cavity and a dynamic equilibrium between dimer and monomer LmrR. While mutant and wild&#8208;type have similar pocket conformation in the cofactor&#8208;bound state, the mutant shows a distinct interaction with the substrate. Our results suggest that increased retention of the catalytic cofactor and widened plasticity improve activity of the mutant. Ultimately, these results help elucidating the intricate relationships between conformational dynamics of the protein scaffold, cofactor and substrates that define catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic route towards a de novo enantioselective total synthesis of (S)&#8208;baclofen based on metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and enzymatic transamination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the chemoenzymatic synthesis of (S)&#8208;baclofen, which involves a sequential combination of transition metal&#8208;catalysis and biocatalysis. The synthesis approach starts from a readily accessible cinnamic acid ester that is converted using a rhodium&#8208;based hydroformylation catalyst towards the corresponding chiral aldehyde. This compound is subsequently converted via a transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reaction system that yields the desired &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid ester and the final free &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid (S)&#8208;baclofen, after a simple hydrolysis reaction. This synthesis concept does provide high atom efficiency and does not require an additional chiral resolution step of a racemic product.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Bioactive Screening of Peptide Inhibitors Targeting Host&#8208;Pathogen Interactions in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV) poses a significant threat to public health, with limited therapeutic options available. This study focuses on the rational design and screening of peptide inhibitors targeting host&#8208;pathogen interactions, specifically between the viral Gn glycoprotein and key host cell receptors, DC&#8208;SIGN and NMMHC&#8208;IIA. By employing molecular dynamics simulations, alanine scanning, and peptide docking techniques, peptides were designed to disrupt these protein&#8208;protein interactions. Among the synthesized candidates, peptides II&#8208;1 and II&#8208;4 demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against SFTSV infection, with reduced TCID50 values in cellular assays and displayed exceptional affinity (KD = 7.381 &#215; 10&#8208;8 M, 1.439 &#215; 10&#8208;8 M), These peptides also exhibited low cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, highlighting their safety profile. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed strong binding affinities for these peptides, underpinned by stable hydrogen bonding interactions. This research provides a promising platform for developing peptide&#8208;based therapeutics targeting SFTSV, paving the way for further preclinical evaluation and clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanobody&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Controllable Systems for Investigating Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, nanobody&#8208;based photocontrollable platforms&#8212;including photobodies, OptoNBs, photoactivatable nanobody conjugate inducers of dimerizations , and others&#8212;have been developed to achieve light&#8208;mediated control of cellular functions with improved spatiotemporal precision.

Nanobodies, the camelid&#8208;derived single&#8208;chain variable domain of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies, are compact in size and exhibit high binding affinity and specificity to their binding partners. As innovative antibody modalities, nanobodies have garnered significant attention in medicine and biological research. To achieve higher spatiotemporal precision, nanobody&#8208;based light&#8208;controlled systems&#8212;such as photobody, optobody, photoactivatable nanobody conjugate inducers of dimerization, and others&#8212;have been developed. These systems enable optical control of biological processes while leveraging the advantages of nanobodies as a binding moiety. This concept, summarizes nanobody&#8208;based photoregulated systems for investigating biology through light, highlights their advantages and potential limitations, and discusses future directions in this emerging research area.

         <title>A Polyproline Type II Peptidomimetic Disrupts a Grb2 SH3C Domain Protein&#8211;Protein Interaction Implicated in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoylurea scaffolds accurately mimic the side&#8208;chain vectors of the i, i&#8201;+&#8201;1/2, and i&#8201;+&#8201;3 positions of polyproline type II helices, showing functional activity in the disruption of a protein&#8211;protein interaction implicated in breast cancer.

Given the essential role of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) in cellular signaling pathways, their selective modulation is of great therapeutic interest. Mimicry of secondary structural protein elements has emerged as a promising strategy, with various scaffolds reproducing recognition surfaces of &#945;&#8211;helical and &#946;&#8211;strand/sheet proteins. A critical PPI, controlling cell growth and proliferation in breast and other cancers, occurs between growth factor receptor&#8208;bound protein 2 (Grb2) and a polyproline II (PPII) helix embedded in Gab2. Herein, the first example of a general approach for nonpeptidic mimicry of extended PPII helices is presented and it is demonstrated that the scaffold may be functionalized to recapitulate the binding characteristics of crucial hydrophobic and cationic Gab2 hot&#8208;spot side&#8208;chains. The rationally designed peptidomimetic binds Grb2 at the same position as Gab2 (protein&#8208;observed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) with affinities comparable to the native peptide sequence (surface plasmon resonance (SPR)). With the addition of a new PPII minimalist scaffold, these studies further validate the use of diverse secondary structure peptidomimetics in disrupting therapeutically relevant PPIs.

         <title>Synthesis of Chemically Diverse siRNA&#8208;Lipid Conjugates Enabled by Reversible Adsorption to Solid Support (RASS)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;interfering RNA&#8211;lipid (siRNA&#8208;lipid) conjugates have vast clinical potential. Herein, the reversible adsorption to solid support method for postsynthetic is applied, multistep modifications of unprotected siRNAs in organic solvents and in the presence of high mM concentrations of hydrophobic reagents. The resulting siRNA&#8211;lipid conjugates encapsulate a larger chemical space than is accessible via in&#8208;solution, aqueous bioconjugation.

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directly regulate gene expression and are, thus, attractive targets for clinical development to treat a variety of human diseases. While &#8220;naked&#8221; siRNAs are poor drug candidates, numerous chemical modifications of siRNAs have been developed to lower nuclease&#8208;sensitivity, increase cellular uptake, and enable cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific targeting. One class of modifications that has received attention is postsynthetic lipidation, as the pharmacokinetics of siRNA&#8211;lipid conjugates have been found to vary significantly based on the structure of the lipid moiety. While postsynthetic lipidation is a facile and effective means to render siRNAs more drug&#8208;like, most of these modifications occur in a single&#8208;step and in aqueous solution, engendering a limited chemical space. Herein, reversible adsorption of oligos onto a cationic solid support is demonstrated to facilitate postsynthetic, multistep modifications of single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded siRNA in neat organic solvent to obtain siRNA&#8211;lipid conjugates with lipid moieties (e.g., long&#8208;chain alkyl thioethers, polyfluorinated biphenyl groups) that are challenging to incorporate using established postsynthetic lipidation procedures. RASS represents a rapid and convenient approach to generate siRNA&#8211;lipid conjugates encompassing a broad chemical space and ultimately a promising avenue to accelerate the discovery of potent siRNA therapeutics.

         <title>Clade III Synthases Add Cyclic and Linear Terpenoids to the Psilocybe Metabolome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Psilocybe cubensis terpene synthases, CubB&#8208;CubE, were investigated. Product formation assays identified CubB as a (3R,6E)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;nerolidol or linalool synthase, whereas CubC is a multiproduct synthase catalyzing the formation of &#946;&#8208;caryophyllene and other linear and cyclic sesquiterpenes/&#8208;terpenoids. CubD and CubE catalyze predominantly sterpurene formation. The results help to explore the true natural product diversity of this iconic mushroom genus.

Psilocybe &#8220;magic mushrooms&#8221; are best known for their indolethylamine psilocybin, yet they encode enzymes for a much more diverse arsenal of small and potentially bioactive molecules. Herein, four Psilocybe cubensis clade III sesquiterpene synthases, CubB&#8208;CubE, whose genes are differently expressed in fruiting bodies compared to vegetative mycelium are reported. CubB&#8208;CubE were functionally characterized in vitro by product formation assays with heterologously produced enzymes and in vivo by transgene expression in Aspergillus niger, followed by extensive gas chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry analyzes. CubB was identified as a single product (3R,6E)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;nerolidol synthase. CubC is a multiproduct enzyme producing &#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, &#946;&#8208;elemene, &#945;&#8208;humulene, and &#946;&#8208;farnesene. CubD and CubE catalyze (near&#8208;)exclusively sterpurene formation. P. cubensis young fruiting bodies and vegetative mycelium were analyzed for sesquiterpenes, which verified the presence of the CubB product &#945;&#8208;(3R,6E)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;nerolidol. As various Psilocybe species encode highly similar enzymes, this study contributes generally to the as&#8208;yet little&#8208;understood secondary metabolome of the genus.

         <title>Harnessing Organometallic Au(III) Complexes as Precision Scaffolds for Next&#8208;Generation Therapeutic and Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclometalated gold(III) complexes offer a versatile platform for selective biological interactions, including cysteine arylation, redox modulation, and enzyme inhibition. This review explores their roles in anticancer, antimicrobial, and protein modification strategies, highlighting their ability to disrupt metabolic pathways, modulate aquaporins, and serve as precision tools for next&#8208;generation therapeutics and imaging applications.

Au(III) organometallic complexes, particularly cyclometalated Au(III) compounds, have emerged as powerful tools in catalysis and bioinorganic chemistry, offering unique reactivity distinct from their Au(I) counterparts. Among their most interesting transformations, C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have become a selective strategy for cysteine arylation, enabling site&#8208;specific modifications of peptides and proteins. This review provides a comprehensive overview of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes in C&#8211;S bond formation, detailing the mechanistic insights, ligand effects, and electronic factors that dictate their reactivity. The role of ancillary ligands in tuning stability and selectivity is critically assessed, alongside advancements in structural modifications that enhance catalytic efficiency. Beyond fundamental C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling, the broader applications of these Au(III) complexes are explored, including enzyme inhibition, metabolic disruption, and transmembrane protein modulation, with implications in anticancer therapy, antimicrobial strategies, and in&#8201;vivo catalytic transformations. By bridging fundamental organometallic reactivity with innovative biomedical applications, this review highlights the potential of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes as next&#8208;generation catalysts for both synthetic and therapeutic innovations.

Changes in the Aqueous Solvent do not Impact the Internal Ring&#8208;Flip Dynamic of Fully Buried F52 in Protein GB1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring&#8208;flip dynamic in the interior of a protein is independent from changes in the solvent and only depends on the protein itself.

Aromatic ring flips are a hallmark of protein dynamics. They are mediated by either transient &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions in which the protein expands into the solvent or by transient internal rearrangement of void spaces. Therefore, they are excellent reporters of such transient protein fluctuations. To decipher the extent to which ring&#8208;flip dynamics are governed by the protein itself or by the aqueous solvent around it, the ring flip of the fully buried aromatic side chain of F52 in protein B1 domain of immunoglobulin G binding protein G(GB1) with experimentally feasible altered buffer conditions by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion experiments is studied. Herein, it is found that ring&#8208;flip rate constants remain the same in all studied cases. Therefore, the ring&#8208;flip dynamic in the interior of GB1 is independent from the solvent and only depends on the protein itself. In addition, this study shows that ring flips are comparable within different buffer conditions.

         <title>Engineering Glucagon via Molecular and Formulation Strategies: From Natural Hormone to Effective and Stable Therapeutics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucagon, a 29&#8208;amino acid pancreatic hormone, plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). While clinically essential for hypoglycemia rescue, its broader therapeutic applications face limitations due to challenging biophysical properties including poor solubility, strong aggregation tendency, and chemical instability, which currently require lyophilized formulations. Recent advances in peptide engineering and formulation science have enabled the development of next&#8208;generation glucagon analogs with enhanced stability and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use profiles. Moving beyond its classical role in glucose elevation, glucagon is now recognized as a multifunctional metabolic regulator influencing lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and cardiorenal function. This expanded understanding has driven the development of innovative GCGR&#8208;targeting therapies including multi&#8208;receptor agonists such as glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R)/GCGR co&#8208;agonists for metabolic disorders and advanced dual&#8208;hormone delivery systems. This review examines the evolving pharmacology of glucagon by analyzing: (1) structural optimization and formulation strategies to address physicochemical challenges, (2) innovative delivery technologies, and (3) emerging therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases. Through critical assessment of translational challenges, this work bridges molecular insights with clinical innovation in glucagon&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Stability and Substrate Profile of Transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi with Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the successful identification of ancestral sequences N50 and N49, which have a longer half&#8208;life of approximately four and two times the wild&#8208;type Sp&#8208;amine transaminase, respectively.. This approach effectively enhances the thermal stability of the transaminase.

Amine transaminases (ATAs), belonging to the class III transaminases within the superfamily of pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyze transamination reactions between amino donors and amino acceptors. These enzymes are particularly appealing for their role in stereospecific synthesis of chiral amines. However, the stability of most ATAs is not satisfying, limiting their suitability for industrial applications. Among them, the amine transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi (Sp&#8208;ATA) has drawn attention due to its high activity and broad substrate scope under mild conditions and high pH. Nevertheless, maintaining the activity at higher temperatures is a challenge. Previous studies to enhance enzyme function through directed evolution have shown promising results, yet predicting the cooperative effects of individual stabilizing mutations remains challenging. An alternative strategy is ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), which is based on gene sequences to create a more or less artificial phylogenetic tree. This study aims to leverage ASR techniques to explore the thermostability, solvent tolerance, and substrate profile of Sp&#8208;ATA, to find more stable transaminases. By using Sp&#8208;ATA as a template and incorporating insights from ancestral sequences, this strategy offers a promising approach for developing robust biocatalysts suitable for industrial applications.

         <title>PCFT&#8208;Independent Cellular Uptake of Cyclic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Folic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;conjugated folic acid mediates efficient internalization of folic acid that is independent of the presence of proton&#8208;coupled folate transporter (PCFT) on the intestinal cells. CPP&#8208;conjugated folic acid demonstrates superior cellular uptake at all studied pH and in the presence of PCFT inhibitors and shows enhanced bioavailability compared to free folic acid.

Folic acid is an essential component of many metabolic processes, including the synthesis of nucleoproteins, purines, and pyrimidines, and is a recommended supplement to lower the incidence of various disorders. Folic acid and folate&#8208;loaded nanoparticles are extensively evaluated for sustained release and enhanced stability of the molecule; however, malfunctioning of proton&#8208;coupled folate transporters (PCFTs) present on the intestinal cells and subsequent folate deficiency remain a major issue in this context. This study provides the first demonstration where cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;conjugated folic acid mediates PCFT&#8208;independent folic acid permeabilization and intracellular bioavailability in&#8201;vitro in the intestinal cells and macrophages. Cyclic&#8208;transactivating transcriptional activator (cTAT) folic acid conjugates are prepared by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and are evaluated for the cellular uptake and bioavailability in the presence and absence of PCFT inhibitors. Compared with free folic acid that showed PCFT&#8208;mediated cellular uptake, cTAT&#8208;folic acid conjugates exhibited enhanced cellular uptake at all studied pH and improved intracellular bioavailability of the cargo, as was determined by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) assay. Folic acid and cTAT&#8208;folic acid conjugates also dampened the production of proinflammatory mediators in the presence of toxins in&#8201;vitro in macrophage cell lines.

         <title>Diversity of ThDP&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Forming Chiral Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral tertiary alcohols are widespread in nature and bioactive compounds; however, their asymmetric synthesis faces several challenges. This review outlines the toolbox of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes able to produce tertiary alcohols through the formation of C&#63743;C bond formation using ketones as acceptor substrates. Herein, the substrate scope, the diversity of physiological functions, and future perspectives are emphasized.

Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes are well known biocatalysts for C&#63743;C bond&#8211;forming reactions. While this enzyme class is mainly investigated for the formation of acyloins of secondary alcohols, recent studies have expanded its scope to utilize ketones as electrophiles in asymmetric carboligation reactions for the formation of tertiary alcohols. Chiral tertiary alcohols are ubiquitous motifs in natural products and important building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive compounds. ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes are emerging as one of the most promising classes of biocatalysts for synthesizing a wide range of products due to the variety of possible substrate combinations, accessible starting materials, high enantioselectivity, and advantageous self&#8208;regeneration of the catalytic ThDP cofactor. This review provides an overview of the ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes (e.g., decarboxylase, DC; transketolase, TK; &#945;&#8208;keto acid dehydrogenase 2, &#945;KADH2) that form tertiary alcohols, focusing on the substrate scope and diversity of physiological functions. The available toolbox and the characterized reactions shall serve as a starting point for future studies. Inspired by nature, an even broader diversity of classes and substrate specificities is expected in this field.

         <title>Macromolecular High&#8208;Affinity Binding Probed by Advanced Fluorescence Techniques</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the extreme sensitivity and the intrinsic selectivity of fluorescence techniques, high&#8208;affinity binding can be measured even at extremely low molecule concentrations in the picomolar range. In particular, modern advanced techniques with fluorescence microscopes have provided considerable methodological advancements in recent years. Here, we provide a brief description of the basic physical principles of fluorescence detection and its experimental measurement setups. For interacting biomolecules in solution, confocal fluorescence microscopy in particular enables some very effective approaches to characterize binding in complex sample environments and with small sample consumption. In addition to standard techniques with bulk samples in classical spectrometers, applications with single molecule FRET, two&#8208;colour coincidence detection and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy are presented. The strength of the more advanced techniques lies in their broad applicability, ranging from fluorescence&#8208;based genetically encoded biosensors for use in living cells to the high controllability in the measurement of binding curves even at very low molecule concentrations. The advantages and limitations of the individual techniques are compared and recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Non&#8208;muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75% of bladder cancer cases, with Bacillus Calmette&#8208;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) immunotherapy as the gold standard for high&#8208;risk patients. BCG elicits a robust immune response but is limited by adverse effects and resistance. To enhance its efficacy, we developed a trehalose&#8208;based conjugation strategy, tethering a cytostatic agent to BCG via a cleavable disulfide linker. This system enables selective drug integration into the BCG envelope and controlled release in tumor cells, aiming to improve therapeutic precision while minimizing toxicity. This approach combines immunotherapy with targeted chemotherapy, offering a promising strategy for NMIBC treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanophenylalanine as an Infrared Probe for Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster Redox State in Multicenter Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noncanonical amino acid, cyanophenylalanine, is genetically inserted close to iron&#8211;sulfur clusters of either spinach ferredoxin or iron&#8211;iron hydrogenase, and functions as an infrared spectroscopic reporter for changes in cluster redox state.

The noncanonical amino acid, para&#8208;cyanophenylalanine (CNF), when incorporated into metalloproteins, functions as an infrared spectroscopic probe for the redox state of iron&#8208;sulfur clusters, offering a strategy for determining electron occupancy in the electron transport chains of complex metalloenzymes. A redshift of &#8776;1&#8211;2&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the nitrile (NC) stretching frequency is observed, following reduction of spinach ferredoxin modified to contain CNF close to its [2Fe&#8211;2S] center, and this shift is reversed on re&#8208;oxidation. We extend this to CNF positioned near to the proximal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. In combination with a distal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster and the [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the active site &#8216;H&#8208;cluster&#8217; ([4Fe&#8211;4S]H), the proximal cluster forms an electron relay connecting the active site to the surface of the protein. Again, a reversible shift in wavenumber for CNF is observed, following cluster reduction in either apo&#8208;protein (containing the iron&#8208;sulfur clusters but lacking the active site) or holo&#8208;protein with intact active site, demonstrating the general applicability of this approach to studying complex metalloenzymes.

&lt;p&gt;The noncanonical amino acid, cyanophenylalanine, is genetically inserted close to iron&#8211;sulfur clusters of either spinach ferredoxin or iron&#8211;iron hydrogenase, and functions as an infrared spectroscopic reporter for changes in cluster redox state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noncanonical amino acid, para-cyanophenylalanine (CNF), when incorporated into metalloproteins, functions as an infrared spectroscopic probe for the redox state of iron-sulfur clusters, offering a strategy for determining electron occupancy in the electron transport chains of complex metalloenzymes. A redshift of &#8776;1&#8211;2&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the nitrile (NC) stretching frequency is observed, following reduction of spinach ferredoxin modified to contain CNF close to its [2Fe&#8211;2S] center, and this shift is reversed on re-oxidation. We extend this to CNF positioned near to the proximal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Desulfovibrio desulfuricans&lt;/i&gt;. In combination with a distal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster and the [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the active site &#8216;H-cluster&#8217; ([4Fe&#8211;4S]&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;), the proximal cluster forms an electron relay connecting the active site to the surface of the protein. Again, a reversible shift in wavenumber for CNF is observed, following cluster reduction in either apo-protein (containing the iron-sulfur clusters but lacking the active site) or holo-protein with intact active site, demonstrating the general applicability of this approach to studying complex metalloenzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoactivatable Alkyne Tag for Photolabeling Biomolecules in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable linear alkyne tag is developed by caging the intermediate of the Eschenmoser&#8211;Tanabe reaction to expand photoinduced intracellular molecular imaging to a variety of biomolecules. The photoactivatable tag is modified onto a cholesterol analog and introduced into cells. After light irradiation, the tag is successfully labeled with azide&#8208;functionalized fluorescent dye, achieving photoinduced intracellular molecular imaging.

Light&#8208;induced molecular imaging methods have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential for monitoring changes in the localization of intracellular molecules, which can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of living systems. In this article, a photoactivatable alkyne tag is developed by modifying an unstable intermediate of the alkyne&#8208;forming reaction with a photodegradable protecting group; the photodegradation triggers the conversion of the intermediate into a linear alkyne in an aqueous solution. The developed photoactivatable alkyne tag is incorporated into a cholesterol analog, introduced into living cells, and exposed to a biocompatible dose of 365&#8201;nm light. Subsequently, the cholesterol analog in light&#8208;irradiated cells is microscopically visualized through alkyne&#8208;specific biotinylation via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition and biotin&#8208;specific labeling with fluorescence&#8208;labeled streptavidin. The obtained results indicate that the photoactivatable alkyne tag can be photoconverted into alkyne derivatives inside cells and applied to the light&#8208;induced intracellular imaging of biomolecules. This photoactivatable chemical tag can potentially expand the range of applications of light&#8208;induced molecular imaging of various biomolecules.

         <title>Hazelnut: Explorations towards the biocatalytic synthesis of its aroma precursor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalysis has gained significant industrial interest due to its controlled stereoselectivity and use of mild process conditions. Here we propose a biosynthetic route for the synthesis of filbertone (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hepten&#8208;4&#8208;one, 1), which is the principal flavour compound of hazelnut. The enantiomeric purity of the industrially synthesized compound is defined, contrary to the natural aroma, which varies according to the source of the nut extraction conditions and treatments. The novel synthetic pathway for a hazelnut aroma precursor proposed here consists of a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade, which starts from the two amino acids D&#8208;Ile and L&#8208;Thr that are individually converted by enzyme catalysts, i.e., D&#8208;amino acid oxidase and threonine deaminase, followed by C&#8208;C ligation of the obtained products allowing a potentially sustainable production of the natural aroma. The most critical step is C&#8208;C ligation that uses two carbonyl compounds as starting material. This step is catalysed by a regioselective transketolase (TK) that originates from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Our approach holds promise for an industrial production of natural hazelnut aroma precursor, addressing the growing demand in the aroma industry for synthesis methods that sustain the regulatory claims for natural compounds.

         <title>Designing the Proteome with Chemical Tools: Degrons and Beyond</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell biology relies on precise changes in protein stability, which can be chemically harnessed to transform cell fate. Decades of research have revealed the many intricate systems underlying cellular proteostasis, which can be hijacked by proximity&#8208;based degrader compounds. The archetypal degrader, PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC), recruits E3 ligases to protein targets to facilitate their ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Being able to customize the human proteome with chemical tools has great value for fundamental research and for clinical progress through the controlled elimination of disease&#8208;causing proteins. Success within the degrader field has reinvigorated interest in mapping the mechanisms underlying native protein degradation, which has platformed new degrader classes capable of advancing the field towards the goal of degrading the entire human proteome. This review discusses ongoing strategies to identify degrons regulating native protein turnover, advances in chemical tools to activate these degrons, and new attempts to streamline degron pathways for simplified targeted protein degradation. The continued discovery and application of degrons has the power to transform human biology and combat disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting SpyTag/SpyCatcher Technology to Design New Artificial Catalytic Copper Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing artificial metal sites in proteins is challenging due to the need to place the metal site in precise positions and to tailor the coordination environment of the metal. A modular approach based on the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology is used to provide the Spy construct with a Cu2+/ATCUN site. This strategy enables versatile metalloprotein design by shifting complexity from a protein to a peptide.

Designing artificial metal binding sites within a protein is challenging since amino acid residues need to be placed in desired positions in the final construct and the use of non&#8208;natural amino acids is difficult. The alternative approach of directing the insertion of artificial metal coordination systems presents the difficulty of grafting such site in a single desired position. Spy protein is composed of a protein component (SpyCatcher) which binds spontaneously an oligopeptide (SpyTag) with formation of an isopeptide bond. A SpyTag peptide equipped with an ATCUN (amino terminal copper and nickel) binding site is designed to bind copper(II) with high femtomolar affinity both in the absence of SpyCatcher and in the reconstituted Spy construct. The Cu2+ ATCUN site in the reconstituted Spy protein presents a catalytic activity in reactive oxygen species production, higher than that of the SpyTag peptide alone. This method offers a novel approach for constructing artificial metalloproteins by incorporating functional metal binding sites into a peptide, which can then be clicked onto its protein counterpart. The small size and modularity of this construct make it versatile for integration into other protein systems, eventually moving the complexity from a protein to a peptide and highlighting its potential for protein design.

         <title>Covalent Peptide&#8208;Graphene Conjugates for Enhanced Cell Spreading, Osteogenic Differentiation, and Angiogenesis in Bone Defects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three peptides RGD, DGEA, and KKGHK are covalently attached to the 2D nanomaterial graphene oxide (GO) to create new biomaterials for the treatment of severe bone injuries. These GO modifications improve cell spreading, stem cell differentiation into bone cell types, and formation of blood vessel&#8208;like structures. These results directly address common challenges faced by bone regeneration scaffolds.

Traumatic bone injury is one of the most common injuries that require surgical intervention, and current treatments suffer severe drawbacks. Modern research in bone regeneration focuses on implants that will support and enhance native tissue regeneration. One scaffold material that shows promise is graphene oxide (GO), a 2D nanomaterial made from oxidation of graphite. GO is biocompatible, strong, osteoinductive, is safely and slowly resorbed by the body, has a cheap, facile, and scalable synthesis, and is highly tailorable and functionalizable. The bioactivity of GO can be enhanced via functionalization with biomolecules such as peptides, proteins, and small molecules. Here, short peptides RGD, DGEA, and KKGHK are covalently bound to GO through a Claisen modification (CG) to create new functional graphenic materials that are cell&#8208;adhesive, osteogenic, and angiogenic, respectively. These peptide&#8208;Claisen graphenes (peptide&#8208;CGs) are found to be cytocompatible, to encourage cell spreading on the graphenic surface, to promote osteogenesis in stem cells, and to induce angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells. They show promise as next&#8208;generation bone regeneration scaffolds by overcoming challenges frequently faced by bone regeneration scaffolds, namely retaining implanted and recruited cells, promoting their survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and ensuring a sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply to new tissue.

         <title>Development of Thiol&#8208;Labile &#945;&#8208;Amino Protecting Groups for Efficient Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To develop thiol&#8208;labile &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;protecting groups for peptide synthesis, the nitrobenzenesulfenyl scaffold is systematically modified and the effects on chemical stability and thiol&#8208;mediated deprotection kinetics are evaluated. The findings reveal that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly influence both stability and thiol susceptibility, offering valuable insights for optimizing protecting group design.

Recently, a thiol&#8208;labile &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;protecting group, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzenesulfenyl (DNPBS), is introduced for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). DNPBS&#8208;SPPS effectively mitigates major side reactions&#8212;such as aspartimide formation and &#945;&#8208;C racemization&#8212;that commonly occur in conventional Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. However, N&#8208;DNPBS&#8208;protected histidine is unstable during the base&#8208;catalyzed peptide bond coupling, leading to histidine redundant insertion byproducts (Nat. Commun. 2023, 14, 5324). In this study, modifications to the nitrobenzenesulfenyl protecting group are explored and their impact on chemical stability and thiol&#8208;mediated deprotection kinetics are systematically evaluated. It is found that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly modulate both stability and thiol susceptibility. Notably, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenyl (Npys) outperforms DNPBS in SPPS. N&#8208;Npys&#8208;protected histidine exhibits markedly greater stability than its N&#8208;DNPBS&#8208;protected counterpart, effectively preventing histidine redundant insertion byproducts commonly observed in DNPBS&#8208;SPPS. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing nitrobenzenesulfenyl&#8208;based protecting groups for more efficient SPPS.

         <title>Development and Recent Advances in SLIPT&#8208;PM: A Chemogenetic Platform for Manipulating Signaling at the Plasma Membrane</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon cell stimulation, mammalian cells activate various signaling proteins and lipids by recruiting their upstream regulators to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), which in turn determines their cellular response. Therefore,&#160;artificially inducing protein translocation to the PM is an effective strategy for dissecting cell signaling networks and engineering cellular functions. Self&#8208;localizing ligand&#8208;induced protein translocation (SLIPT) is an emerging technique that we developed to control protein localization in living cells using synthetic self&#8208;localizing ligands (SLs). Building on this strategy, we recently introduced a versatile chemogenetic SLIPT platform that rapidly recruits proteins of interest fused to an engineered&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;dihydrofolate reductase tag from the cytoplasm to the PM using a trimethoprim&#8208;based SL. The PM&#8208;specific SLIPT (SLIPT&#8208;PM) system is easy to use and enables researchers to manipulate diverse intracellular signaling molecules and pathways with controlled reversibility and repeatability. Owing to its modular design, related SLIPT&#8208;PM tools have also been developed to support more sophisticated experiments, such as light&#8208;induced spatially regulated protein recruitment and multiplexed signal manipulation. In this Concept article, we review the development, principal features, current applications, and future challenges of SLIPT&#8208;PM as a unique tool in chemical biology and synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Molecules of Small Molecular and Peptidic HIV Fusion Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid molecules of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptide SC22EK (3) are designed as heterodimeric HIV fusion inhibitors (10&#8211;12) to compensate for the drawbacks of the homodimeric molecules of small compounds or peptides. Hybrid molecules (10a&#8211;c) have remarkably higher anti&#8208;HIV activity than SC22EK (3).

Since the membrane fusion step is the last chance to block the virus extracellularly, membrane fusion is an important target for anti&#8208;human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents. Previously, the dimeric derivatives of C34, which are contained in the HIV&#8208;1 envelope protein gp41 are found, linked by a disulfide bridge or a pegylated linker at its C&#8208;terminus have more potent anti&#8208;HIV activity than the C34 peptide monomer, and that bivalent inhibitors crosslinking two peptidomimetic small compounds have more potent anti&#8208;HIV activity than the parent small compounds. In the present study, the hybrids of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptides (SC34 (2) and SC22EK (3)) are designed as heterodimeric molecules (10&#8211;15) to compensate for the drawbacks of the above homodimeric molecules. Some hybrid molecules of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptide SC22EK (3) have remarkably higher anti&#8208;HIV activity than peptide SC22EK (3). Crosslinking small compounds and peptides (3) is found to be critical for an increase in anti&#8208;HIV activity. Hybrid molecules with small compounds and peptides are useful HIV&#8208;1 fusion inhibitors.

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, we discuss current insights into GT promiscuity, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Cubamyces Menziesii Terpenome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome of Cubamyces menziesii reveals 18 putative sesquiterpene cyclase genes. These genes are cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding 10 active enzymes. Using farnesyl diphosphate as substrate, the enzymes are analyzed, and the products characterized after bioconversion, uncovering diverse sesquiterpene structures. This study highlights the phylogenetic prediction and the ecological and biotechnological relevance of C. menziesii sesquiterpenes.

Long&#8208;lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, the genome of Cubamyces (C.) menziesii and identified 18 genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases (STCs) is explored. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, the 18 codon&#8208;optimized open reading frames are cloned and overproduced the C. menziesii STCs in Escherichia coli. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme is purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these 10 enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes is determined by (GC&#8208;MS) gas chromatography mass spectrometry and (NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Among the 10 enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds, and the remaining two acted as a multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore C. menziesii and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.

         <title>Biochemical Characterization of Multimodular Xylanolytic Carbohydrate Esterases from the Marine Bacterium Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodular carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes often combine different catalytic activities for efficient polysaccharide degradation. In this work, the structural and functional characterization of three multimodular xylan&#8208;targeting esterases, Fl6, Fll1 and Fll4 from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48, are presented. Each protein shows novelty in its architecture, with particular emphasis on the enzyme Fll4, which consists of three esterase domains, resulting in bifunctional esterase activity.

Carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes) are critical for sustainable biomass utilization due to their ability to degrade complex polysaccharides. Frequently, a multimodularity can be observed combining several CAZyme domains and activities in close proximity which can benefit this degradation process. In this study, three multimodular xylanolytic carbohydrate esterases (CEs), named Fl6, Fll1, and Fll4, originating from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48 that represent a novel arrangement of catalytic and/or binding domains, are investigated. While Fl6 acts as a glucuronyl esterase, it also contains a carbohydrate binding module which is normally associated with xylanase activity. Fll1 combines xylosidase with acetylxylan esterase (AXE) activity mediated by a CE3 domain. The third enzyme, Fll4, is the first enzyme that comprises three distinct CE domains and shows bifunctional activity as an AXE and a feruloyl esterase (FAE). Investigation of the single domains reveals that the CE6 domain of Fll4 mediates its AXE activity while one of the putative CE1 domains, CE1a, mediates the FAE activity. This investigation of multimodularity of marine CAZymes not only enhances our understanding of these enzymes but may provide a promising route toward more efficient algal biomass utilization for biotechnological applications.
