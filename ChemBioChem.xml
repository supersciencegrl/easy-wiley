         <title>Making Enzymes Suitable for Organic Chemistry by Rational Protein Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review outlines recent developments in protein engineering of stereo&#8208; and regioselective enzymes, which are of prime interest in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry as well as biotechnology. The widespread application of enzymes was hampered for decades due to limited enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity, which was the reason why most organic chemists were not interested in biocatalysis. This attitude&#160; began to change with the advent of semi&#8208;rational directed evolution methods based on focused saturation mutagenesis at sites lining the binding pocket. Screening constitutes the labor&#8208;intensive step (bottleneck), which is the reason why various research groups are continuing to develop techniques for the generation of small and smart mutant libraries. Rational enzyme design, traditionally an alternative to directed evolution, provides small collections of mutants which require minimal screening. This approach first focused on thermostabilization, and did not enter the field of stereoselectivity until later. Computational guides such as the Rosetta algorithms, HotSpot Wizard metric, and Machine Learning (ML) contribute significantly in decision making. The newest advancements show that semi&#8208;rational directed evolution such as CAST/ISM and rational enzyme design no longer develop on separate tracks, instead, they have started to merge. Indeed, researchers utilizing the two approaches have learned from each other. Today, the toolbox of organic chemists includes enzymes, primarily because the possibility of controlling stereoselectivity by protein engineering has ensured reliability when facing synthetic challenges. This review was also written with the hope that undergraduate and graduate education will include enzymes more so than in the past.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Novel Tyrosine Ammonia Lyases for the Enzymatic Synthesis of p&#8208;Coumaric Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a phylogenetic tree&#8208;building approach, five novel tyrosine ammonia lyases (TALs) and three novel phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyases (PTALs) were identified. The enzymes were biochemically characterized and the optimal conditions for a whole cell E. coli biotransformation were determined. Under these conditions p&#8208;coumaric acid (p&#8208;CA) yields of 2.03&#8197;g/L after 8&#8197;hours by TALclu and 2.35&#8197;g/L after 24&#8197;hours by TALrpc could be achieved.







Abstract
p&#8208;Coumaric acid (p&#8208;CA) is a key precursor for the biosynthesis of flavonoids. Tyrosine ammonia lyases (TALs) specifically catalyze the synthesis of p&#8208;CA from l&#8208;tyrosine, which is a convenient enzymatic pathway. To explore novel and highly active TALs, a phylogenetic tree&#8208;building approach was conducted including 875 putative TALs and 46 putative phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyases (PTALs). Among them, 5 TALs and 3 PTALs were successfully characterized and found to exhibit the proposed enzymatic activity. The TAL from Chryseobacterium luteum sp. nov (TALclu) has the highest affinity (Km=0.019&#8197;mm) and conversion efficiency (kcat/Km=1631 s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mm&#8722;1) towards l&#8208;tyrosine. The reaction conditions for two purified enzymes and their E. coli recombinant cells were optimized and p&#8208;CA yields of 2.03&#8197;g/L after 8&#8197;hours by TALclu and 2.35&#8197;g/L after 24&#8197;h by TAL from Rivularia sp. PCC 7116 (TALrpc) in whole cells were achieved. These TALs are thus candidates for the construction of whole&#8208;cell systems to produce the flavonoid precursor p&#8208;CA.

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trihydroxypiperidine Based Multivalent Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) Enhancers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multivalent piperidine iminosugars described in this work are strong inhibitors of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease. The trivalent derivative 12 was able to double GCase activity in patient's fibroblasts homozygous for the L444P mutation, which is resistant to most pharmacological chaperones. Co&#8208;incubation of 12 with recombinant GCase enzyme paves the way to its application in PC/ERT therapy.







Abstract
The synthesis of five new multivalent derivatives of a trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar was accomplished through copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of an azido ending piperidine and several propargylated scaffolds. The resulting multivalent architectures were assayed as inhibitors of lysosomal GCase, the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease. The multivalent compounds resulted in much more potent inhibitors than a parent monovalent reference compound, thus showing a good multivalent effect. Biological investigation of these compounds as pharmacological chaperones revealed that the trivalent derivative (12) gives a 2&#8208;fold recovery of the GCase activity on Gaucher patient fibroblasts bearing the L444P/L444P mutations responsible for neuropathies. Additionally, a thermal denaturation experiment showed its ability to impart stability to the recombinant enzyme used in therapy.

         <title>Structure and Mutation of the Native Amine Dehydrogenase MATOUAmDH2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The native amine dehydrogenase MATOUAmDH2, catalyzes the ammoniation of small aliphatic ketones with high selectivity. Structural analysis reveals domain movements associated with the formation of the active site. This informed the design of mutants that have superior activity for the amination of cyclohexanone with either ammonia or methylamine.







Abstract
Native amine dehydrogenases (nat&#8208;AmDHs) have recently emerged as a potentially valuable new reservoir of enzymes for the sustainable and selective synthesis of chiral amines, catalyzing the NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent ammoniation of carbonyl compounds with high activity and selectivity. MATOUAmDH2, recently identified from the Marine Atlas of Tara Oceans Unigenes (MATOUv1) database of eukaryotic genes, displays exceptional catalytic performance against its best identified substrate, isobutyraldehyde, as well as having broader substrate scope than other nat&#8208;AmDHs. In the interests of providing a platform for the rational engineering of this and other nat&#8208;AmDHs, we have determined the structure of MATOUAmDH2 in complex with NADP+ and also with the cofactor and cyclohexylamine. Monomers within the structure are representative of more open and closed conformations of the enzyme and illustrate the profound changes undergone by nat&#8208;AmDHs during the catalytic cycle. An alanine screen of active site residues revealed that M215A and L180A are more active than the wild&#8208;type enzyme for the amination of cyclohexanone with ammonia and methylamine respectively; the latter suggests that AmDHs have the potential to be engineered for the improved production of secondary amines.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photocontrollable probes (YGH&#8208;1 and YGH&#8208;2) were synthesized and used for mitochondrial proteomic studies. Our results show that the probes can be successfully used for spatial and temporal analysis of subcellular proteomes.







Abstract
The mitochondrion is the core site of cell signaling, energy metabolism and biosynthesis. Here, taking advantage of activity&#8208;based probes, we synthesized two photocontrollable probes (YGH&#8208;1 and YGH&#8208;2), composed of a mitochondrial localization moiety &#8220;triphenylphosphonium&#8221;, a photo&#8208;triggered group to achieve spatially and temporally controlled protein capture, and an alkyne group to enrich the labeled protein. Proteomic validation was further carried out to facilitate identification of the mitochondrial proteome in HeLa cells. The results show that half of the identified protein hits (&#8764;300) labeled by YGH&#8208;1 and YGH&#8208;2 belong to mitochondria, and are mostly localized in the mitochondrial matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane. Our results provide a new tool for spatial and temporal analysis of subcellular proteomes.

         <title>C&#8208;Nitrosothioformamide: A Donor Template for Dual Release of HNO and H2S</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction triggered dual release of H2S and HNO from C&#8208;nitrosothioformamides is reported. This process produces HNO and COS concurrently. COS can be further converted to H2S by carbonic anhydrase. These donors may be useful to understanding the crosstalk between H2S and HNO.







Abstract
C&#8208;Nitrosothioformamide was demonstrated to be a donor template for dual release of HNO and COS triggered by a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. COS is an H2S precursor in the presence of carbonic anhydrase. This process produces HNO and H2S in a slow but steady manner. As such, the direct reaction between HNO and H2S under this situation appears to be minor. This may provide a useful tool for studying the synergistic effects of HNO and H2S.

         <title>Crucial role of the chaperonin GroES/EL for heterologous production of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylomonas methanica MC09</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane is a widespread energy source and can serve as an attractive C1 building block for a future bioeconomy. The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) is able to break strong C&#8208;H bond of methane and convert it to methanol. The high structural complexity, multiplex cofactors, and unfamiliar folding or maturation procedures of sMMO have hampered the heterologous production and thus biotechnological applications. Here, we demonstrate the heterologous production of active sMMO from the marine Methylomonas methanica MC09 in Escherichia coli by co&#8208;synthesizing the GroES/EL chaperonin. Iron determination, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and native gel immunoblots revealed the incorporation of the Fe&#8208;Fe active site and homodimer formation of active sMMO. The production of recombinant sMMO will enable detailed studies on biological methane conversion in the future, allowing for a variety of novel biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Fusions between P450 BM3 and an Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Efficient (+)&#8208;Nootkatone Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fruitful fusion: A cytochrome P450 BM3 mutant and an alcohol dehydrogenase were genetically fused in different order and with different linkers to unite both substrate oxidation and cofactor regeneration in one construct. The fusions exhibited higher activity compared to separate enzymes as highlighted with the two&#8208;step oxidation of (+)&#8208;valencene to the grapefruit aroma (+)&#8208;nootkatone formed at a concentration of 1080&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzyme cascades enable the production of valuable chemical compounds, and fusion of the enzymes that catalyze these reactions can improve the reaction outcome. In this work, P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium and an alcohol dehydrogenase from Sphingomonas yanoikuyae were fused to bifunctional constructs to enable cofactor regeneration and improve the in&#8197;vitro two&#8208;step oxidation of (+)&#8208;valencene to (+)&#8208;nootkatone. An up to 1.5&#8208;fold increased activity of P450 BM3 was achieved with the fusion constructs compared to the individual enzyme. Conversion of (+)&#8208;valencene coupled to cofactor regeneration and performed in the presence of the solubilizing agent cyclodextrin resulted in up to 1080&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 (+)&#8208;nootkatone produced by the fusion constructs as opposed to 620&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 produced by a mixture of the separate enzymes. Thus, a two&#8208;step (+)&#8208;valencene oxidation was considerably improved through the simple method of enzyme fusion.

         <title>Switchable DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library: Interconversion between Double&#8208; and Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Formats</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) encoding methods were classified into single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies and double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies. To deal with the conflict between the two DNA formats, the concept of interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries is proposed and practically realized.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries (DEL) have attracted substantial attention due to the infinite possibility for hit discovery in both pharmaceutical companies and academia. The encoding method is the initial step of DEL construction and one of the cornerstones of DEL applications. Classified by the DNA format, the existing DEL encoding strategies were categorized into single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies and double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies. The two DEL formats have their unique advantages but are usually incompatible with each other. To address this issue, we propose the concept of interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DEL based on the &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221; design, which combines maximum robustness of synthesis with extraordinary flexibility of applications in distinct setups. Future opportunities in this field are also proposed to advance DEL technology to a comprehensive drug discovery platform.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Modulation of the Catalytic Properties of [2Fe&#8722;2S]&#8208;Dependent Dehydratases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron&#8208;sulfur cluster is one of the most versatile cofactors in nature. This cover feature highlights the study of an iron&#8208;sulfur cluster dependent enzyme, catalysing the dehydration reaction of dihydroxy acids to &#945;&#8208;ketoacids. This is one of the key steps in the valorisation of biomass and industrial by&#8208;products to chemicals, feed, and biofuels. Combining in silico prediction with in&#8197;vitro validation, structure&#8208;function relationships were deduced, and a more active variant toward a non&#8208;natural reaction was designed. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Sieber et&#8197;al.

         <title>Whole&#8208;cell Biotransformation of Penicillin G by a Three&#8208;enzyme Co&#8208;expression System with Engineered Deacetoxycephalosporin C Synthase</title>

         <dc:description>Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) catalyzes the tranformation of penicillin G to phenylacetyl&#8208;7&#8208;aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid (G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA) in dependence on 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG).  However, the  low activity of DAOCS and the expense of 2OG restricted the practical application in the production of G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA. Herein, a rational design campaign was performed on a DAOCS from  Streptomyces clavuligerus  (scDAOCS) in the quest to construct novel expandases. The resulting mutants showed 25~58% increase in activity compared to the template. The dominant DAOCS variants were then embeded into a three&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;expression system, consisting of a catalase and a L&#8208;glutamic oxidase for the generation of 2OG, to convert penicillin G into G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA  in E. coli  . The engineered whole&#8208;cell enzyme cascade was applied on an up scaled reaction, exhibiting a yield of G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA up to 39.21 mM (14.6 g&#183;L  &#8208;1  ) with a conversion of 78.42 mol%. This work highlights the potential of the integrated whole&#8208;cell system that may inspire further research on green and efficient production of 7&#8208;ADCA.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Tobacco Mosaic Virus&#8208;Binding Peptides for Biotechnology Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biopanning led to the identification of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)&#8208;binding peptides that can be utilized for diagnostic assays to detect TMV in plant sap or for biotechnology applications such as adding functional moieties to the TMV used as nanocarrier.







Abstract
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was the first virus to be discovered and it is now widely used as a tool for biological research and biotechnology applications. TMV particles can be decorated with functional molecules by genetic engineering or bioconjugation. However, this can destabilize the nanoparticles, and/or multiple rounds of modification may be necessary, reducing product yields and preventing the display of certain cargo molecules. To overcome these challenges, we used phage display technology and biopanning to isolate a TMV&#8208;binding peptide (TBPT25) with strong binding properties (IC50=0.73&#8197;&#956;M, KD=0.16&#8197;&#956;M), allowing the display of model cargos via a single mixing step. The TMV&#8208;binding peptide is specific for TMV but does not recognize free coat proteins and can therefore be used to decorate intact TMV or detect intact TMV particles in crude plant sap.

         <title>An Engineered Cholesterol Oxidase Catalyses Enantioselective Oxidation of Non&#8208;steroidal Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Libraries of cholesterol oxidase variants were screened for activity towards secondary alcohols. The active variants oxidised a range of secondary alcohols including unactivated alcohols, and allylic and benzylic alcohols. In conjunction with a non&#8208;selective reducing agent, they effected the deracemisation of racemic alcohols to yield (R)&#8208;alcohols in high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
The enantioselective oxidation of 2&#176; alcohols to ketones is an important reaction in synthetic chemistry, especially if it can be achieved using O2&#8208;driven alcohol oxidases under mild reaction conditions. However to date, oxidation of secondary alcohols using alcohol oxidases has focused on activated benzylic or allylic substrates, with unactivated secondary alcohols showing poor activity. Here we show that cholesterol oxidase (EC&#8197;1.1.3.6) could be engineered for activity towards a range of aliphatic, cyclic, acyclic, allylic and benzylic secondary alcohols. Additionally, since the variants demonstrated high (S)&#8208;selectivity, deracemisation reactions were performed in the presence of ammonia borane to obtain enantiopure (R)&#8208;alcohols.

         <title>Phenyl Selenide&#8208;Based Precursors as Hydrogen Peroxide Inducible DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Method to produce quinone methides (QMs): Phenolic hydroxyl group and benzylic leaving group are essential for the formation of QMs. In contrast to previous work on H2O2&#8208;inducible formation of phenolic hydroxyl group to produce QMs, we show that H2O2&#8208;inducible formation of a good benzylic leaving group, benzeneselenenic acid converted from phenyl selenoxide, evokes generation of QMs to crosslink DNA.







Abstract
DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic DNA lesions, and induce cell death by blocking DNA strand separation. Most ICL agents aiming to kill cancer cells, also generate adverse side effects to normal cells. H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA ICL agents are highly selective for targeting cancer cells, as the concentration of H2O2 is higher in cancer cells than normal cells. Previous studies have focused on arylboronate&#8208;based precursors, reacting with H2O2 to generate reactive quinone methides (QMs) crosslinking DNA. Here we explore phenyl selenide&#8208;based precursors 1&#8211;3 as H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA ICL agents. The precursors 1&#8211;3 can be activated by H2O2 to generate the good benzylic leaving group and promote production of reactive QMs to crosslink DNA. Moreover, the DNA cross&#8208;linking ability is enhanced by the introduction of substituents in the para&#8208;position of the phenolic hydroxyl group. From the substituents explored (H, OMe, F), the introduction of electron donating group (OMe) shows a pronounced elevating effect. Further mechanistic studies at the molecular and DNA levels confirm alkylation sites located mainly at dAs, dCs and dGs in DNA. Additionally, cellular experiments reveal that agents 1&#8211;3 exhibit higher cytotoxicity toward H1299 human lung cancer cells compared to clinically used drugs, by inducing cellular DNA damage, apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. This study provides a strategy to develop H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA interstrand cross&#8208;linkers.

         <title>The &#945;/&#946; Hydrolase AzpM Catalyzes Dipeptide Synthesis in Alazopeptin Biosynthesis Using Two Molecules of Carrier Protein&#8208;Tethered Amino Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alazopeptin biosynthesis includes a characteristic peptide&#8208;formation machinery that uses a hydrolase (AzpM) to synthesize a dipeptide composed of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine (DON). Detailed analyses using a DON analogue, azaserine, show that AzpM catalyzes the condensation of two DON molecules tethered to a carrier protein and the subsequent hydrolysis. Enzymatic synthesis of alazopeptin analogues composed of azaserine was also established.







Abstract
During the biosynthesis of alazopeptin, a tripeptide composed of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;L&#8208;norleucine (DON) and one of alanine, the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase AzpM synthesizes the DON&#8208;DON dipeptide using DON tethered to the carrier protein AzpF (DON&#8208;AzpF). However, whether AzpM catalyzes the condensation of DON&#8208;AzpF with DON or DON&#8208;AzpF remains unclear. Here, to distinguish between these two condensation possibilities, the reaction catalyzed by AzpM was examined in&#8197;vitro using a DON analogue, azaserine (AZS). We found that AzpM catalyzed the condensation between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON&#8208;AzpF, but not between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON. Possible reaction intermediates, DON&#8208;DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AZS&#8208;AzpF, were also detected during AzpM&#8208;catalyzed dipeptide formation from DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AzpF, respectively. From these results, we concluded that AzpM catalyzed the condensation of the two molecules of DON&#8208;AzpF and subsequent hydrolysis to produce DON&#8208;DON. Thus, AzpM is an unprecedented &#945;/&#946; hydrolase that catalyzes dipeptide synthesis from two molecules of a carrier protein&#8208;tethered amino acid.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alazopeptin biosynthesis&lt;/b&gt; includes a characteristic peptide-formation machinery that uses a hydrolase (AzpM) to synthesize a dipeptide composed of two molecules of 6-diazo-5-oxo-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-norleucine (DON). Detailed analyses using a DON analogue, azaserine, show that AzpM catalyzes the condensation of two DON molecules tethered to a carrier protein and the subsequent hydrolysis. Enzymatic synthesis of alazopeptin analogues composed of azaserine was also established.

         <title>Engineering Formaldehyde Dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida to Favor Nicotinamide Cytosine Dinucleotide</title>

NAD&#8208;dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) was engineered and the mutant enzyme FalDH* was obtained with over 150&#8208;fold higher preference for the non&#8208;natural cofactor NCD.







Abstract
The enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) from Pseudomonas putida is of particular interest for biotechnological applications as it catalyzes the oxidation of formaldehyde independent of glutathione. However, the consumption of a stoichiometric amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) can be challenging at the metabolic level as this may affect many other NAD&#8208;linked processes. A potential solution is to engineer FalDH to utilize non&#8208;natural cofactors. Here we devised FalDH variants to favor nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) by structure&#8208;guided modification of the binding pocket for the adenine moiety of NAD. Several mutants were obtained and the best one FalDH 9B2 had over 150&#8208;fold higher preference for NCD than NAD. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the cofactor binding pocket shrunk to better fit NCD, a smaller&#8208;sized cofactor. FalDH 9B2 together with other NCD&#8208;linked enzymes offer opportunities to assemble orthogonal pathways for biological conversion of C1 molecules.

         <title>Mapping the Conformational Landscape of the Neutral Network of RNA Sequences That Connect Two Functional Distinctly Different Ribozymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diversity of secondary structures of different ribozymes connected through several mutational steps were investigated. We mapped the mutational landscape in order to understand changes in secondary structure and their link to particular functions. This work further highlights the necessity for the utilization of different complementary techniques for the analysis of RNA secondary structures.







Abstract
During evolution of an RNA world, the development of enzymatic function was essential. Such enzymatic function was linked to RNA sequences capable of adopting specific RNA folds that possess catalytic pockets to promote catalysis. Within this primordial RNA world, initially evolved self&#8208;replicating ribozymes presumably mutated to ribozymes with new functions. Schultes and Bartel (Science 2000, 289, 448&#8211;452) investigated such conversion from one ribozyme to a new ribozyme with distinctly different catalytic functions. Within a neutral network that linked these two prototype ribozymes, a single RNA chain could be identified that exhibited both enzymatic functions. As commented by Schultes and Bartel, this system possessing one sequence with two enzymatic functions serves as a paradigm for an evolutionary system that allows neutral drifts by stepwise mutation from one ribozyme into a different ribozyme without loss of intermittent function. Here, we investigated this complex functional diversification of ancestral ribozymes by analyzing several RNA sequences within this neutral network between two ribozymes with class III ligase activity and with self&#8208;cleavage reactivity. We utilized rapid RNA sample preparation for NMR spectroscopic studies together with SHAPE analysis and in&#8208;line probing to characterize secondary structure changes within the neutral network. Our investigations allowed delineation of the secondary structure space and by comparison with the previously determined catalytic function allowed correlation of the structure&#8208;function relation of ribozyme function in this neutral network.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application of a Clickable Version of Epoxomicin for Proteasome Activity Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epoxomicin&#8208;alkyne probe described can be clicked to a variety of fluorophores. It can then be used in gel&#8208;based assays, microscopy, and flow cytometry to determine proteasome activity. It is sensitive enough to be able to detect both proteasome inhibition and stimulation by small molecules.







Abstract
Degradation of proteins by the proteasome is an essential cellular process and one that many wish to study in a variety of disease types. There are commercially available probes that can monitor proteasome activity in cells, but they typically contain common fluorophores that limit their simultaneous use with other activity&#8208;based probes. In order to exchange the fluorophore or incorporate an enrichment tag, the proteasome probe likely has to be synthesized which can be cumbersome. Here, we describe a simple synthetic procedure that only requires one purification step to generate epoxomicin, a selective proteasome inhibitor, with a terminal alkyne. Through a copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition, any moiety containing an azide can be incorporated into the probe. Many fluorophores are commercially available that contain an azide that can be &#8220;clicked&#8221;, allowing this proteasome activity probe to be included into already established assays to monitor both proteasome activity and other cellular activities of interest.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel benzaldehyde lyase for the production of chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones was identified by a machine learning model and two variants with altered substrate scopes were created by rational design. All three variants exhibit significantly higher thermostability compared to the only previously described benzaldehyde lyase. When immobilized in a packed&#8208;bed reactor, the most thermostable variant showed stable substrate turnover over days.







Abstract
Enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are important building blocks of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which can be produced by thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyases, such as benzaldehyde lyase. Here we report the discovery of a novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis R138 (ReBAL). While the overall sequence identity to the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar I (PfBAL) was only 65&#8201;%, comparison of a structural model of ReBAL with the crystal structure of PfBAL revealed only four divergent amino acids in the substrate binding cavity. Based on rational design, we generated two ReBAL variants, which were characterized along with the wild&#8208;type enzyme in terms of their substrate spectrum, thermostability and biocatalytic performance in the presence of different co&#8208;solvents. We found that the new enzyme variants have a significantly higher thermostability (up to 22&#8201;&#176;C increase in T50) and a different co&#8208;solvent&#8208;dependent activity. Using the most stable variant immobilized in packed&#8208;bed reactors via the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, (R)&#8208;benzoin was synthesized from benzaldehyde over a period of seven days with a stable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8208;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;d&#8722;1. Our work expands the important class of benzaldehyde lyases and therefore contributes to the development of continuous biocatalytic processes for the production of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and APIs.

Using the most stable variant immobilized in packed-bed reactors via the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-benzoin was synthesized from benzaldehyde over a period of seven days with a stable space-time-yield of 9.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;d&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work expands the important class of benzaldehyde lyases and therefore contributes to the development of continuous biocatalytic processes for the production of &#945;-hydroxy ketones and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;Branched Primer Assembled Gene Nanovector and Its Potential Applications in Genome Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;branched primer, branch&#8208;PCR provided a size&#8208;tunable method to construct gene nanovectors, which could carry the full CRISPR/Cas9 components but retain a biocompatible size (100&#8211;200&#8197;nm) with high serum stability. This size tunability of branch&#8208;PCR constructed gene nanovectors expands their application in genome editing.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used as an efficient genome editing toolkit for gene therapy. The delivery of vectors encoding the full CRISPR/Cas9 components including Cas9 gene and gRNA expression element into cells is the crucial step to effective genome editing. However, the cargo gene sequence for genome editing is usually large, which reduces the cargo encapsulation efficiency and affects the vector size. To obtain a nanovector with high cargo gene loading capacity and biocompatible size, we report the construction of a gene nanovector from branch&#8208;PCR with a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;branched primer and establish the correlation mapping between gene length and nanovector size. The results show that the size of nanovectors can be tuned according to the gene length. According to the findings, we constructed nanovectors carrying the full CRISPR/Cas9 components in 100&#8211;200&#8197;nm and validated their application in genome editing. The results show that this kind of nanovector exhibits higher serum stability than plasmids and can reach comparable genome editing efficiency with plasmids. Hence, this type of gene nanovector obtained through branch&#8208;PCR can carry large gene cargos and maintain a biocompatible nanoscale size, which we envisage will expand its medical applications in gene therapy.

         <title>Immobilization of the Aspartate Ammonia&#8208;Lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 on Magnetic Nanoparticles: Characterization and Kinetics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aspartate ammonia&#8208;lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 (PfAAL) was isolated, expressed and characterized in this study. PfAAL was covalently immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles. Both the native and immobilized PfAAL were efficient biocatalysts in the ammonia elimination of aspartate. The effect of the viscosity of the reaction medium was investigated with the free and immobilized enzyme.







Abstract
Aspartate ammonia&#8208;lyases (AALs) catalyze the non&#8208;oxidative elimination of ammonia from l&#8208;aspartate to give fumarate and ammonia. In this work the AAL coding gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 was identified, isolated, and cloned into the pET&#8208;15b expression vector and expressed in E.&#8197;coli. The purified enzyme (PfAAL) showed optimal activity at pH&#8197;8.8, Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics in the ammonia elimination from l&#8208;aspartate, and no strong dependence on divalent metal ions for its activity. The purified PfAAL was covalently immobilized on epoxy&#8208;functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), and effective kinetics of the immobilized PfAAL&#8208;MNP was compared to the native solution form. Glycerol addition significantly enhanced the storability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP. Inhibiting effect of the growing viscosity (modulated by addition of glycerol or glucose) on the enzymatic activity was observed for the native and immobilized form of PfAAL, as previously described for other free enzymes. The storage stability and recyclability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP is promising for further biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Characterization of Competitive Inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;Dependent Protein Kinase**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed to combat malaria. Isoxazole&#8208;based compounds were found to be potent, selective, and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is an enticing antimalarial drug target. Novel chemotypes are needed because existing inhibitors have safety issues that may prevent further development. This work demonstrates isoxazole&#8208;based compounds are potent ATP competitive inhibitors of PfPKG and discloses a new analogue in this series. Isoxazoles 3 and 5 had Ki values that are comparable to a known standard, 4&#8208;[2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(1&#8208;methylpiperidine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H pyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;yl] pyridine. They also exhibited excellent selectivity for PfPKG over the human orthologue and the gatekeeper mutant T618Q PfPKG, which mimics the less accessible binding site of the human orthologue. The human orthologue's larger binding site volume is predicted to explain the selectivity of the inhibitors for the P. falciparum enzyme.

         <title>Synthetic Neoglycoconjugates of Hepta&#8208; and Nonamannoside Ligands for Eliciting Oligomannose&#8208;Specific HIV&#8208;1&#8208;Neutralizing Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannoside 3&#8208;aminopropyl derivatives were prepared in good overall yields using a block&#8208;wise assembly followed by conversion into neoglycoconjugates. CRM197 conjugates of the &#946;&#8208;variants showed comparable binding to Fabs of HIV&#8208;1 neutralizing PGT antibodies, but stronger binding of the heptamannosides by the corresponding IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Oligomannose&#8208;type glycans on the spike protein of HIV&#8208;1 constitute relevant epitopes to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Herein we describe an improved synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;linked hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl ligands that were subsequently converted into BSA and CRM197 neoglycoconjugates. We assembled the ligands from anomeric 3&#8208;azidopropyl spacer glycosides from select 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected thiocresyl mannoside donors. Chain extensions were achieved using [4+3] or [4+5] block synthesis of thiocresyl and trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors. Subsequent global deprotection generated the 3&#8208;aminopropyl oligosaccharide ligands. ELISA binding data obtained with the &#946;&#8208;anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl conjugates with a selection of HIV&#8208;1 bnAbs showed comparable binding of both mannosyl ligands by Fab fragments yet lesser binding of the nonasaccharide conjugate by the corresponding IgG antibodies. These results support previous observations that a complete Man9 structure might not be the preferred antigenic binding motif for some oligomannose&#8208;specific antibodies, and have implications for glycoside designs to elicit oligomannose&#8208;targeted HIV&#8208;1&#8208;neutralizing antibodies.

         <title>Rational Design of Self&#8208;Assembling Artificial Proteins Utilizing a Micelle&#8208;Assisted Protein Labeling Technology (MAPLabTech): Testing the Scope**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Advancement of micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling technology (MAPLabTech 3.0): In this work, we have demonstrated the synthesis of self&#8208;assembling artificial proteins by site&#8208;specific labeling of a single cysteine residue of globular proteins. This methodology should be broadly applicable to a wide range of natural and recombinant proteins containing an engineered cysteine residue.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling artificial proteins (SAPs) have gained enormous interest in recent years due to their applications in different fields. Synthesis of well&#8208;defined monodisperse SAPs is accomplished predominantly through genetic methods. However, the last decade has witnessed the use of a few chemical technologies for this purpose. In particular, micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling technology (MAPLabTech) has made huge progress in this area. The first generation MAPLabTech focused on site&#8208;specific labeling of the active&#8208;site residue of serine proteases to make SAPs. Further, this methodology was exploited for labeling of N&#8208;terminal residue of a globular protein to make functional SAPs. In this study, we describe the synthesis of novel SAPs by developing a chemical method for site&#8208;specific labeling of a surface&#8208;exposed cysteine residue of globular proteins. In addition, we disclose the synthesis of redox&#8208;sensitive SAPs and their systematic self&#8208;assembly and disassembly studies using size&#8208;exclusion chromatography. Altogether these studies further expand the scope of MAPLabTech in different fields such as vaccine design, targeted drug delivery, diagnostic imaging, biomaterials, and tissue engineering.

         <title>The pH&#8208;Dependence of the Hydration of 5&#8208;Formylcytosine: an Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has been identified and quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. We report a free energy of hydration for the hydration reactions of 5&#8201;fC and 5&#8201;fU. In case of 5&#8201;fC, acidification leads to an increased hydrate content of up to 0.5&#8201;% in aqueous solution.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formylcytosine is an important nucleobase in epigenetic regulation, whose hydrate form has been implicated in the formation of 5&#8208;carboxycytosine as well as oligonucleotide binding events. The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has now been quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. Small amounts of hydrate can be identified for the protonated form of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and for neutral 5&#8208;formyluracil. For neutral 5&#8208;formylcytosine, however, direct detection of the hydrate was not possible due to its very low abundance. This is in full agreement with theoretical estimates.

         <title>Glyco&#8208;Steroidal Amphiphiles (GSAs) for Membrane Protein Structural Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthetically accessible glyco&#8208;diosgenin (GDN) variants were developed. Some of these agents confer enhanced membrane protein stability compared to DDM (n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;maltoside) and the original GDN.







Abstract
Integral membrane proteins pose considerable challenges to high resolution structural analysis. Maintaining membrane proteins in their native state during protein isolation is essential for structural study of these bio&#8208;macromolecules. Detergents are the most commonly used amphiphilic compounds for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution outside a lipid bilayer. We previously introduced a glyco&#8208;diosgenin (GDN) detergent that was shown to be highly effective at stabilizing a wide range of membrane proteins. This steroidal detergent has additionally gained attention due to its compatibility with membrane protein structure study via cryo&#8208;EM. However, synthetic inconvenience limits widespread use of GDN in membrane protein study. To improve its synthetic accessibility and to further enhance detergent efficacy for protein stabilization, we designed a new class of glyco&#8208;steroid&#8208;based detergents using three steroid units: cholestanol, cholesterol and diosgenin. These new detergents were efficiently prepared and showed marked efficacy for protein stabilization in evaluation with a few model membrane proteins including two G protein&#8208;coupled receptors. Some new agents were not only superior to a gold standard detergent, DDM (n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;maltoside), but were also more effective than the original GDN at preserving protein integrity long term. These agents represent valuable alternatives to GDN, and are likely to facilitate structural determination of challenging membrane proteins.

         <title>The Role of Spike Protein Mutations in the Infectious Power of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Variants: A Molecular Interaction Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>

New SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2&#8201;variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells.







Abstract
Specific S477N, N501Y, K417N, K417T, E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein in the wild type SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus have resulted, among others, in the following variants: B.1.160 (20A or EU2, first reported in continental Europe), B1.1.7 (&#945; or 20I501Y.V1, first reported in the United Kingdom), B.1.351 (&#946; or 20H/501Y.V2, first reported in South Africa), B.1.1.28.1 (&#947; or P.1 or 20J/501Y.V3, first reported in Brazil), and B.1.1.28.2 (&#950;, or P.2 or 20B/S484K, also first reported in Brazil). From the analysis of a set of bonding descriptors firmly rooted in the formalism of quantum mechanics, including Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO), Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and highly correlated energies within the Domain Based Local Pair Natural Orbital Coupled Cluster Method (DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)), and from a set of computed electronic spectral patterns with environmental effects, we show that the new variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells. This results in significantly improved initial virus&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;cell molecular recognition and attachment at the microscopic level, which trigger the infectious cycle.

         <title>Can Precision Electrophile Signaling Make a Meaningful and Lasting Impression in Drug Design?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medicinal chemists have uncovered that the incorporation of an electrophilic appendage into a non&#8208; covalent pharmacophore can confer important benefits, such as improved selectivity. Studies on electrophile signaling have shown that when a matched electrophile engages with its protein target, unexpected phenotypic responses can ensue. Such responses are above and beyond what has been typically reported for covalent pharmacophore&#8208;protein target interactions. So, can we blend these concepts together to make better drugs?







Abstract
For several years, drugs with reactive electrophilic appendages have been developed. These units typically confer prolonged residence time of the drugs on their protein targets, and may assist targeting shallow binding sites and/or improving the drug&#8211;protein target spectrum. Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.

Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cover Feature: Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones (ChemBioChem 7/2022)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right tool can do the trick: A novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis was identified using the computer&#8208;assisted prediction tool Tome, and two variants with altered active sites were constructed based on homology models. All new enzyme variants showed significantly increased thermostability compared with the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens to date. The enzyme variants showed different substrate specificities and different activities in the presence of a range of co&#8208;solvents. The most stable variant was then immobilized and used for continuous production of enantiopure benzoin. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;S. Rabe et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Application of Biocatalysis in the Preparation and Resolution of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adducts and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction is an important carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reaction in organic synthesis. A new stereogenic centre is created in this reaction and much effort has been invested over the years into finding methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman products. In this review, the contribution of biocatalysis towards achieving this goal is discussed.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction affords highly functionalised allylic alcohols containing a new stereogenic centre. These MBH adducts are very versatile and have been transformed into a large range of products, some of which have medicinal potential. Several examples of asymmetric syntheses of MBH adducts have been reported, although a generally applicable method remains to be developed. Biocatalytic approaches for the synthesis and enzymatic kinetic resolution of MBH adducts have been reported, and are discussed in detail in this review. Enzymes able to catalyse the asymmetric MBH reaction have been identified, but selectivity and efficiency have generally been low. Lipases, esterases and nitrile&#8208;converting enzymes have all been successfully applied in the resolution of MBH adducts, with excellent selectivity being realised in most cases.

         <title>Oligo Pools as an Affordable Source of Synthetic DNA for Cost&#8208;Effective Library Construction in Protein&#8208; and Metabolic Pathway Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of large variant libraries is critical for rational protein engineering, directed evolution, and protein de novo design, but is constrained by the relatively high cost of DNA synthesis. Here, we consolidate methods that allow using array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools as DNA input &#8211; a cheap but error&#8208;prone source of DNA.







Abstract
The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user&#8208;defined sequences (up to &#8764;350&#8197;bases in length) have emerged as a low&#8208;cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost &#8804;10&#8201;% (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next&#8208;generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence&#8208;function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de&#8208;novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.

         <title>Mammalian Chemical Genomics towards Identifying Targets and Elucidating Modes&#8208;of&#8208;Action of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 7, April 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical genomic screens using shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA libraries in mammalian cultured cells play central roles in identifying modes of action of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances of chemical genomic approaches in mammalian cultured cells to identify the molecular target, modes of action, and synthetic lethal pathways of compounds of interest, with a focus on recent examples including our results are discussed.







Abstract
The step of identifying target molecules and elucidating the mode of action of bioactive compounds is a major bottleneck for drug discovery from phenotypic screening. Genetic screening for genes that affect drug sensitivity or phenotypes of mammalian cultured cells is a powerful tool to obtain clues to their modes of action. Chemical genomic screening systems for comprehensively identifying such genes or genetic pathways have been established using shRNA libraries for RNA interference&#8208;mediated mRNA knockdown or sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene knockout. The combination of chemical genomic screening in mammalian cells with other approaches such as biochemical searches for target molecules, phenotypic profiling, and yeast genetics provides a systematic way to elucidate the mode of action by converging various pieces of information regarding target molecules, target pathways, and synthetic lethal pathways.

         <title>Broadening the scope of the Flavin&#8208;tag method by improving flavin incorporation and incorporating flavin analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for facile site&#8208;selective modifications of proteins are in high demand. We have recently shown that a flavin transferase can be used for site&#8208;specific covalent attachment of a chromo&#8208; and fluorogenic flavin (FMN) to any targeted protein. Although this Flavin&#8208;tag method resulted in efficient labeling of proteins  in vitro  , labelling in  E. coli  cells resulted in partial flavin incorporation. It was also restricted in the type of installed label with only type of flavin, FMN, being incorporated. Here, we report on an extension of the Flavin&#8208;tag method that addresses previous limitations. We demonstrate that coexpression of FAD synthetase improves the flavin incorporation efficiency, allowing complete flavin&#8208;labeling of a target protein in  E. coli  cells. Furthermore, we have found that various flavin derivatives and even a nicotinamide can be covalently attached to a target protein, rendering this method even more versatile and valuable.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Dynamics Support Electrostatic Interactions in the Active Site of Adenylate Kinase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AKE protein residues exerting the highest electric fields along the reactive bond are also the residues that visit the most conformations within the picosecond to microsecond timescale. This effect is further exacerbated by entropy&#8208;tuning mutations that otherwise leave the average protein structure unchanged.







Abstract
Electrostatic preorganization as well as structural and dynamic heterogeneity are often used to rationalize the remarkable catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, they are often presented as incompatible because the generation of permanent electrostatic effects implies that the protein structure remains rigid. Here, we use a metric, electric fields, that can treat electrostatic contributions and dynamics effects on equal footing, for a unique perspective on enzymatic catalysis. We find that the residues that contribute the most to electrostatic interactions with the substrate in the active site of Adenylate Kinase (our working example) are also the most flexible residues. Further, entropy&#8208;tuning mutations raise flexibility at the picosecond timescale where more conformations can be visited on short time periods, thereby softening the sharp heterogeneity normally visible at the microsecond timescale.

         <title>Trichoderma&#8208;Derived Pentapeptides from the Infected Nest Mycobiome of the Subterranean Termite Coptotermes testaceus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic opportunities from an infected termite nest: Isolation and structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy and MS/MS revealed a novel pentapeptide (FE011) and five derivatives produced by a strain of Trichoderma enriched in and isolated from an infected nest of the wood&#8208;feeding termite Coptotermes testaceus.







Abstract
Termites live in a dynamic environment where colony health is strongly influenced by surrounding microbes. However, little is known about the mycobiomes of lower termites and their nests, and how these change in response to disease. Here we compared the individual and nest mycobiomes of a healthy subterranean termite colony (Coptotermes testaceus) to one infected and ultimately eradicated by a fungal pathogen. We identified Trichoderma species in the materials of both nests, but they were also abundant in the infected termites. Methanolic extracts of Trichoderma sp. FHG000531, isolated from the infected nest, were screened for secondary metabolites by UHPLC&#8208;HR MS/MS&#8208;guided molecular networking. We identified many bioactive compounds with potential roles in the eradication of the infected colony, as well as a cluster of six unknown peptides. The novel peptide FE011 was isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The function of this novel peptide family as well as the role of Trichoderma species in dying termite colonies therefore requires further investigation.

         <title>Probing Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation Chemistries for the Construction of Homogeneous Synthetic Glycodendriproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous glycodendriproteins: A comparative reactive platform was designed via use of C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reactions (unprecedented for this family of glycoconjugates) and via triazoles (in two orientations), from recombinant proteins containing non&#8208;canonical amino acids (dehydroalanine, homoallylglycine, homopropargylglycine, and azidohomoalanine) that can give access to well&#8208;defined glycodendriproteins as synthetic functional mimics of N&#8208;linked glycoproteins.







Abstract
Methods that site&#8208;selectively attach multivalent carbohydrate moieties to proteins can be used to generate homogeneous glycodendriproteins as synthetic functional mimics of glycoproteins. Here, we study aspects of the scope and limitations of some common bioconjugation techniques that can give access to well&#8208;defined glycodendriproteins. A diverse reactive platform was designed via use of thiol&#8208;Michael&#8208;type additions, thiol&#8208;ene reactions, and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions from recombinant proteins containing the non&#8208;canonical amino acids dehydroalanine, homoallylglycine, homopropargylglycine, and azidohomoalanine.

         <title>Proteomic tools for the quantitative analysis of artificial peptide libraries: detection and characterization of target&#8208;amplified PD&#8208;1 inhibitors.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a quantitative proteomics data analysis pipeline which, coupled to protein&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DDC) experiments, enables the rapid discovery and direct characterization of protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) modulators. A low&#8208;affinity PD&#8208;1 binder was incubated with a library of &gt;100 D&#8208;peptides under thiol&#8208;exchange favoring conditions, in the presence of the target protein PD&#8208;1, and we determined the S&#8208;linked dimeric species that resulted amplified in the protein samples versus the controls. We chemically synthesized the target dimer candidates and validated them by thermophoresis binding and protein&#8208;protein interaction assays. The results provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for using this strategy in the high&#8208;throughput search of improved drug&#8208;like peptide binders that block therapeutically relevant protein&#8208;protein interactions.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The new variant of concern of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, namely Omicron, has triggered global fear recently. Till now, our knowledge of Omicron, particularly of how S glycoprotein mutations affect the infectivity of the virus and the severity of the infection, is far from complete. This hinders our ability to treat the disease and to predict the future state of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 threats to well&#8208;being and economic stability. Despite this, efforts have been being made to unveil the routes of transmission and the efficiency of existing vaccines in tackling Omicron. This article reviews the latest understanding of Omicron and the current status of the use of vaccines and drug for infection control. It is hoped that this article can offer insights into the development for more effective measures to tackle the pandemic.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of nicotinamide mononucleotide from xylose via coupling engineered Escherichia coli and a biocatalytic cascade</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has recently gained attention for nutritional supplement because it is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ). In this study, we develop NMN synthesis by coupling two modules. The first module is to culture E. coli MG1655 &#8710; tktA &#8710; tktB &#8710; ptsG to metabolize xylose to generate D &#8208;ribose in the medium. The supernatant containing D &#8208;ribose was applied in the second module which is composed of Ec RbsK&#8208; Ec PRPS&#8208; Cp NAMPT reaction to synthesize NMN, that requires additional enzymes of CHU0107 and Ec PPase to remove feedback inhibitors, ADP and pyrophosphate. The second module can be rapidly optimized by comparing NMN production determined by the cyanide assay. Finally, 10 mL optimal&#160;biocascade reaction generated NMN with good yield of 84% from 1 mM D &#8208;ribose supplied from the supernatant of E. coli MG1655 &#8710; tktA &#8710; tktB &#8710; ptsG . Our results can further guide researchers to metabolically engineer E. coli for NMN synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Derivatives of Natural Organocatalytic Cofactors and Artificial Organocatalytic Cofactors as Catalysts in Enzymes</title>

Organocatalysts meet proteins: Enzymatic activities by natural organocatalytic cofactors, non&#8208;natural derivatives of them and artificial cofactors are reviewed.







Abstract
Catalytically active non&#8208;metal cofactors in enzymes carry out a variety of different reactions. The efforts to develop derivatives of naturally occurring cofactors such as flavins or pyridoxal phosphate and the advances to design new, non&#8208;natural cofactors are reviewed here. We report the status quo for enzymes harboring organocatalysts as derivatives of natural cofactors or as artificial ones and their application in the asymmetric synthesis of various compounds.

         <title>Structural Properties Dictating Selective Optotracer Detection of Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optotracers are conformation&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer molecules that detect peptide&#8208; and carbohydrate&#8208;based biopolymers. In this study, we investigated the structural properties providing optimal detection of Staphylococcus aureus. We show that the chemical structure and photophysics of these molecules are key tunable characteristics in the development of optotracers for selective detection of bacterial species.







Abstract
Optotracers are conformation&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer molecules that detect peptide&#8208; and carbohydrate&#8208;based biopolymers. Their binding to bacterial cell walls allows selective detection and visualisation of Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus). Here, we investigated the structural properties providing optimal detection of S.&#8197;aureus. We quantified spectral shifts and fluorescence intensity in mixes of bacteria and optotracers, using automatic peak analysis, cross&#8208;correlation, and area&#8208;under&#8208;curve analysis. We found that the length of the conjugated backbone and the number of charged groups, but not their distribution, are important factors for selective detection of S.&#8197;aureus. The photophysical properties of optotracers were greatly improved by incorporating a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D)&#8208;type motif in the conjugated backbone. With significantly reduced background and binding&#8208;induced on&#8208;switch of fluorescence, these optotracers enabled real&#8208;time recordings of S.&#8197;aureus growth. Collectively, this demonstrates that chemical structure and photophysics are key tunable characteristics in the development of optotracers for selective detection of bacterial species.

         <title>Conformationally Constrained Sialyl Analogues as New Potential Binders of h&#8208;CD22</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The h&#8208;CD22 ability to regulate the immune system has made this receptor an attractive therapeutic target. Here we report the characterization of the binding epitopes and affinities of two synthetic analogues bound to h&#8208;CD22 together with the determination of tridimensional models of the protein&#8208;ligand complexes.







Abstract
Here, two conformationally constrained sialyl analogues were synthesized and characterized in their interaction with the inhibitory Siglec, human CD22 (h&#8208;CD22). An orthogonal approach, including biophysical assays (SPR and fluorescence), ligand&#8208;based NMR techniques, and molecular modelling, was employed to disentangle the interaction mechanisms at a molecular level. The results showed that the Sialyl&#8208;TnThr antigen analogue represents a promising scaffold for the design of novel h&#8208;CD22 inhibitors. Our findings also suggest that the introduction of a biphenyl moiety at position 9 of the sialic acid hampers canonical accommodation of the ligand in the protein binding pocket, even though the affinity with respect to the natural ligand is increased. Our results address the search for novel modifications of the Neu5Ac&#8208;&#945;(2&#8208;6)&#8208;Gal epitope, outline new insights for the design and synthesis of high&#8208;affinity h&#8208;CD22 ligands, and offer novel prospects for therapeutic intervention to prevent autoimmune diseases and B&#8208;cell malignancies.

         <title>Optimizing the Chemiluminescence of a Light&#8208;Producing Deoxyribozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Factors that affect the catalytic activity of Supernova, a light&#8208;producing deoxyribozyme recently discovered in our group, were investigated in this study. These experiments indicate that multiple zinc ions are required for function, suggesting a mechanistic link between Supernova and proteins that catalyze related reactions. They also made it possible to increase the rate enhancement of light production by &gt;1000&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Supernova is a chemiluminescent deoxyribozyme recently discovered in our group. It transfers the phosphate group from the 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate CDP&#8208;Star to its 5&#8242; hydroxyl group, which triggers a decomposition reaction and the production of light. Here we investigated the effects of reaction conditions on the ability of Supernova to generate a chemiluminescent signal (using a plate reader assay) and to phosphorylate itself (using a ligation assay). Our experiments indicate that multiple zinc ions are required for catalytic function, suggesting links between Supernova and protein enzymes that catalyze similar reactions. They also show how factors such as pH, potassium concentration, CDP&#8208;Star concentration, and DNA concentration affect the reaction. By combining information from different experiments, the rate enhancement of light production was increased by more than 1000&#8208;fold. These results should be useful for applications in which Supernova is used as a sensor.

         <title>The Complex Roles of Adenosine Triphosphate in Bioenergetics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the major roles of ATP is to modify protein structure through binding. Examples are motor proteins and ABC transporters. Other major roles are played by the ADP and Pi products of its hydrolysis.







Abstract
ATP is generally defined as the &#8220;energy currency&#8221; of the cell. Its phosphoanhydride P&#8722;O bonds are often considered to be &#8220;high energy&#8221; linkages that release free energy when broken, and its hydrolysis is described as &#8220;strongly exergonic&#8221;. However, breaking bonds cannot release energy and ATP hydrolysis in motor and active transport proteins is not &#8220;strongly exergonic&#8221;. So, the relevance of ATP resides elsewhere. As important as the nucleotide are the proteins that undergo functionally relevant conformational changes upon both ATP binding and release of ADP and inorganic phosphate. ATP phosphorylates proteins for signaling, active transport, and substrates in condensation reactions. The ensuing dephosphorylation has different consequences in each case. In signaling and active transport the phosphate group is hydrolyzed whereas in condensation reactions the phosphoryl fragment acts as a dehydrating agent. As it will be discussed in this article, ATP does much more than simply contribute free energy to biological processes.

         <title>Allosteric Probe Recognition Initiated Cascade Transcription Amplification for Sensitive Analysis of Exosomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive and specific exosome detection approach is established based on target recognition initiated cascade signal amplification. There are in total three procedures in the approach including: i) allosteric probe based specific recognition of target exosomes, ii) polymerase based chain extension and Nt&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BstNBI based chain liberation, and iii) generated spinach RNA sequences binding to DFHBI to produce enhanced fluorescence signal.







Abstract
Sensitive and accurate analysis of exosomes is important for many biological processes including as a biomarker for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we established a sensitive and specific exosome detection approach based on target recognition initiated cascade signal amplification. In this method, an allosteric probe was designed with a hairpin structure for specific recognition of the exosome followed by signal amplification. After the cascade signal amplification process, spinach RNA sequences bind to DFHBI ((Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;one) to produce enhanced fluorescence signal (approximate 2000 fold than that of inactive DFHBI). Compared with former proposed exosome detection techniques, this method exhibited a comparable detection range, but with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;design toolbox. Therefore, we believe that the proposed approach holds great potential for exosome based early diagnosis and prognosis of disease.

         <title>Claisen condensation reaction mediated pimelate biosynthesis via the reverse adipate&#8208;degradation pathway and its isoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pimelic acid is an important seven&#8208;carbon dicarboxylic acid, which is broadly applied in various fields. The industrial production of pimelic acid is mainly through chemical method, which is complicated and environment unfriendly. Herein, we found that pimelic acid could be biosynthesized by the reverse adipate&#8208;degradation pathway (RADP), a typical Claisen condensation reaction that could be applied to the arrangement of C&#8208;C bond. In order to strengthen the supply of glutaryl&#8208;CoA precursor, PA5530 protein was used to transport glutaric acid. Subsequently, we discovered that the enzymes in the BIOZ pathway was isoenzymes with the RADP. By combining the isoenzymes of the two pathways, the titer of pimelic acid reached 36.7 mg&#183;L &#8208;1 under the optimal combination, which was increased by 382.9% compared with the control strain B&#8208;3. It was also the highest titer of pimelic acid biosynthesized by Claisen condensation reaction, laying foundations for further pimelic acid and its derivatives production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The promise of personalized medicine for monogenic and complex polygenic diseases depends on the availability of strategies for targeted inhibition of disease&#8208;associated polymorphic protein variants. A large majority of disease&#8208;causing genetic alterations are non&#8208;synonymous single nucleotide genetic variations (nsSNVs). Yet a general strategy for inhibiting the expression of nsSNVs without editing the human genome is currently lacking. Here, we reveal that upon intracellular delivery of lipid conjugated point mutation&#8208;specific monoclonal antibodies, a target&#8208;specific knockdown of gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels is observed. By harnessing the phenomenon of  m  embrane  a  nchorage  i  ndu  c  ed (MAGIC) knock&#8208;down of epitope&#8208;containing protein targets, we reveal a novel approach for inhibiting the expression of amino acid&#8208;altering point mutations. This approach opens up a new opportunity for the therapeutic inhibition of undruggable protein variants as well as paves the way for interrogating the nsSNVs in the human genome.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) is a symmetrically substituted synthetic porphyrin whose properties can be readily modified, providing it with significant advantages over naturally occurring porphyrins. Herein, we report the first example of a stable complex between a native biomolecule, the haemoprotein HasA, and TPP as well as its derivatives. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of nine different HasA&#8208;TPP complexes were solved at high resolutions. HasA capturing TPP derivatives was also demonstrated to inhibit growth of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Mutant variants of HasA binding FeTPP were shown to possess a different mode of coordination, permitting the cyclopropanation of styrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibiting Erastin&#8208;Induced Ferroptotic Cell Death by Purine&#8208;Based Chelators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purine derivatives were synthesized and were explored for ferroptosis inhibition via iron chelation and showed effective iron chelation with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand&#8201;:&#8201;metal) stoichiometry. One compound (2) in particular showed better activity than the known iron chelator and ferroptosis inhibitor AS8351.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a cell death event caused by increased lipid peroxidation leading to iron&#8208;dependent oxidative stress and is associated with a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, ferroptosis inhibition has emerged as a novel strategy to target different pathologies. Here, we report the synthesis of two purine derivatives, 1 and 2, for iron chelation strategy and evaluate their potency to inhibit erastin&#8208;induced ferroptosis. Both compounds showed efficient iron chelation in solution as well as in cellular environment. The crystal structure of the purine derivatives with iron demonstrated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand to metal center) stoichiometry for iron and purine derivative complexation. The synthesized compounds also decrease the reactive oxygen species concentration in cell cultures. Compound 2 showed better potency towards the prevention of ferroptotic cell death as compared to commercially available iron chelator in the erastin&#8208;induced ferroptosis cell culture model. Such purine analogues are potential functional scaffolds for the development of target molecules for ferroptosis inhibition.

In recent years, ferroptosis inhibition has emerged as a novel strategy to target different pathologies. Here, we report the synthesis of two purine derivatives, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, for iron chelation strategy and evaluate their potency to inhibit erastin-induced ferroptosis. Both compounds showed efficient iron chelation in solution as well as in cellular environment. The crystal structure of the purine derivatives with iron demonstrated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand to metal center) stoichiometry for iron and purine derivative complexation. The synthesized compounds also decrease the reactive oxygen species concentration in cell cultures. Compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; showed better potency towards the prevention of ferroptotic cell death as compared to commercially available iron chelator in the erastin-induced ferroptosis cell culture model. Such purine analogues are potential functional scaffolds for the development of target molecules for ferroptosis inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Different Oligomeric States of the Tumor Suppressor p53 Show Identical Binding Behavior Towards the S100&#946; Homodimer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that is referred to as the &#8220;guardian of the genome&#8221; and plays an important role in cancer development. P53 is active as a homotetramer;the S100&#946; homodimer binds to the intrinsically disordered  C  &#8208;terminus of p53 affecting its transcriptional activity.The p53/S100&#946; complex is regarded as highly promising therapeutic target in cancer. It has been suggested that S100&#946; exerts its oncogenic effects by altering the p53 oligomeric state. Our aim was to study the structures and oligomerization behavior of different p53/S100&#946; complexes by ESI&#8208;MS, XL&#8208;MS, and SPR. Wild&#8208;type p53 and single amino acid variants, representing different oligomeric states of p53 were individually investigated regarding their binding behavior towards S100&#946;. The stoichiometry of the different p53/S100&#946; complexes were determined by ESI&#8208;MS showing that tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric p53 variants all bind to an S100&#946; dimer. In addition, XL&#8208;MS revealed the topologies of the p53/S100&#946; complexes to be independent of p53&#8217;s oligomeric state. With SPR, the thermodynamic parameters were determined for S100&#946; binding to tetrameric, dimeric or monomeric p53 variants. Our data prove that the S100&#946; homodimer binds to different oligomeric states of p53 irrespective of p53&#180;s oligomerization state and similar binding affinities were observed. This emphasizes the need for alternative explanations to describe the molecular mechanisms underlying p53/S100&#946; interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable DNA&#8208;Based Peroxidases Controlled by a Chaotropic Ion**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaotropic anion perchlorate selectively destabilizes guanine&#8208;rich double stranded DNA, allowing it to form a G&#8208;quadruplex that can complex with hemin, forming a peroxidase DNAzyme. This affords a pH&#8208; and ATP&#8208;independent means of switching DNA secondary structure and controlling electron&#8208;transfer reactions.







Abstract
Here we demonstrate a switchable DNA electron&#8208;transfer catalyst, enabled by selective destabilization of secondary structure by the denaturant, perchlorate. The system is comprised of two strands, one of which can be selectively switched between a G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex or single&#8208;stranded conformations. In the G&#8208;quadruplex state, it binds hemin, enabling peroxidase activity. This switching ability arises from our finding that perchlorate, a chaotropic Hofmeister ion, selectively destabilizes duplex over G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. By varying perchlorate concentration, we show that the DNA structure can be switched between states that do and do not catalyze electron&#8208;transfer catalysis. State switching can be achieved in three ways: thermally, by dilution, or by concentration.

         <title>Carving the Active Site of CYP153A7 Monooxygenase for Improving Terminal Hydroxylation of Medium&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make activation of C&#8208;H bond feasible: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) catalyze the terminal hydroxylation of fatty acids to form &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids. To date, available P450s for the terminal hydroxylation of fatty acids stalls at CYP153A subfamily members, which have the limitation of low activity and poor thermostability. We, therefore, adopted directed evolution to generate P450pyr mutants with higher catalytic efficiency toward medium&#8208;chain fatty acids. The results show that mutants toward C6&#8722;C12 fatty acids display improved analytical yields of &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids.







Abstract
The P450&#8208;mediated terminal hydroxylation of non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is a chemically challenging reaction. CYP153A7 monooxygenase, discovered in Sphingomonas sp. HXN200, belongs to the CYP153A subfamily and shows a pronounced terminal selectivity. Herein, we report the significantly improved terminal hydroxylation activity of CYP153A7 by redesign of the substrate binding pocket based on molecular docking of CYP153A7&#8722;C8:0 and sequence alignments. Some of the resultant single mutants were advantageous over the wild&#8208;type enzyme with higher reaction rates, achieving a complete conversion of n&#8208;octanoic acid (C8:0, 1&#8197;mM) in a shorter time period. Especially, a single&#8208;mutation variant, D258E, showed 3.8&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency than the wild type toward the terminal hydroxylation of medium&#8208;chain fatty acid C8:0 to the high value&#8208;added product 8&#8208;hydroxyoctanoic acid.

Multiplexing protein delivery: The cover illustrates the simultaneous delivery of up to four different synthetic proteins to live cells. This allowed us to study the differences in their localization and cellular functions during stress. This method is particularly useful for comparing uniquely modified proteins with organic fluorescent dyes. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Brik et&#8197;al.

         <title>Challenges of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) Variant and Its Lineages: A Global Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is continuously mutating and is regularly re&#8208;emerging. The recently emerged Omicron variant shows high rates of mutation at the spike protein and receptor binding domain regions. Because of these mutations, the Omicron variant has been noted to have the highest transmissibility among the previous SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants including the Delta variant. Given Omicron's high genetic variability, it demonstrates immune escape mechanisms that potentially negate vaccine protection and causes re&#8208;infections. Therefore, variant&#8208;specific monoclonal antibodies, drugs, and vaccines are required to counter the pandemic.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus has shown increased ability to mutate over the past two years, especially in the regions of the spike protein and receptor binding sites. Omicron (B.1.1.529) is the fifth variant of concern (VOC) after the emergence of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta VOCs of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This new variant has now circulated in 128 countries and according to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), these 128 countries have shared 650,657 Omicron genome sequences as of 26 January, 2022. In this article, we highlight the real challenges of Omicron and its different lineages.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Isolation and Characterization of High Purity Mammalian Melanin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative, chemoenzymatic process was developed to isolate eumelanin from mammalian tissues using a fluorescent and electron microscopic screen for guidance. This multi&#8208;step process enables quantitative isolation high purity melanin from mammalian tissue for structural studies as demonstrated by solid&#8208;state NMR analyses.







Abstract
Although melanin is one of the most ubiquitous polymers in living systems, our understanding of its molecular structure, biosynthesis and biophysical properties has been limited to only a small number of organisms other than humans. This is in part due to the difficulty associated with isolating pure melanin. While purification methods exist, they typically involve harsh treatments with strong acid/base conditions combined with elevated temperatures that can lead to the polymer backbone degradation. To be successful, a viable isolation method must deliver a selective, yet complete degradation of non&#8208;melanin biopolymers as well as remove small molecule metabolites that are not integrative to the melanin backbone. Here, we demonstrate the use of chemoenzymatic processing guided by fluorescent probes for the purification and isolation of native mammalian melanin without significant induction of chemical degradation. This multi&#8208;step purification&#8208;tracking methodology enables quantitative isolation of pure melanin from mammalian tissue for spectroscopic characterization.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Modulation of the Catalytic Properties of [2Fe&#8722;2S]&#8208;Dependent Dehydratases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme catalysis: In silico and in&#8197;vitro investigations enabled the elucidation of the role of important active site residues of the enzymes dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) and sugar acid&#8208;specific dehydratase (DHT), both belonging to the FeS cluster&#8208;dependent ilvD/EDD superfamily. We proposed a new classification for these enzymes, and we were able to alter their substrate preference, improving activities for non&#8208;natural substrates significantly.







Abstract
The FeS cluster&#8208;dependent dihydroxyacid dehydratases (DHADs) and sugar acid&#8208;specific dehydratases (DHTs) from the ilvD/EDD superfamily are key enzymes in the bioproduction of a wide variety of chemicals. We analyzed [2Fe&#8722;2S]&#8208;dependent dehydratases in silico and in&#8197;vitro, deduced functionally relevant sequence, structure, and activity relationships within the ilvD/EDD superfamily, and we propose a new classification based on their evolutionary relationships and substrate profiles. In silico simulations and analyses identified several key positions for specificity, which were experimentally investigated with site&#8208;directed and saturation mutagenesis. We thus increased the promiscuity of DHAD from Fontimonas thermophila (FtDHAD), showing &gt;10&#8208;fold improved activity toward D&#8208;gluconate, and shifted the substrate preference of DHT from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT) toward shorter sugar acids (recording a six&#8208;fold improved activity toward the non&#8208;natural substrate D&#8208;glycerate). The successful elucidation of the role of important active site residues of the ilvD/EDD superfamily will further guide developments of this important biocatalyst for industrial applications.

         <title>Chemical and Biological Tools for the Study of Voltage&#8208;Gated Sodium Channels in Electrogenesis and Nociception</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desire to understand the role of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in electrical signaling and pain perception has motivated the development of chemical and biological tools that target this protein class. Such advances are summarized in this account and future research opportunities are highlighted.







Abstract
The malfunction and misregulation of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels (NaVs) underlie in large part the electrical hyperexcitability characteristic of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. NaVs are responsible for the initiation and propagation of electrical impulses (action potentials) in cells. Tissue and nerve injury alter the expression and localization of multiple NaV isoforms, including NaV1.1, 1.3, and 1.6&#8211;1.9, resulting in aberrant action potential firing patterns. To better understand the role of NaV regulation, localization, and trafficking in electrogenesis and pain pathogenesis, a number of chemical and biological reagents for interrogating NaV function have been advanced. The development and application of such tools for understanding NaV physiology are the focus of this review.

         <title>Carbonate&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemical Tool for Uncovering Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) Activity Variations in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the established importance of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in drug metabolism, methods to monitor factors that influence CES1 activity are limited. Herein, we exploit the self&#8208;immolative properties of carbonates to generate a fluorescent chemical tool and use it to identify activity differences between CES1 sequence variants in live cells.







Abstract
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) plays a key role in the metabolism of endogenous biomolecules and xenobiotics including a variety of pharmaceuticals. Despite the established importance of CES1 in drug metabolism, methods to study factors that can vary CES1 activity are limited with only a few suitable for use in live cells. Herein, we report the development of FCP1, a new CES1 specific fluorescent probe with a unique carbonate substrate constructed from commercially available reagents. We show that FCP&#8208;1 can specifically report on endogenous CES1 activity with a robust fluorescence response in live HepG2 cells through studies with inhibitors and genetic knockdowns. Subsequently, we deployed FCP&#8208;1 to develop a live cell fluorescence microscopy&#8208;based approach to identify activity differences between CES1 isoforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of a fluorescent probe to measure the activity of CES1 sequence variants in live cells.

Synthesis of functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters using Chan's diene and modified Mukaiyama&#8208;aldol reaction conditions. Diastereoselective reduction to syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diols and saponification yielded the respective acids. All synthesized compounds were evaluated for their 5&#8208;lipoxygenase activity.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters and &#948;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy esters are characteristic structural motifs of statin&#8208;type natural products and drug candidates. Here, we describe the synthesis of functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities using Chan's diene and modified Mukaiyama&#8208;aldol reaction conditions. Diastereoselective reduction of &#948;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy esters afforded the respective syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diols, and saponification yielded the corresponding acids. All products were evaluated for their anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, which uncovered a surprising structure&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Specific Synthesis of Di&#8208;ubiquitin Probes Enabled by the Incorporation of Unnatural Amino Acid ThzK</title>

         <dc:description>
Unnatural amino acid replacement of designated Lys residues in ubiquitin facilitates the synthesis of linkage&#8208;specific di&#8208;ubiquitin probes that can capture enzymes for ubiquitin transfer and cleavage.







Abstract
Di&#8208;ubiquitin (diUB) conjugates of defined linkages are useful tools for probing the functions of UB ligases, UB&#8208;binding proteins and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in coding, decoding and editing the signals carried by the UB chains. Here we developed an efficient method for linkage&#8208;specific synthesis of diUB probes based on the incorporation of the unnatural amino acid (UAA) N&#1013;&#8208;L&#8208;thiaprolyl&#8208;L&#8208;Lys (L&#8208;ThzK) into UB for ligation with another UB at a defined Lys position. The diUB formed by the UAA&#8208;mediated ligation reaction has a G76C mutation on the side of donor UB for conjugation with E2 and E3 enzymes or undergoing dethiolation to generate a covalent trap for DUBs. The development of UAA mutagenesis for diUB synthesis provides an easy route for preparing linkage&#8208;specific UB&#8208;based probes to decipher the biological signals mediated by protein ubiquitination.

         <title>Strategies to Reduce the On&#8208;Target Platelet Toxicity of Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitors: PROTACs, SNIPERs and Prodrug&#8208;Based Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bcl&#8208;xL protein expression is essential for the survival of platelets, cancer, and senescence cells. Therefore, early&#8208;stage anticancer/senolytic Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs are plagued with on&#8208;target platelet toxicity. Initial attempts with synergistic combinations allowed researchers to reduce effective Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor dosage and related dose&#8208;dependent toxicity. As these designs presented occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology, approaches based on event&#8208;driven pharmacology (especially protein degradation approaches: PROTACs &amp; SNIPERs) gained significant interest. Also, some prodrug strategies have been developed, which are discussed in detail in this review.







Abstract
Apoptosis is a highly regulated cellular process. Aberration in apoptosis is a common characteristic of various disorders. Therefore, proteins involved in apoptosis are prime targets in multiple therapies. Bcl&#8208;xL is an antiapoptotic protein. Compared to other antiapoptotic proteins, the expression of Bcl&#8208;xL is common in solid tumors and, to an extent, in some leukemias and lymphomas. The overexpression of Bcl&#8208;xL is also linked to survival and chemoresistance in cancer and senescent cells. Therefore, Bcl&#8208;xL is a promising anticancer and senolytic target. Various nanomolar range Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitors have been developed. ABT&#8208;263 was successfully identified as a Bcl&#8208;xL/Bcl&#8208;2 dual inhibitor. But it failed in the clinical trial (phase&#8208;II) because of its on&#8208;target platelet toxicity, which also implies an essential role of Bcl&#8208;xL protein in the survival of human platelets. Classical Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs utilize occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology with typical shortcomings (such as dose&#8208;dependent off&#8208;target and on&#8208;target platelet toxicities). Hence, event&#8208;driven pharmacology&#8208;based approaches, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and SNIPERs (specific non&#8208;genetic IAP&#8208;based protein erasers) have been developed. The development of Bcl&#8208;xL based PROTACs was expected, as 600 E3&#8208;ligases are available in humans, while some (such as cereblon (CRBN), von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)) are relatively less expressed in platelets. Therefore, E3 ligase ligand&#8208;based Bcl&#8208;xL PROTACs (CRBN: XZ424, XZ739; VHL: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b) showed a significant improvement in platelet therapeutic index than their parent molecules (ABT&#8208;263: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b, XZ739, PZ15227; A1155463: XZ424). Other than their distinctive pharmacology, PROTACs are molecularly large, which limits their cell permeability and plays a role in improving their cell selectivity. We also discuss prodrug&#8208;based approaches, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ABBV&#8208;155), phosphate prodrugs (APG&#8208;1252), dendrimer conjugate (AZD0466), and glycosylated conjugates (Nav&#8208;Gal). Studies of in&#8208;vitro, in&#8208;vivo, structure&#8208;activity relationships, biophysical characterization, and status of preclinical/clinical inhibitors derived from these strategies are also discussed in the review.

         <title>A Major Shell Protein of 1,2&#8208;Propanediol Utilization Microcompartment Conserves the Activity of Its Signature Enzyme at Higher Temperatures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaperon&#8208;like behavior of the shell protein PduBB&#8217; towards the native enzyme PduCDE was studied. The shell protein PduBB&#8217; was found to interact with the enzyme PduCDE and protect it from temperature&#8208;induced denaturation. It also preserved its catalytic activity during thermal stress.







Abstract
A classic example of an all&#8208;protein natural nano&#8208;bioreactor, the bacterial microcompartment is a prokaryotic organelle that confines enzymes in a small volume enveloped by an outer protein shell. These protein compartments metabolize specific organic molecules, allowing bacteria to survive in restricted nutrient environments. In this work, 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilization microcompartment (PduMCP) was used as a model to study the effect of molecular confinement on the stability and catalytic activity of native enzymes in the microcompartment. A combination of enzyme assays, spectroscopic techniques, binding assays, and computational analysis were used to evaluate the impact of the major shell protein PduBB&#8242; on the stability and activity of PduMCP&#8242;s signature enzyme, dioldehydratase PduCDE. While free PduCDE shows &#8764;45&#8201;% reduction in its optimum activity (activity at 37&#8201;&#176;C) when exposed to a temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C, it retains similar activity up to 50&#8201;&#176;C when encapsulated within PduMCP. PduBB&#8242;, a major component of the outer shell of PduMCP, preserves the catalytic efficiency of PduCDE under thermal stress and prevents temperature&#8208;induced unfolding and aggregation of PduCDE in&#8197;vitro. We observed that while both PduB and PduB&#8242; interact with the enzyme with micromolar affinity, only the PduBB&#8242; combination influences its activity and stability, highlighting the importance of the unique PduBB&#8242; combination in the functioning of PduMCP.

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Mediated Enzyme Fragment Complementation Assay for Quantification of the Stability of Splice Isoforms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR&#8208;mediated enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay targeting exon 7 of the survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene was developed. The EFC assay is compatible with 384&#8208;well plates and robustly quantified the splicing modulation activity of small molecules.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule splicing modulators exemplified by an FDA&#8208;approved drug, risdiplam, are a new pharmacological modality for regulating the expression and stability of splice isoforms. We report a CRISPR&#8208;mediated enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay to quantify the splice isoform stability. The EFC assay harnessed a 42 amino acid split of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (designate &#945;&#8208;tag), which could be fused at the termini of the target genes using CRISPR/cas9. The &#945;&#8208;tagged splice isoform would be quantified by measuring the enzymatic activity upon complementation with the rest of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This EFC assay retained all the sequences of introns and exons of the target gene in the native genomic environment that recapitulates the cell biology of the diseases of interest. For a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;mediated EFC assay targeting the exon 7 of the survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene. The EFC assay is compatible with 384&#8208;well plates and robustly quantified the splicing modulation activity of small molecules. In this study, we also discovered that a coumarin derivative, compound 4, potently modulated SMN2 exon 7 splicing at as low as 1.1&#8197;nM.

         <title>Multiplexed Delivery of Synthetic (Un)Conjugatable Ubiquitin and SUMO2 Enables Simultaneous Monitoring of Their Localization and Function in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live cell imaging of post&#8208;translationally modified proteins is key to understanding their involvement in both healthy and disease states. We report multiplexed bead loading (MBL) for the simultaneous delivery of several synthetic proteins to the same cells. Using MBL, we reveal unknown involvements of ubiquitin and SUMO2 in lysosomes.







Abstract
Ubiquitin (Ub) and its related small Ub like modifier (SUMO) are among the most influential protein post&#8208;translational modifications in eukaryotes. Unfortunately, visualizing these modifications in live cells is a challenging task. Chemical protein synthesis offers great opportunities in studying and further understanding Ub and SUMO biology. Nevertheless, the low cell permeability of proteins limits these studies mainly for in&#8197;vitro applications. Here, we introduce a multiplexed protein cell delivery approach, termed MBL (multiplexed bead loading), for simultaneous loading of up to four differentially labeled proteins with organic fluorophores. We applied MBL to visualize ubiquitination and SUMOylation events in live and untransfected cells without fluorescent protein tags or perturbation to their endogenous levels. Our study reveals unprecedented involvements of Ub and SUMO2 in lysosomes depending on conjugation states. We envision that this approach will improve our understanding of dynamic cellular processes such as formation and disassembly of membraneless organelles.

         <title>Host&#8208;Assisted Delivery of a Model Drug to Genomic DNA: Key Information from Ultrafast Spectroscopy and in silico Study</title>

Delivery of Toluidine Blue (TB) to DNA in the form of TB&#8208;surfactant ionic pair occurs in the pre&#8208;micellar stage of the surfactant, in contrast to the no transfer of TB molecules to DNA in the micellar stage.







Abstract
Drug delivery to a target without adverse effects is one of the major criteria for clinical use. Herein, we have made an attempt to explore the delivery efficacy of SDS surfactant in a monomer and micellar stage during the delivery of the model drug, Toluidine Blue (TB) from the micellar cavity to DNA. Molecular recognition of pre&#8208;micellar SDS encapsulated TB with DNA occurs at a rate constant of k1 &#8764;652&#8197;s&#8722;1. However, no significant release of encapsulated TB at micellar concentration was observed within the experimental time frame. This originated from the higher binding affinity of TB towards the nano&#8208;cavity of SDS at micellar concentration which does not allow the delivery of TB from the nano&#8208;cavity of SDS micelles to DNA. Thus, molecular recognition controls the extent of DNA recognition by TB which in turn modulates the rate of delivery of TB from SDS in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Porphyrin in Prebiotic Catalysis: Ascertaining a Route for the Emergence of Early Metalloporphyrins**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putative pathway for the emergence of primitive metalloporphyrins: We studied the influence of the porphyrin scaffold tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS), on the modulation of metal ion&#8208;mediated oxidation. We show that TPPS can modulate metal ion oxidizing activity by forming metal&#8208;coordinated complexes or non&#8208;coordinated aggregates. We also show the formation of metal&#8208;TPPS coordinated complexes under prebiotic settings, highlighting their potential role as primitive catalysts.







Abstract
Metal ions are known to catalyze certain prebiotic reactions. However, the transition from metal ions to extant metalloenzymes remains unclear. Porphyrins are found ubiquitously in the catalytic core of many ancient metalloenzymes. In this study, we evaluated the influence of porphyrin&#8208;based organic scaffold, on the catalysis, emergence and putative molecular evolution of prebiotic metalloporphyrins. We studied the effect of porphyrins on the transition metal ion&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ). We report a change in the catalytic activity of the metal ions in the presence of porphyrin. This was observed to be facilitated by the coordination between metal ions and porphyrins or by the formation of non&#8208;coordinated complexes. The metal&#8208;porphyrin complexes also oxidized NADH, underscoring its versatility at oxidizing more than one substrate. Our study highlights the selective advantage that some of the metal ions would have had in the presence of porphyrin, underscoring their role in shaping the evolution of protometalloenzymes.

         <title>Fermentative Production of Halogenated Tryptophan Derivatives with Corynebacterium glutamicum Overexpressing Tryptophanase or Decarboxylase Genes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tryptophan overproducing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain was metabolically engineered to produce 7&#8208;Br/Cl&#8208;indole and 7&#8208;Br/Cl&#8208;tryptamine. For this purpose, tryptophanases and aromatic l&#8208;amino acid decarboxylases from different origins were screened and utilized in combination with halogenase RebH. Fermentative production of 7&#8208;Br&#8208;tryptamine in a bioreactor resulted in a product titer of 0.36&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
The aromatic amino acid l&#8208;tryptophan serves as a precursor for many valuable compounds such as neuromodulators, indoleamines and indole alkaloids. In this work, tryptophan biosynthesis was extended by halogenation followed by decarboxylation to the respective tryptamines or cleavage to the respective indoles. Either the tryptophanase genes tnaAs from E. coli and Proteus vulgaris or the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase genes AADCs from Bacillus atrophaeus, Clostridium sporogenes, and Ruminococcus gnavus were expressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum strains producing (halogenated) tryptophan. Regarding indoles, final titers of 16&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Cl&#8208;indole and 23&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;indole were attained. Tryptamine production led to a much higher titer of 2.26&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 upon expression of AADC from B. atrophaeus. AADC enzymes were shown to be active with halogenated tryptophan in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo and supported production of 0.36&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;tryptamine with a volumetric productivity of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a fed&#8208;batch fermentation.

Either the tryptophanase genes &lt;i&gt;tnaAs&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Proteus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; or the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase genes &lt;i&gt;AADCs&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus atrophaeus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clostridium sporogenes&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcus gnavus&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterium glutamicum&lt;/i&gt; strains producing (halogenated) tryptophan. Regarding indoles, final titers of 16&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; 7-Cl-indole and 23&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; 7-Br-indole were attained. Tryptamine production led to a much higher titer of 2.26&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; upon expression of &lt;i&gt;AADC&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;B. atrophaeus&lt;/i&gt;. AADC enzymes were shown to be active with halogenated tryptophan &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; and supported production of 0.36&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; 7-Br-tryptamine with a volumetric productivity of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a fed-batch fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of the Fluorescent, Cyclic Dinucleotides cthGAMP</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP is an essential second messenger for the innate immune system of mammals. The organic synthesis of an intrinsically fluorescent mimic provided large quantities for cell feeding studies, examination of biological activity and two&#8208;photon excitation microscopy.







Abstract
The cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is known for its role in sensing cytosolic DNA introduced by a viral infection, bacterial invasion or tumorigenesis. Free DNA is recognized by the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS) catalyzing the production of 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP) in mammals. This cyclic dinucleotide acts as a second messenger, activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) that finally triggers the transcription of interferon genes and inflammatory cytokines. Due to the therapeutic potential of this pathway, both the production and the detection of cGAMP via fluorescent moieties for assay development is of great importance. Here, we introduce the paralleled synthetic access to the intrinsically fluorescent, cyclic dinucleotides 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP and 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP based on phosphoramidite and phosphate chemistry, adaptable for large scale synthesis. We examine their binding properties to murine and human STING and confirm biological activity including interferon induction by 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP in THP&#8208;1 monocytes. Two&#8208;photon imaging revealed successful cellular uptake of 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP in THP&#8208;1 cells.

         <title>Selective Display of a Chemoattractant Agonist on Cancer Cells Activates the Formyl Peptide Receptor 1&#8201;on Immune Cells**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional immune&#8208;engaging agents that exploit the inherent acidic microenvironment of most solid tumors were developed to selectively graft the surface of cancer cells with a formyl peptide receptor ligand (FPRL). We established that selectively remodeling cancer cells with such peptides activates formyl peptide receptors on recruited immune cells, potentially initiating an immune response towards tumors.







Abstract
Current immunotherapeutics often work by directing components of the immune system to recognize biomarkers on the surface of cancer cells to generate an immune response. However, variable changes in biomarker distribution and expression can result in inconsistent patient response. The development of a more universal tumor&#8208;homing strategy has the potential to improve selectivity and extend therapy to cancers with decreased expression or absence of specific biomarkers. Here, we designed a bifunctional agent that exploits the inherent acidic microenvironment of most solid tumors to selectively graft the surface of cancer cells with a formyl peptide receptor ligand (FPRL). Our approach is based on the pH(Low) insertion peptide (pHLIP), a unique peptide that selectively targets tumors in&#8197;vivo by anchoring to cancer cells in a pH&#8208;dependent manner. We establish that selectively remodeling cancer cells with a pHLIP&#8208;based FPRL activates formyl peptide receptors on recruited immune cells, potentially initiating an immune response towards tumors.

         <title>Structure Optimization of the Toxic Conformation Model of Amyloid &#946;42 by Intramolecular Disulfide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformation&#8208;restricted analogues of amyloid &#946;42 (1&#8211;6) with an intramolecular disulfide bridge exist in an oligomeric state (250&#8211;800&#8197;kDa) in a cell culture medium. Nevertheless, only 1&#8211;3 with a Cys&#8208;Cys or homoCys&#8208;Cys bridge at positions 17/28 exhibit potent cytotoxicity against SH&#8208;SY5Y and THP&#8208;1 cells, suggesting that the formation of oligomers is not a necessary and sufficient condition to induce cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers play a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, we reported that a conformation&#8208;restricted A&#946;42 with an intramolecular disulfide bond through cysteine residues at positions 17/28 formed stable oligomers with potent cytotoxicity. To further optimize this compound as a toxic conformer model, we synthesized three analogues with a combination of cysteine and homocysteine at positions 17/28. The analogues with Cys&#8208;Cys, Cys&#8208;homoCys, or homoCys&#8208;Cys, but not the homoCys&#8208;homoCys analogue, exhibited potent cytotoxicity against SH&#8208;SY5Y and THP&#8208;1 cells even at 10&#8197;nM. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of conformation&#8208;restricted analogues at positions 16/29 or 18/27 was significantly weaker than that of wild&#8208;type A&#946;42. Furthermore, thioflavin&#8208;T assay, non&#8208;denaturing gel electrophoresis, and morphological studies suggested that the majority of these conformation&#8208;restricted analogues exists in an oligomeric state in cell culture medium, indicating that the toxic conformation of A&#946;42, rather than the oligomeric state, is essential to induce cytotoxicity.

         <title>Stereoselective Biocatalyzed Reductions of Ginger Active Components Recovered from Industrial Wastes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ginger active constituents have been successfully recovered from industrial waste biomasses of fermented ginger and converted into the corresponding diols and alcohols by stereoselective biocatalyzed reductions.







Abstract
Ginger is among the most widespread and widely consumed traditional medicinal plants around the world. Its beneficial effects, which comprise e.&#8201;g. anticancer and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities as well as gastrointestinal regulatory effects, are generally attributed to a family of non&#8208;volatile compounds characterized by an arylalkyl long&#8208;chained alcohol, diol, or ketone moiety. In this work, ginger active components have been successfully recovered from industrial waste biomass of fermented ginger. Moreover, their recovery has been combined with the first systematic study of the stereoselective reduction of gingerol&#8208;like compounds by isolated alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), obtaining the enantioenriched sec&#8208;alcohol derivatives via a sustainable biocatalytic path in up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversions and &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric/diastereomeric excesses.

         <title>Principles of Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Nucleotide Interactions Revealed by Binding Affinities between Homogeneous Oligopeptides and Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbead&#8208;based flow cytometry method (FCM) was used to perform the binding affinity measurements for octapeptides&#8208;ssDNA. Comparative analyses of the binding energies reveal unique binding strength patterns assignable to each pair of ssDNA and octapeptide. Amino&#8208;acid&#8208;nucleotide interactions can be categorized in three levels of binding strength: strong, intermediate, and weak, separated by apparent gaps in binding energies.







Abstract
We have determined the binding strengths between nucleotides of adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine in homogeneous single stranded DNAs and homo&#8208;octapeptides consisting of 20 common amino acids. We use a bead&#8208;based fluorescence assay for these measurements in which octapeptides are immobilized on the bead surface and ssDNAs are in solutions. Comparative analyses of the distribution of the binding energies reveal unique binding strength patterns assignable to each DNA nucleotide and amino acid originating from the chemical structures. Pronounced favorable (such as Arg&#8208;G, etc.) and unfavorable (such as Ile&#8208;T, etc.) binding interactions can be identified in selected groups of amino acid and nucleotide pairs that could provide basis to elucidate energetics of amino&#8208;acid&#8208;nucleotide interactions. Such interaction selectivity, specificity and polymorphism establish the contributions from DNA backbone, DNA bases, as well as main chain and side chain of the amino acids.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Divergent Enzyme Cascades to Convert Racemic 4&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Butanol into either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;Corresponding Chiral Amine</title>

A one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade has been developed for the cell&#8208;free conversion of racemic secondary alcohols to either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiopure chiral amines, with in&#8208;situ recycling of NAD(P)+ cofactors. This biocatalytic system was successfully applied to the amination reaction of racemic 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol to yield the high value (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the amine reaching good (73&#8201;% (S)) and excellent (&gt;99&#8201;% (R)) enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiopure chiral amines from racemic alcohols is a key transformation in the chemical industry, e.&#8201;g., in the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, this reaction remains challenging. In this work, we propose a one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade for the direct conversion of a racemic alcohol into either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the corresponding amine, with in&#8208;situ cofactor recycling. This enzymatic cascade consists of two enantio&#8208;complementary alcohol dehydrogenases, both NADH and NADPH oxidase for in&#8208;situ recycling of NAD(P)+ cofactors, and either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantioselective transaminase. This cell&#8208;free biocatalytic system has been successfully applied to the conversion of racemic 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol into the high value (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the amine reaching good (73&#8201;% (S)) and excellent (&gt;99&#8201;% (R)) enantioselectivities.

         <title>Impact of bPNA Backbone Structural Constraints and Composition on Triplex Hybridization with DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone constraints and amino acid composition of bPNAs exert subtle effects on triplex hybridization with DNA. Design elements that limit backbone conformation favor hybridization, but conservative amino acid mutations can also have a significant effect on hybrid stability.







Abstract
We report herein a study on the impact of bifacial peptide nucleic acid (bPNA) amino acid composition and backbone modification on DNA binding. A series of bPNA backbone variants with identical net charge were synthesized to display either 4 or 6 melamine (M) bases. These bases form thymine&#8208;melamine&#8208;thymine (TMT) base&#8208;triples, resulting in triplex hybrid stem structures with T&#8208;rich DNAs. Analyses of 6&#8197;M bPNA&#8208;DNA hybrids suggested that hybrid stability was linked to amino acid secondary structure propensities, prompting a more detailed study in shorter 4&#8197;M bPNAs. We synthesized 4&#8197;M bPNAs predisposed to adopt helical secondary structure via helix&#8208;turn nucleation in 7&#8208;residue bPNAs using double&#8208;click covalent stapling. Generally, hybrid stability improved upon stapling, but amino acid composition had a more significant effect. We also pursued an alternative strategy for bPNA structural preorganization by incorporation of residues with strong backbone amide conformational preferences such as 4R&#8208; and 4S&#8208;fluoroprolines. Notably, these derivatives exhibited an additional improvement in hybrid stability beyond both unsubstituted proline bPNA analogues and the helically patterned bPNAs. Overall, these findings demonstrate the tunability of bPNA&#8208;DNA hybrid stability through bPNA backbone structural propensities and amino acid composition.

         <title>Superior Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Gold Nanorattles in Ultrasensitive H2O2 Sensing and Antioxidant Screening</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxidase&#8208;like activity of gold nanorattles was evaluated and was found to have better efficiency compared to that of solid gold nanocubes and nanospheres. Thus, they were able to sense hydrogen peroxide down to a few micromolar concentrations. These nanorattles were further used to screen antioxidants or determine antioxidant potential.







Abstract
Nanozymes are artificial enzyme systems which are easy to produce, highly stable and cost&#8208;effective in comparison to natural enzymes. Herein, we evaluated the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of gold nanorattles (Au NRTs) having a solid gold octahedron core and thin, porous cubic gold shell. We also prepared solid gold nanocubes and nanospheres of similar sizes and surface charge as that of Au NRTs and compared their activity with standard horse radish peroxidase (HRP). All the prepared nanostructures followed Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics as observed from their substrate concentration vs. initial reaction velocity plot using 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate. The kinetic parameters and the catalytic efficiency for the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the nanostructures and HRP were calculated, and it was observed that Au NRTs possess the best nanozymatic activity with lowest KM and highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). The better activity of Au NRTs compared with other nanostructures and HRP could be attributed to the hollow porous structure with a solid core where different surfaces are available for reaction. Au NRTs, being the best amongst the tested nanozymes were further used for the sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and were found to sense H2O2 down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M. Further, two naturally occurring antioxidants, tannic acid and ascorbic acid showed inhibitory effect on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Au NRTs in a concentration dependent manner which can be further used for screening of antioxidants or for determining the antioxidant potential.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Step Enzymatic Cascade for Efficient Production of L&#8208;Phenylglycine from Biobased L&#8208;Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise four&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for L&#8208;phenylglycine synthesis from biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine was devised. Forty millimolar L&#8208;phenylalanine afforded the synthesis of 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L&#8208;phenylglycine, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion.







Abstract
Enantiopure amino acids are of particular interest in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for efficient production of L&#8208;phenylglycine (L&#8208;Phg) from biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine (L&#8208;Phe). We first attempted to engineer Escherichia coli for expressing L&#8208;amino acid deaminase (LAAD) from Proteus mirabilis, hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from Amycolatopsis orientalis, (S)&#8208;mandelate dehydrogenase (SMDH) from Pseudomonas putida, the endogenous aminotransferase (AT) encoded by ilvE and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) from E. coli. However, 10&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phe only afforded the synthesis of 7.21&#177;0.15&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phg. The accumulation of benzoylformic acid suggested that the transamination step might be rate&#8208;limiting. We next used leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) from Bacillus cereus to bypass the use of L&#8208;glutamate as amine donor, and 40&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phe gave 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L&#8208;Phg, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion. In summary, this work demonstrates a concise four&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for L&#8208;Phg synthesis from biobased L&#8208;Phe, with a potential for future industrial applications.

     alt="A Four-Step Enzymatic Cascade for Efficient Production of L-Phenylglycine from Biobased L-Phenylalanine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A concise four-step&lt;/b&gt; enzymatic cascade for L-phenylglycine synthesis from biobased L-phenylalanine was devised. Forty millimolar L-phenylalanine afforded the synthesis of 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L-phenylglycine, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantiopure amino acids are of particular interest in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we report a multi-enzyme cascade for efficient production of L-phenylglycine (L-Phg) from biobased L-phenylalanine (L-Phe). We first attempted to engineer &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; for expressing L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD) from &lt;i&gt;Proteus mirabilis&lt;/i&gt;, hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from &lt;i&gt;Amycolatopsis orientalis&lt;/i&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-mandelate dehydrogenase (SMDH) from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt;, the endogenous aminotransferase (AT) encoded by &lt;i&gt;ilvE&lt;/i&gt; and L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. However, 10&#8197;mM L-Phe only afforded the synthesis of 7.21&#177;0.15&#8197;mM L-Phg. The accumulation of benzoylformic acid suggested that the transamination step might be rate-limiting. We next used leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; to bypass the use of L-glutamate as amine donor, and 40&#8197;mM L-Phe gave 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L-Phg, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion. In summary, this work demonstrates a concise four-step enzymatic cascade for L-Phg synthesis from biobased L-Phe, with a potential for future industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Opportunities for Expanding Encoded Chemical Diversification and Improving Hit Enrichment in mRNA&#8208;Displayed Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA&#8208;displayed libraries of peptides and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries of small molecules are compared and contrasted in this review with a focus on diversification reactions and selection approaches where the former can learn from developments in the latter. We conclude by outlining a path towards approaches that may offer discovery of hybrid small&#8208;molecule peptidomimetics.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded small&#8208;molecule libraries and mRNA displayed peptide libraries both use numerically large pools of oligonucleotide&#8208;tagged molecules to identify potential hits for protein targets. They differ dramatically, however, in the &#8216;drug&#8208;likeness&#8217; of the molecules that each can be used to discover. We give here an overview of the two techniques, comparing some advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest areas where particularly mRNA display can benefit from adopting advances developed with DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We outline cases where chemical modification of the peptide library has already been used in mRNA display, and survey opportunities to expand this using examples from DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We also propose potential opportunities for encoding such reactions within the mRNA/cDNA tag of an mRNA&#8208;displayed peptide library to allow a more diversity&#8208;oriented approach to library modification. Finally, we outline alternate approaches for enriching target&#8208;binding hits from a pooled and tagged library, and close by detailing several examples of how an adjusted mRNA&#8208;display based approach could be used to discover new &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; modified small peptides.

         <title>Spectroscopic and in&#8197;vitro Investigations of Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Nucleic Acid Repair and Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinorganic perspective on the AlkB as well as the TET enzyme families, Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases involved in nucleic acid repair and processing, and epigenetic gene regulation is presented in this review. Important spectroscopic techniques which can be useful for in&#8197;vitro examination of the structure and formation of those proteins and their active site, of the interaction with their substrates, as well as of mechanistic details are discussed together with their advantages and limitations.







Abstract
The activation of molecular oxygen for the highly selective functionalization and repair of DNA and RNA nucleobases is achieved by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/iron&#8208;dependent dioxygenases. Of special interest are the human homologues AlkBH of Escherichia coli EcAlkB and ten&#8208;eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in demethylation or dealkylation of DNA and RNA, although additional physiological functions are continuously being found. Given their importance, studying enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions, turnover and kinetic parameters is pivotal for the understanding of the mode of action of these enzymes. Diverse analytical methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been employed to study the changes in the active site and the overall enzyme structure upon substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor addition. Several methods are now available to assess the activity of these enzymes. By discussing limitations and possibilities of these techniques for EcAlkB, AlkBH and TET we aim to give a comprehensive synopsis from a bioinorganic point&#8208;of&#8208;view, addressing researchers from different disciplines working in the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field of epigenetic processes and DNA/RNA repair and modification.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs): Promising Biocatalysts for the Environmentally Friendly Production of Aroma Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are promising biocatalysts that catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids to produce (one carbon&#8208;shortened) fatty aldehydes, which are used as flavors and fragrances. This comprehensive review summarizes the recent advances in the biotechnological utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with focus on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs together with analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity.







Abstract
Fatty aldehydes (FALs) can be derived from fatty acids (FAs) and related compounds and are frequently used as flavors and fragrances. Although chemical methods have been conventionally used, their selective biotechnological production aiming at more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly synthetic routes is in demand. &#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are heme&#8208;dependent oxidative enzymes biologically involved in the initial step of plant FA &#945;&#8208;oxidation during which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the C&#945;&#8208;position of a FA (Cn) to generate the intermediate FA hydroperoxide, which is subsequently converted into the shortened corresponding FAL (Cn&#8208;1). &#945;&#8208;DOXs are promising biocatalysts for the flavor and fragrance industries, they do not require NAD(P)H as cofactors or redox partner proteins, and they have a broad substrate scope. Here, we highlight recent advances in the biocatalytic utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with emphasis on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs as well as analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Dual Activities of Oxidation and Oxidative Decarboxylation by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual functions by a single active site are found in flavoenzyme oxidases. This is the first review to discuss and compare the reaction mechanisms of flavoenzymes catalyzing both oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation of l&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid. Recurrent features and factor controlling oxidative decarboxylation are proposed.







Abstract
Specific flavoenzyme oxidases catalyze oxidative decarboxylation in addition to their classical oxidation reactions in the same active sites. The mechanisms underlying oxidative decarboxylation by these enzymes and how they control their two activities are not clearly known. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of four enzymes from the l&#8208;amino acid oxidase and l&#8208;hydroxy acid oxidase families, including l&#8208;tryptophan 2&#8208;monooxygenase, l&#8208;phenylalanine 2&#8208;oxidase and l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase and lactate monooxygenase which catalyze substrate oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation. Apart from specific interactions to allow substrate oxidation by the flavin cofactor, specific binding of oxidized product in the active sites appears to be important for enabling subsequent decarboxylation by these enzymes. Based on recent findings of l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase, we propose that nucleophilic attack of H2O2 on the imino acid product is the mechanism enabling oxidative decarboxylation.

         <title>Strategies for Interference of Insulin Fibrillogenesis: Challenges and Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite of the fact that the world is celebrating the 100th year of the discovery of insulin, advancement in the domain of insulin stabilization remains unsaturated. An efficient, simpler, and an economically favorable solution is always welcome. This review will be useful for a broad range of researchers working in the development of aggregation&#8208;free insulin formulations or insulin analogues.







Abstract
The discovery of insulin came with very high hopes for diabetic patients. In 2021, the world celebrated the 100th anniversary of the discovery of this vital hormone. However, external use of insulin is highly affected by its aggregating tendency that occurs during its manufacturing, transportation, and improper handling which ultimately leads to its pharmaceutically and biologically ineffective form. In this review, we aim to discuss the various approaches used for decelerating insulin aggregation which results in the enhancement of its overall structural stability and usage. The approaches that are discussed are broadly classified as either a measure through excipient additions or by intrinsic modifications in the insulin native structure.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic description of Pdx2 catalytic mechanism is provided by QM/MM methodologies. Pdx2, the glutaminase subunit of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) synthase, is characterized by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad used to deaminate glutamine to glutamate. While being absent in humans, Pdx2 is essential for the development and replication of the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogens, which are responsible for two deadly diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, respectively. Pdx2 is thus a promising drug target for fighting these diseases. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;F. Pina et&#8197;al.

         <title>Oxidative Stress in Cancer Therapy: Friend or Enemy?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative stress and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells is described in this review, followed by discussion of the therapeutic strategies focused on ROS levels for cancer therapy. Clinically approved drugs with oxidative stress anticancer mechanisms of action are described and examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates with such mechanisms of action are highlighted.







Abstract
Excessive cellular oxidative stress is widely perceived as a key factor in pathophysiological conditions and cancer development. Healthy cells use several mechanisms to maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overall redox homeostasis to avoid damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Cancer cells, in contrast, exhibit elevated ROS levels and upregulated protective antioxidant pathways. Counterintuitively, such elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defence mechanisms in cancer cells provide a therapeutic opportunity for the development of drugs with different anticancer mechanisms of action (MoA). In this review, oxidative stress and the role of ROS in cells are described. The tumour&#8208;suppressive and tumour&#8208;promotive functions of ROS are discussed, and these two different therapeutic strategies (increasing or decreasing ROS to fight cancer) are compared. Clinically approved drugs with demonstrated oxidative stress anticancer MoAs are highlighted followed by description of examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates causing oxidative stress in cancer cells via novel MoAs.

         <title>Biocatalytic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Promising Materials for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous networks and attractive functions have been intelligently employed as supports to encase enzymes and protect them against harsh environments. More importantly, customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative guideline for constructing robust enzyme mimics. This review will introduce the concept of these biocatalytic MOFs, with special emphasis on how the biocatalytic processes operate in these materials can reverse the plight of native enzyme&#8208;based biosensing.







Abstract
The highly efficient and specific catalysis of enzymes allows them to recognize a myriad of substrates, which enables biosensing. However, the fragility of natural enzymes severely restricts their practical applications.

More importantly, customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative route for the construction of robust enzyme mimics. This review will introduce the concept of these biocatalytic MOFs, with special emphasis on how biocatalytic processes that operate in these materials can reverse the plight of native enzyme&#8208;based biosensing.

         <title>Modern Strategies for the Diversification of the Supply of Natural Compounds: The Case of Alkaloid Painkillers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaloid pharmaceuticals supply&#8208;chain is highly dependent on opium poppy harvest. The biosynthesis of alkaloid painkillers encounters its first bottleneck in the enzymatic Pictet&#8208;Spengler stereoselective condensation of 4&#8208;HPAA and dopamine, to synthesize S&#8208;norcoclaurine. The enzyme mechanisms and possible methodology for the improvement of their efficiency are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived natural compounds have been used for treating diseases since prehistorical times. The supply of many plant&#8208;derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is primarily dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency adds an extra risk factor to ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Emerging technologies, such as biocatalysis, might help to solve this problem by diversifying the sources of supply of these compounds. Here we review the first committed step in the production of alkaloid painkillers, the production of S&#8208;norcoclaurine, and the enzymes involved. The improvement of these enzymes can be carried out experimentally by directed evolution and rational design strategies, supported by computational methods, to create variants that produce the S&#8208;norcoclaurine precursor for alkaloid painkillers in heterologous organisms, meeting the pharmaceutical industry standards and needs without depending on opium poppy crops.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Protein Manipulation Systems: From Function Regulation to Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami creates an ideal operation panel for positioning and manipulating individual proteins with nanoscale precision. This review provides an overview of the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems for protein function regulation and biological applications.







Abstract
Proteins directly participate in tremendous physiological processes and mediate a variety of cellular functions. However, precise manipulation of proteins with predefined relative position and stoichiometry for understanding protein&#8208;protein interactions and guiding cellular behaviors is still challenging. With superior programmability of DNA molecules, DNA origami technology is able to construct arbitrary nanostructures that can accurately control the arrangement of proteins with various functionalities to solve these problems. Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami&#8208;based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.

         <title>Extension of the Terpene Chemical Space: the Very First Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to a unique biosynthetic scheme, the diversification of terpene structure could be envisioned through the structural modification of the two universal common terpene precursors IPP and DMAPP. This minireview covers the synthesis, the use as prenyl transferase substrates, and the synthetic application of IPP and DMAPP homologues developed for diversifying the terpene chemical space.







Abstract
The structural diversity of terpenes is particularly notable and many studies are carried out to increase it further. In the terpene biosynthetic pathway this diversity is accessible from only two common precursors, i.&#8201;e. isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Methods recently developed (e.&#8201;g. the Terpene Mini Path) have allowed DMAPP and IPP to be obtained from a two&#8208;step enzymatic conversion of industrially available isopentenol (IOH) and dimethylallyl alcohol (DMAOH) into their corresponding diphosphates. Easily available IOH and DMAOH analogues then offer quick access to modified terpenoids thus avoiding the tedious chemical synthesis of unnatural diphosphates. The aim of this minireview is to cover the literature devoted to the use of these analogues for widening the accessible terpene chemical space.

         <title>Bioinorganic Chemistry of Zinc in Relation to the Immune System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc's role in human immunity has been extensively covered from a biological perspective. The structural, thermodynamic, and inorganic chemistry of zinc in relation to proteins and pathways of the immune system has received less attention and is the topic of the present review.







Abstract
Zinc is well&#8208;known to have a central role in human inflammation and immunity and is itself an anti&#8208;inflammatory and antiviral agent. Despite its massively documented role in such processes, the underlying chemistry of zinc in relation to specific proteins and pathways of the immune system has not received much focus. This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc&#8208;based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.
