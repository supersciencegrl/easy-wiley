         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Ligands: Design, Synthesis and Their Utilization for Optical Assignment of Polymorphic&#8208;Disease&#8208;Associated Protein Aggregates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformation&#8208;sensitive thiophene&#8208;based ligands have emerged as a class of molecular tools for efficient optical imaging of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates. This review summarizes the design and chemical evolution of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, as well as describes how this class of ligands has been used for fluorescent assignment of polymorphic disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
The development of ligands for detecting protein aggregates is of great interest, as these aggregated proteinaceous species are the pathological hallmarks of several devastating diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In this regard, thiophene&#8208;based ligands have emerged as powerful tools for fluorescent assessment of these pathological entities. The intrinsic conformationally sensitive photophysical properties of poly&#8208; and oligothiophenes have allowed optical assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections, as well as real&#8208;time in&#8197;vivo imaging of protein deposits. Herein, we recount the chemical evolution of different generations of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, and exemplify their use for the optical distinction of polymorphic protein aggregates. Furthermore, the chemical determinants for achieving a superior fluorescent thiophene&#8208;based ligand, as well as the next generation of thiophene&#8208;based ligands targeting distinct aggregated species are described. Finally, the directions for future research into the chemical design of thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can aid in resolving the scientific challenges around protein aggregation diseases are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Muramyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;Lactam in Spore Peptidoglycan of Clostridioides difficile</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Muramate in the Clostridioides difficile cell&#8208;wall peptidoglycan is converted to muramyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactam on conversion to spores. This transformation is instigated by proteins CwlD, GerS, and PdaA1.







Abstract
Clostridioides difficile is a spore&#8208;forming human pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Infections by this pathogen ensue dysbiosis of the intestinal tract, which leads to germination of the spores. The process of spore formation requires a transition for the cell&#8208;wall peptidoglycan of the vegetative C. difficile to that of spores, which entails the formation of muramyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactam. We describe a set of reactions for three recombinant C. difficile proteins, GerS, CwlD, and PdaA1, with the use of four synthetic peptidoglycan analogs. CwlD and PdaA1 excise the peptidoglycan stem peptide and the acetyl moiety of N&#8208;acetyl muramate, respectively. The reaction of CwlD is accelerated in the presence of GerS. With the use of a suitable substrate, we document that PdaA1 catalyzes a novel zinc&#8208;dependent transamidation/transpeptidation reaction, an unusual reaction that requires excision of the stem peptide as a pre&#8208;requisite.

         <title>Fusion Enzymes Involved in Biosynthetic Tailoring Reactions in Fungi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion enzymes are single proteins consisting of two or more functional domains, which have been increasingly reported from the biosynthesis of fungal natural products. This concept provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date summary of the characterized fusion enzymes responsible for catalyzing biosynthetic tailoring reactions in fungi.







Abstract
Enzyme fusion, the fusion of enzymes with different domains to a single protein, has been widely recognized as a promising strategy in the development of biocatalysts. Nature has evolved gene fusion to combine different catalytic enzymes to function as a fusion enzyme, and this strategy is utilized in many natural product biosynthetic pathways. Owing to rapid advances in genome sequencing and biosynthetic pathway characterization, there is increasing interest in fusion enzymes from fungal biosynthetic pathways, particularly those involved in tailoring steps. This concept aims to provide an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of fusion enzymes that catalyze tailoring reactions in the biosynthesis of fungal secondary metabolites. Since fungal fusion enzymes are often associated with novel metabolites, this pioneering work may stimulate the exploration of the structural diversity of fungal natural products through genome mining of the untapped biosynthetic pathways involving fusion enzymes.

         <title>p&#8208;Chloropropynyl Phenylalanine, a Versatile Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acid for Co&#8208;Translational Peptide Macrocyclization and Side Chain Diversification</title>

Cyclize or diversify. The novel amino acid pCPF is compatible with in&#8197;vitro translation and allows spontaneous macrocyclization with peptides containing cysteine or diversification through its reactivity with thiols.







Abstract
Macrocyclization has proven to be a beneficial strategy to improve upon some of the disadvantages of peptides as therapeutics. Nevertheless, many peptide cyclization strategies are not compatible with in&#8197;vitro display technologies like mRNA display. Here we describe the novel amino acid p&#8208;chloropropynyl phenylalanine (pCPF). pCPF is a substrate for a mutant phenylalanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase and its introduction into peptides via in&#8197;vitro translation leads to spontaneous peptide macrocyclization in the presence of peptides containing cysteine. Macrocyclization occurs efficiently with a wide variety of ring sizes. Moreover, pCPF can be reacted with thiols after charging onto tRNA, enabling the testing of diverse ncAAs in translation. The versatility of pCPF should facilitate downstream studies of translation and enable the creation of novel macrocyclic peptide libraries.

         <title>Unfolding under pressure: an NMR perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review aims at analysing the role of solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in pressure&#8208;induced in vitro studies of protein unfolding. Although this transition has for many years been neglected because of technical difficulties, it provides important information about the forces that keep together protein structure. We first analyse what is pressure unfolding. We then provide a critical overview of how NMR has contributed to the field and evaluate the observables used in these studies. Finally, we discuss the commonalities and differences between pressure&#8208;, cold&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced unfolding. We conclude that, while within specific peculiarities, cold and pressure denaturation both rely on the important contribution of the state of hydration of non&#8208;polar side&#8208;chains as a major factor that determines the pressure dependence of the conformational stability of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Curse and Blessing of Non&#8208;proteinogenic Parts in Computational Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme engineering aims to improve or install a new function in biocatalysts for applications ranging from chemical synthesis to biomedicine. For decades, computational techniques have been developed to predict the effect of protein changes and design new enzymes. However, these techniques may have been optimized to deal with proteins composed of the standard amino acid alphabet, while the function of many enzymes relies on non&#8208;proteogenic parts like cofactors, nucleic acids, and post&#8208;translational modifications. Enzyme systems containing such molecules might be handled or modeled improperly by computational tools, and thus be unsuitable, or require additional tweaking, parameterization, or preparation. In this review, we give an overview of common and recent tools and workflows available to computational enzyme engineers. We highlight the various pitfalls that come with including non&#8208;proteogenic compounds in computations and outline potential ways to address common issues. Finally, we showcase successful examples from literature that computationally engineered such enzymes.</dc:description>

However, these techniques may have been optimized to deal with proteins composed of the standard amino acid alphabet, while the function of many enzymes relies on non-proteogenic parts like cofactors, nucleic acids, and post-translational modifications. Enzyme systems containing such molecules might be handled or modeled improperly by computational tools, and thus be unsuitable, or require additional tweaking, parameterization, or preparation. In this review, we give an overview of common and recent tools and workflows available to computational enzyme engineers. We highlight the various pitfalls that come with including non-proteogenic compounds in computations and outline potential ways to address common issues. Finally, we showcase successful examples from literature that computationally engineered such enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Molecular biology and biochemistry interpret microscopic processes in the living world in terms of molecular structures and their interactions, which are quantum mechanical by their very nature.&#160;Whereas the theoretical foundations of these interactions are well established, the computational solution of the relevant quantum mechanical equations is very hard.&#160;However, much of molecular function in biology can be understood in terms of classical mechanics, where the interactions of electrons and nuclei have been mapped onto effective&#160;surrogate potentials that model the interaction of atoms or even larger entities.&#160;The simple mathematical structure of these potentials offers huge computational advantages; however, this comes at the cost that all quantum correlations and the rigorous many&#8208;particle nature of the interactions are omitted.&#160;In this work, we discuss how quantum computation may advance the practical usefulness of the quantum foundations of molecular biology by offering computational advantages for simulations of biomolecules.&#160;We not only discuss typical quantum mechanical problems of the electronic structure of biomolecules in this context, but also consider the dominating classical problems (such as protein folding and drug design) as well as data&#8208;driven approaches of bioinformatics and the degree to which they might become amenable to quantum simulation and quantum computation.</dc:description>

         <title>G&#8208;quadruplexes as key transcriptional regulators in neglected trypanosomatid parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid secondary structures that have been linked to the functional regulation of eukaryotic organisms. G4s have been extensively characterised in humans and emerging evidence suggests that they might also be biologically relevant for human pathogens. This supports the idea that G4s might be novel therapeutic targets in tackling infectious diseases. Bioinformatic analyses revealed a high prevalence of putative quadruplex&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in the genome of protozoans, which highlights their potential roles in regulating vital processes of these parasites, including DNA transcription and replication. In this work, we focus on the neglected trypanosomatid parasites, Trypanosoma and Leishmania spp., which cause debilitating and deadly diseases across the poorest populations worldwide. We review three examples where G4&#8208;formation might be key to modulate transcriptional activity in trypanosomatids, providing an overview of experimental approaches that can be used to exploit the regulatory roles and relevance of these structures to fight parasitic infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of an unusual &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase off&#8208;loading domain from a cyanobacterial type I fatty acid synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type I fatty acid synthases (FAS) are known from higher eukaryotes and fungi. We report the discovery of FasT, a rare type I FAS from the cyanobacterium Chlorogloea sp. CCALA695. FasT possesses an unusual off&#8208;loading domain, which was heterologously expressed in E.&#160;coli and found to act as an &#945;&#8209;oxoamine synthase (AOS) in vitro. Similar to serine palmitoyltransferases from sphingolipid biosynthesis, the AOS off&#8208;loading domain catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen condensation between l&#8208;serine and a fatty acyl thioester. While the AOS domain was strictly specific for l&#8208;serine, thioesters with saturated fatty acyl chains of six carbon atoms and longer were tolerated, with the highest activity observed for stearoyl&#8208;coenzyme A (C18). Our findings suggest a novel route to &#945;&#8209;amino ketones via the direct condensation of iteratively produced long&#8208;chain fatty acids with l&#8208;serine by a FAS with a cis&#8208;acting AOS off&#8208;loading domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporating a Polyethyleneglycol Linker to Enhance the Hydrophilicity of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Triphenylphosphonium Constructs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation is widely used for selective delivery of compounds into mitochondria. This study demonstrated that the replacement of an alkyl chain with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain in TPP&#8208;conjugated compounds can reduce the membrane adsorption of the compounds, leading to fine&#8208;tuning of mitochondria targeting strategies.







Abstract
The targeting of bioactive molecules and probes to mitochondria can be achieved by coupling to the lipophilic triphenyl phosphonium (TPP) cation, which accumulates several hundred&#8208;fold within mitochondria in response to the mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#968;m). Typically, a simple alkane links the TPP to its &#8220;cargo&#8221;, increasing overall hydrophobicity. As it would be beneficial to enhance the water solubility of mitochondria&#8208;targeted compounds we explored the effects of replacing the alkyl linker with a polyethylene glycol (PEG). We found that the use of PEG led to compounds that were readily taken up by isolated mitochondria and by mitochondria inside cells. Within mitochondria the PEG linker greatly decreased adsorption of the TPP constructs to the matrix&#8208;facing face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. These findings will allow the distribution of mitochondria&#8208;targeted TPP compounds within mitochondria to be fine&#8208;tuned.

         <title>Advances in Synthetic Biology of Fungi and Contributions to the Discovery of New Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput activation of cryptic BGCs. Putative biosynthetic gene clusters can be identified by screening all available fungal genomes. The relevant genes are then assembled to promote simultaneous expression of the involved genes. Plasmids are transferred into chassis organisms, and positive colonies are cultivated to identify new metabolites.







Abstract
The sequencing of fungal genomes is becoming increasingly accessible, with a wealth of data already available. In parallel, the prediction of the putative biosynthetic pathways responsible for the synthesis of potential new natural products is also increasing. The difficulty of translating computational analyses into available compounds is becoming evident, slowing down a process that was thought to be faster with the advent of the genomic era. Advances in gene techniques made it possible to genetically modify a wider range of organisms, including fungi typically considered recalcitrant to DNA manipulation. However, the possibility of screening many gene cluster products for new activities in a high&#8208;throughput manner remains unfeasible. Nonetheless, some updates on the synthetic biology of fungi could provide interesting insights that could help to achieve this goal in the future.

         <title>The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;Cluster of HydF is not Required for the Binding and Transfer of the Diiron Site of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial mimic of the [2Fe&#8208;2S]&#8208;precursor was shown to be integrated into variants of HydF from Thermosipho melanesiensis in which the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster was absent. Surprisingly, these semi&#8208;artificial HydF constructs were still able to bind and subsequently transfer the precursor to the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, rendering the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster dispensable for this process.







Abstract
The active site of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases contains a cubane [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster and a unique diiron cluster with biologically unusual CO and CN&#8722; ligands. The biogenesis of this diiron site, termed [2FeH], requires the maturation proteins HydE, HydF and HydG. During the maturation process HydF serves as a scaffold protein for the final assembly steps and the subsequent transfer of the [2FeH] precursor, termed [2FeP], to the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase. The binding site of [2FeP] in HydF has not been elucidated, however, the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster of HydF was considered as a possible binding partner of [2FeP]. By targeting individual amino acids in HydF from Thermosipho melanesiensis using site directed mutagenesis, we examined the postulated binding mechanism as well as the importance and putative involvement of the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster for binding and transferring [2FeP]. Surprisingly, our results suggest that binding or transfer of [2FeP] does not involve the proposed binding mechanism or the presence of a [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster at all.

The binding site of [2Fe&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;] in HydF has not been elucidated, however, the [4Fe-4S]-cluster of HydF was considered as a possible binding partner of [2Fe&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;]. By targeting individual amino acids in HydF from &lt;i&gt;Thermosipho melanesiensis&lt;/i&gt; using site directed mutagenesis, we examined the postulated binding mechanism as well as the importance and putative involvement of the [4Fe-4S]-cluster for binding and transferring [2Fe&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;]. Surprisingly, our results suggest that binding or transfer of [2Fe&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;] does not involve the proposed binding mechanism or the presence of a [4Fe-4S]-cluster at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Release of a Dual Zinc&#8208;Sensing and Gene Regulating Small Molecule from DNA Micelles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study the small molecule zinc chelator TPEN is given enhanced solubility and therapeutic capabilities through localized delivery by a nucleic acid nanocapsule. The TPEN NAN is shown to successfully suppress Eotaxin, a key chemokine involved in asthma at significantly reduced concentrations.







Abstract
Intracellular zinc ions are essential for various biological cell processes and are often dysregulated in many diseases de&#8208;pending on their location, protein binding affinity, and concentration in the cell. Due to their prevalence in diseases, it is important to not only effectively sense but chelate the often excess amount of zinc in a cell to alleviate further disease progression. N, N, N&#8242;, N&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis (2&#8208;pyridinylmethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine (TPEN) is a selective zinc chelator but its water&#8208;insoluble nature and general cytotoxicity limit its therapeutic potential. To address these challenges, TPEN loaded nucleic acid nanocapsules (TL&#8208;NANs) were synthesized, and its dual ability to sense and suppress zinc levels intracellularly were evaluated. Additionally, TL&#8208;NANs were incubated in lung cells and shown to down regulate Eotaxin, a protein up&#8208;regulated during asthma, at significantly reduced concentrations of TPEN showcasing the therapeutic potential of this drug for asthma.

         <title>Efficient Chemical and Enzymatic Syntheses of FAD Nucleobase Analogues and Their Analysis as Enzyme Cofactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the cofactor version of vitamin B2, is essential for redox reactions in cellular metabolism. Here, we report efficient chemical and enzymatic approaches for the synthesis of FAD nucleobase analogues, their biosynthesis in cellular systems, and finally, their utilization as a catalyst for&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;glutathione reductase.







Abstract
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is an essential redox cofactor in cellular metabolism. The organic synthesis of FAD typically involves coupling flavin mononucleotide (FMN) with adenosine monophosphate, however, existing synthesis routes present limitations such as multiple steps, low yields, and/or difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain starting materials. In this study, we report the synthesis of FAD nucleobase analogues with guanine/cytosine/uracil in place of adenine and deoxyadenosine in place of adenosine using chemical and enzymatic approaches with readily available starting materials, achieved in 1&#8211;3 steps with moderate yields (10&#8211;57&#8201;%). We find that the enzymatic route using Methanocaldococcus jannaschii FMN adenylyltransferase (MjFMNAT) is versatile and can produce these FAD analogues in high yields. Further, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli glutathione reductase is capable of binding and using these analogues as cofactors. Finally, we show that FAD nucleobase analogues can be synthesized inside a cell from cellular substrates FMN and nucleoside triphosphates by the heterologous expression of MjFMNAT. This lays the foundation for their use in studying the molecular role of FAD in cellular metabolism and as biorthogonal reagents in biotechnology and synthetic biology.

         <title>Protein Ligation&#8208;Assisted Reconstitution of Split HRP Fragments for Facile Production of HRP Fusion Proteins in E.&#8197;coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a split protein system and protein ligation using SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry enables the efficient production of covalently reconstituted, biologically functional HRP&#8208;fusion proteins. This strategy can facilitate the construction of various kinds of stable bio&#8208;composites based on split protein fragments in an irreversible manner.







Abstract
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is a pivotal biocatalyst for biosensor development and fine chemical synthesis. HRP proteins are mostly extracted and purified from the roots of horseradish because the solubility and productivity of recombinant HRP in bacteria are significantly low. In this study, we investigate the reconstitution system of split HRP fragments to improve its soluble expression levels in E.&#8197;coli allowing the cost&#8208;effective production of bioactive HRPs. To promote the effective association between two HRP fragments (HRPn and HRPc), we exploit SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry, a versatile protein coupling method with high affinity and selectivity. Each HRP fragment was genetically fused with SpyTag and SpyCatcher, respectively, exhibiting soluble expression in the E.&#8197;coli cytoplasm. The engineered split HRPs were effectively and irreversibly reconstituted into a biologically active and stable assembly that can catalyze intrinsic enzymatic reactions. Compared to the chaperone co&#8208;expression system, our approach shows that the production yield of soluble HRP is comparable, but the purity of the final product is relatively high. Therefore, our results can be applied to the high&#8208;yield production of recombinant HRP variants and other difficult&#8208;to&#8208;express proteins in bacteria without complex downstream processes.

         <title>Differential Chemoproteomics Reveals MARK2/3 as Cell Migration&#8208;Relevant Targets of the ALK Inhibitor Brigatinib</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting two hallmarks: In addition to inhibiting cancer cell viability, some targeted drugs can also affect cell migration. Using differential quantitative chemoproteomics we identified cross&#8208;phenotype polypharmacology of the clinical ALK inhibitor brigatinib, which kills EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;positive lung cancer cells through inhibition of ALK and inhibits cancer cell migration through targeting MARK2/3.







Abstract
Metastasis poses a major challenge in cancer management, including EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;rearranged non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As cell migration is a critical step during metastasis, we assessed the anti&#8208;migratory activities of several clinical ALK inhibitors in NSCLC cells and observed differential anti&#8208;migratory capabilities despite similar ALK inhibition, with brigatinib displaying superior anti&#8208;migratory effects over other ALK inhibitors. Applying an unbiased in&#8197;situ mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomics approach, we determined the proteome&#8208;wide target profile of brigatinib in EML4&#8208;ALK+ NSCLC cells. Dose&#8208;dependent and cross&#8208;competitive chemoproteomics suggested MARK2 and MARK3 as relevant brigatinib kinase targets. Functional validation showed that combined pharmacological inhibition or genetic modulation of MARK2/3 inhibited cell migration. Consistently, brigatinib treatment induced inhibitory YAP1 phosphorylation downstream of MARK2/3. Collectively, our data suggest that brigatinib exhibits unusual cross&#8208;phenotype polypharmacology as, despite similar efficacy for inhibiting EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;dependent cell proliferation as other ALK inhibitors, it more effectively prevented migration of NSCLC cells due to co&#8208;targeting of MARK2/3.

         <title>Bioinformatic Analysis of Immobilized Enzymes: Towards a Better Understanding of The Guiding Forces</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deciphering enzyme immobilization: Using bioinformatic tools in a case&#8208;by&#8208;case study of immobilized enzymes, allows rational decision making to be applied to a process currently linked to a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Here, we apply these tools to rationalize and investigate the guiding forces that affect a set of enzymes during their immobilization.







Abstract
Protein bioinformatics has been applied to a myriad of opportunities in biocatalysis from enzyme engineering to enzyme discovery, but its application in enzyme immobilization is still very limited. Enzyme immobilization brings clear advantages in terms of sustainability and cost&#8208;efficiency but is still limited in its implementation. This, because it is a technique that remains tied to a quasi&#8208;blind protocol of trial and error, and therefore, is regarded as a time&#8208;intensive and costly approach. Here, we present the use of a set of bioinformatic tools to rationalize the results of protein immobilization that have been previously described. The study of proteins with these new tools allows the discovery of key driving forces in the process of immobilization that explain the obtained results, moving us a step closer to the final goal: predictive enzyme immobilization protocols.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein bioinformatics has been applied to a myriad of opportunities in biocatalysis from enzyme engineering to enzyme discovery, but its application in enzyme immobilization is still very limited. Enzyme immobilization brings clear advantages in terms of sustainability and cost-efficiency but is still limited in its implementation. This, because it is a technique that remains tied to a quasi-blind protocol of trial and error, and therefore, is regarded as a time-intensive and costly approach. Here, we present the use of a set of bioinformatic tools to rationalize the results of protein immobilization that have been previously described. The study of proteins with these new tools allows the discovery of key driving forces in the process of immobilization that explain the obtained results, moving us a step closer to the final goal: predictive enzyme immobilization protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Investigation of Foldamer&#8208;Based Iodine&#8208;Supported Artificial Glycosidases</title>

Ersatz enzyme: A foldamer was found to be highly efficient at hydrolysing ethers and glycoside carbohydrates in the presence of iodine at room temperature. The backbone conformation of the enzyme mimetic remains almost unchanged after the glycosidase reaction.







Abstract
Glycosidases are a type of enzyme that hydrolytically cleave carbohydrates and form glycans for biologically important processes. The inadequacies of glycosidases or their genetic abnormalities are responsible for various diseases. Thus, the development of glycosidase mimetics is of great importance. We have designed and synthesized an enzyme mimetic containing l&#8208;phenylalanine, &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), l&#8208;leucine, and m&#8208;Nifedipine. From X&#8208;ray crystallography, the foldamer adopts a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation stabilized by two 10&#8208;member and one 18&#8208;member NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the foldamer was found to be highly efficient in hydrolysing ethers and glycosides in the presence of iodine at room temperature. Further, X&#8208;ray analysis shows the backbone conformation of the enzyme mimetic to be almost unchanged after the glycosidase reaction. This is the first example of iodine&#8208;supported artificial glycosidase activity with an enzyme mimic at ambient conditions.

         <title>Constraining and Modifying Peptides Using Pd&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Allylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cysteine allylation is used for peptide stapling and the resulting alkene&#8208;containing staples are further modified via biorthogonal reactions to introduce additional probes.







Abstract
Over the past decades, several strategies for inducing and stabilizing secondary structure formation in peptides have been developed to increase their proteolytic stability and their binding affinity to specific interaction partners. Here, we report how our recently introduced chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cysteine allylation reaction can be extended to stapling and how the resulting alkene&#8208;containing staples themselves can be further modified to introduce additional probes into such stabilized peptides. The latter is demonstrated by introducing a fluorophore as well as a PEG moiety into different stapled peptides using bioorthogonal thiol&#8208;ene and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Furthermore, we investigated structural implications of our allyl staples when used to replace conformationally relevant disulfide bridges. To this end, we chose a selective binder of integrin &#945;3&#946;1 (LXY3), which is only active in its cyclic disulfide form. We replaced the disulfide bridge by different stapling reagents in order to increase stability and binding affinity towards integrin &#945;3&#946;1.

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;Based Inhibitors of the Peptidoglycan O&#8208;Acetylesterase Ape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehyde&#8208;based inhibitors of the peptidoglycan deacetylase Ape were shown to act as competitive inhibitors with Ki values in the low micromolar range. Reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol abolishes inhibition, suggesting that the binding may involve the formation of a tetrahedral adduct with the active site serine nucleophile.







Abstract
The O&#8208;acetylation of the muramic acid residues in peptidoglycan (PG) is a modification that protects the bacteria from lysis due to the action of lysozyme. In Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, deacetylation is required to allow lytic transglycosylases to promote PG cleavage during cell growth and division. This deacetylation is catalyzed by O&#8208;acetylpeptidoglycan esterase (Ape) which is a serine esterase and employs covalent catalysis via a serine&#8208;linked acyl enzyme intermediate. Loss of Ape activity affects the size and shape of bacteria and dramatically reduces virulence. In this work, we report the first rationally designed aldehyde&#8208;based inhibitors of Ape from Campylobacter jejuni. The most potent of these acts as a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 13&#8197;&#956;M. We suspect that the inhibitors are forming adducts with the active site serine that closely mimic the tetrahedral intermediate of the normal catalytic cycle. Support for this notion is found in the observation that reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol effectively abolishes the inhibition.

         <title>Effect of Ionic Strength on the Thermal Stability of DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of DNA origami nanostructures in aqueous media is closely tied to the presence of cations that screen electrostatic inter&#8208;helix repulsion. Here, the thermal melting behavior of different DNA origami nanostructures is investigated in dependence of Mg2+ concentration and compared to calculated ensemble melting temperatures of the staple strands used in DNA origami folding. Strong deviations of the measured DNA origami melting temperatures from the calculated ones are observed, in particular at high ionic strength where the melting temperature saturates and becomes independent of ionic strength. The degree of deviation between the measured and calculated melting temperatures further depends on the superstructure and in particular the mechanical properties of the DNA origami nanostructures. This indicates that thermal stability of a given DNA origami design at high ionic strength is governed predominantly not by electrostatic inter&#8208;helix repulsion but mostly by mechanical strain.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineered heme proteins were developed to possess numerous excellent biocatalytic nitrenoid C&#8208;H functionalizations. Computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT), hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were employed to help understand some important mechanistic aspects of these heme nitrene transfer reactions. This review summarizes advances of computational reaction pathway results of these biocatalytic intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8208;H aminations/amidations, focusing on mechanistic origins of reactivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity as well as effects of substrate substituent, axial ligand, metal center, and protein environment.

         <title>Discovery of Potent Pyrazoline&#8208;Based Covalent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitors
</title>

         <dc:description>
Using covalent chemoproteomic strategies, structure&#8208;guided medicinal chemistry, and modular synthesis of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted pyrazolines bearing either chloroacetamide or vinyl sulfonamide cysteine&#8208;reactive warheads, we have discovered nanomolar potency inhibitors against Mpro from not only SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but across many other coronaviruses.







Abstract
While vaccines and antivirals are now being deployed for the current SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic, we require additional antiviral therapeutics to not only effectively combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants, but also future coronaviruses. All coronaviruses have relatively similar genomes that provide a potential exploitable opening to develop antiviral therapies that will be effective against all coronaviruses. Among the various genes and proteins encoded by all coronaviruses, one particularly &#8220;druggable&#8221; or relatively easy&#8208;to&#8208;drug target is the coronavirus Main Protease (3CLpro or Mpro), an enzyme that is involved in cleaving a long peptide translated by the viral genome into its individual protein components that are then assembled into the virus to enable viral replication in the cell. Inhibiting Mpro with a small&#8208;molecule antiviral would effectively stop the ability of the virus to replicate, providing therapeutic benefit. In this study, we have utilized activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;based chemoproteomic approaches to discover and further optimize cysteine&#8208;reactive pyrazoline&#8208;based covalent inhibitors for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. Structure&#8208;guided medicinal chemistry and modular synthesis of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted pyrazolines bearing either chloroacetamide or vinyl sulfonamide cysteine&#8208;reactive warheads enabled the expedient exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR), yielding nanomolar potency inhibitors against Mpro from not only SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but across many other coronaviruses. Our studies highlight promising chemical scaffolds that may contribute to future pan&#8208;coronavirus inhibitors.

         <title>Toward &#8220;E&#8208;Ring&#8208;Free&#8221; Lamellarin Analogues: Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, several pentacyclic E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarin analogues were prepared using a new facile and straightforward synthetic method based on [3+2] cycloaddition. Their cytotoxicity was assessed in a panel of cancer cell lines in comparison with several hexacyclic lamellarins. E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarins were devoid of cytotoxicity due to their poor solubility in cellular environment.







Abstract
Since the discovery of anticancer properties of a naturally occurring hexacyclic marine alkaloid Lamellarin D, the attempts have been made to prepare its synthetic analogues and elucidate the effects of each structural component on their activity profile. While F&#8208;ring&#8208;free, A&#8208;ring&#8208;free and B&#8208;ring&#8208;open lamellarins are known, E&#8208;ring&#8208;free analogues have never been investigated. In this work, we developed a facile and straightforward synthetic method toward E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarin analogues based on the [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition. For the first time, we prepared several pentacyclic lamellarin analogues without E&#8208;ring in their structure and assessed their cytotoxicity in a panel of cancer cell lines in comparison with several hexacyclic lamellarins. E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarins were devoid of cytotoxicity due to their poor solubility in cellular environment.

         <title>Engineering Glucose Dehydrogenase to Favor&#160;Totally Synthetic Biomimetic&#160;containing carboxyl group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of unnatural nicotinamide cofactors for reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases has gained increasing interest. Totally synthetic nicotinamide cofactor biomimetics (NCBs) are cost&#8208;effective and convenient to synthesize. Thus, it has becoming increasingly important to develop enzymes that accept NCBs. Here, we have engineered SsGDH to favor a newly synthesized unnatural cofactor 3&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybenzyl) pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium (BANA+). Using in situ ligand minimization tool, sites 44 and 114 were identified as hotspots for mutagenesis. All the double mutants demonstrated 2.7&#8211;7.7&#8208;fold improvements in catalytic activity, and the best double mutant E44D/E114L exhibited 10.6&#8208;fold increased catalytic efficiency toward BANA+. These results provide valuable information for the rational engineering of oxidoreductases with versatile NCBs&#8208;dependency, as well as the design of novel biomimetic cofactors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photosensitizers combine the inherent reactivity of reactive oxygen species with the sophisticated reaction control of light. Through selective targeting these light&#8208;active molecules have the potential to overcome certain limitations in drug discovery. Ongoing advances in the synthesis and evaluation of photosensitizer conjugates with biomolecules such as antibodies, peptides or small molecule drugs are leading to increasingly powerful agents for the eradication of a growing number of microbial species. This review article therefore summarizes challenges and opportunities in the development of selective photosensitizers and their conjugates described in recent literature.

         <title>Cannabidiol&#8208;Loaded Poly Lactic&#8208;Co&#8208;Glycolic Acid Nanoparticles with Improved Bioavailability as a Potential for Osteoarthritis Therapeutic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cannabidiol (CBD) have been considered as a potential drug for arthritis treatment. In this article, we describe an effective strategy to fabricate CBD&#8208;loaded poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles (CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs), with inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors, increasing cellularity, and improving structural changes, which can be regarded as a potential system to treat OA.







Abstract
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non&#8208;intoxicating cannabinoid from cannabis sativa that has demonstrated efficacious against inflammation, which can be considered as a potential drug for arthritis treatment. However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability limit its clinical application. Here, we report an effective strategy to fabricate Cannabidiol&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) copolymer (CBD&#8208;PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), with a spherical morphology and an average diameter of 238&#8197;nm. CBD was sustained release from CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs, which improved the bioavailability of CBD. The CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs effectively protect the damage of LPS to cell viability. We observed that CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs significantly suppressed LPS&#8208;induced primary rat chondrocyte expression of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1&#946; (IL&#8208;1&#946;), interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6), tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP&#8208;13). Remarkably, CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs also showed better therapeutic effects of inhibiting the degradation of the extracellular matrix of chondrocytes than equivalent CBD solution. In general, the fabrication CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs showed good protection of primary chondrocytes in&#8197;vitro and is a promising system for osteoarthritis treatment.

Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate every aspect of cellular function with profound implications in biology and health. To facilitate study of PTMs, genetic code expansion (GCE) has emerged as a powerful tool to synthesize proteins with homogeneous and stoichiometric PTMs or their analogs. This Concept paper summarizes several common PTMs that are successfully installed through GCE and discusses their applications in biological studies.







Abstract
Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play critical roles in regulating cellular activities. Here we provide a survey of genetic code expansion (GCE) methods that were applied in the co&#8208;translational installation and studies of PTMs through noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis. We begin by reviewing types of PTM that have been installed by GCE with a focus on modifications of tyrosine, serine, threonine, lysine, and arginine residues. We also discuss examples of applying these methods in biological studies. Finally, we end the piece with a short discussion on the challenges and the opportunities of the field.

         <title>Chemical Biology Approaches toward Precise Structure Control of IgG&#8208;Based Antibody&#8208;Oligonucleotide Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article is centered on different chemical biology approaches that enable the production of antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates (AOCs) with accurate site&#8208;specificity and degree of conjugation. These techniques are categorized into linker&#8208;free or linker&#8208;mediated conjugations, with an emphasis on the detailed chemistry and potential applications. Additionally, the article assesses the pros and cons of each method and provides a viewpoint on the future advancements in the field of precise AOCs.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates (AOCs) are important tools for drug development and biochemical analysis. However, the structural heterogeneity of AOCs synthesized through conventional coupling methods raises reproducibility and safety concerns in clinical trials. To address these issues, different covalent coupling approaches have been developed to synthesize AOCs with precise site&#8208;specificity and degree of conjugation. This Concept article categorizes these approaches as linker&#8208;free or linker&#8208;mediated and provides details on their chemistry and potential applications. Several factors, including site&#8208;specificity, conjugation control, accessibility, stability, and efficiency, are highlighted when evaluating the pros and cons of these approaches. The article also discusses the future of AOCs, including the development of better conjugation approaches to ensure stimuli&#8208;responsive release and the application of high&#8208;throughput methods to facilitate their development.

         <title>Deacetylation of Arabinofuranosylated Xylopyranosyl Residues Related to Plant Xylan: Significant Differences Between Xylan Deacetylases Classified into Various Carbohydrate Esterase Families</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenyl glycosides derived from &#946;&#8208;1,4&#8208;xylobiose acetylated and &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosylated at the non&#8208;reducing&#8208;end terminal xylose have been synthesized and employed as model substrates for deesterification catalyzed by acetylxylan esterases classified in different carbohydrate esterase families. Heterogeneously disubstituted xylopyranosyl residues are the most recalcitrant hemicellulose epitopes and their debranching is a prerequisite for efficient acetylarabinoxylan utilization and saccharification.







Abstract
A chemical synthesis of two novel phenyl glycosides of trisaccharides related to acetylarabinoxylan is described. The trisaccharides bear acetyl and arabinofuranosyl moieties at the non&#8208;reducing&#8208;end xylopyranosyl residue, which is substituted at positions 2 and 3. Both compounds were treated with various xylan deacetylases classified in different carbohydrate esterase (CE) families and significant differences between the families were found. While the arabinosylation hampers deacetylation by CE2&#8208;CE5 and CE12 family members, both epitopes are deesterified by CE1 and in particular CE6 enzymes. The 3&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 2&#8208;O&#8208;arabinosylated compound is also processed by CE7 and majority of CE16 esterases, but not by a hitherto non&#8208;classified Flavobacterium johnsoniae acetylxylan esterase. The data suggests that a slow deesterification of the 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 3&#8208;O&#8208;arabinosylated compound may be due to the acetyl group migration followed by deacetylation of this migration product.

         <title>ROS&#8208;Triggered Gel&#8208;Sol Transition and Kinetics&#8208;Controlled Cargo Release by Methionine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delivering the goods: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling peptides showing gel&#8208;sol transitions have been developed, in which the gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol phase transitions are triggered by H2O2 causing oxidation at the methionine residues in the peptides. By tuning the position of these redox&#8208;active methionine residues, the phase&#8208;transition kinetics and velocity of cargo release from the hydrogel were successfully controlled.







Abstract
The gel&#8208;sol transition of self&#8208;assembling peptides is a useful switch for environment&#8208;dependent drug release. For their applications, kinetics control of the responses is important for matching the velocity of release to the target biological events. Here we demonstrate the chemical control of redox&#8208;triggered gel&#8208;sol transition kinetics of self&#8208;assembling peptides by altering the amino acid sequence. Amphiphilic peptides were developed in which a methionine residue was located in the middle (JigSAP&#8208;IMI) or near the N&#8197;terminus (JigSAP&#8208;MII). Both peptides formed hydrogels under physiological conditions&#8212;forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;based supramolecular nanofibers. In contrast, the oxidized forms remained in the solution state under identical conditions&#8212;adopting &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich secondary structures. Upon oxidation with H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, JigSAP&#8208;MII showed a faster gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition and cargo&#8208;releasing than JigSAP&#8208;IMI, thus indicating that the phase&#8208;transition and releasing kinetics of self&#8208;assembling peptides can be rationally controlled by the position of the reactive amino acid residue.

         <title>Rapid Biocatalytic Synthesis of Aromatic Acid CoA Thioesters by Using Microbial Aromatic Acid CoA Ligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood you go this way? Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;dependent aromatic acid&#8208;coenzyme A (CoA) ligases in microbial lignin degradation follow a different mechanism of CoA ligation than plant phenylpropanoid ligases contributing to lignification. Microbial ligases form an acyl&#8208;phosphate intermediate instead of an acyl&#8208;adenylate and enable metabolism of the highly substituted sinapic acid. Such ligases have promise as tools for biocatalysis and lignin engineering.







Abstract
Chemically labile ester linkages can be introduced into lignin by incorporation of monolignol conjugates, which are synthesized in planta by acyltransferases that use a coenzyme&#8197;A (CoA) thioester donor and a nucleophilic monolignol alcohol acceptor. The presence of these esters facilitates processing and aids in the valorization of renewable biomass feedstocks. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is potentially limited by the low steady&#8208;state levels of aromatic acid thioester donors in plants. As part of an effort to overcome this, aromatic acid CoA ligases involved in microbial aromatic degradation were identified and screened against a broad panel of substituted cinnamic and benzoic acids involved in plant lignification. Functional fingerprinting of this ligase library identified four robust, highly active enzymes capable of facile, rapid, and high&#8208;yield synthesis of aromatic acid CoA thioesters under mild aqueous reaction conditions mimicking in planta activity.

         <title>Investigation of Sequence&#8208;Penetration Relationships of Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing better oligonucleotide therapeutics requires better understanding of the features that promote efficient cytosolic delivery. This study uses the chloroalkane penetration assay to explore features of base sequence, length, and secondary structure that affect cytosolic delivery of druglike oligonucleotides.







Abstract
A major limitation for the development of more effective oligonucleotide therapeutics has been a lack of understanding of their penetration into the cytosol. While prior work has shown how backbone modifications affect cytosolic penetration, it is unclear how cytosolic penetration is affected by other features including base composition, base sequence, length, and degree of secondary structure. We have applied the chloroalkane penetration assay, which exclusively reports on material that reaches the cytosol, to investigate the effects of these characteristics on the cytosolic uptake of druglike oligonucleotides. We found that base composition and base sequence had moderate effects, while length did not correlate directly with the degree of cytosolic penetration. Investigating further, we found that the degree of secondary structure had the largest and most predictable correlations with cytosolic penetration. These methods and observations add a layer of design for maximizing the efficacy of new oligonucleotide therapeutics.

         <title>Resorc[4]arene Modifiers for Supramolecular Site&#8208;Directed Immobilization of Antibodies on Multi&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes were covalently decorated with resorc[4]arenes to improve the site&#8208;direct immobilization of SPS1 antibody. This system was used to fabricate an immunosensor for the detection of SPS1 from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.







Abstract
One of the main problems in developing immunosensors featuring carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is immobilizing antibodies (Abs) onto the CNT surface to afford selective binding to target antigens (Ags). In this work, we developed a practical supramolecular Ab conjugation strategy based on resorc[4]arene modifiers. To improve the Ab orientation on the CNTs surface and optimizing the Ab/Ag interaction, we exploited the host&#8208;guest approach by synthesizing two newly resorc[4]arene linkers R1 and R2 via well&#8208;established procedures. The upper rim was decorated with eight methoxyl groups to promote selective recognition of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the Ab. Moreover, the lower rim was functionalized with 3&#8208;bromopropyloxy or 3&#8208;azidopropiloxy substituents to bind the macrocycles on the multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) surface. Accordingly, several chemical modifications of MWCNTs were evaluated. After the morphological and electrochemical characterization of nanomaterials, the resorc[4]arene&#8208;modified MWCNTs were deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode surface to evaluate their potential applicability for label&#8208;free immunosensor development. The most promising system showed an improved electrode active area (AEL) of almost 20&#8201;% and a site&#8208;oriented immobilization of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein S1 antibody (Ab&#8208;SPS1). The developed immunosensor revealed a good sensitivity (23.64&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mL&#8201;ng&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) towards the SPS1 antigen and a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.01&#8201;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1.

         <title>Computationally Supported Inversion of Ketoreductase Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using Rosetta enzyme design and MD simulations, the active site of a thermostable ketoreductase was redesigned to invert the stereoselectivity. Simultaneous introduction of 6&#8211;8 mutations without laboratory screening of mutant libraries gave active enzymes catalyzing asymmetric synthesis of 1&#8208;phenylethanols with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Whereas directed evolution and rational design by structural inspection are established tools for enzyme redesign, computational methods are less mature but have the potential to predict small sets of mutants with desired properties without laboratory screening of large libraries. We have explored the use of computational enzyme redesign to change the enantioselectivity of a highly thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermus thermophilus in the asymmetric reduction of ketones. The enzyme reduces acetophenone to (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol. To invert the enantioselectivity, we used an adapted CASCO workflow which included Rosetta for enzyme design and molecular dynamics simulations for ranking. To correct for unrealistic binding modes, we used Boltzmann weighing of binding energies computed by a linear interaction energy approach. This computationally cheap method predicted four variants with inverted enantioselectivity, each with 6&#8211;8 mutations around the substrate&#8208;binding site, causing only modest reduction (2&#8208; to 7&#8208;fold) of kcat/KM values. Laboratory testing showed that three variants indeed had inverted enantioselectivity, producing (R)&#8208;alcohols with up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. The broad substrate range allowed reduction of acetophenone derivatives with full conversion to highly enantioenriched alcohols. The results demonstrate the use of computational methods to control ketoreductase stereoselectivity in asymmetric transformations with minimal experimental screening.

         <title>Oligonucleotides Containing C5&#8208;Propynyl Modified Arabinonucleic Acids: Synthesis, Biophysical and Antisense Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligonucleotides containing C5&#8208;Propynyl modified arabinonucleic acids: Few oligonucleotide modifications support RNase H cleavage of RNA, limiting candidates for gapmer design. Arabinonucleic acid (ANA)/RNA duplexes are RNase H substrates, but exhibit poor thermal stability. Oligonucleotides containing ANA cores with C5&#8208;propynyl nucleobases were synthesized, formed stable duplexes with RNA and a gapmer with MOE wings elicited E. coli RNase H cleavage &#8208; these findings contribute to antisense therapeutic design.







Abstract
The introduction of chemical modifications on the nucleic acid scaffold has allowed for the progress of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the clinic for the treatment of a variety of disorders. In contribution to the repertoire of gene&#8208;silencing nucleic acid modifications, herein we report the synthesis and incorporation of C5&#8208;propynyl arabinouridine (araUP) and arabinocytidine (araCP) into mixed&#8208;base ASOs containing a pyrimidine core. Substitution of the core with araUP and araCP resulted in stabilization of the duplex formed with RNA but not with DNA. Similar results were obtained with ASOs bearing phosphorothioate linkages or methoxyethyl (MOE) wings in a gapmer design. All modified ASOs were compatible with E. coli RNase H mediated degradation of target RNA. Substitution of DNA for araUP and araCP in the central portion of a gapmer with MOE wings demonstrated improved nuclease resistance. These results suggest C5&#8208;modified arabinonucleic acids may serve as a potential chemical modification for therapeutic ASOs.

Two promiscuous O&#8208;methyltransferases from bacteria were found to methylate a panel of catechol substrates towards high&#8208;value medicinal compounds. Surprisingly, the non&#8208;catechol substrates 5&#8208;hydroxyflavonoids and o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acids/aldehydes were also methylated at low conversion rates. The crystal structures reveal potential target sites for enzyme engineering for biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;directed methylation is a ubiquitous tailoring reaction in natural product pathways catalysed by O&#8208;methyltransferases (OMTs). Promiscuous OMT biocatalysts are thus a valuable asset in the toolkit for sustainable synthesis and optimization of known bioactive scaffolds for drug development. Here, we characterized the enzymatic properties and substrate scope of two bacterial OMTs from Desulforomonas acetoxidans and Streptomyces avermitilis and determined their crystal structures. Both OMTs methylated a wide range of catechol&#8208;like substrates, including flavonoids, coumarins, hydroxybenzoic acids, and their respective aldehydes, an anthraquinone and an indole. One enzyme also accepted a steroid. The product range included pharmaceutically relevant compounds such as (iso)fraxidin, iso(scopoletin), chrysoeriol, alizarin 1&#8208;methyl ether, and 2&#8208;methoxyestradiol. Interestingly, certain non&#8208;catechol flavonoids and hydroxybenzoic acids were also methylated. This study expands the knowledge on substrate preference and structural diversity of bacterial catechol OMTs and paves the way for their use in (combinatorial) pathway engineering.

         <title>Biomimetic S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine Regeneration Starting from Multiple Byproducts Enables Biocatalytic Alkylation with Radical SAM Enzymes
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biomimetic regeneration system for S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAM analogues presented is based on the salvage of the adenine moiety and in&#8197;situ supply of d&#8208;ribose and polyphosphate. It is compatible with a broad range of SAM&#8208;dependent enzymes including aminopropyl transferases, and is shown to support ethylation reactions with both conventional and radical SAM methyltransferases.







Abstract
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine (SAM) is an enzyme cofactor involved in methylation, aminopropyl transfer, and radical reactions. This versatility renders SAM&#8208;dependent enzymes of great interest in biocatalysis. The usage of SAM analogues adds to this diversity. However, high cost and instability of the cofactor impedes the investigation and usage of these enzymes. While SAM regeneration protocols from the methyltransferase (MT) byproduct S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine are available, aminopropyl transferases and radical SAM enzymes are not covered. Here, we report a set of efficient one&#8208;pot systems to supply or regenerate SAM and SAM analogues for all three enzyme classes. The systems&#8217; flexibility is showcased by the transfer of an ethyl group with a cobalamin&#8208;dependent radical SAM MT using S&#8208;adenosylethionine as a cofactor. This shows the potential of SAM (analogue) supply and regeneration for the application of diverse chemistry, as well as for mechanistic studies using cofactor analogues.

         <title>Stereodivergent Biocatalytic Formal Reduction of &#945;&#8208;Angelica Lactone to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone in a One&#8208;Pot Cascade</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic formal reduction of &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone to both enantiomers of &#947;&#8208;valerolactone was achieved in a biocatalytic one&#8208;pot cascade combining an asymmetric isomerization step and a reduction step. A fusion protein linking two Old Yellow Enzymes with complementary activities showed excellent (R)&#8208;selectivity, while the (S)&#8208;enantiomer was obtained using a single enzyme for both steps of the cascade.







Abstract
The formal asymmetric and stereodivergent enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone to both enantiomers of &#947;&#8208;valerolactone was achieved in a one&#8208;pot cascade by uniting the promiscuous stereoselective isomerization activity of Old Yellow Enzymes with their native reductase activity. In addition to running the cascade with one enzyme for each catalytic step, a bifunctional isomerase&#8208;reductase biocatalyst was designed by fusing two Old Yellow Enzymes, thereby generating an unprecedented case of an artificial enzyme catalyzing the reduction of nonactivated C=C bonds to access (R)&#8208;valerolactone in overall 41&#8201;% conversion and up to 91&#8201;% ee. The enzyme BfOYE4 could be used as single biocatalyst for both steps and delivered (S)&#8208;valerolactone in up to 84&#8201;% ee and 41&#8201;% overall conversion. The reducing equivalents were provided by a nicotinamide recycling system based on formate and formate dehydrogenase, added in a second step. This enzymatic system provides an asymmetric route to valuable chiral building blocks from an abundant bio&#8208;based chemical.

         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;sol transition of peptides is useful for environment&#8208;dependent drug release. For the applications, kinetics control of the responses is important for matching the releasing velocity to the target events. We demonstrate a rational control of redox&#8208;triggered gel&#8208;sol transition kinetics of self&#8208;assembling peptides by the amino acid sequence. A sequence bearing a redox&#8208;active methionine (Met) residue near a terminus allowed for faster oxidation&#8208;triggered gel&#8208;sol transition with reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide than a peptide possessing a Met residue at the center. The present study contributes not only to the biomaterials design but also to the biological research on the kinetic effects of Met oxidation depending on its position in proteins on pathology.

         <title>Hofmeister Series: From Aqueous Solution of Biomolecules to Single Cells and Nanovesicles</title>

Hofmeister effects on cellular exocytosis and nanovesicle opening: This minireview highlights the recent progress in ionic species regulating cellular exocytosis, vesicular content, and nanovesicle opening. Studies of Hofmeister effects on biomolecules (e.&#8201;g., proteins, enzymes, and lipids) explain observations of changing dynamics for cellular exocytosis, vesicular content, and nanovesicle opening and how they can be modulated by ions along the Hofmeister series.







Abstract
Hofmeister effects play a critical role in numerous physicochemical and biological phenomena, including the solubility and/or accumulation of proteins, the activities of enzymes, ion transport in biochannels, the structure of lipid bilayers, and the dynamics of vesicle opening and exocytosis. This minireview focuses on how ionic specificity affects the physicochemical properties of biomolecules to regulate cellular exocytosis, vesicular content, and nanovesicle opening. We summarize recent progress in further understanding Hofmeister effects on biomacromolecules and their applications in biological systems. These important steps have increased our understanding of the Hofmeister effects on cellular exocytosis, vesicular content, and nanovesicle opening. Increasing evidence is firmly establishing that the ions along the Hofmeister series play an important role in living organisms that has often been ignored.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Probes for Analyzing Non&#8208;Enzymatic Post&#8208;Translational Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the development and application of bioorthogonal probes for the study of non&#8208;enzymatic post&#8208;translational modifications, which has been long time challenging due to the heterogeneity of adducts and the lack of appropriate tagging tools.







Abstract
Non&#8208;enzymatic post&#8208;translational modifications (nPTMs) have been proposed as indicators of cellular stresses and diseases. Unfortunately, direct assessment of nPTMs in native environment is extremely challenging due to the heterogeneity of adducts and the lack of tagging tools. Given these challenges, bioorthogonal probes (BPs) have been developed for the analysis of nPTMs. The rationality is that BPs could selectively install azides or alkynes into nPTMs as a biorthogonal handle for the following enrichment or tracking. Herein, we review the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of BPs used for nPTMs studies, clarify their working principles, and highlight how they advance our understanding of the biological functions of nPTMs.

         <title>Type II Polyketide Synthases: A Bioinformatics&#8208;Driven Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinformatics&#8208;driven studies of type II polyketide synthases are summarized in this review. How bioinformatics can advance our understanding of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases is discussed, focusing on their enzymatic classification, molecular evolution, structural prediction of the biosynthetic products, and the global distribution of the gene clusters and their products.







Abstract
Bioinformatics has become an indispensable tool for natural products research in the genomic era. One of the key challenges is to accurately convert sequence data of a biosynthetic gene cluster into chemical information such as the enzymatic function or the biosynthetic product structure. Type&#8197;II polyketide synthase is the most bioinformatically well&#8208;studied class of non&#8208;modular biosynthetic machinery and represents a model system to showcase bioinformatic applications in natural products research. This review takes a bioinformatics&#8208;centered perspective and summarizes the past advances and future opportunities of bioinformatics&#8208;guided research on type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. How bioinformatics has contributed to deepen the chemical understanding of type&#8197;II PKSs will be discussed with the focus on enzymology, evolution, structural prediction of the biosynthetic products, genome mining, and the global analyses of their polyketide products.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Find sugar in the cellular maple tree&#8221; &#8211; New advances in developing tools to achieve protein&#8208;specific glycan labeling and/or editing in different glycan hierarchy levels, and the corresponding elucidation of glycan functions are reviewed.







Abstract
Glycosylation in live cell and animal modulate a constellation of biological functions. The advent of Chemical Biology has revolutionized the analysis and tailoring of glycans, by introducing myriads of glycan engineering methods. However, the ideal scenario to achieve glycan monitoring and structural manipulation at any hierarchical levels is unmet yet. Herein we review recent advances in the methodological innovation and the versatile applications of the protein&#8208;specific glycan visualization and editing in deciphering the biological functions of glycans. An outlook for future directions toward specific sugar&#8208;chain editing is also included.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of mRNA for Cell&#8208;Selective CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing using Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimal delivery of mRNA by using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be achieved through a rational design process and high&#8208;throughput screening of a lipid library. The spatiotemporally controlled delivery of mRNA&#8208;encoding CRISPR/Cas9 can provide an effective and convenient approach for cell&#8208;selective genome editing and targeted gene therapy.







Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is being used as part of an emerging class of biotherapeutics with great promise for preventing and treating a wide range of diseases, as well as encoding programmable nucleases for genome editing. However, mRNA's low stability and immunogenicity, as well as the impermeability of the cell membrane to mRNA greatly limit mRNA's potential for therapeutic use. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently one of the most extensively studied nanocarriers for mRNA delivery and have recently been clinically approved for developing mRNA&#8208;based vaccines to prevent COVID&#8208;19. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in designing ionizable lipids and formulating LNPs for intracellular and tissue&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. Furthermore, we discuss the progress of intracellular mRNA delivery for spatiotemporally controlled CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing by using LNPs. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of LNP&#8208;based mRNA delivery for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and the treatment of genetic disorders.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Nanoarchitectonics for the Treatment of Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 9, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;rounder: Peptides are multifunctional building blocks for fabricating therapeutic nanomaterials. This review summarizes peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for the treatment of liver fibrosis. The fabrication methods, therapeutic mechanisms, and therapeutic efficacies of various kinds of peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics are discussed with an emphasis on the impact of the nanostructures on the antifibrotic activities.







Abstract
Liver fibrosis is a process of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix caused by liver injury. Liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis or even liver cancer without proper intervention. Until now, no effective therapeutic drugs have been clinically approved for treating liver fibrosis. Hence, the development of safe and effective antifibrotic drugs is particularly important. As a representative biomaterial, peptides have been investigated as key components for constructing antifibrotic nanomaterials given their advantages of biological origination, synthetic availability, and good biocompatibility. Peptides serve as multifunctional motifs in antifibrotic nanomaterials, such as liver&#8208;targeting molecules, antifibrotic molecules, and self&#8208;assembling building blocks for the formation of the nanomaterials. In this review, we focus on peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for treating liver fibrosis, including nanomaterials modified with liver&#8208;targeting peptides, nanomaterials for the efficient delivery of antifibrotic peptides, and self&#8208;assembled peptide nanomaterials for the delivery of antifibrotic drugs. The design rules of these peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials are described. The antifibrotic mechanisms and effects of these peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in treating liver fibrosis and related diseases are highlighted. The challenges and future perspectives of using peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for the treatment of liver fibrosis are discussed. These results are expected to accelerate the rational design and clinical translation of antifibrotic nanomaterials.

         <title>Spirocyclic Chromenopyrazole Inhibitors Disrupting the Interaction between the RNA&#8208;binding protein LIN28 and Let&#8208;7</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of the RNA&#8208;binding and regulating protein LIN28 have the potential to be developed as chemical probes for biological perturbation and as therapeutic candidates.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Summary Chemical cell surface modification is a fast&#8208;growing field of research, due to a common interest of chemists and synthetic biologists in tissue engineering, cell&#8208;based immunotherapy, and regenerative medicine. Few works, however, have been realized with bacteria, to engineer in this way the formation of bacterial tissues. We present here, an orthogonal nucleic acid&#8208;protein conjugation strategy to promote artificial bacterial aggregation. This system gathers the high selectivity and stability of linkage to a protein Tag expressed at the cell surface and the modularity and reversibility of aggregation due to oligonucleotide hybridization. For the first time, XNA (xeno nucleic acids in the form of 1,5&#8208;anhydrohexitol nucleic acids) were immobilized at cell surface to induce bacterial aggregation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid, Label&#8208;Free Screening of Diverse Biotransformations by Flow&#8208;Injection Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separation not required: Mass spectrometry without prior chromatographic separation, carried out on a single&#8208;quadrupole HPLC&#8208;MS, can be used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of diverse biotransformations. This flow&#8208;injection analysis mass spectrometry (FIA&#8208;MS) approach represents an attractive alternative to more traditional photometric, fluorometric, and chromatographic methods for screening enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening methods combine the advantages of photometric or fluorometric assays and analytical chromatography, as they are reasonably fast (throughput &#8805;1 sample/min) and broadly applicable, with no need for labelled substrates or products. However, the established MS&#8208;based screening approaches require specialised and expensive hardware, which limits their broad use throughout the research community. We show that a more common instrumental platform, a single&#8208;quadrupole HPLC&#8208;MS, can be used to rapidly analyse diverse biotransformations by flow&#8208;injection mass spectrometry (FIA&#8208;MS), that is, by automated infusion of samples to the ESI&#8208;MS detector without prior chromatographic separation. Common organic buffers can be employed as internal standard for quantification, and the method provides readily validated activity and selectivity information with an analytical run time of one minute per sample. We report four application examples that cover a broad range of analyte structures and concentrations (0.1&#8211;50&#8197;mM before dilution) and diverse biocatalyst preparations (crude cell lysates and whole microbial cells). Our results establish FIA&#8208;MS as a versatile and reliable alternative to more traditional methods for screening enzymatic reactions.

         <title>Discovery and Characterization of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase Using Sequence Similarity Network Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase from Halopolyspora algeriensis (BVMOHalo) derived from a marine metagenome dataset using a sequence similarity network analysis. The enzyme was recombinantly expressed in E. coli and biochemically characterized. It converts a range of aliphatic ketones and 2&#8208;chlorophenylacetone into the corresponding esters with high conversions of up to 86&#8201;%.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are important flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes which perform oxygen insertion reactions leading to valuable products. As reported in many studies, BVMOs are usually unstable during application, preventing a wider usage in biocatalysis. Here, we discovered a novel NADPH&#8208;dependent BVMO which originates from Halopolyspora algeriensis using sequence similarity networks (SSNs). The enzyme is stable at temperatures between 10&#8201;&#176;C to 30&#8201;&#176;C up to five days after the purification, and yields the normal ester product. In this study, the substrate scope was investigated for a broad range of aliphatic ketones and the enzyme was biochemically characterized to identify optimum reaction conditions. The best substrate (86&#8201;% conversion) was 2&#8208;dodecanone using purified enzyme. This novel BVMO could potentially be applied as part of an enzymatic cascade or in bioprocesses which utilize aliphatic alkanes as feedstock.

         <title>Resolving Confusion Surrounding d&#8208;Ala&#8208;d&#8208;Ala Ligase Catalysis in Cyanobacterial Mycosporine&#8208;Like Amino Acid (MAA) Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What's in a name? Cyanobacteria can introduce structural diversity into MAAs by using a mysD ligase with relaxed specify to modify mycosporine&#8208;glycine. The naming of mysD, based solely upon sequence similarity to the d&#8208;Ala&#8208;d&#8208;Ala ligase of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, has been confusing. Combining phylogeny and &#945;&#8208;fold tertiary protein structure prediction unambiguously distinguished mysD from d&#8208;Ala&#8208;d&#8208;Ala ligase, and the generic name mycosporine&#8208;glycine&#8208;amine ligase (MG&#8208;amine ligase) is proposed.







Abstract
Mycosporine&#8208;like amino acids (MAAs) are natural UV&#8208;absorbing sunscreens that evolved in cyanobacteria and algae to palliate harmful effects from obligatory exposure to solar radiation. Multiple lines of evidence prove that in cyanobacteria all MAAs are derived from mycosporine&#8208;glycine, which is typically modified by an ATP&#8208;dependent ligase encoded by the gene mysD. The function of the mysD ligase has been experimentally described but haphazardly named based solely upon sequence similarity to the d&#8208;alanine&#8208;d&#8208;alanine ligase of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Combining phylogeny and alpha&#8208;fold tertiary protein structure prediction unambiguously distinguished mysD from d&#8208;alanine&#8208;d&#8208;alanine ligase. The renaming of mysD to mycosporine&#8208;glycine&#8208;amine ligase (MG&#8208;amine ligase) using recognised enzymology rules of nomenclature is, therefore, proposed, and considers relaxed specificity for several different amino acid substrates. The evolutionary and ecological context of MG&#8208;amine ligase catalysis merits wider appreciation especially when considering exploiting cyanobacteria for biotechnology, for example, producing mixtures of MAAs with enhanced optical or antioxidant properties.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Closure on the Rocks in a Prebiotic Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Did analogues of metabolic reactions occur in a geochemical context on the early Earth? We have attempted to reproduce the cyclisation step of the orotate pathway of pyrimidines biosynthesis on mineral surfaces chosen for their type of reactivity and similarity to enzymes that carry out the same reaction. Diverse outcomes were observed, with extensive cyclization on some supports, favouring however 5&#8208;cycles (hydantoins) rather than the biological 6&#8208;cycle.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;closure is a key step in current pyrimidine anabolism and one may wonder whether cyclisation reactions could be promoted in the geochemical context at the origins of life, i.&#8201;e. with the help of minerals. Various prebiotic minerals were tested in this work, including silica, carbonates, microporous minerals. In particular, the role of zinc ions supported on minerals was investigated in view of its presence in the catalytic site of cyclic amidohydrolase enzymes. Based on in&#8197;situ (TGA: ThermoGravimetric Analysis, ATR&#8208;IR: Attenuated Total Reflectance&#8208;InfraRed) and ex situ (1H NMR&#8208; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) characterisations, we identified the products of thermal activation of NCA (N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;aspartic acid) in wetting&#8208;and&#8208;drying scenarios on the surface of minerals. NCA can cyclize extensively only on some surfaces, with the predominant product being 5&#8208;carboxymethylhydantoin (Hy) rather than dihydroorotate (DHO), while there is a competition with hydrolysis on others. Replacing the enzymes with heterogeneous catalysts also works with other reactions catalysed by enzymes of the cyclic amidohydrolases family. The role of the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of minerals as well as the regioselectivity of the cyclisation (5&#8208;carboxymethylhydantoin versus dihydroorotate) are examined.

         <title>Mapping the Chemical Space of Active&#8208;Site Targeted Covalent Ligands for Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent chemical probes and inhibitors for tyrosine phosphatases have historically been challenging to develop. We report the characterization of diverse cysteine&#8208;reactive electrophiles and fragment&#8208;like scaffolds as covalent ligands for tyrosine phosphatases. Our investigation reveals chemical constraints for tyrosine phosphatase covalent inhibitor design and sheds light on the structural features of phosphatases that govern their susceptibility to covalent inhibition.







Abstract
Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are an important class of enzymes that modulate essential cellular processes through protein dephosphorylation and are dysregulated in various disease states. There is demand for new compounds that target the active sites of these enzymes, for use as chemical tools to dissect their biological roles or as leads for the development of new therapeutics. In this study, we explore an array of electrophiles and fragment scaffolds to investigate the required chemical parameters for covalent inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Our analysis juxtaposes the intrinsic electrophilicity of these compounds with their potency against several classical PTPs, revealing chemotypes that inhibit tyrosine phosphatases while minimizing excessive, potentially non&#8208;specific reactivity. We also assess sequence divergence at key residues in PTPs to explain their differential susceptibility to covalent inhibition. We anticipate that our study will inspire new strategies to develop covalent probes and inhibitors for tyrosine phosphatases.

         <title>Phase Separation in cGAS&#8208;STING Signaling: Cytosolic DNA Sensing and Regulatory Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cGAS&#8208;STING signaling is an important pathway in DNA sensing and innate immune response. It is tightly linked with pathological process including cancers, virus infections, and inflammatory diseases. The LLPS between cGAS and dsDNA determines the activation ability of cGAS directly.







Abstract
Phase separation is a crucial biophysical process that governs cellular signaling and function. This process allows biomolecules to separate and form membraneless compartments in response to both extra&#8208; and intra&#8208;cellular stimuli. Recently, the identification of phase separation in different immune signaling pathways, including the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway, has shed light on its tight association with pathological processes such as viral infections, cancers, and inflammatory diseases. In this review, we present the phase separation in cGAS&#8208;STING signaling, along with its related cellular regulatory functions. Furthermore, we discuss the introduction of therapeutics targeting cGAS&#8208;STING signaling, which plays a pivotal role in cancer progression.

         <title>Using Holographic Microscopy To Measure the Effect of Confinement on Crowding Agents in Lipid Vesicles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have used digital holographic microscopy to investigate whether confinement within a cell&#8208;sized lipid bilayer vesicle impacts the diffusion of a colloidal tracer. While lipid bilayers do not appear to impede diffusion for sucrose or dextran in the dilute regime, the diffusion is significantly slower for particles trapped in a vesicle containing poly(ethylene glycol) in the semidilute regime.







Abstract
The hydrodynamic effects of macromolecular crowding inside cells are often studied in&#8197;vitro by using polymers as crowding agents. Confinement of polymers inside cell&#8208;sized droplets has been shown to affect the diffusion of small molecules. Here we develop a method, based on digital holographic microscopy, to measure the diffusion of polystyrene microspheres that are confined within lipid vesicles containing a high concentration of solute. We apply the method to three solutes of varying complexity: sucrose, dextran, and PEG, prepared at &#8764;7&#8201;% (w/w). We find that diffusion inside and outside the vesicles is the same when the solute is sucrose or dextran that is prepared below the critical overlap concentration. For poly(ethylene glycol), which is present at a concentration higher than the critical overlap concentration, the diffusion of microspheres inside vesicles is slower, hinting at the potential effects of confinement on crowding agents.

         <title>Impact of Divalent Metal Ions on Regulation of Trans&#8208;Cleavage Activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explored the mechanism by which divalent metal ions affect the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of LbuCas13a through molecular dynamics simulations combined with in&#8197;vitro experiments. These results provide new insight into the role of divalent metal ions in LbuCas13a and practical application for amplified RNA detection using ion combination.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;LbuCas13a has emerged as a revolutionary tool for in&#8197;vitro diagnosis. Similar to other Cas effectors, LbuCas13a requires Mg2+ to maintain its nuclease activity. However, the effect of other divalent metal ions on its trans&#8208;cleavage activity remains less explored. Herein, we addressed this issue by combining experimental and molecular dynamics simulation analysis. In vitro studies showed that both Mn2+ and Ca2+ could replace Mg2+ as cofactors of LbuCas13a. In contrast, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, or Fe2+ inhibits the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;cleavage activity, while Pb2+ does not affect it. Importantly, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that calcium, magnesium, and manganese hydrated ions have a strong affinity to nucleotide bases, thus stabilizing the conformation of crRNA repeat region and enhancing the trans&#8208;cleavage activity. Finally, we showed that combination of Mg2+ and Mn2+ can further enhance the trans&#8208;cleavage activity to allow amplified RNA detection, revealing its potential advantage for in&#8197;vitro diagnosis.

Herein, we addressed this issue by combining experimental and molecular dynamics simulation analysis. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that both Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; could replace Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as cofactors of LbuCas13a. In contrast, Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits the &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;cleavage activity, while Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; does not affect it. Importantly, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that calcium, magnesium, and manganese hydrated ions have a strong affinity to nucleotide bases, thus stabilizing the conformation of crRNA repeat region and enhancing the trans-cleavage activity. Finally, we showed that combination of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can further enhance the trans-cleavage activity to allow amplified RNA detection, revealing its potential advantage for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A monolithic catalyst of Filler&#8208;CA@Lys&#8208;HOF&#8208;1 (FCLH) was prepared by coating chemical sorption of CA on the surface of the filler followed by the coating of Lys&#8208;HOF&#8208;1. The highest catalytic activity of FCLH was obtained by regulating the amount of HOF&#8208;1 monomer added. Due to the protection of Lys&#8208;HOF&#8208;1, the FCLH showed good tolerance against acidity and salinity, which could retain about 80.2&#8201;% of the original activity after 9&#8197;h incubation in simulated seawater. The catalytic activity of FCLH could retain 85.4&#8201;% of the initial activity after 10 cycles. In short, we may offer a promising biocatalyst for carbon mineralization, which may drive down carbon emissions when used for CO2 capture and conversion on offshore platforms.







Abstract
Exhausted emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from ships or offshore platforms has become one of the major contributors to global carbon emissions. Enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase (CA) have been widely used for CO2 mineralization because of their high catalytic rate. However, CA in seawater is easy to inactivate and difficult to reuse. Immobilization would be a feasible solution to address the stability issue, which, however, may cause an increase of internal diffusion resistance and reduced catalytic activity. In this regard, design of high&#8208;performance biocatalysts for acquiring high catalytic activity and stability of CA is highly desirable. Herein, a monolithic catalyst of Filler&#8208;CA@Lys&#8208;HOF&#8208;1 (FCLH) was prepared by chemical sorption of CA on the surface of the Filler followed by the coating of Lys&#8208;HOF&#8208;1. The highest catalytic activity of FCLH was obtained by regulating the amount of HOF&#8208;1 monomer added.

The catalytic activity of FCLH could retain 85.4&#8201;% of the initial activity after 10 cycles. Hopefully, our study can provide a promising biocatalyst for CO2 mineralization, which may drive down carbon emissions when used for CO2 capture and conversion on offshore platforms.

         <title>Synthetic approaches of epoxysuccinate chemical probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic chemical probes are powerful tools for investigation of biological processes. They are particularly useful for proteomic studies such as Activity Based Protein Profiling (ABPP). These chemical methods initially used mimics of natural substrates. As the techniques gained prominence, more and more elaborated chemical probes with increased specificity towards given enzyme/protein families and amenability to various reaction conditions have been used. Among chemical probes, peptidyl&#8208;epoxysuccinates represent one of the first type of compounds used to investigate activity of cysteine proteases papain&#8208;like family of enzymes. Structurally derived from the natural substrate to date exists a wide body of inhibitors and activity&#8208; or affinity&#8208;based probes bearing the electrophilic oxirane unit for covalent labelling of active enzymes. Herein we review the literature regarding the synthetic approaches to epoxysuccinate&#8208;based chemical probes together with the reported applications, from biological chemistry and inhibition studies to supramolecular chemistry and formation of protein arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>A RaPID macrocyclic peptide that inhibits the formation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein amyloid fibrils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is considerable interest in drug discovery targeting at the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) since this molecular process is closely associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. However, inhibiting &#945;Syn aggregation remains as a major challenge because of its highly dynamic nature that makes it difficult to form a stable binding complex with a drug molecule. Here, by exploiting Random non&#8208;standard Peptides Integrated Discovery (RaPID) system, we identified a macrocyclic peptide, BD1, that could interact with immobilized &#945;Syn and inhibit the formation of fibrils. Furthermore, improving the solubility of BD1 suppresses the co&#8208;aggregation with &#945;Syn fibrils while it kinetically inhibits more effectively without change in their morphology. We also revealed the molecular mechanism of kinetic inhibition, where peptides bind to fibril ends of &#945;Syn, thereby preventing further growth of fibrils. These results suggest that our approach for generating non&#8208;standard macrocyclic peptides is a promising approach for developing potential therapeutics against neurodegeneration.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Ureidopeptide Natural Products Macrocyclized via Indole N&#8208;acylation in Marine Microbulbifer spp. Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commensal bacteria associated with marine invertebrates are underappreciated sources of chemically novel natural products. Using mass spectrometry, we had previously detected the presence of peptidic natural products in obligate marine bacteria of the genus Microbulbifer cultured from marine sponges. In this report, the isolation and&#160;structural characterization of a panel of ureidohexapeptide natural products, termed the bulbiferamides, from Microbulbifer strains is reported wherein the tryptophan side chain indole participates in a macrocyclizing peptide bond formation. Genome sequencing identifies biosynthetic gene clusters encoding production of the bulbiferamides and implicates the involvement of a thioesterase in the indolic macrocycle formation. The structural diversity and widespread presence of bulbiferamides in commensal microbiomes of marine invertebrates point toward a possible ecological role for these natural products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging modality, highly employed in research and clinical settings. However, MRI images suffers from low signals and lack of target specificity. We aimed to develop a multimodal imaging probe to detect targeted&#8208;cells by MRI and fluorescence microscopy. We synthesized a tri&#8208;functional imaging probe consisting of a SNAP&#8208;tag substrate for irreversible and specific labeling of cells, cyanine dyes for bright fluorescence, and a chelated Gd(III) molecule for enhancing MRI&#8208;contrast. Our probes exhibit specific and efficient labelling of genetically&#8208;defined cells (expressing SNAP at their membrane), bright fluorescence and MRI signal. Our synthetic approach provides a versatile platform for production of multimodal imaging probes, particularly for light microscopy and MRI.</dc:description>

         <title>A clickable photosystem I, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin NADP+ reductase fusion system for light&#8208;driven NADPH regeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic organisms like plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use light for the regeneration of dihydronicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The process starts with the light&#8208;driven oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII) and the released electrons are transferred via the cytochrome b6f complex towards photosystem I (PSI). This membrane protein complex is responsible for the light&#8208;driven reduction of the soluble electron mediator ferredoxin (Fd), which passes the electrons to ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR). Finally, NADPH is regenerated by FNR at the end of the electron transfer chain. In this study, we established a clickable fusion system for in vitro NADPH regeneration with PSI&#8208;Fd and PSI&#8208;Fd&#8208;FNR, respectively. For this, we fused immunity protein 7 (Im7) to the C&#8208;terminus of the PSI&#8208;PsaE subunit in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Furthermore, colicin DNase E7 (E7) fusion chimeras of Fd and FNR with varying linker domains were expressed in E. coli. Isolated Im7&#8208;PSI was coupled with the E7&#8208;Fd or E7&#8208;Fd&#8208;FNR fusion proteins through highaffinity binding of the E7/Im7 protein pair. The corresponding complexes were tested for NADPH regeneration capacity in comparison to the free protein systems demonstrating the general applicability of the strategy.</dc:description>

This membrane protein complex is responsible for the light-driven reduction of the soluble electron mediator ferredoxin (Fd), which passes the electrons to ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR). Finally, NADPH is regenerated by FNR at the end of the electron transfer chain. In this study, we established a clickable fusion system for in vitro NADPH regeneration with PSI-Fd and PSI-Fd-FNR, respectively. For this, we fused immunity protein 7 (Im7) to the C-terminus of the PSI-PsaE subunit in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Furthermore, colicin DNase E7 (E7) fusion chimeras of Fd and FNR with varying linker domains were expressed in E. coli. Isolated Im7-PSI was coupled with the E7-Fd or E7-Fd-FNR fusion proteins through highaffinity binding of the E7/Im7 protein pair. The corresponding complexes were tested for NADPH regeneration capacity in comparison to the free protein systems demonstrating the general applicability of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development and characterization of selective FAK inhibitors and PROTACs with in vivo activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an attractive drug target due to its overexpression in cancer. FAK functions as a non&#8208;receptor tyrosine kinase and scaffolding protein, coordinating several downstream signaling effectors and cellular processes. While drug discovery efforts have largely focused on targeting FAK kinase activity, FAK inhibitors have failed to show efficacy as single agents in clinical trials. Here, using structure&#8208;guided design, we report the development of a selective FAK inhibitor (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;175) and degrader (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146) to evaluate the consequences and advantages of abolishing all FAK activity in cancer models. BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 achieves rapid and potent FAK degradation with high proteome&#8208;wide specificity in cancer cells and induces durable degradation in mice. Compared to kinase inhibition, targeted degradation of FAK exhibits pronounced improved activity on downstream signaling and cancer cell viability and migration. Together, BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;175 and BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 are valuable chemical tools to dissect the specific consequences of targeting FAK through small molecule inhibition or degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the Boundaries of Structural Heterogeneity with the Lipid A of Marine Bacteria Cellulophaga</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipopolysaccharide and its lipid A from marine bacteria are a chemical gold for the development of new adjuvants and immune therapeutics. Here we defined the structure of three marine Cellulophaga species and the TLR4 activation potential of their lipopolysaccharide. An extreme structural heterogeneity has been disclosed that resulted in a weak TLR4 immunostimulatory capacity for two of the species analyzed.







Abstract
Marine bacteria, which are often described as chemical gold, are considered an exceptional source of new therapeutics. Considerable research interest has been given to lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), the main components of the Gram&#8208;negative outer membrane. LPS and its lipid A portion from marine bacteria are known to exhibit a tricky chemistry that has been often associated with intriguing properties such as behaving as immune adjuvants or anti&#8208;sepsis molecules. In this scenario, we report the structural determination of the lipid A from three marine bacteria within the Cellulophaga genus, which showed to produce an extremely heterogenous blend of tetra&#8208; to hexa&#8208;acylated lipid A species, mostly carrying one phosphate and one D&#8208;mannose on the glucosamine disaccharide backbone. The ability of the three LPSs in activating TLR4 signaling revealed a weaker immunopotential by C. baltica NNO 15840T and C. tyrosinoxydans EM41T, while C. algicola ACAM 630T behaved as a more potent TLR4 activator.

         <title>Biophysical and Computational Approaches to Study Ternary Complexes: A &#8216;Cooperative Relationship&#8217; to Rationalize Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of biophysical and computational methodology used in the targeted protein degradation field, emphasizing the importance of high&#8208;quality data for the accurate computation of degrader&#8208;induced ternary complex models.







Abstract
Degraders have illustrated that compound&#8208;induced proximity to E3 ubiquitin ligases can prompt the ubiquitination and degradation of disease&#8208;relevant proteins. Hence, this pharmacology is becoming a promising alternative and complement to available therapeutic interventions (e.&#8201;g., inhibitors). Degraders rely on protein binding instead of inhibition and, hence, they hold the promise to broaden the druggable proteome. Biophysical and structural biology approaches have been the cornerstone of understanding and rationalizing degrader&#8208;induced ternary complex formation. Computational models have now started to harness the experimental data from these approaches with the aim to identify and rationally help design new degraders. This review outlines the current experimental and computational strategies used to study ternary complex formation and degradation and highlights the importance of effective crosstalk between these approaches in the advancement of the targeted protein degradation (TPD) field. As our understanding of the molecular features that govern drug&#8208;induced interactions grows, faster optimizations and superior therapeutic innovations for TPD and other proximity&#8208;inducing modalities are sure to follow.

         <title>Light Chain Q166C Mutation Permits One&#8208;step Site Specific Conjugation on Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineered cysteines are frequently used for site&#8208;specific conjugation in antibody&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC) development. When cysteine&#8208;engineered mAbs are produced in the cell culture process, the sulfhydryl groups on the engineered cysteines are mostly in an oxidized form. The oxidized cysteines require multiple steps (such as reduction, reoxidation, and buffer exchanges) to reactivate for bioconjugation, which complicates the ADC production process and reduces yields. In this study, we identified a Q166C mutation in the light chain that allows the presence of free sulfhydryl groups during cell culture and purification process. This mutation is in the constant region and away from sites involved in antigen binding or Fc&#8208;mediated functions. The free sulfhydryl reacts readily with maleimide in a mild solution at a high conjugation rate. This is only the second such site reported (the first one is Q124C in the light chain). Using the Q166C mutation, we conjugated an anti&#8208;angiopoietin&#8208;2 (Ang&#8208;2) peptide on bevacizumab, an anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, to construct a peptide antibody conjugate, Ava&#8208;Plus, which could block two pro&#8208;angiogenic factors simultaneously. Ava&#8208;Plus showed high affinity for both VEGF and Ang&#8208;2 and demonstrated higher activity than bevacizumab in in vitro cell migration and in vivo mouse xenograft models.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Effects of Mutagenesis on FusionRed by Using Excited&#8208;State QM/MM Dynamics and Classical Force Field Simulations
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three computationally tested variants of the FusionRed protein are on display in glass cloche bells. All three platforms are colored by the excitation wavelength of FusionRed, while each protein structure is colored by the emission wavelengths. Additionally, the experimentally demonstrated increased fluorescence of C158I is represented by the brighter light emission strength of the structure, and our predicted return of the A157N/C158I variant to a WT&#8208;like behavior is shown by the reduced brightness. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. R. Walker et al.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive and Reversible A&#8208;Motif&#8208;Based DNA Hydrogel: Synthesis and Biosensing Application
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly&#8208;dA can form noncanonical duplexes at acidic pH. DNA three&#8208;way junctions with poly&#8208;dA stretches can form supramolecular hydrogels under acidic conditions thereby providing a pH&#8208;responsive, reversible DNA hydrogel that can be used for sensing foreign nucleic acid strands.







Abstract
Functional DNA hydrogels with various motifs and functional groups require perfect sequence design to avoid cross&#8208;bonding interference with themselves or other structural sequences. This work reports an A&#8208;motif functional DNA hydrogel that does not require any sequence design. A&#8208;motif DNA is a noncanonical parallel DNA duplex structure containing homopolymeric deoxyadenosines (poly&#8208;dA) strands that undergo conformation changes from single strands at neutral pH to a parallel duplex DNA helix at acidic pH. Despite this and other advantages over other DNA motifs like no cross&#8208;bonding interference with other structural sequences, the A&#8208;motif has not been explored much. We successfully synthesized a DNA hydrogel by using an A&#8208;motif as a reversible handle to polymerize a DNA three&#8208;way junction. The A&#8208;motif hydrogel was initially characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and dynamic light scattering, which showed the formation of higher&#8208;order structures. Further, we used imaging techniques like atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscope to validating its hydrogel like highly branched morphology. pH&#8208;induced conformation transformation from monomers to gel is quick and reversible, and was analysed for multiple acid&#8208;base cycles. The sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel transitions and gelation properties were further examined in rheological studies. The use of the A&#8208;motif hydrogel in the visual detection of pathogenic target nucleic acid sequence was demonstrated for the first time in a capillary assay. Moreover, pH&#8208;induced hydrogel formation was observed in&#8197;situ as a layer over the mammalian cells. The proposed A&#8208;motif DNA scaffold has enormous potential in designing stimuli&#8208;responsive nanostructures that can be used for many biological applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poly&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;dA can form noncanonical duplexes&lt;/b&gt; at acidic pH. DNA three-way junctions with poly-dA stretches can form supramolecular hydrogels under acidic conditions thereby providing a pH-responsive, reversible DNA hydrogel that can be used for sensing foreign nucleic acid strands.

         <title>FerryCalin: an Engineered Lipocalin Protein Directed against the Transferrin Receptor with Potential for Brain Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transferrin receptor (TfR) mediates transcytosis across the blood&#8211;brain barrier, thus enabling the non&#8208;invasive delivery of therapeutics into the brain, for example as fusion proteins with the single&#8208;chain Fv of the antibody 8D3. As a robust alternative, we have developed a cognate Anticalin, dubbed FerryCalin, based on the human lipocalin 2, an abundant plasma protein. With its dynamic binding behavior and its epitope remote from the transferrin binding site, FerryCalin offers a potential vehicle for the brain delivery of biopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
The transferrin receptor (TfR) mediates transcytosis across the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which offers a promising approach for the non&#8208;invasive delivery of therapeutics into the brain parenchyma. Employing the recombinant homodimeric murine TfR ectodomain, prepared in a biochemically functional state, we have selected a cognate Anticalin via phage display and bacterial cell surface display from a random library based on the human lipocalin 2 (Lcn2). After affinity maturation, several engineered lipocalin variants were identified that bind murine TfR in a non&#8208;competitive manner with the natural ligand (transferrin&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Fe3+), among those an Anticalin &#8211; dubbed FerryCalin &#8211; exhibiting a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.8&#8197;nM. Epitope analysis using the SPOT technique revealed a sequential epitope in a surface region of TfR remote from the transferrin&#8208;binding site. Due to the fast kon rate and short complex half&#8208;life, as evidenced by real&#8208;time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, FerryCalin, or one of its related mutants, shows characteristics as a potential vehicle for the brain delivery of biopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Replication Protein A Enhances Kinetics of Uracil DNA Glycosylase on ssDNA and Across DNA Junctions: Explored with a DNA Repair Complex Produced with SpyCatcher/SpyTag Ligation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SpyCatcher/SpyTag ligation was used to produce a covalent complex containing DNA repair proteins replication protein A (RPA) and uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2). By comparing its activity to the wild&#8208;type proteins, we assigned functions specific to the complex and investigated the mechanisms used by RPA to target UNG2 towards uracil bases in ssDNA and at ssDNA&#8722;dsDNA junctions.







Abstract
DNA repair proteins participate in extensive protein&#8722;protein interactions that promote the formation of DNA repair complexes. To understand how complex formation affects protein function during base excision repair, we used SpyCatcher/SpyTag ligation to produce a covalent complex between human uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2) and replication protein A (RPA). Our covalent &#8220;RPA&#8722;Spy&#8722;UNG2&#8221; complex could identify and excise uracil bases in duplex areas next to ssDNA&#8722;dsDNA junctions slightly faster than the wild&#8208;type proteins, but this was highly dependent on DNA structure, as the turnover of the RPA&#8722;Spy&#8722;UNG2 complex slowed at DNA junctions where RPA tightly engaged long ssDNA sections. Conversely, the enzymes preferred uracil sites in ssDNA where RPA strongly enhanced uracil excision by UNG2 regardless of ssDNA length. Finally, RPA was found to promote UNG2 excision of two uracil sites positioned across a ssDNA&#8722;dsDNA junction, and dissociation of UNG2 from RPA enhanced this process. Our approach of ligating together RPA and UNG2 to reveal how complex formation affects enzyme function could be applied to examine other assemblies of DNA repair proteins.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioconjugation of chemical entities to biologically active proteins has increased our insight in the inner workings of a cell and resulted in novel therapeutic agents. A current challenge is the efficient generation of homogeneous conjugates of native proteins, not only when isolated, but also when still present in their native environment. To do this, various features of protein&#8208;modifying enzymes have been combined in artificial constructs. In this concept, the current status of this approach is evaluated, and the interplay between designs and protein modification will be discussed. Particular focus is directed on the protein&#8208;binding anchor, the chemistry that is used for the modification, and the linker that connects these two units. Suggestions how to include additional elements such as a trigger&#8208;responsive switch that regulated protein modification are also presented.</dc:description>

eukaryotic cells. Co&#8208;localization experiments revealed that the ligand/plasmid complex is taken upviathe endosomal pathway

         <title>Chemical zymogens: specificity and steroidal control of reactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activation and masking of enzymatic activity on demand is of the highest importance in nature. It is achieved via chemical interconversion of enzymes and the corresponding zymogens through, for example, proteolytic processing or reversible phosphorylation, and affords on&#8208;demand activation of enzymes, controlled in space and/or time. In stark contrast, examples of chemical zymogens are very few, and in most cases these are based on the disulfide chemistry, which is largely indiscriminate to the nature of the activating thiol. In this work, we address an outstanding challenge of specificity of reactivation of chemical zymogens. We achieve this through engineering affinity between the chemical zymogen and the activator. Additional, higher level control over zymogen reactivation is installed in a nature&#8208;mimicking approach using steroidal hormones. Taken together, results of this study take a step towards establishing specificity of reactivation of synthetic, chemical zymogens. We anticipate that results of this study contribute significantly to the development of chemical zymogens as tools for diverse use in chemical biology and biotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Phospholipid&#8208;Coated Boronic Oxide Nanoparticles as a Boron Agent for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minimally invasive boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is one of the elegant approaches for cancer treatment. The deliverability of boron agents to cancer cells with high selectivity and efficiency is the key to maximizing the therapeutic benefits of BNCT. In addition, the enhancement of the frequencies to achieve a boron neutron capture reaction is also significant in improving therapeutic efficacy by providing a highly concentrated boron agent in each boron nanoparticle. Since the density of the thermal neutron beam remains low, it is unable to induce high&#8208;efficiency cell destruction. Herein, we report phospholipid&#8208;coated boronic oxide nanoparticles as a boron agent for BNCT, which can provide a highly concentrated boron atom in each nanoparticle. The current system exhibited BNCT activity seven&#8208;fold higher than the commercially applicable boron agents in vitro. Furthermore, the system could penetrate cancer spheroids deeply, efficiently suppressing thermal neutron irradiation&#8208;induced growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Isotope&#8208;Guided Metabolomics Reveals Divergent Incorporation of Valine into Different Flavor Precursor Classes in Chives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowing your onions: To investigate flavor precursor biosynthesis in chives (Allium schoenoprasum), untargeted metabolomics was used to trace metabolites with sulfur and 13C labels from valine&#8208;13C5 isotope labeling experiments. Surprisingly, propenyl&#8208;bearing metabolites exhibited a much stronger incorporation of carbon from valine into their side chains than their propyl&#8208;bearing analogs, despite their close structural similarity.







Abstract
Plants of the genus Allium such as chives, onions or garlic produce S&#8208;alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides as flavor precursors. Two major representatives are S&#8208;propenyl cysteine sulfoxide (isoalliin) and S&#8208;propyl cysteine sulfoxide (propiin), which only differ by a double bond in the C3 side chain. The propenyl group of isoalliin is derived from the amino acid valine, but the source of the propyl group of propiin remains unclear. Here, we present an untargeted metabolomics approach in seedlings of chives (Allium schoenoprasum) to track mass features containing sulfur and/or 13C from labeling experiments with valine&#8208;13C5 guided by their isotope signatures. Our data show that propiin and related propyl&#8208;bearing metabolites incorporate carbon derived from valine&#8208;13C5, but to a much lesser extent than isoalliin and related propenyl compounds. Our findings provide new insights into the biosynthetic pathways of flavor precursors in Allium species and open new avenues for future untargeted labeling experiments.

         <title>Styryl&#8208;NIR Mitochondrial Probes with Rapid HOCl Detection in Live&#8208;Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is critical for maintaining immune system balance, but it can harm mitochondria by hindering enzyme activity, leading to decreased ATP and increased cell death. In this study, we have designed a fluorophore with a pyridinium scaffold for selective staining of the mitochondria and to detect hypochlorite. The fluorophore exhibits strong solvatochromic emission due to intramolecular charge transfer and excellent sub&#8208;cellular localization in the mitochondria. Additionally, it shows a rapid response to HOCl with high selectivity among different reactive oxygen/nitrogen compounds with a detection limit of 2.31&#956;M. Moreover, it is also utilized for the exogenous and endogenous detection of HOCl in live cells, which may help study the role of hypochlorite in organelles at the cellular level. DFT and TDDFT calculations have been carried out to understand the relationship between the structure and properties of the cationic probes with respect to the &#945;&#8208;cyano substitution and extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The selective detection of HOCl by C4 over other cationic probes has also been well&#8208;demonstrated, showing how the binding of HOCl affects the electronic properties of C4 through the analysis of non&#8208;bonding orbitals (NBO) population, electrostatic potential surface (ESP), and density of states (DOS) projected DOS investigations</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Synthesizing and Enhancing the Immune Response of Cancer Vaccines Based on MUC1 Glycopeptide Antigens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MUC1 glycopeptide antigens: Cancer vaccines are based on a vaccinology strategy whereby the patient's immune system is harnessed to induce a specific immune response to kill cancer cells. Glycoprotein mucin&#8197;1 (MUC1), which is overexpressed and poorly glycosylated on cancer cells, is one of the most promising candidates for the development of new cancer vaccines. However, it should be noted that mucin&#8208;like glycopeptides are poorly immunogenic and unable to elicit effective and long&#8208;lasting immune responses. Therefore, MUC1&#8208;derived tumor antigens need to be conjugated with immune activators. The process of reasonable design and evaluation of tumor vaccine based on MUC1 can be generally divided into three steps. Firstly, it is necessary to obtain pure and structural identified MUC1 protein&#8208;related antigens, mainly including tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs), non&#8208;glycosylated MUC1 variable&#8208;number tandem repeat (VNTR) polypeptide, and MUC1 glycopeptides. Secondly, the immunogenicity of the vaccine can be improved by introducing T cell epitopes, immune activating molecules or some nano delivery systems. Finally, wild type (WT) mice or transgenic (Tg) mice can be immunized to evaluate the efficacy of the designed vaccines.

         <title>Exploring the Effects of Mutagenesis on FusionRed by Using Excited&#8208;State QM/MM Dynamics and Classical Force Field Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Predicted mutation of FusionRed variants leads to partial restoration of photoisomerization activity via enhanced solvent effects and reduced hydrophobic interactions in the barrel. We apply QM/MM excited state dynamics to reveal the effects of protein structure on fluorescence quantum yield of FusionRed in WT, C158I, and A157N/C158I variants.







Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are a powerful tool for examining tissues, cells, and subcellular components in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. FusionRed is a particular FP variant mutated from mKate2 that, in addition to lower cytotoxicity and aggregation rates, has shown potential for acting as a tunable photoswitch. This was posited to stem partially from the presence of a bulky side chain at position 158 and a further stabilizing residue at position 157. In this work, we apply computational techniques including classical molecular dynamics (MD) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations (QM/MM) to explore the effect of mutagenesis at these locations in FusionRed on the chromophore structure, the excited&#8208;state surface, and relative positional stability of the chromophore in the protein pocket. We find specific connections between the statistical sampling of the underlying protein structure and the nonradiative decay mechanisms from excited&#8208;state dynamics. A single mutation (C158I) that restricts the motion of the chromophore through a favorable hydrophobic interaction corresponds to an increase in fluorescence quantum yield (FQY), while a second rescue mutation (C158I&#8208;A157N) partially restores the flexibility of the chromophore and photoswitchability with favorable water interactions on the surface of the protein that counteracts the original interaction. We suggest that applying this understanding of structural features that inhibit or favor rotation on the excited state can be applied for rational design of new, tunable and red photoswitches.

         <title>Reflections on the Origin and Early Evolution of the Genetic Code</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A primordial anti&#8208;messenger RNA composed only of adenosine and uracil nucleotides is proposed 1)&#8197;to contain anticodons for a maximum of eight different amino acids (left) and, consequently, be able to form short active polypeptides and 2)&#8197;to fold as a hairpin RNA adaptor exposing one of the anticodons for the formation of a specific amino acyl species (right).







Abstract
Examination of the genetic code (GeCo) reveals that amino acids coded by (A/U) codons display a large functional spectrum and bind RNA whereas, except for Arg, those coded by (G/C) codons do not. From a stereochemical viewpoint, the clear preference for (A/U)&#8208;rich codons to be located at the GeCo half blocks suggests they were specifically determined. Conversely, the overall lower affinity of cognate amino acids for their (G/C)&#8208;rich anticodons points to their late arrival to the GeCo. It is proposed that i)&#8197;initially the code was composed of the eight (A/U) codons; ii)&#8197;these codons were duplicated when G/C nucleotides were added to their wobble positions, and three new codons with G/C in their first position were incorporated; and iii)&#8197;a combination of A/U and G/C nucleotides progressively generated the remaining codons.

         <title>Tracking the Message: Applying Single Molecule Localization Microscopy to Cellular RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The super microscope illustrates the power of super resolution microscopy to provide unprecedented insight into RNA biology. Beyond sequence, the function of these biomolecules is linked to their localization. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has the power to decipher this crucial feature at nanometric resolution. However, this capability relies on the design of molecular recognition systems to bring the right label to the right RNA with minimal artifacts. We hope that our review inspires researchers to develop creative RNA labeling approaches that leverage the power of SMLM. Design by B. Arnould and A. Quillin. More information can be found in the Review by B. Arnould et al.

         <title>SCF&#8208;ChemBio: Chemical Biology Tour de France</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Created in 2020, SCF&#8208;ChemBio aims to promote the French community of chemical biologists. In this Tour de France, we asked researchers from this community to illustrate the strength, originality and diversity of their work.







Abstract
Chemical biology is a steadily growing field that has traditionally struggled to clearly define its boundaries in a short sentence. However, it can be stated that through the development of chemical and physicochemical tools, concepts and methods, chemical biology aims to address or stimulate biological questions at the molecular level in living organisms. Chemical biologists design and develop molecular tools that can probe or modulate biological processes, in order to understand their function, and sometimes to modify it for specific applications, but also to observe and analyze these tools in complex biological environments. Essentially positioned as a fundamental approach, chemical biology often remains very close to potential applications as it builds molecular objects capable of reacting to a significant biological stimulus. Chemical biology therefore finds natural development in fields such as health for the design of drugs and diagnostic systems or the environment for applications in crop science and ecology.

         <title>Capturing Covalent Catalytic Intermediates by Enzyme Mutants: Recent Advances in Methodologies and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism&#8208;based trapping strategies for capturing transient covalent catalytic intermediates are reviewed here. The applications of enzyme mutant&#8208;based traps in mechanism studies, substrate discovery, and labeling for diagnosis and functionalization are described with representative examples.







Abstract
Covalent catalytic intermediates provide valuable information for revealing the catalytic mechanism, probing the enzyme activity and identifying substrate specificity. However, naturally formed covalent intermediates are too rapidly degraded for general biological studies. In order to capture transient covalent intermediates, a variety of chemical strategies have been developed over decades to extend the half&#8208;life of the enzyme&#8208;substrate intermediates (or close analogues) required for the downstream structural and functional studies. This review summarizes three general mechanism&#8208;based strategies for trapping covalent catalytic intermediates. In particular, enzyme mutant&#8208;based approaches, especially the introduction of genetically encoded 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid to replace the catalytic cysteine/serine in proteases for acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate trapping are described. In addition, the applications of trapped intermediates in structural, functional and protein labeling studies are presented, and the potential new directions of using enzyme substrate traps are discussed at the end of the review.

         <title>Protein Backbone Alteration in Non&#8208;Hairpin &#946;&#8208;Turns: Impacts on Tertiary Folded Structure and Folded Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone modification in &#946;&#8208;turns is vital in the development of protein mimetics. Prior work has focused on the subset of turns that join strands of a &#946;&#8208;sheet. The cover image, rendered in a style inspired by Pittsburgh native Andy Warhol, depicts four modification schemes among a series examined in a helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix domain. Optimal artificial residue placement yields variants of the prototype sequence with native&#8208;like tertiary structure and improved thermal stability. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. W. Harmon and W. S. Horne.

         <title>Epitopes displayed in a cyclic peptide scaffold bind SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus that causes COVID&#8208;19 is a global health issue. The spread of the virus has resulted in more than six million deaths to date. The emergence of new viral strains highlights the importance of continuous surveillance of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus, using timely and accurate diagnostic tools. Here, we used stable cyclic peptide scaffolds to present antigenic sequences derived from spike protein, reactive to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies. Using peptide sequences from different domains of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, we grafted epitopes on the peptide scaffold sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI&#8208;1). These scaffold peptides were then used to develop a SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 ELISA to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies in serum. We show that displaying epitopes in the scaffold improves reactivity overall. One of the scaffold peptides (S2_1146&#8208;1161_c) has reactivity equal to commercial assays, and shows diagnostic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress on Cyclic Peptides Assembly and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are important building blocks for constructing functional structures and have been applied in various fields. Considering the significant structural and functional roles of cyclic peptides in materials science and the attributed biophysical advantages, we provide an overview of cyclic peptide types that can self&#8208;assemble to form nanotubes and the recent progress in stimuli&#8208;triggered cyclic peptide assembly and the methods to construct peptide and polymer conjugates based on cyclic peptides with alternative chirality. Specifically, we highlight the roles that stimuli triggered cyclic peptides and their conjugates play in biomedical applications. Besides, recent progress for other cyclic peptides acting as gelators in drug delivery and biomedicine are also summarized. These cyclic peptides with properties in self&#8208;assembly are expected to act as adaptive systems for drug delivery and selective disease targeting.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Near&#8208;IR Absorbing Ruthenium(II) Complex as Photosensitizer for Photodynamic Therapy and its Cetuximab Bioconjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel Ru(II) cyclometalated photosensitizer (PS), Ru&#8208;NH2, for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of formula [Ru(appy)(bphen)2]PF6 (where appy = 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpyridine and bphen =&#160; bathophenanthroline) and its cetuximab (CTX) bioconjugates, Ru&#8208;Mal&#8208;CTX and Ru&#8208;BAA&#8208;CTX (where Mal = maleimide and BAA = benzoylacrylic acid) were synthesised and characterised. The photophysical properties of Ru&#8208;NH2 revealed absorption maxima around 580 nm with an absorption up to 725 nm. The generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) upon light irradiation was confirmed with a 1O2 quantum yield of 0.19 in acetonitrile. Preliminary in vitro experiments revealed the Ru&#8208;NH2 was nontoxic in the dark in CT&#8208;26 and SQ20B cell lines but showed outstanding phototoxicity when irradiated, reaching interesting phototoxicity indexes (PI) &gt; 370 at 670 nm, and &gt; 150 at 740 nm for CT&#8208;26 cells and &gt; 50 with NIR light in SQ20B cells. The antibody CTX was successfully attached to the complexes in view of the selective delivery of the PS to cancer cells. Up to four ruthenium fragments were anchored to the antibody (Ab), as confirmed by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass spectrometry. Nonetheless, the bioconjugates were not as photoactive as the Ru&#8208;NH2 complex.</dc:description>

         <title>De novo design of polyhedral protein assemblies: before and after the AI revolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembling polyhedral protein biomaterials have gained attention as engineering targets owing to their naturally evolved sophisticated functions, ranging from protecting macromolecules from the environment to spatially controlling biochemical reactions. Precise computational design of de novo protein polyhedra is possible through two main types of approaches: methods from first principles, using physical and geometrical rules, and more recent data&#8208;driven methods based on artificial intelligence (AI), including deep learning. Here, we retrospect first principle&#8208; and AI&#8208;based approaches for designing finite polyhedral protein assemblies, as well as advances in the structure prediction of such assemblies. We further highlight the possible applications of these materials and explore how the presented approaches can be combined to overcome current challenges and to advance the design of functional protein&#8208;based biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;based Drug discovery with Deep Learning</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of deep learning bears promise for drug discovery and chemical biology, e.g., to predict protein structure and molecular bioactivity, plan organic synthesis, and design molecules de novo. While most of the deep learning efforts in drug discovery have focused on ligand&#8208;based approaches, structure&#8208;based drug discovery has the potential to tackle unsolved challenges, such as affinity prediction for unexplored protein targets, binding&#8208;mechanism elucidation, and the rationalization of related chemical kinetic properties. Advances in deep learning methodologies and the availability of accurate predictions for protein tertiary structure advocate for a renaissance in structure&#8208;based approaches for drug discovery guided by AI. This review summarizes the most prominent algorithmic concepts in structure&#8208;based deep learning for drug discovery, and forecasts opportunities, applications, and challenges ahead.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Metabolite Interactions: Discovery and Significance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolites orchestrate cellular processes as either substrates, co&#8208;enzymes, inhibitors, or activators of cellular proteins such as enzymes and receptors. Although traditional biochemical and structural biology&#8209;based approaches have been successfully employed for the discovery of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions, they often fail to detect transient and low&#8208;affinity biomolecular relationships. Another limitation of these approaches is that they are performed under in vitro conditions lacking the physiological context. Recently developed mass spectrometry&#8208;based methodologies overcome both these shortcomings, and have resulted in the discovery of global protein&#8208;metabolite cellular interaction networks. Herein, we describe traditional and modern approaches for the discovery of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions, and discuss the impact of these discoveries on our understanding of cellular physiology and drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Dynamics of Iron is a Key Player in the Catalysis of Non&#8208;heme Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mononuclear nonheme iron enzymes catalyze a large variety of oxidative transformations responsible for various biosynthesis and metabolism processes. Unlike their P450 counterparts, non&#8208;heme enzymes generally possess flexible and variable coordination architecture, which can endow rich reactivity for non&#8208;heme enzymes. This Concept highlights that the coordination dynamics of iron can be a key player in controlling the activity and selectivity of non&#8208;heme enzymes. In ergothioneine synthase EgtB, the coordination switch of the sulfoxide radical species enables the efficient and selective C&#8208;S coupling reaction. In iron(II)&#8208; and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent &#160;(Fe/2OG) oxygenases, the conformational flip of ferryl&#8208;oxo intermediate can be extensively involved in selective oxidation reactions. Especially, the five&#8208;coordinate ferryl&#8208;oxo species may allow the substrate coordination via O or N atom, which may facilitate the C&#8208;O or C&#8208;N coupling reactions via stabilizing the transition states and inhibiting the unwanted hydroxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Polypyridyl CoII&#8208;Curcumin Complexes as Photoactivated Anticancer and Antibacterial Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spice of cell death: Cytosol&#8208;targeting polypyridyl&#8208;CoII complexes of curcumin have shown remarkable apoptotic anticancer activity through in&#8208;cell ROS production triggered by visible light. These complexes also presented significant antibacterial response on visible light exposure. These reported results have the potential to deliver new CoII&#8208;based anticancer and antibacterial drugs.







Abstract
Four new CoII complexes, [Co(bpy)2(acac)]Cl (1), [Co(phen)2(acac)]Cl (2), [Co(bpy)2(cur)]Cl (3), [Co(phen)2(cur)]Cl (4), where bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (1 and 3), phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (2 and 4), acac=acetylacetonate (1 and 2), cur=curcumin monoanion (3 and 4) have been designed, synthesized and fully characterized. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of 1 and 2 indicated that the CoN4O2 core has a distorted octahedral geometry. The photoactivity of these complexes was tuned by varying the &#960; conjugation in the ligands. Curcumin complexes 3 and 4 had an intense absorption band near 435&#8197;nm, which made them useful as visible&#8208;light photodynamic therapy agents; they also showed fluorescence with &#955;em&#8776;565&#8197;nm. This fluorescence was useful for studying their intracellular uptake and localization in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. The acetylacetonate complexes (1 and 2) were used as control complexes to understand the role of curcumin. The white&#8208;light&#8208;triggered anticancer profiles of the cytosol targeting complexes 3 and 4 were investigated in detail. These non&#8208;dark toxic complexes displayed significant apoptotic photo&#8208;cytotoxicity (under visible light) against MCF&#8208;7 cells through ROS generation. The control complexes 1 and 2 did not induce significant cell death in the light or dark. Interestingly, 1&#8208;4 produced a remarkable antibacterial response upon light exposure. Overall, the reported results here can increase the boundary of the CoII&#8208;based anticancer and antibacterial drug development.

         <title>Refining the dynamic network of T2SS endopilus tip hetero&#8208;complex combining cw&#8208;EPR and Nitroxide&#8208;Gd(III) distance measurements</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The type 2 secretion system (T2SS) is a bacterial nanomachine constituted by an inner membrane assembly platform, an outer membrane pore and a dynamic endopilus. T2SS endopili are organized into a homo&#8208;multimeric body formed by the major pilin capped by a hetero&#8208;complex of four minor pilins. The first model of the T2SS endopilus was recently released even if structural dynamics insights are still required to decipher the role of each protein in the full tetrameric complex. Here, we applied continuous wave and pulse EPR spectroscopy using nitroxide&#8208;gadolinium orthogonal labelling strategies to investigate the hetero&#8208;oligomeric assembly of the minor pilins. Overall, our data are in line with the endopilus model even if they evidenced conformational flexibility and alternative orientations at local scale of specific regions of minor pilins. The integration of different labelling strategies and EPR experiments demonstrates the pertinence of this approach to investigate protein&#8208;protein interactions in such multi protein hetero&#8208;complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Backbone Alteration in Non&#8208;Hairpin &#946;&#8208;Turns: Impacts on Tertiary Folded Structure and Folded Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone modification in &#946;&#8208;turns is vital in the development of protein mimetics. Prior work has focused on the subset of turns that join strands of a &#946;&#8208;sheet. Here we report the evaluation of complementary strategies that stabilize &#946;&#8208;turns found in other structural contexts. Optimal artificial residue placement in a helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix domain yields variants with folded structure identical to the prototype and improved thermal stability (Tm).







Abstract
The importance of &#946;&#8208;turns to protein folding has motivated extensive efforts to stabilize the motif with non&#8208;canonical backbone connectivity. Prior work has focused almost exclusively on turns between strands in a &#946;&#8208;sheet (i.&#8201;e., hairpins). Turns in other structural contexts are also common in nature and have distinct conformational preferences; however, design principles for their mimicry remain poorly understood. Here, we report strategies that stabilize non&#8208;hairpin &#946;&#8208;turns through systematic evaluation of the impacts of backbone alteration on the high&#8208;resolution folded structure and folded stability of a helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix prototype protein. Several well&#8208;established hairpin turn mimetics are shown detrimental to folded stability and/or hydrophobic core packing, while less&#8208;explored modification schemes that reinforce alternate turn types lead to improved stability and more faithful structural mimicry. Collectively, these results have implications in control over protein folding through chemical modification as well as the design of protein mimetics.

         <title>Tracking the Message: Applying Single Molecule Localization Microscopy to Cellular RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular RNA Imaging: Numerous techniques have been developed for imaging RNA, and in parallel super resolution and single&#8208;molecule techniques have allowed high&#8208;resolution imaging of biomolecules in cells. In this review, we highlight current approaches that utilize single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to image RNA at nanoscale resolution and discuss the vast potential for developing new RNA labeling methods inspired by SMLM for mapping RNA localization.







Abstract
RNA function is increasingly appreciated to be more complex than merely communicating between DNA sequence and protein structure. RNA localization has emerged as a key contributor to the intricate roles RNA plays in the cell, and the link between dysregulated spatiotemporal localization and disease warrants an exploration beyond sequence and structure. However, the tools needed to visualize RNA with precise resolution are lacking in comparison to methods available for studying proteins. In the past decade, many techniques have been developed for imaging RNA, and in parallel super resolution and single&#8208;molecule techniques have enabled imaging of single molecules in cells. Of these methods, single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has shown significant promise for probing RNA localization. In this review, we highlight current approaches that allow super resolution imaging of specific RNA transcripts and summarize challenges and future opportunities for developing innovative RNA labeling methods that leverage the power of SMLM.

         <dc:description>Current cancer treatments damage healthy cells and tissues, causing short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term side effects. New treatments are desired that show greater selectivity toward cancer cells and evade the common mechanisms of multidrug resistance. Membranolytic anticancer peptides (mACPs) hold promise against cancer and multidrug resistance. Amphipathicity, hydrophobicity, and net charge of mACPs participate in their respective interactions with cell membranes and their overall inhibition of cancer cells. To support the design of cell&#8208;line selective mACPs, we investigated the relationships that amino acid composition, physicochemical properties, sequence motifs and sequence homology could have with their potency and selectivity towards several healthy and cancer cell lines. Sequence length and net charge are known to affect the selectivity of mACPs between cancer and healthy cell lines. Our study reveals that increasing the net charge or flexibility (i.e., small and aliphatic residues) influences their selectivity between cancer cell lines with comparable lipid compositions.</dc:description>

         <title>Surfaceome profiling identifies basigin&#8208;chaperoned protein clients</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface proteome or &#8220;surfaceome&#8221; is a critical mediator of cellular biology, facilitating cell&#8208;tocell interactions and communication with extracellular biomolecules. Constituents of the surfaceome can serve as biomarkers for changing cell states and as targets for pharmacological intervention. While some pathways of cell surface trafficking are well characterized to allow prediction of surface localization, some non&#8208;canonical trafficking mechanisms do not. Basigin (Bsg), a cell surface glycoprotein, has been shown to chaperone protein clients to the cell surface. However, understanding which proteins are served by Bsg is not always straightforward. To accelerate such identification, we applied a surfaceome proximity labeling method that is integrated with quantitative mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics to discern changes in the surfaceome of hepatic stellate cells that occur in response to the genetic loss of Bsg. Using this strategy, we observed that the loss of Bsg leads to corresponding reductions in the cell surface expression of monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4. We also found that these relationships were unique to Bsg and not found in neuroplastin (Nptn), a related family member. These results establish the utility of the surfaceome proximity labeling method to determine clients of cell surface chaperone proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoproteomic Profiling Reveals that Anti&#8208;Cancer Natural Product Dankastatin B&#160;Covalently Targets Mitochondrial VDAC3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorinated gymnastatin and dankastatin alkaloids derived from the fungal strain&#160;Gymnascella dankaliensis&#160;have been reported to possess significant anti&#8208;cancer activity but their mode of action is unknown. These members possess electrophilic functional groups that may undergo covalent bond formation with specific proteins to exert their biological activity. To better understand the mechanism of action of this class of natural products, we mapped the proteome&#8208;wide cysteine&#8208;reactivity of the most potent of these alkaloids, dankastatin B, using activity&#8208;based protein profiling chemoproteomic approaches. We identified a primary target of dankastatin B in breast cancer cells as cysteine C65 of the voltage&#8208;dependent anion selective channel on the outer mitochondrial membrane VDAC3. We demonstrated direct and covalent interaction of dankastatin B with VDAC3. VDAC3 knockdown conferred hyper&#8208;sensitivity to dankastatin B&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;proliferative effects in breast cancer cells indicating that VDAC3 was at least partially involved in the anti&#8208;cancer effects of this natural product. Our study reveals a potential mode of action of dankastatin B through covalent targeting of VDAC3 and highlight the utility of chemoproteomic approaches in gaining mechanistic understanding of electrophilic natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Rieske Oxygenases and other Ferredoxin&#8208;dependent Enzymes: Electron Transfer Principles and Catalytic Capabilities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes that depend on sophisticated electron transfer via ferredoxins (Fds) exhibit outstanding catalytic capabilities, but despite decades of research, many of them are still not well understood nor exploited for synthetic applications. This review aims to provide a general overview of the most important Fd&#8208;dependent enzymes and the electron transfer processes involved.&#160;While several examples are discussed, we focus in particular on the family of Rieske non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent oxygenases (ROs).&#160;In addition to illustrating their electron transfer principles and catalytic potential, the current state of knowledge on structure&#8208;function relationships and the mode of interaction between the redox partner proteins is reviewed. Moreover, we highlight several key catalyzed transformations, but also take a deeper dive into their engineerability for biocatalytic applications.&#160;The overall findings from these case studies highlight the catalytic capabilities of these biocatalysts and may stimulate future interest in developing additional Fd&#8208;dependent enzyme classes for synthetic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Tyrosine Nitration with a Small Tb(III)&#8208;Metallopeptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine nitration, a post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) that takes place under nitrosative stress conditions, occurs through a non&#8208;enzymatic peroxynitrite&#8208;mediated reaction. Although protein nitration has long been considered an irreversible PTM involved in nitrosative stress&#8208;associated diseases, it has also been suggested to be a regulatory mechanism of signal transduction. Therefore, the development of tools that help to understand this protein modification is of great interest. Herein, we explore a Tb(III)&#8208;chelating metallopeptide to monitor tyrosine nitration. The luminescence of this probe decreases significantly between its non&#8208;nitrated and nitrated states, and this reduction in the luminescence intensity is directly related to the degree of tyrosine nitration after treatment with peroxynitrite. Remarkably, the luminescence intensity changes after nitration are not affected in the presence of complex biological media, which makes it a promising tool for understanding this protein modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Novel Tool to Demystify Drug Distribution at Tissue&#8208;Blood Barriers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tissue endothelial cells express ABC&#8208;transporter enzymes that change the concentration of small molecule within different tissue&#8208;compartments. These &#8220;blood&#8208;tissue barriers&#8221; have been shown to directly affect the efficacy and toxicity of anti&#8208;cancer, anti&#8208;microbial, psychiatric, and anti&#8208;epileptic drugs. Currently this phenomenon is best studied for the blood&#8208;brain barrier but remains enigmatic for most other tissues. In addition, canonical pharmacokinetic theory specifically assumes an equal concentration of free drug within all tissue compartments.
Inspired by Lipinski&#8217;s &#8220;rule of 5,&#8221; we here clarify current knowledge on drug&#8208;tissue distribution by: (1) curating the in vivo literature on 73 drugs across 23 tissues and (2) developing two graphical web&#8208;based applications to visually describe and interpret data. This curated in vivo dataset and visualization tools enabled us to achieve new insights into the logic of the barrier&#8208;tissues organization and showed remarkable correspondence to whole&#8208;body imaging of radiolabeled molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Definition of an Index Parameter to Screen Highly Functional Enzymes Derived from a Biochemical and Thermodynamic Analysis of Ancestral meso&#8208;Diaminopimelate Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;based protein design approaches are being adopted to generate highly functional enzymes; however, screening the enzymes remains a time&#8208;consuming task. In the present study, by analyzing the enzymatic properties of the four ancestral meso&#8208;2,6&#8208;diaminopimelate dehydrogenases (AncDAPDHs) AncDAPDH&#8208;N1, &#8208;N2, &#8208;N3, and &#8208;N4, we attempted to define a new index parameter that is helpful for efficiently screening the enzymes. Biochemical and thermodynamic analyses indicated that only AncDAPDH&#8208;N4 exhibited greater thermal stability than and activity similar to those of native DAPDHs. Structural and sequence comparisons between DAPDH from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgDAPDH) and the AncDAPDHs suggested that &#8220;quality of mutations&#8221; is a potential index parameter. In fact, the mutations introduced from CgDAPDH to AncDAPDH&#8208;N4 were highly correlated with the mutations accumulated during the evolution process from mesophiles to thermophiles. These results suggest that, although there are several of exceptions, the correlation coefficient can be used as an index parameter for screening high&#8208;functioning enzymes from sequence data.</dc:description>

         <title>The wild&#8208;type tRNA adenosine deaminase enzyme TadA is capable of sequence&#8208;specific DNA base editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Base editors are genome editing tools that enable site&#8208;specific base conversions via the chemical modification of nucleobases in DNA. Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert A&#8226;T to G&#8226;C base pairs in DNA by utilizing an adenosine deaminase enzyme to modify target adenosines to inosine intermediates. Due to the lack of a naturally occurring adenosine deaminase that can modify DNA, ABEs were evolved from a tRNA&#8208;deaminating enzyme, TadA. Previous experiments utilizing an ABE comprised of a wild&#8208;type (wt) TadA showed no detectable activity on DNA, and directed evolution was therefore required to enable this enzyme to accept DNA as a substrate. Here we show that wtTadA can perform base editing in DNA in both bacterial and mammalian cells, with a strict sequence motif requirement of TAC. We leverage this discovery to optimize a reporter assay to detect base editing levels as low as 0.01%. Finally, we use this assay along with molecular dynamics simulations of full ABE:DNA complexes to better understand how the sequence recognition of mutant TadA variants change as they accumulate mutations to better edit DNA substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>A tri&#8208;enzyme cascade for efficient production of L&#8208;2&#8208;aminobutyrate from L&#8208;threonine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:L&#8208;2&#8208;aminobutyrate (L&#8208;ABA) is an important chiral drug intermediate with a key role in modern medicinal chemistry. Here, we describe the development of an efficient method for the asymmetric synthesis of L&#8208;ABA in a tri&#8208;enzymatic cascade in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using a cost&#8208;effective L&#8208;Thr. Low activity of leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus thuringiensis (BtLDH) and unbalanced expression of enzymes in the cascade are challenges to overcome. Mechanism&#8208;based protein engineering generated the optimal triple variant BtLDH M3 (A262S/V296C/P150M) with 20.7&#8208;fold increased specific activity and 9.6&#8208;fold increased kcat/Km compared with the wild type. Optimizing plasmids with different copy numbers regulated enzymatic expression, thereby increasing the activity ratio (0.3:1:0.6) of these enzymes invivo close to the optimal ratio (0.4:1:1) in vitro. Importing the optimal triple mutant BtLDH M3 into our constructed pathway in vivo and optimization of transformation conditions achieved one&#8208;pot conversion of L&#8208;Thr to 130.2 g/L L&#8208;ABA, with 95% conversion, 99% e.e. and 10.9 g&#8901;L&#8208;1&#8901;h&#8208;1 productivity (the highest to date) in 12 h on a 500 mL scale. These results describe a potential biosynthesis approach for the industrial production of L&#8208;ABA.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of A Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted JNK Inhibitor and Its Protective Effect on Parkinson&#8217;s Disease Phenotypes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase (JNK) is a key mediator involved in a variety of physiological processes. JNK activation is regulated in a complex manner by upstream kinases and phosphatases and plays an important role in physiological processes such as the immune response and neuronal function. Therefore, JNK has become a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, arthritis and other diseases. Inhibition of JNK activation in mitochondria holds great potential for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. However, no specific mitochondrial&#8208;targeted JNK inhibitor has been reported. Herein, we developed a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted JNK inhibitor, P2, by linking a mitochondrial&#8208;specific cell&#8208;penetrating peptide to SP600125 (SP), a commercialized specific inhibitor of JNK. We found that P2 specifically inhibited mitochondrial JNK phosphorylation instead of nuclear JNK signaling. Further studies showed that P2 effectively rescued PD phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that it is a potential therapeutic for PD.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the mechanistic basis for perfluoroalkyl&#8208;protein interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although rarely used in nature, fluorine has emerged as an important elemental ingredient in the design of proteins with altered folding, stability, oligomerization propensities and bioactivity. Adding to the molecular modification toolbox, here we report the ability of privileged perfluorinated amphiphiles to non&#8208;covalently decorate proteins to alter their conformational plasticity and potentiate their dispersion into fluorous phases. Employing a complementary suite of biophysical, in silico and in vitro approaches, we establish structure&#8208;activity relationships defining these phenomena and investigate their impact on protein structural dynamics and intracellular trafficking. Notably, we show that the lead compound, perfluorononanoic acid, is 106 more potent in inducing non&#8208;native protein secondary structure in select proteins compared to the well&#8208;known helix inducer trifluoroethanol, as well as significantly enhances the cellular uptake of complexed proteins. These findings may advance the rational design of fluorinated proteins, inform on potential modes of toxicity for perfluoroalkyl substances, and guide the development of fluorine&#8208;modified biologics with desirable functional properties for drug discovery and delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylalanine Residues are Very Rapidly Damaged by Nitrate Radicals (NO3&#8226;) in an Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic studies revealed that nitrate radicals (NO3&#9679; ), which are formed through reaction of the noxious air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#9679; ) and ozone (O3), very rapidly oxidize phenylalanine (Phe) residues in an aqueous environment, with overall rate coefficients in the 108&#8208;109 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 range. Using amino acids and dipeptides as model systems, the data suggest that the reaction proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;complex between NO3&#9679; and the aromatic ring in Phe, which subsequently decays into a charge transfer (CT) complex. The stability of the &#960;&#8208;complex is sequence&#8208;dependent and is increased when Phe is at the N&#8208;terminus of the dipeptide. Computations revealed that the considerably more rapid radical&#8208;induced oxidation of Phe residues in both neutral and acidic aqueous environments, compared to acetonitrile, can be attributed to the stabilization of the CT complex by the protic solvent, clearly highlighting the health&#8208;damaging potential of exposure to combined NO2&#9679; and O3.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosphingolipid (GSL) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) are the two major glycolipids expressed by eukaryotic cells, and their metabolisms share the same machineries. Moreover, both GSLs and GPI&#8208;anchored proteins (GPI&#8208;APs) are localized in the cholesterol&#8208;rich regions, namely the lipid rafts, of the cell membrane, where many other signaling molecules are compartmentalized as well. Therefore, the interaction between GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs and their interactions with other molecules in the lipid rafts are inevitable. This review is focused on the influences of GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs on each other&#8217;s biosynthesis, trafficking, cell membrane distribution, and biological functions, e.g., signal transduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic investigation of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering efficiency in intestinal cells using a dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;monosaccharide conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) of cells with synthetic monosaccharides can introduce functionality to the glycans of cell membranes. Unnatural sugars (e.g., peracetylated mannose&#8208;azide) can be expressed on the cell surface with the azide group in place. After MOE, the azide group can participate in a copper&#8208;free click reaction with an alkyne (e.g., dibenzocyclooctyne, DBCO) probe. This allows the metabolic fate of monosaccharides in cells to be understood. However, in a drug delivery context it is desirable to have azide groups on the probe (e.g. a drug delivery particle) and the alkyne (e.g. DBCO) on the cell surface. Consequently, the labelling efficiency of intestinal cell lines (Caco&#8208;2 and HT29&#8208;MTX&#8208;E12) treated with N&#8208;dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;tetra&#8208;acetylmannosamine, and the concentration&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent labelling were determined. Furthermore, the labelling of mucus in HT29&#8208;MTX&#8208;E12 cells with DBCO was shown. This study highlights the potential for using MOE to target azide&#8208;functionalised probes to intestinal tissues for drug delivery applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) of cells with synthetic monosaccharides can introduce functionality to the glycans of cell membranes. Unnatural sugars (e.g., peracetylated mannose-azide) can be expressed on the cell surface with the azide group in place. After MOE, the azide group can participate in a copper-free click reaction with an alkyne (e.g., dibenzocyclooctyne, DBCO) probe. This allows the metabolic fate of monosaccharides in cells to be understood. However, in a drug delivery context it is desirable to have azide groups on the probe (e.g. a drug delivery particle) and the alkyne (e.g. DBCO) on the cell surface. Consequently, the labelling efficiency of intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX-E12) treated with N-dibenzocyclooctyne-tetra-acetylmannosamine, and the concentration- and time-dependent labelling were determined. Furthermore, the labelling of mucus in HT29-MTX-E12 cells with DBCO was shown. This study highlights the potential for using MOE to target azide-functionalised probes to intestinal tissues for drug delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Taking Synthetic Biology to the Seas &#8211; From Blue Chassis Organisms to Marine Aquaforming</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oceans cover 71% of Earth&#8217;s surface and are home to hundreds of thousands of species, many of which are microbial. Knowledge about marine microbes has strongly increased in the past decades due to global sampling expeditions and hundreds of detailed studies on marine microbial ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry. However, the translation of this knowledge into biotechnological applications or synthetic biology approaches using marine microbes has been limited so far. This review highlights key examples of marine bacteria in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and outlines possible future work based on the emerging marine chassis organisms Vibrio natriegens and Halomonas bluephagenesis. Furthermore, the valorization of algal polysaccharides by genetically enhanced microbes is presented as an example for the opportunities and challenges associated with blue biotechnology. Finally, new roles for marine synthetic biology in tackling pressing global challenges, including climate change and marine pollution, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural basis for activation of cobalt&#8208;carbon bond and control of adenosyl radical in coenzyme B12 catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or coenzyme B12 is a naturally occurring organometallic compound that serves as a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze intramolecular group&#8208;transfer reactions and ribonucleotide reduction in a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to animals. AdoCbl&#8208;dependent enzymes are radical enzymes and generate an adenosyl radical by homolysis of the coenzyme&#8217;s cobalt&#8208;carbon (Co&#8208;C) bond for catalysis. How do the enzymes activate and cleave the Co&#8208;C bond to form the adenosyl radical? How do the enzymes utilize the high reactivity of adenosyl radical for catalysis by suppressing undesirable side reactions? Our recent structural studies aimed to solve these problems with diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase established the crucial importance of steric strain of the Co&#8208;C bond and conformational stabilization of adenosyl radical for coenzyme B12 catalysis. We outline here our results obtained with these eliminating isomerases and compare them with those obtained with other radical B12 enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Metal Complexes for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global problem with more than 1 million deaths due to AMR infection in 2019 alone. New and innovative therapeutics are required to overcome this challenge. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a rapidly growing area of research poised to provide much needed help in the fight against AMR. aPDT works by administering a photosensitizer (PS), which is activated only when irradiated with light, allowing high spatiotemporal control and selectivity. The PS typically generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage a variety of key biological targets, potentially circumventing existing resistance mechanisms. Metal complexes are well known to display excellent optoelectronic properties and recent focus has begun to shift towards their application in tackling microbial infections. We herein review the last 5 years of progress in the emerging field of small molecule metal complex PSs for aPDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Validation Approach for Tools to Study the DNA Repair Enzyme SNM1A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a two&#8208;step validation approach to evaluate the suitability of metal&#8208;binding groups for targeting DNA damage repair metalloenzymes, using model enzyme SNM1A. A fragment&#8208;based screening approach was first used to identify metal&#8208;binding fragments suitable for targeting the enzyme. Effective fragments were then incorporated into oligonucleotides via the copper&#8208;catalysed azidealkyne cycloaddition reaction. These modified oligonucleotides were recognised by SNM1A at &gt;1000&#8208;fold lower concentrations than their fragment counterparts. The exonuclease SNM1A is a key enzyme involved in the repair of interstrand crosslinks, a highly cytotoxic form of DNA damage. However, SNM1A and other enzymes of this class are poorly understood as there is a lack of tools available to facilitate their study. Our novel approach of incorporating functional fragments into oligonucleotides is broadly applicable to generate modified oligonucleotide structures with high affinity for DNA damage repair enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Etoposide&#8208;Entrapped Progesterone&#8208;Cationic Lipid Nanoaggregates as Selective Therapeutics against Etoposide&#8208;Resistant Colorectal Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug resistance majorly impacts the treatment of several cancers.&#160;&#160;This is mainly due to the overexpression of cellular drug efflux proteins. Hence, drug delivery systems that can avoid this resistance are needed. We report PR10, a progesterone&#8208;cationic lipid conjugate, as a self&#8208;assembling nanoaggregate that delivers etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor, as drug cargo selectively to cancer cells. In this study, we observed that etoposide nanoaggregates (P:E) caused selective and enhanced toxicity in etoposide&#8208;resistant CT26 cancer cells (IC50&#160;9&#160;mM) compared to when etoposide (IC50&#160;&gt; 20&#160;mM) was used alone. Concurrently, no toxicity was observed in etoposide&#8208;sensitive HEK293 for P:E treatment (IC50&#160;&gt; 20&#160;mM).&#160;&#160;The P:E&#8208;treated cancer cells seems to have no effect on ABCB1 expression, but etoposide&#8208;treated cells exhibited two&#8208;fold increase in ABCB1 expression, a potent efflux protein for several xenobiotic compounds. This observation supports the notion that the enhanced toxicity of P:E nanoaggregates is due to its ability to keep reduced expression of ABCB1, thus allowing longer intracellular residence of etoposide. In a BALB/c orthotopic colorectal cancer model, the nanoaggregates led to enhanced survival (45 days) as compared to etoposide&#8208;treated mice (39 days). These findings suggest that PR10 could be used as a potential cancer&#8208;selective etoposide delivery vehicle to treat several etoposide&#8208;resistant cancers with fewer side effects due to nonspecific toxicity of the drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection and Imaging of Active Substances in Early Atherosclerotic Lesions using Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atherosclerosis (AS) is a vascular disease caused by chronic inflammation and lipids, which is the main cause of myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is often difficult to detect in early stages due to the absence of clinically significant vascular stenosis. This is not conducive to the early intervention and treatment of the disease. Over the past decade, researchers have developed various imaging methods for the detection and imaging of atherosclerosis. At the same time, more and more biomarkers are being found that can be used as targets for detecting atherosclerosis. Therefore, the development of a variety of imaging methods and a variety of targeted imaging probes is an important project to achieve early assessment and treatment of atherosclerosis. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optical probes used to detect and target atherosclerosis imaging in recent years, and describes the current challenges and future development directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unique Crosslinking Properties of Psoralen&#8208;conjugated Oligonucleotides developed by Novel Psoralen N&#8208;Hydroxysuccinimide Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psoralens and their derivatives, such as trioxsalen, have unique crosslinking features to DNA. However, psoralen monomers do not have sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking ability with the target DNA. With the development of psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides (Ps&#8208;Oligos), sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking with target DNA has become achievable, thereby expanding the application of psoralen&#8208;conjugated molecules&#160;in gene transcription inhibition, gene knockout, and targeted recombination by genome editing. In this study, we developed two novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters that allow the introduction of psoralens into any amino&#8208;modified oligonucleotides.&#160;&#160;Quantitative evaluation of the photo&#8208;crosslinking efficiencies of the Ps&#8208;Oligos to target single&#8208;stranded DNAs revealed that the crosslinking selectivity to 5&#8208;mC is the unique feature of trioxsalen. We found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide&#160;via&#160;a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target double&#8208;stranded DNA. We believe our findings are essential information for the development of Ps&#8208;Oligos as novel gene regulation tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Derivatization of Mirror&#8208;image&#160;L&#8208;Nucleic Acids with 2'&#8208;OMe Modification for Thermal and Structural Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To further expand the functionality and enhance the stability of mirror&#8208;image nucleic acid as advanced agent for basic research and therapeutic design, we have synthesized the 2'&#8208;deoxy2'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;L&#8208;uridine phosphoramidites and incorporate it into L&#8208;DNA and L&#8208;RNA via solid&#8208;phase synthesis quantitatively. We found that the thermostability of L&#8208;nucleic acids is dramatically improved after introducing the modifications. Moreover, we successfully crystallized both L&#8208;DNA and L&#8208;RNA duplexes containing the 2'&#8208;OMe modifications and sharing the identical sequence. The crystal structure determination and analysis reveal the overall structures of the mirrorimage nucleic acids, and for the first time interpretate the structural deviation caused by 2'&#8208;OMe and 2'&#8208;OH groups in the oligonucleotides which are highly similar. This novel chemical modification of nucleic acid has the potential to be used to design nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutic and material in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering the Modular Architecture of Galectins Affects its Binding with Synthetic &#945;&#8208;Dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated Core M1 Glycoconjugates In situ</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multifunctionality of galectins helps regulate a broad range of fundamental cellular processes via cis&#8208;binding and trans&#8208;bridging activities and has gained widespread attention with respect to the importance of the natural specificity/selectivity of this lectin family to its glycoconjugate receptors. Combining galectin (Gal)&#8208;1, &#8208;3, &#8208;4, and &#8208;9 variant test panels, achieved via rational protein engineering, and a synthetic &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan (DG) O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptide library, a detailed comparative analysis was performed, utilizing microarray experiments to delineate the design&#8208;functionality relationships within this lectin family. Enhancement of prototype Gal&#8208;1 and chimera&#8208;type Gal&#8208;3 cis&#8208;binding toward the prepared ligands is possible by transforming these lectins into tandem&#8208;repeat type and prototypes, respectively. Furthermore, Gal&#8208;1 variants demonstrated improved trans&#8208;bridging capabilities between core M1 &#945;&#8208;DG glycopeptides and laminins in microarray, suggesting the possible translational applications of these galectin variants in the treatment of some forms of &#945;&#8208;dystroglycanopathy.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Glycopeptides to Explore the Role of Mucin 1 Glycosylation in Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Posttranslational modifications affect protein biology in physiological and pathological conditions. Efficient methods for the preparation of peptides and proteins carrying defined, homogeneous modifications are fundamental tools for investigating these functions. In the case of Mucin 1 (MUC1) an altered glycosylation pattern is observed in carcinogenesis. To better understand the role of MUC1 glycosylation in interaction and adhesion of cancer cells, we prepared a panel of homogeneously O&#8208;glycosylated MUC1 peptides using a quantitative chemoenzymatic approach. Cell adhesion experiments with MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells on surfaces carrying up to 6 differently glycosylated MUC1 peptides demonstrated that different glycans significantly impact adhesion. This finding suggests a distinct role of MUC1 glycosylation patterns in cancer cell migration and/or invasion. To decipher the molecular mechanism for the observed adhesion we investigated conformation of the glycosylated MUC1 peptides by NMR. These experiments revealed only minor differences in peptide structure, therefore clearly relating the adhesion behaviour to the type and number of glycans linked to MUC1.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes and Nanoparticles for Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical imaging techniques are widely used to detect, locate, and track the growth or shrinkage of cancerous tumors. Although these techniques have shown impressive results, they often come with health risks due to the use of toxic contrast agents or ionizing radiation. To address these limitations, research efforts have been focused on the development of new imaging techniques. Among the emerging medicinal methods, photoacoustic imaging is receiving much attention. This method effectively combines the most important benefits of both ultrasound and fluorescence imaging, while minimizing their respective drawbacks via a light&#8208;in and ultrasound&#8208;out approach. This review article focuses on the fundamental concept, recent advancements, and strategies for novel contrast agents based on molecular metal complexes or metallic nanoparticles for use in photoacoustic imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>HaloTag&#8208;based reporters for fluorescence imaging and biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing the structure and dynamics of biomolecules is critical to understand biological function, and requires methods to fluorescently label targets of interest in their cellular context. Self&#8208;labelling proteins, which combine a genetically encoded tag with a small&#8208;molecule fluorophore, have attracted considerable attention for this purpose, as they can overcome limitations of fluorescent proteins. Among them, the HaloTag protein is the most broadly used, showing fast specific labelling with a small, easy to functionalize and cell&#8208;permeant ligand. Synthetic chemistry and protein engineering have provided a portfolio of powerful imaging tools exploiting HaloTag, along with general methods to optimize and adapt them to specific applications. Here, we provide an overview of fluorescent reporters based on the HaloTag protein for imaging and biosensing, highlighting engineering strategies and general applications.</dc:description>
