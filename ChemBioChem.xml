         <title>Chemoenzymatic Isolation and Characterization of High Purity Mammalian Melanin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative, chemoenzymatic process was developed to isolate eumelanin from mammalian tissues using a fluorescent and electron microscopic screen for guidance. This multi&#8208;step process enables quantitative isolation high purity melanin from mammalian tissue for structural studies as demonstrated by solid&#8208;state NMR analyses.







Abstract
Although melanin is one of the most ubiquitous polymers in living systems, our understanding of its molecular structure, biosynthesis and biophysical properties has been limited to only a small number of organisms other than humans. This is in part due to the difficulty associated with isolating pure melanin. While purification methods exist, they typically involve harsh treatments with strong acid/base conditions combined with elevated temperatures that can lead to the polymer backbone degradation. To be successful, a viable isolation method must deliver a selective, yet complete degradation of non&#8208;melanin biopolymers as well as remove small molecule metabolites that are not integrative to the melanin backbone. Here, we demonstrate the use of chemoenzymatic processing guided by fluorescent probes for the purification and isolation of native mammalian melanin without significant induction of chemical degradation. This multi&#8208;step purification&#8208;tracking methodology enables quantitative isolation of pure melanin from mammalian tissue for spectroscopic characterization.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Modulation of the Catalytic Properties of [2Fe&#8722;2S]&#8208;Dependent Dehydratases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme catalysis: In silico and in&#8197;vitro investigations enabled the elucidation of the role of important active site residues of the enzymes dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) and sugar acid&#8208;specific dehydratase (DHT), both belonging to the FeS cluster&#8208;dependent ilvD/EDD superfamily. We proposed a new classification for these enzymes, and we were able to alter their substrate preference, improving activities for non&#8208;natural substrates significantly.







Abstract
The FeS cluster&#8208;dependent dihydroxyacid dehydratases (DHADs) and sugar acid&#8208;specific dehydratases (DHTs) from the ilvD/EDD superfamily are key enzymes in the bioproduction of a wide variety of chemicals. We analyzed [2Fe&#8722;2S]&#8208;dependent dehydratases in silico and in&#8197;vitro, deduced functionally relevant sequence, structure, and activity relationships within the ilvD/EDD superfamily, and we propose a new classification based on their evolutionary relationships and substrate profiles. In silico simulations and analyses identified several key positions for specificity, which were experimentally investigated with site&#8208;directed and saturation mutagenesis. We thus increased the promiscuity of DHAD from Fontimonas thermophila (FtDHAD), showing &gt;10&#8208;fold improved activity toward D&#8208;gluconate, and shifted the substrate preference of DHT from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT) toward shorter sugar acids (recording a six&#8208;fold improved activity toward the non&#8208;natural substrate D&#8208;glycerate). The successful elucidation of the role of important active site residues of the ilvD/EDD superfamily will further guide developments of this important biocatalyst for industrial applications.

         <title>Allosteric Probe Recognition Initiated Cascade Transcription Ampli&#64257;cation for Sensitive Analysis of Exosomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive and accurate analysis of exosome plays considerable roles in multifarious biological processes and being deemed to be important biomarkers for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we established a sensitive and specific exosomes detection approach based on target recognition initiated cascade signal amplification. In this method, allosteric probe is designed with hairpin structure for specific recognition of exosome and inducing the following signal amplification. Eventually, generated spinach RNA sequences after the cascade signal amplification process bind to DFHBI ((Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#64258;uoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;one) to produce enhanced fluorescence signal (approximate 2000 fold than that of inactive DFHBI). Compared with former proposed exosomes detection methods, the method exhibited a comparable detection range, but with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;design toolbox. Therefore, we believe that the proposed approach holds great potential for exosome based early diagnosis and prognosis of disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Biological Tools for the Study of Voltage&#8208;Gated Sodium Channels in Electrogenesis and Nociception</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desire to understand the role of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in electrical signaling and pain perception has motivated the development of chemical and biological tools that target this protein class. Such advances are summarized in this account and future research opportunities are highlighted.







Abstract
The malfunction and misregulation of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels (NaVs) underlie in large part the electrical hyperexcitability characteristic of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. NaVs are responsible for the initiation and propagation of electrical impulses (action potentials) in cells. Tissue and nerve injury alter the expression and localization of multiple NaV isoforms, including NaV1.1, 1.3, and 1.6&#8211;1.9, resulting in aberrant action potential firing patterns. To better understand the role of NaV regulation, localization, and trafficking in electrogenesis and pain pathogenesis, a number of chemical and biological reagents for interrogating NaV function have been advanced. The development and application of such tools for understanding NaV physiology are the focus of this review.

         <title>Carbonate&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemical Tool for Uncovering Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) Activity Variations in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the established importance of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in drug metabolism, methods to monitor factors that influence CES1 activity are limited. Herein, we exploit the self&#8208;immolative properties of carbonates to generate a fluorescent chemical tool and use it to identify activity differences between CES1 sequence variants in live cells.







Abstract
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) plays a key role in the metabolism of endogenous biomolecules and xenobiotics including a variety of pharmaceuticals. Despite the established importance of CES1 in drug metabolism, methods to study factors that can vary CES1 activity are limited with only a few suitable for use in live cells. Herein, we report the development of FCP1, a new CES1 specific fluorescent probe with a unique carbonate substrate constructed from commercially available reagents. We show that FCP&#8208;1 can specifically report on endogenous CES1 activity with a robust fluorescence response in live HepG2 cells through studies with inhibitors and genetic knockdowns. Subsequently, we deployed FCP&#8208;1 to develop a live cell fluorescence microscopy&#8208;based approach to identify activity differences between CES1 isoforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of a fluorescent probe to measure the activity of CES1 sequence variants in live cells.

         <title>Conformationally constrained sialyl analogues as new potential binders of h&#8208;CD22</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, two conformationally constrained sialyl analogues were synthesized and characterized in their interaction with the inhibitory Siglec, human CD22 (h&#8208;CD22). An orthogonal approach, including biophysical assays (SPR and fluorescence), ligand&#8208;based NMR techniques, and molecular modelling, was employed to disentangle the interaction mechanisms at a molecular level. The results showed that the Sialyl&#8208;TnThr antigen analogue represents a promising scaffold for the design of novel h&#8208;CD22 inhibitors. Our findings also suggested that the introduction of a biphenyl moiety at position 9 of the sialic acid hampers the canonical accommodation of the ligand in the protein binding pocket, even though the affinity with respect to the natural ligand is increased. Our outcomes address the search of novel modifications of the Neu5Ac&#8208;a(2&#8208;6)&#8208;Gal epitope, outlining new hints for the design and synthesis of high&#8208;affinity h&#8208;CD22 ligands, offering new prospects for therapeutic intervention to prevent autoimmune diseases and B&#8208;cells malignancies.</dc:description>

Synthesis of functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters using Chan's diene and modified Mukaiyama&#8208;aldol reaction conditions. Diastereoselective reduction to syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diols and saponification yielded the respective acids. All synthesized compounds were evaluated for their 5&#8208;lipoxygenase activity.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters and &#948;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy esters are characteristic structural motifs of statin&#8208;type natural products and drug candidates. Here, we describe the synthesis of functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities using Chan's diene and modified Mukaiyama&#8208;aldol reaction conditions. Diastereoselective reduction of &#948;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy esters afforded the respective syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diols, and saponification yielded the corresponding acids. All products were evaluated for their anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, which uncovered a surprising structure&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Specific Synthesis of Di&#8208;ubiquitin Probes Enabled by the Incorporation of Unnatural Amino Acid ThzK</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unnatural amino acid replacement of designated Lys residues in ubiquitin facilitates the synthesis of linkage&#8208;specific di&#8208;ubiquitin probes that can capture enzymes for ubiquitin transfer and cleavage.







Abstract
Di&#8208;ubiquitin (diUB) conjugates of defined linkages are useful tools for probing the functions of UB ligases, UB&#8208;binding proteins and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in coding, decoding and editing the signals carried by the UB chains. Here we developed an efficient method for linkage&#8208;specific synthesis of diUB probes based on the incorporation of the unnatural amino acid (UAA) N&#1013;&#8208;L&#8208;thiaprolyl&#8208;L&#8208;Lys (L&#8208;ThzK) into UB for ligation with another UB at a defined Lys position. The diUB formed by the UAA&#8208;mediated ligation reaction has a G76C mutation on the side of donor UB for conjugation with E2 and E3 enzymes or undergoing dethiolation to generate a covalent trap for DUBs. The development of UAA mutagenesis for diUB synthesis provides an easy route for preparing linkage&#8208;specific UB&#8208;based probes to decipher the biological signals mediated by protein ubiquitination.

         <title>Strategies to Reduce the On&#8208;Target Platelet Toxicity of Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitors: PROTACs, SNIPERs and Prodrug&#8208;Based Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bcl&#8208;xL protein expression is essential for the survival of platelets, cancer, and senescence cells. Therefore, early&#8208;stage anticancer/senolytic Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs are plagued with on&#8208;target platelet toxicity. Initial attempts with synergistic combinations allowed researchers to reduce effective Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor dosage and related dose&#8208;dependent toxicity. As these designs presented occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology, approaches based on event&#8208;driven pharmacology (especially protein degradation approaches: PROTACs &amp; SNIPERs) gained significant interest. Also, some prodrug strategies have been developed, which are discussed in detail in this review.







Abstract
Apoptosis is a highly regulated cellular process. Aberration in apoptosis is a common characteristic of various disorders. Therefore, proteins involved in apoptosis are prime targets in multiple therapies. Bcl&#8208;xL is an antiapoptotic protein. Compared to other antiapoptotic proteins, the expression of Bcl&#8208;xL is common in solid tumors and, to an extent, in some leukemias and lymphomas. The overexpression of Bcl&#8208;xL is also linked to survival and chemoresistance in cancer and senescent cells. Therefore, Bcl&#8208;xL is a promising anticancer and senolytic target. Various nanomolar range Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitors have been developed. ABT&#8208;263 was successfully identified as a Bcl&#8208;xL/Bcl&#8208;2 dual inhibitor. But it failed in the clinical trial (phase&#8208;II) because of its on&#8208;target platelet toxicity, which also implies an essential role of Bcl&#8208;xL protein in the survival of human platelets. Classical Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs utilize occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology with typical shortcomings (such as dose&#8208;dependent off&#8208;target and on&#8208;target platelet toxicities). Hence, event&#8208;driven pharmacology&#8208;based approaches, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and SNIPERs (specific non&#8208;genetic IAP&#8208;based protein erasers) have been developed. The development of Bcl&#8208;xL based PROTACs was expected, as 600 E3&#8208;ligases are available in humans, while some (such as cereblon (CRBN), von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)) are relatively less expressed in platelets. Therefore, E3 ligase ligand&#8208;based Bcl&#8208;xL PROTACs (CRBN: XZ424, XZ739; VHL: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b) showed a significant improvement in platelet therapeutic index than their parent molecules (ABT&#8208;263: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b, XZ739, PZ15227; A1155463: XZ424). Other than their distinctive pharmacology, PROTACs are molecularly large, which limits their cell permeability and plays a role in improving their cell selectivity. We also discuss prodrug&#8208;based approaches, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ABBV&#8208;155), phosphate prodrugs (APG&#8208;1252), dendrimer conjugate (AZD0466), and glycosylated conjugates (Nav&#8208;Gal). Studies of in&#8208;vitro, in&#8208;vivo, structure&#8208;activity relationships, biophysical characterization, and status of preclinical/clinical inhibitors derived from these strategies are also discussed in the review.

         <title>Optimized Hemolysin Type 1 Secretion System in Escherichia coli by Directed Evolution of the Hly Enhancer Fragment and Including a Terminator Region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretion efficiency of the Hly secretion system was optimized through directed evolution of the Hly enhancer fragment using KnowVolution strategy. The structural analysis of wildtype and the developed enhancer fragment suggested that the improved secretion is due to a different affinity of the novel enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein. This was further supported by a RNA pulldown assay.







Abstract
Type 1 secretion systems (T1SS) have a relatively simple architecture compared to other classes of secretion systems and therefore, are attractive to be optimized by protein engineering. Here, we report a KnowVolution campaign for the hemolysin (Hly) enhancer fragment, an untranslated region upstream of the hlyA gene, of the hemolysin T1SS of Escherichia coli to enhance its secretion efficiency. The best performing variant of the Hly enhancer fragment contained five nucleotide mutations at five positions (A30U, A36U, A54G, A81U, and A116U) resulted in a 2&#8208;fold increase in the secretion level of a model lipase fused to the secretion carrier HlyA1. Computational analysis suggested that altered affinity to the generated enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein contributes to the enhanced secretion levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that involving a native terminator region along with the generated Hly enhancer fragment increased the secretion levels of the Hly system up to 5&#8208;fold.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking between BrU and Pyrene Residues in an RNA/DNA Hybrid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreaction of BrU in a pyrene&#8208;labeled DNA duplex, RNA duplex, and DNA/RNA hybrids was investigated. We found that the photoreactivity of BrU changed dramatically from hydrogen abstraction to cross&#8208;linking by changing the conformation of the duplex from the B&#8208;form to the A&#8208;form.







Abstract
In this study, we investigated the photoreaction of BrU in a pyrene&#8208;labeled DNA duplex, RNA duplex, and DNA/RNA hybrids. We found that the photoreactivity of BrU changed dramatically from hydrogen abstraction to cross&#8208;linking by changing the conformation of the duplex from the B&#8208;form to the A&#8208;form. Among three A&#8208;form structures, the largest amount of cross&#8208;linked products was observed when BrU was incorporated into the RNA strand and the pyrene was conjugated to the 5&#8242; end of the DNA. These results indicate that the contact manner of pyrene was different between A&#8208; and B&#8208;form duplexes. This is a rare example of the use of the reactivity of bromouracil to analyze the contact between a small molecule with a weak binding affinity and a nucleic acid.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of Site&#8208;Specifically Mono&#8208;Ubiquitylated p53</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ubiquitin (Ub) system (E1, E2, E3) ubiquitylates the tumor suppressor p53 thereby affecting different p53 properties including interaction with DNA and other proteins. However, as p53 is ubiquitylated at several lysine residues, it remains unclear, if and how distinct p53 properties are affected by site&#8208;specific ubiquitylation. To address this pertinent question, oxime ligation was employed to generate site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated p53.







Abstract
The tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by various posttranslational modifications including different types of ubiquitylation, which exert distinct effects on p53. While modification by ubiquitin chains targets p53 for degradation, attachment of single ubiquitin moieties (mono&#8208;ubiquitylation) affects the intracellular location of p53 and/or its interaction with chromatin. However, how this is achieved at the molecular level remains largely unknown. Similarly, since p53 can be ubiquitylated at different lysine residues, it remains unclear if the eventual effect depends on the position of the lysine modified. Here, we combined genetic code expansion with oxime ligation to generate p53 site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated at position 120. We found that mono&#8208;ubiquitylation at this position neither interferes with p53 ubiquitylation by the E3 ligases HDM2 and E6AP in complex with the viral E6 oncoprotein nor affects p53 binding to a cognate DNA sequence. Thus, ubiquitylation per se does not affect physiologically relevant properties of p53.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Recognition&#8208;Initiated Exponential Amplification Reaction (PRIEAR) and Its Application in Clinical Diagnosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce DNA assembly is reported. This technology converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combines two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification. Diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations by using PRIEAR.







Abstract
Isothermal exponential amplification technology has rarely been fabricated as a universal sensing platform for the detection of proteins. To broaden their application, we have developed a strategy, named protein&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce DNA assembly, which converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combines two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification. Taking advantage of this principle, diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations in a homogenous manner, making PRIEAR suitable for clinical settings. Therefore, this strategy can expand the powerful isothermal exponential amplification technology to protein targets and thus provide a new toolbox in clinical and biomedical applications.

         <title>The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability**

Twisted supramolecular recognition? CD spectroscopy of Yariv reagent dyes identifies a correlation between positive couplets in CD spectra, indicative of helical chirality, and the ability of the dyes to bind arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs).







Abstract
Yariv reagents are glycosylated triphenylazo dyes that bind to arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), proteoglycans found in plant cell walls that are integral for plant growth and development. Yariv reagents are widely utilized as imaging, purification, and quantification tools for AGPs and represent the only small molecule probe for interrogating AGP function. The ability of Yariv reagents to bind to AGPs is dependent on the structure of the terminal glycoside on the dye. The reason for this selectivity has not been understood until the present work. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the Yariv reagents form supramolecular aggregates with helical chirality. More significantly, the ability of the Yariv reagent to bind AGPs is correlated with this helical chirality. This finding paves the way towards developing a more detailed understanding of the nature of the Yariv&#8208;AGP complex, and the design of AGP&#8208;binding reagents with higher affinities and selectivities.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Michael Additions of Acetaldehyde to Aliphatic Nitroalkenes Catalyzed by Proline&#8208;Based Carboligases</title>

Enantiocomplementary Michael additions: The application of two tailor&#8208;made enantiocomplementary carboligases allow for the stereodivergent synthesis of aliphatic &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes, which are useful precursors for pharmaceutically active analogues of the blockbuster drug, Pregabalin. Good isolated product yields and excellent enantiopurity (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.) were achieved.







Abstract
The blockbuster drug Pregabalin is widely prescribed for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Given the continuous epidemic growth of diabetes, the development of sustainable synthesis routes for Pregabalin and structurally related pharmaceutically active &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives is of high interest. Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes are versatile synthons for the production of GABA derivatives, which can be prepared through a Michael&#8208;type addition of acetaldehyde to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes. Here we report that tailored variants of the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) can accept diverse aliphatic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes as substrates for acetaldehyde addition. Highly enantioenriched aliphatic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes were obtained in good yields using two enantiocomplementary 4&#8208;OT variants. Our results underscore the synthetic potential of 4&#8208;OT for the preparation of structurally diverse synthons for bioactive analogues of Pregabalin.

         <title>Chemical Regulation of the Protein Quality Control E3 Ubiquitin Ligase C&#8208;Terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein (CHIP)</title>

Identification of a CHIP inhibitor: CHIP is a protein quality control E3 ubiquitin&#8208;ligase that has been implicated in numerous diseases. Here we identified an inhibitor of CHIP and revealed that allosteric regulation of CHIP may be one way to regulate its activity.







Abstract
The ubiquitin ligase C&#8208;terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) is an important regulator of proteostasis. Despite playing an important role in maintaining proteostasis, little progress has been made in developing small molecules that regulate ubiquitin transfer by CHIP. Here we used differential scanning fluorimetry to identify compounds that bound CHIP. Compounds that bound CHIP were then analyzed by quantitative ubiquitination assays to identify those that altered CHIP function. One compound, MS.001, inhibited both the chaperone binding and ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP at low micromolar concentrations. Interestingly, we found that MS.001 did not have activity against isolated U&#8208;box or tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains, but instead only inhibited full&#8208;length CHIP. Using in silico docking we identified a potential MS.001 binding site on the linker domain of CHIP and mutation of this site rendered CHIP resistant to MS.001. Together our data identify an inhibitor of the E3 ligase CHIP and provides insight into the development of compounds that regulate CHIP activity.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Permeant, Bioactivatable Coumarin Derivatives for In&#8208;Cell Labelling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;drug approach delivered sulfonated and phosphonated fluorescent coumarin dyes to live cells without labeling internal membranes. The new dyes exhibited homogeneous cell distribution. In addition, the use of azide groups followed by click chemistry provided fluorogenicity.







Abstract
The delivery of small molecule fluorophores with minimal compartmentalization is currently one of the most critical technical problems in intracellular labelling. Here we introduce sulfonated and phosphonated coumarin dyes, demonstrate rapid cell entry via a prodrug approach, and show a lack of interaction with membranes, organelles, or other compartments. The dyes show no specific localization and are evenly distributed in the cells. Our fluorogenic, clickable phosphonate derivatives successfully tagged model targets in intact cells and the increase in brightness upon click reaction was around 60&#8208;fold.

         <title>Improving Biocatalytic Properties of an Azoreductase via the N&#8208;Terminal Fusion of Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fusion protein comprised of formate dehydrogenase and azoreductase was constructed to allow the simultaneous activity of dye reduction and NAD+ regeneration. The fusion protein showed improved substrate scope, but it only showed partial degradation for the bulkier azo dyes.







Abstract
Azoreductases require NAD(P)H to reduce azo dyes but the high cost of NAD(P)H limits its application. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) allows NAD(P)+ recycling and therefore, the fusion of these two biocatalysts seems promising. This study investigated the changes to the fusion protein involving azoreductase (AzoRo) of Rhodococcus opacus 1CP and FDH (FDHC23S and FDHC23SD195QY196H) of Candida boidinii in different positions with His&#8208;tag as the linker. The position affected enzyme activities as AzoRo activity decreased by 20&#8208;fold when it is in the N&#8208;terminus of the fusion protein. FDHC23S+AzoRo was the most active construct and was further characterized. Enzymatic activities of FDHC23S+AzoRo decreased compared to parental enzymes but showed improved substrate scope &#8211; accepting bulkier dyes. Moreover, pH has an influence on the stability and activity of the fusion protein because at pH&#8197;6 (pH that is suboptimal for FDH), the dye reduction decreased to more than 50&#8201;% and this could be attributed to the impaired NADH supply for the AzoRo part.

         <title>A Peroxygenase&#8208;Alcohol Dehydrogenase Cascade Reaction to Transform Ethylbenzene Derivatives into Enantioenriched Phenylethanols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bienzymatic cascade to access complementary chiral phenylethanols from simple ethylbenzene derivatives is presented, combining peroxygenase&#8208;catalysed oxyfunctionalisation to the corresponding acetophenone with alcohol dehydrogenase&#8208;catalysed enantioselective reduction.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a new bienzymatic reaction to produce enantioenriched phenylethanols. In a first step, the recombinant, unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO) was used to oxidise ethylbenzene and its derivatives to the corresponding ketones (prochiral intermediates) followed by enantioselective reduction into the desired (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;phenylethanols using the (R)&#8208;selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH) or the (S)&#8208;selective ADH from Rhodococcus ruber (ADH&#8208;A). In a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade, 11 ethylbenzene derivatives were converted into the corresponding chiral alcohols at acceptable yields and often excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Improving Structural Stability and Anticoagulant Activity of a Thrombin Binding Aptamer by Aromatic Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer (TBA) forms a chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex that shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with thrombin. Modification of TBA with aromatic chromophores is shown to improve the quadruplex stability and thrombin binding affinity. The best results were obtained for the addition of a single PDI unit, which increases the thermal stability (&#916;Tm=+18.2&#8201;&#176;C) and anticoagulant ability of the aptamer.







Abstract
The thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) is a 15&#8208;mer DNA oligonucleotide (5&#8242;&#8208;GGT TGG TGT GGT TGG&#8208;3&#8242;), that can form a stable intramolecular antiparallel chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex structure. This aptamer shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with one of the two anion binding sites of thrombin, namely the fibrinogen&#8208;recognition exosite. Here, we demonstrate that terminal modification of TBA with aromatic fragments such as coumarin, pyrene and perylene diimide (PDI), improves the G&#8208;quadruplex stability. The large aromatic surface of these dyes can &#960;&#8208;&#960; stack to the G&#8208;quadruplex or to each other, thereby stabilizing the aptamer. With respect to the original TBA, monoPDI&#8208;functionalized TBA exhibited the most remarkable improvement in melting temperature (&#916;Tm&#8776;+18&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed enhanced anticoagulant activity.

         <title>Orthogonal Peptide&#8208;Templated Labeling Elucidates Lateral ETAR/ETBR Proximity and Reveals Altered Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
GPCR&#8208;GPCR interactions can influence signaling events but are difficult to investigate in live cell setups. Here, we report on an orthogonal labeling approach, which excludes intracellular background signals and allows the installment of different dyes. Using this technique, the interaction of homo&#8208;receptors demonstrated for different GPCRs, but hetero&#8208;interaction was limited to ETAR/ETBR. For the latter, impaired ETBR signaling was shown.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that lateral GPCR interactions in the cell membrane can impact signaling profiles. Here, we report on a one&#8208;step labeling method of multiple membrane&#8208;embedded GPCRs. Based on short peptide tags, complementary probes transfer the cargo (e.&#8201;g. a fluorescent dye) by an acyl transfer reaction with high spatial and temporal resolution within 5&#8197;min. We applied this approach to four receptors of the cardiovascular system: the endothelin receptor A and B (ETAR and ETBR), angiotensin II receptor type 1, and apelin. Wild type&#8208;like G protein activation after N&#8208;terminal modification was demonstrated for all receptor species. Using FRET&#8208;competent dyes, a constitutive proximity between hetero&#8208;receptors was limited to ETAR/ETBR. Further, we demonstrate, that ETAR expression regulates the signaling of co&#8208;expressed ETBR. Our orthogonal peptide&#8208;templated labeling of different GPCRs provides novel insight into the regulation of GPCR signaling.

The modular architecture of naturally occurring ribozymes makes them a promising class of structural platform for the design and assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) RNA nanostructures. We dimerized ribozyme trimers with a triangular shape by introducing three pillar units. The double&#8208;decker hexamers exhibited higher catalytic activity than the parent ribozyme trimers.







Abstract
The modular architecture of naturally occurring ribozymes makes them a promising class of structural platform for the design and assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) RNA nanostructures, into which the catalytic ability of the platform ribozyme can be installed. We have constructed and analyzed RNA nanostructures with polygonal&#8208;shaped (closed) ribozyme oligomers by assembling unit RNAs derived from the Tetrahymena group I intron with a typical modular architecture. In this study, we dimerized ribozyme trimers with a triangular shape by introducing three pillar units. The resulting double&#8208;decker nanostructures containing six ribozyme units were characterized biochemically and their structures were observed by atomic force microscopy. The double&#8208;decker hexamers exhibited higher catalytic activity than the parent ribozyme trimers.

         <title>Serum Compatible Spermine&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids with Nonidentical Hydrocarbon Tails Mediate High Transfection Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with nonidentical hydrophobic chains showed excellent transfection efficiency under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions when compared with the commercially available transfection agent, Lipofectamine3000.







Abstract
Cationic lipids are widely used as nonviral synthetic vectors for gene delivery as a safer alternative to viral vectors. In this work, a library of L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with identical and nonidentical hydrophobic chains having variable carbon lengths (from C10 to C18) was designed and synthesized. These lipids were characterized and the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds were determined for DNA binding and transfection ability when formulated as cationic liposomes. The liposomes were then used successfully for the transfection of HEK293T, HeLa, PC3, H460, HepG2, SH&#8208;SY5Y and Calu&#8217;3&#8197;cell lines. The transfection efficiency of lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon chains was greater than the identical analogue. These reagents exhibited superior efficiency to the commercial reagent, Lipofectamine3000, under both serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions in HEK293T, HeLa and H460&#8197;cell lines. The lipids were not toxic to the tested cell line. The results suggest that L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon tails could serve as efficient and safe nonviral vector gene carriers in further in&#8197;vivo studies.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenases for the Regiospecific Hydroxylation of Polycyclic Phenols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to perform regiospecific hydroxylations of sterically challenging monophenols was engineered into a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase. Its variants are valuable tools for production of the corresponding catechols for in&#8197;vitro or live whole&#8208;cell conversions.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylacetate 3&#8208;hydroxylase (4HPA3H), a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase from E. coli that catalyzes the hydroxylation of monophenols to catechols, was modified by rational redesign to convert also more bulky substrates, especially phenolic natural products like phenylpropanoids, flavones or coumarins. Selected amino acid positions in the binding pocket of 4HPA3H were exchanged with residues from the homologous protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yielding variants with improved conversion of spacious substrates such as the flavonoid naringenin or the alkaloid mimetic 2&#8208;hydroxycarbazole. Reactions were followed by an adapted Fe(III)&#8208;catechol chromogenic assay selective for the products. Especially substitution of the residue Y301 facilitated modulation of substrate specificity: introduction of nonaromatic but hydrophobic (iso)leucine resulted in the preference of the substrate ferulic acid (having a guaiacyl (guajacyl) moiety, part of the vanilloid motif) over unsubstituted monophenols. The in&#8197;vivo (whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts) and in&#8197;vitro (three&#8208;enzyme cascade) transformations of substrates by 4HPA3H and its optimized variants was strictly regiospecific and proceeded without generation of byproducts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ability to perform&lt;/b&gt; regiospecific hydroxylations of sterically challenging monophenols was engineered into a flavin-dependent monooxygenase. Its variants are valuable tools for production of the corresponding catechols for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; or live whole-cell conversions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-Hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase (4HPA3H), a flavin-dependent monooxygenase from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; that catalyzes the hydroxylation of monophenols to catechols, was modified by rational redesign to convert also more bulky substrates, especially phenolic natural products like phenylpropanoids, flavones or coumarins. Selected amino acid positions in the binding pocket of 4HPA3H were exchanged with residues from the homologous protein from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, yielding variants with improved conversion of spacious substrates such as the flavonoid naringenin or the alkaloid mimetic 2-hydroxycarbazole. Reactions were followed by an adapted Fe(III)-catechol chromogenic assay selective for the products. Especially substitution of the residue Y301 facilitated modulation of substrate specificity: introduction of nonaromatic but hydrophobic (iso)leucine resulted in the preference of the substrate ferulic acid (having a guaiacyl (guajacyl) moiety, part of the vanilloid motif) over unsubstituted monophenols. The &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; (whole-cell biocatalysts) and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; (three-enzyme cascade) transformations of substrates by 4HPA3H and its optimized variants was strictly regiospecific and proceeded without generation of byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NMR Data&#8208;Driven Docking of HDM2&#8208;Inhibitor Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
HDM2 lead optimization was guided by the rapid generation of protein&#8208;ligand structures using an NMR&#8208;data driven docking protocol. This work underscores an &#8220;integrative&#8221; approach where strengths from modeling, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy can be leveraged to deliver more information on ligand&#8208;protein interactions than is available from any one technique.







Abstract
We present an automated NMR&#8208;guided docking workflow that can be used to generate models of protein&#8208;ligand complexes based on data from NOE NMR experiments. The first step is to generate a number of intermolecular distance constraints from experimental NOE data. Then, the ligand is docked on an ensemble of receptor structures to account for protein flexibility, and multiple poses are generated. Finally, we use the NOE&#8208;based constraints to filter and score docking poses based on the percentage of NOE constraints that are consistent with protein&#8208;ligand interatomic distances. This workflow was successfully used during a lead optimization project to generate models of synthetic protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors bound to the HDM2 protein.

         <title>Cover Feature: The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability (ChemBioChem 6/2022)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Yariv reagents are a class of tris&#8208;azo dyes, some of which stain and precipitate arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), plant cell wall proteoglycans. These dyes form supramolecular aggregates in solution. In this study, CD spectroscopy revealed that the aggregates exhibit helical chirality. Only those aggregates with right&#8208;handed helicity have a fertile interaction with AGP, while those with left&#8208;handed helicity do not bind. Artwork credit: D. Caianiello and M. Bohne.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidation of protein interactions in living cells is a critical step in deciphering pharmacological targets. Here, we apply an orthogonal labeling approach to G protein&#8208;coupled receptors by two peptide pairs, interacting through coiled&#8208;coil motifs. The rapid reporter introduction in a one&#8208;pot reaction allows the investigation of transient and proximity&#8208;dependent interplay of different receptor proteins at the cell membrane. Focusing on prominent cardiovascular receptors, present in heart and blood vessel tissue, distinct receptor&#8211;receptor interactions have been identified that modulate intracellular signaling cascades. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;G. Beck&#8208;Sickinger et&#8197;al.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Natural Proteins and Their Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive natural proteins have been widely investigated and show great potential for their application in various fields. This minireview highlights the recent advances in natural proteins with specific stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, including temperature, light, force, electric field, and magnetic field.







Abstract
Natural proteins are essential biomacromolecules that fulfill versatile functions in the living organism, such as their usage as cytoskeleton, nutriment transporter, homeostasis controller, catalyzer, or immune guarder. Due to the excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility/biodegradability, natural protein&#8208;based biomaterials are well equipped for prospective applications in various fields. Among these natural proteins, stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins can be reversibly and precisely manipulated on demand, rendering the protein&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for numerous applications, including disease detection, drug delivery, bio&#8208;sensing, and regenerative medicine. Therefore, we present some typical natural proteins with diverse physical stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, including temperature, light, force, electrical, and magnetic sensing in this review. The structure&#8208;function mechanism of these proteins is discussed in detail. Finally, we give a summary and perspective for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins.

Various nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, and differentiate. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool.







Abstract
At the cellular level, numerous nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, differentiate, etc. Understanding and manipulating the cellular functions in&#8197;vitro, necessitates the elucidation of these nanocues provided to the cells by the extracellular matrix (ECM), neighbouring cells or in the form of ligands. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool. We also provide a brief outlook on the current challenges and the future potentials of these DNA&#8208;based nanostructures so as to inspire novel innovations in the field.

         <title>New Trends and Future Opportunities in the Enzymatic Formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research on the biocatalytic formation of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O is surveyed in this review to provide an overview of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field as well as future perspectives.







Abstract
Organic chemistry provides society with fundamental products we use daily. Concerns about the impact that the chemical industry has over the environment is propelling major changes in the way we manufacture chemicals. Biocatalysis offers an alternative to other synthetic approaches as it employs enzymes, Nature's catalysts, to carry out chemical transformations. Enzymes are biodegradable, come from renewable sources, operate under mild reaction conditions, and display high selectivities in the processes they catalyse. As a highly multidisciplinary field, biocatalysis benefits from advances in different areas, and developments in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering have accelerated the extension of the range of available transformations (E.&#8197;L. Bell et&#8197;al., Nat. Rev. Meth. Prim. 2021, 1, 1&#8211;21). Recently, we surveyed advances in the expansion of the scope of biocatalysis via enzyme discovery and protein engineering (J.&#8197;R. Marshall et&#8197;al., Tetrahedron 2021, 82, 131926). Herein, we focus on novel enzymes currently available to the broad synthetic community for the construction of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bonds, with the purpose of providing the non&#8208;specialist with new and alternative tools for chiral and sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Charge Matters: Mutations in Omicron Variant Favor Binding to Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 6, March 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the mutations present in the Omicron variant, the surface of the spike protein is highly positively charged. For binding of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to host cells, electrostatic interactions with heparan sulfate polyglycerols covering the cell surface play an essential role. Molecular dynamic simulation reveals that the interaction of the Omicron spike with polysulfates is much stronger than that of the wild type. We surmise that this enhanced interaction favors binding of Omicron and therefore subsequent cell entry and infection.







Abstract
Evidence is strengthening to suggest that the novel SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mutant Omicron, with its more than 60 mutations, will spread and dominate worldwide. Although the mutations in the spike protein are known, the molecular basis for why the additional mutations in the spike protein that have not previously occurred account for Omicron's higher infection potential, is not understood. We propose, based on chemical rational and molecular dynamics simulations, that the elevated occurrence of positively charged amino acids in certain domains of the spike protein (Delta: +4; Omicron: +5 vs. wild type) increases binding to cellular polyanionic receptors, such as heparan sulfate due to multivalent charge&#8208;charge interactions. This observation is a starting point for targeted drug development.

         <title>Structural dynamics support electrostatic interactions in the active site of Adenylate Kinase.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrostatic preorganization as well as structural and dynamic heterogeneity are often used to rationalize the remarkable catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, they are often presented as incompatible because the generation of permanent electrostatic effects implies that the protein structure remains rigid. Here, we use a metric, electric fields, that can treat electrostatic contributions and dynamics effects on equal footing, for a unique perspective on enzymatic catalysis. We find that the residues that contribute the most to electrostatic interactions with the substrate in the active site of Adenylate Kinase (our working example) are also the most flexible residues. Further, entropy&#8208;tuning mutations raise flexibility at the picosecond timescale where more conformations can be visited on short time periods, thereby softening the sharp heterogeneity normally visible at the microsecond timescale.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalytically active non&#8208;metal cofactors in enzymes carry out a variety of different reactions. The efforts to develop derivatives of natural occurring cofactors such as flavins or pyridoxal phosphate and the advances to design new, non&#8208;natural cofactors are reviewed here. We report the status quo for enzymes harboring organocatalysts as derivatives of natural cofactors or as artificial ones and their application in the asymmetric synthesis of various compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Properties Dictating Selective Optotracer Detection of S.&#160;aureus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optotracers are conformation&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer molecules detecting peptide&#8208; and carbohydrate&#8208;based biopolymers. Their binding to bacterial cell walls allows selective detection and visualisation of  Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)  . Here, we investigated the structural properties providing optimal detection of  S. aureus.  We quantified spectral shifts and fluorescence intensity in mixes of bacteria and optotracers, using automatic peak analysis, cross&#8208;correlation, and area under curve analysis. We found that the length of the conjugated backbone and the number of charged groups, but not their distribution, are important factors for selective detection of  S. aureus  . The photophysical properties of optotracers were greatly improved by incorporating a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D)&#8208;type motif in the conjugated backbone. With significantly reduced background and binding&#8208;induced on&#8208;switch of fluorescence, these optotracers enabled real&#8208;time recordings of  S. aureus  growth. Collectively, this proves the chemical structure and photophysics as key tunable characteristics in the development of optotracers for selective detection of bacterial species.</dc:description>

         <title>Trichoderma&#8208;derived pentapeptides from the infected nest mycobiome of the subterranean termite Coptotermes testaceus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Termites live in a dynamic environment where colony health is strongly influenced by surrounding microbes. However, little is known about the mycobiomes of lower termites and their nests, and how these change in response to disease. Here we compared the individual and nest mycobiomes of a healthy subterranean termite colony (  Coptotermes testaceus  ) to one infected and ultimately eradicated by a fungal pathogen. We identified  Trichoderma  species in the materials of both nests, but they were also abundant in the infected termites. Methanolic extracts of  Trichoderma  sp. FHG000531, isolated from the infected nest, were screened for secondary metabolites by UHPLC&#8208;HR MS/MS&#8208;guided molecular networking. We identified many bioactive compounds with potential roles in the eradication of the infected colony, as well as a cluster of six unknown peptides. The novel peptide FE011 was isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The function of this novel peptide family as well as the role of  Trichoderma  species in dying termite colonies therefore requires further investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Major Shell Protein of 1,2&#8208;Propanediol Utilization Microcompartment Conserves the Activity of Its Signature Enzyme at Higher Temperatures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaperon&#8208;like behavior of the shell protein PduBB&#8217; towards the native enzyme PduCDE was studied. The shell protein PduBB&#8217; was found to interact with the enzyme PduCDE and protect it from temperature&#8208;induced denaturation. It also preserved its catalytic activity during thermal stress.







Abstract
A classic example of an all&#8208;protein natural nano&#8208;bioreactor, the bacterial microcompartment is a prokaryotic organelle that confines enzymes in a small volume enveloped by an outer protein shell. These protein compartments metabolize specific organic molecules, allowing bacteria to survive in restricted nutrient environments. In this work, 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilization microcompartment (PduMCP) was used as a model to study the effect of molecular confinement on the stability and catalytic activity of native enzymes in the microcompartment. A combination of enzyme assays, spectroscopic techniques, binding assays, and computational analysis were used to evaluate the impact of the major shell protein PduBB&#8242; on the stability and activity of PduMCP&#8242;s signature enzyme, dioldehydratase PduCDE. While free PduCDE shows &#8764;45&#8201;% reduction in its optimum activity (activity at 37&#8201;&#176;C) when exposed to a temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C, it retains similar activity up to 50&#8201;&#176;C when encapsulated within PduMCP. PduBB&#8242;, a major component of the outer shell of PduMCP, preserves the catalytic efficiency of PduCDE under thermal stress and prevents temperature&#8208;induced unfolding and aggregation of PduCDE in&#8197;vitro. We observed that while both PduB and PduB&#8242; interact with the enzyme with micromolar affinity, only the PduBB&#8242; combination influences its activity and stability, highlighting the importance of the unique PduBB&#8242; combination in the functioning of PduMCP.

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Mediated Enzyme Fragment Complementation Assay for Quantification of the Stability of Splice Isoforms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR&#8208;mediated enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay targeting exon 7 of the survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene was developed. The EFC assay is compatible with 384&#8208;well plates and robustly quantified the splicing modulation activity of small molecules.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule splicing modulators exemplified by an FDA&#8208;approved drug, risdiplam, are a new pharmacological modality for regulating the expression and stability of splice isoforms. We report a CRISPR&#8208;mediated enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay to quantify the splice isoform stability. The EFC assay harnessed a 42 amino acid split of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (designate &#945;&#8208;tag), which could be fused at the termini of the target genes using CRISPR/cas9. The &#945;&#8208;tagged splice isoform would be quantified by measuring the enzymatic activity upon complementation with the rest of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This EFC assay retained all the sequences of introns and exons of the target gene in the native genomic environment that recapitulates the cell biology of the diseases of interest. For a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;mediated EFC assay targeting the exon 7 of the survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene. The EFC assay is compatible with 384&#8208;well plates and robustly quantified the splicing modulation activity of small molecules. In this study, we also discovered that a coumarin derivative, compound 4, potently modulated SMN2 exon 7 splicing at as low as 1.1&#8197;nM.

         <title>Optimizing the chemiluminescence of a light&#8208;producing deoxyribozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supernova is a chemiluminescent deoxyribozyme recently discovered in our group. It transfers the phosphate group from the 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate CDP&#8208;Star to its 5' hydroxyl group, which triggers a decomposition reaction and the production of light. Here we investigated the effects of reaction conditions on the ability of Supernova to generate a chemiluminescent signal (using a plate reader assay) and to phosphorylate itself (using a ligation assay). Our experiments indicate that multiple zinc ions are required for catalytic function, suggesting links between Supernova and protein enzymes that catalyze similar reactions. They also show how factors such as pH, potassium concentration, CDP&#8208;Star concentration, and DNA concentration affect the reaction. By combining information from different experiments, the rate enhancement of light production was increased by more than 1000&#8208;fold. These results should be useful for applications in which Supernova is used as a sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiplexed Delivery of Synthetic (Un)Conjugatable Ubiquitin and SUMO2 Enables Simultaneous Monitoring of Their Localization and Function in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live cell imaging of post&#8208;translationally modified proteins is key to understanding their involvement in both healthy and disease states. We report multiplexed bead loading (MBL) for the simultaneous delivery of several synthetic proteins to the same cells. Using MBL, we reveal unknown involvements of ubiquitin and SUMO2 in lysosomes.







Abstract
Ubiquitin (Ub) and its related small Ub like modifier (SUMO) are among the most influential protein post&#8208;translational modifications in eukaryotes. Unfortunately, visualizing these modifications in live cells is a challenging task. Chemical protein synthesis offers great opportunities in studying and further understanding Ub and SUMO biology. Nevertheless, the low cell permeability of proteins limits these studies mainly for in&#8197;vitro applications. Here, we introduce a multiplexed protein cell delivery approach, termed MBL (multiplexed bead loading), for simultaneous loading of up to four differentially labeled proteins with organic fluorophores. We applied MBL to visualize ubiquitination and SUMOylation events in live and untransfected cells without fluorescent protein tags or perturbation to their endogenous levels. Our study reveals unprecedented involvements of Ub and SUMO2 in lysosomes depending on conjugation states. We envision that this approach will improve our understanding of dynamic cellular processes such as formation and disassembly of membraneless organelles.

Delivery of Toluidine Blue (TB) to DNA in the form of TB&#8208;surfactant ionic pair occurs in the pre&#8208;micellar stage of the surfactant, in contrast to the no transfer of TB molecules to DNA in the micellar stage.







Abstract
Drug delivery to a target without adverse effects is one of the major criteria for clinical use. Herein, we have made an attempt to explore the delivery efficacy of SDS surfactant in a monomer and micellar stage during the delivery of the model drug, Toluidine Blue (TB) from the micellar cavity to DNA. Molecular recognition of pre&#8208;micellar SDS encapsulated TB with DNA occurs at a rate constant of k1 &#8764;652&#8197;s&#8722;1. However, no significant release of encapsulated TB at micellar concentration was observed within the experimental time frame. This originated from the higher binding affinity of TB towards the nano&#8208;cavity of SDS at micellar concentration which does not allow the delivery of TB from the nano&#8208;cavity of SDS micelles to DNA. Thus, molecular recognition controls the extent of DNA recognition by TB which in turn modulates the rate of delivery of TB from SDS in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Porphyrin in Prebiotic Catalysis: Ascertaining a Route for the Emergence of Early Metalloporphyrins**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Putative pathway for the emergence of primitive metalloporphyrins: We studied the influence of the porphyrin scaffold tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS), on the modulation of metal ion&#8208;mediated oxidation. We show that TPPS can modulate metal ion oxidizing activity by forming metal&#8208;coordinated complexes or non&#8208;coordinated aggregates. We also show the formation of metal&#8208;TPPS coordinated complexes under prebiotic settings, highlighting their potential role as primitive catalysts.







Abstract
Metal ions are known to catalyze certain prebiotic reactions. However, the transition from metal ions to extant metalloenzymes remains unclear. Porphyrins are found ubiquitously in the catalytic core of many ancient metalloenzymes. In this study, we evaluated the influence of porphyrin&#8208;based organic scaffold, on the catalysis, emergence and putative molecular evolution of prebiotic metalloporphyrins. We studied the effect of porphyrins on the transition metal ion&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ). We report a change in the catalytic activity of the metal ions in the presence of porphyrin. This was observed to be facilitated by the coordination between metal ions and porphyrins or by the formation of non&#8208;coordinated complexes. The metal&#8208;porphyrin complexes also oxidized NADH, underscoring its versatility at oxidizing more than one substrate. Our study highlights the selective advantage that some of the metal ions would have had in the presence of porphyrin, underscoring their role in shaping the evolution of protometalloenzymes.

         <title>Fermentative Production of Halogenated Tryptophan Derivatives with Corynebacterium glutamicum Overexpressing Tryptophanase or Decarboxylase Genes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tryptophan overproducing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain was metabolically engineered to produce 7&#8208;Br/Cl&#8208;indole and 7&#8208;Br/Cl&#8208;tryptamine. For this purpose, tryptophanases and aromatic l&#8208;amino acid decarboxylases from different origins were screened and utilized in combination with halogenase RebH. Fermentative production of 7&#8208;Br&#8208;tryptamine in a bioreactor resulted in a product titer of 0.36&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
The aromatic amino acid l&#8208;tryptophan serves as a precursor for many valuable compounds such as neuromodulators, indoleamines and indole alkaloids. In this work, tryptophan biosynthesis was extended by halogenation followed by decarboxylation to the respective tryptamines or cleavage to the respective indoles. Either the tryptophanase genes tnaAs from E. coli and Proteus vulgaris or the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase genes AADCs from Bacillus atrophaeus, Clostridium sporogenes, and Ruminococcus gnavus were expressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum strains producing (halogenated) tryptophan. Regarding indoles, final titers of 16&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Cl&#8208;indole and 23&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;indole were attained. Tryptamine production led to a much higher titer of 2.26&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 upon expression of AADC from B. atrophaeus. AADC enzymes were shown to be active with halogenated tryptophan in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo and supported production of 0.36&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;tryptamine with a volumetric productivity of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a fed&#8208;batch fermentation.

         <title>Phenyl Selenide&#8208;Based Precursors as Hydrogen Peroxide Inducible DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Method to produce quinone methides (QMs): Phenolic hydroxyl group and benzylic leaving group are essential for the formation of QMs. In contrast to previous work on H2O2&#8208;inducible formation of phenolic hydroxyl group to produce QMs, we show that H2O2&#8208;inducible formation of a good benzylic leaving group, benzeneselenenic acid converted from phenyl selenoxide, evokes generation of QMs to crosslink DNA.







Abstract
DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic DNA lesions, and induce cell death by blocking DNA strand separation. Most ICL agents aiming to kill cancer cells, also generate adverse side effects tonormal cells. H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA ICL agents are highly selective for targeting cancer cells, as the concentrationof H2O2 is higher in cancer cells than normal cells.Previous studies have focused on arylboronate&#8208;based precursors, reacting with H2O2 to generate reactive quinone methides (QMs) crosslinking DNA. Here we explore phenyl selenide&#8208;based precursors 1&#8211;3 as H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA ICL agents. The precursors 1&#8211;3 can be activated by H2O2 to generate the good benzylic leaving group and promote productionof reactive QMs to crosslink DNA. Moreover, the DNA cross&#8208;linking ability isenhancedby the introduction ofsubstituentsin the para&#8208;position ofthe phenolic hydroxyl group. From the substituents explored (H, OMe, F), the introduction of electron donating group (OMe) shows a pronounced elevating effect. Further mechanisticstudies at the molecular and DNA levelsconfirm alkylation sites located mainly at dAs, dCs and dGs in DNA. Additionally, cellular experiments reveal that agents 1&#8211;3 exhibit higher cytotoxicity toward H1299 human lung cancer cells compared to clinically used drugs, by inducing cellular DNA damage, apoptosis and G0/G1&#8197;cell cycle arrest. This study provides a strategy to develop H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA interstrand cross&#8208;linkers.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of the Fluorescent, Cyclic Dinucleotides cthGAMP</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP is an essential second messenger for the innate immune system of mammals. The organic synthesis of an intrinsically fluorescent mimic provided large quantities for cell feeding studies, examination of biological activity and two&#8208;photon excitation microscopy.







Abstract
The cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is known for its role in sensing cytosolic DNA introduced by a viral infection, bacterial invasion or tumorigenesis. Free DNA is recognized by the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS) catalyzing the production of 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP) in mammals. This cyclic dinucleotide acts as a second messenger, activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) that finally triggers the transcription of interferon genes and inflammatory cytokines. Due to the therapeutic potential of this pathway, both the production and the detection of cGAMP via fluorescent moieties for assay development is of great importance. Here, we introduce the paralleled synthetic access to the intrinsically fluorescent, cyclic dinucleotides 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP and 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP based on phosphoramidite and phosphate chemistry, adaptable for large scale synthesis. We examine their binding properties to murine and human STING and confirm biological activity including interferon induction by 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP in THP&#8208;1 monocytes. Two&#8208;photon imaging revealed successful cellular uptake of 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cthGAMP in THP&#8208;1 cells.

         <title>Selective Display of a Chemoattractant Agonist on Cancer Cells Activates the Formyl Peptide Receptor 1&#8201;on Immune Cells**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional immune&#8208;engaging agents that exploit the inherent acidic microenvironment of most solid tumors were developed to selectively graft the surface of cancer cells with a formyl peptide receptor ligand (FPRL). We established that selectively remodeling cancer cells with such peptides activates formyl peptide receptors on recruited immune cells, potentially initiating an immune response towards tumors.







Abstract
Current immunotherapeutics often work by directing components of the immune system to recognize biomarkers on the surface of cancer cells to generate an immune response. However, variable changes in biomarker distribution and expression can result in inconsistent patient response. The development of a more universal tumor&#8208;homing strategy has the potential to improve selectivity and extend therapy to cancers with decreased expression or absence of specific biomarkers. Here, we designed a bifunctional agent that exploits the inherent acidic microenvironment of most solid tumors to selectively graft the surface of cancer cells with a formyl peptide receptor ligand (FPRL). Our approach is based on the pH(Low) insertion peptide (pHLIP), a unique peptide that selectively targets tumors in&#8197;vivo by anchoring to cancer cells in a pH&#8208;dependent manner. We establish that selectively remodeling cancer cells with a pHLIP&#8208;based FPRL activates formyl peptide receptors on recruited immune cells, potentially initiating an immune response towards tumors.

         <title>Carving the Active Site of CYP153A7 Monooxygenase for Improving Terminal Hydroxylation of Medium&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The P450&#8208;mediated terminal hydroxylation of non&#8208;activated C&#8211;H bonds is a chemically challenging reaction. CYP153A7 monooxygenase discovered in  Sphingomonas  sp. HXN200 belongs to the CYP153A subfamily and shows a pronounced terminal selectivity. Herein, we report the significantly improved terminal hydroxylation activity of CYP153A7 by redesign of the substrate binding pocket based on molecular docking of CYP153A7&#8211;C  8:0  and sequence alignments. Some of the resultant single mutants were advantageous over the wild&#8208;type enzyme with higher reaction rates, achieving a complete conversion of  n&#8208;  octanoic acid (C  8:0.  1 mM) in a shorter period. Especially, a single&#8208;mutation variant, D258E, showed 3.8&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency than the wild type toward the terminal hydroxylation of medium&#8208;chain fatty acid C  8:0  into the high value&#8208;added product 8&#8208;hydroxyoctanoic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable DNA&#8208;based Peroxidases Controlled by a Chaotropic Ion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we demonstrate a switchable DNA electron transfer catalyst, enabled by selective destabilization of secondary structure by a denaturant, perchlorate. The system is comprised of two strands, one of which can be selectively switched between a G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex or single&#8208;stranded conformations. In the G&#8208;quadruplex state, it binds hemin, enabling peroxidase activity. This switching ability arises from our finding that perchlorate, a chaotropic Hofmeister ion, selectively destabilizes duplex over G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. By varying perchlorate concentration, we show that the DNA structure can be switched between states that do and do not catalyze electron transfer catalysis. State switching can be achieved in three ways: thermally, by dilution, or by concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Optimization of the Toxic Conformation Model of Amyloid &#946;42 by Intramolecular Disulfide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformation&#8208;restricted analogues of amyloid &#946;42 (1&#8211;6) with an intramolecular disulfide bridge exist in an oligomeric state (250&#8211;800&#8197;kDa) in a cell culture medium. Nevertheless, only 1&#8211;3 with a Cys&#8208;Cys or homoCys&#8208;Cys bridge at positions 17/28 exhibit potent cytotoxicity against SH&#8208;SY5Y and THP&#8208;1 cells, suggesting that the formation of oligomers is not a necessary and sufficient condition to induce cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers play a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, we reported that a conformation&#8208;restricted A&#946;42 with an intramolecular disulfide bond through cysteine residues at positions 17/28 formed stable oligomers with potent cytotoxicity. To further optimize this compound as a toxic conformer model, we synthesized three analogues with a combination of cysteine and homocysteine at positions 17/28. The analogues with Cys&#8208;Cys, Cys&#8208;homoCys, or homoCys&#8208;Cys, but not the homoCys&#8208;homoCys analogue, exhibited potent cytotoxicity against SH&#8208;SY5Y and THP&#8208;1 cells even at 10&#8197;nM. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of conformation&#8208;restricted analogues at positions 16/29 or 18/27 was significantly weaker than that of wild&#8208;type A&#946;42. Furthermore, thioflavin&#8208;T assay, non&#8208;denaturing gel electrophoresis, and morphological studies suggested that the majority of these conformation&#8208;restricted analogues exists in an oligomeric state in cell culture medium, indicating that the toxic conformation of A&#946;42, rather than the oligomeric state, is essential to induce cytotoxicity.

         <title>Stereoselective Biocatalyzed Reductions of Ginger Active Components Recovered from Industrial Wastes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ginger active constituents have been successfully recovered from industrial waste biomasses of fermented ginger and converted into the corresponding diols and alcohols by stereoselective biocatalyzed reductions.







Abstract
Ginger is among the most widespread and widely consumed traditional medicinal plants around the world. Its beneficial effects, which comprise e.&#8201;g. anticancer and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities as well as gastrointestinal regulatory effects, are generally attributed to a family of non&#8208;volatile compounds characterized by an arylalkyl long&#8208;chained alcohol, diol, or ketone moiety. In this work, ginger active components have been successfully recovered from industrial waste biomass of fermented ginger. Moreover, their recovery has been combined with the first systematic study of the stereoselective reduction of gingerol&#8208;like compounds by isolated alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), obtaining the enantioenriched sec&#8208;alcohol derivatives via a sustainable biocatalytic path in up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversions and &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric/diastereomeric excesses.

         <title>Principles of Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Nucleotide Interactions Revealed by Binding Affinities between Homogeneous Oligopeptides and Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbead&#8208;based flow cytometry method (FCM) was used to perform the binding affinity measurements for octapeptides&#8208;ssDNA. Comparative analyses of the binding energies reveal unique binding strength patterns assignable to each pair of ssDNA and octapeptide. Amino&#8208;acid&#8208;nucleotide interactions can be categorized in three levels of binding strength: strong, intermediate, and weak, separated by apparent gaps in binding energies.

We have determined the binding strengths between nucleotides of adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine in homogeneous single stranded DNAs and homo&#8208;octapeptides consisting of 20 common amino acids. We use a bead&#8208;based fluorescence assay for these measurements in which octapeptides are immobilized on the bead surface and ssDNAs are in solutions. Comparative analyses of the distribution of the binding energies reveal unique binding strength patterns assignable to each DNA nucleotide and amino acid originating from the chemical structures. Pronounced favorable (such as Arg&#8208;G, etc.) and unfavorable (such as Ile&#8208;T, etc.) binding interactions can be identified in selected groups of amino acid and nucleotide pairs that could provide basis to elucidate energetics of amino&#8208;acid&#8208;nucleotide interactions. Such interaction selectivity, specificity and polymorphism establish the contributions from DNA backbone, DNA bases, as well as main chain and side chain of the amino acids.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A microbead-based&lt;/b&gt; flow cytometry method (FCM) was used to perform the binding affinity measurements for octapeptides-ssDNA. Comparative analyses of the binding energies reveal unique binding strength patterns assignable to each pair of ssDNA and octapeptide. Amino-acid-nucleotide interactions can be categorized in three levels of binding strength: strong, intermediate, and weak, separated by apparent gaps in binding energies.

A one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade has been developed for the cell&#8208;free conversion of racemic secondary alcohols to either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiopure chiral amines, with in&#8208;situ recycling of NAD(P)+ cofactors. This biocatalytic system was successfully applied to the amination reaction of racemic 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol to yield the high value (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the amine reaching good (73&#8201;% (S)) and excellent (&gt;99&#8201;% (R)) enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiopure chiral amines from racemic alcohols is a key transformation in the chemical industry, e.&#8201;g., in the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, this reaction remains challenging. In this work, we propose a one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade for the direct conversion of a racemic alcohol into either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the corresponding amine, with in&#8208;situ cofactor recycling. This enzymatic cascade consists of two enantio&#8208;complementary alcohol dehydrogenases, both NADH and NADPH oxidase for in&#8208;situ recycling of NAD(P)+ cofactors, and either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantioselective transaminase. This cell&#8208;free biocatalytic system has been successfully applied to the conversion of racemic 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol into the high value (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the amine reaching good (73&#8201;% (S)) and excellent (&gt;99&#8201;% (R)) enantioselectivities.

         <title>Impact of bPNA Backbone Structural Constraints and Composition on Triplex Hybridization with DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone constraints and amino acid composition of bPNAs exert subtle effects on triplex hybridization with DNA. Design elements that limit backbone conformation favor hybridization, but conservative amino acid mutations can also have a significant effect on hybrid stability.







Abstract
We report herein a study on the impact of bifacial peptide nucleic acid (bPNA) amino acid composition and backbone modification on DNA binding. A series of bPNA backbone variants with identical net charge were synthesized to display either 4 or 6 melamine (M) bases. These bases form thymine&#8208;melamine&#8208;thymine (TMT) base&#8208;triples, resulting in triplex hybrid stem structures with T&#8208;rich DNAs. Analyses of 6&#8197;M bPNA&#8208;DNA hybrids suggested that hybrid stability was linked to amino acid secondary structure propensities, prompting a more detailed study in shorter 4&#8197;M bPNAs. We synthesized 4&#8197;M bPNAs predisposed to adopt helical secondary structure via helix&#8208;turn nucleation in 7&#8208;residue bPNAs using double&#8208;click covalent stapling. Generally, hybrid stability improved upon stapling, but amino acid composition had a more significant effect. We also pursued an alternative strategy for bPNA structural preorganization by incorporation of residues with strong backbone amide conformational preferences such as 4R&#8208; and 4S&#8208;fluoroprolines. Notably, these derivatives exhibited an additional improvement in hybrid stability beyond both unsubstituted proline bPNA analogues and the helically patterned bPNAs. Overall, these findings demonstrate the tunability of bPNA&#8208;DNA hybrid stability through bPNA backbone structural propensities and amino acid composition.

         <title>Superior Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Gold Nanorattles in Ultrasensitive H2O2 Sensing and Antioxidant Screening</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxidase&#8208;like activity of gold nanorattles was evaluated and was found to have better efficiency compared to that of solid gold nanocubes and nanospheres. Thus, they were able to sense hydrogen peroxide down to a few micromolar concentrations. These nanorattles were further used to screen antioxidants or determine antioxidant potential.







Abstract
Nanozymes are artificial enzyme systems which are easy to produce, highly stable and cost&#8208;effective in comparison to natural enzymes. Herein, we evaluated the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of gold nanorattles (Au NRTs) having a solid gold octahedron core and thin, porous cubic gold shell. We also prepared solid gold nanocubes and nanospheres of similar sizes and surface charge as that of Au NRTs and compared their activity with standard horse radish peroxidase (HRP). All the prepared nanostructures followed Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics as observed from their substrate concentration vs. initial reaction velocity plot using 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate. The kinetic parameters and the catalytic efficiency for the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the nanostructures and HRP were calculated, and it was observed that Au NRTs possess the best nanozymatic activity with lowest KM and highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). The better activity of Au NRTs compared with other nanostructures and HRP could be attributed to the hollow porous structure with a solid core where different surfaces are available for reaction. Au NRTs, being the best amongst the tested nanozymes were further used for the sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and were found to sense H2O2 down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M. Further, two naturally occurring antioxidants, tannic acid and ascorbic acid showed inhibitory effect on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Au NRTs in a concentration dependent manner which can be further used for screening of antioxidants or for determining the antioxidant potential.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Step Enzymatic Cascade for Efficient Production of L&#8208;Phenylglycine from Biobased L&#8208;Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise four&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for L&#8208;phenylglycine synthesis from biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine was devised. Forty millimolar L&#8208;phenylalanine afforded the synthesis of 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L&#8208;phenylglycine, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion.







Abstract
Enantiopure amino acids are of particular interest in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for efficient production of L&#8208;phenylglycine (L&#8208;Phg) from biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine (L&#8208;Phe). We first attempted to engineer Escherichia coli for expressing L&#8208;amino acid deaminase (LAAD) from Proteus mirabilis, hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from Amycolatopsis orientalis, (S)&#8208;mandelate dehydrogenase (SMDH) from Pseudomonas putida, the endogenous aminotransferase (AT) encoded by ilvE and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) from E. coli. However, 10&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phe only afforded the synthesis of 7.21&#177;0.15&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phg. The accumulation of benzoylformic acid suggested that the transamination step might be rate&#8208;limiting. We next used leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) from Bacillus cereus to bypass the use of L&#8208;glutamate as amine donor, and 40&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phe gave 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L&#8208;Phg, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion. In summary, this work demonstrates a concise four&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for L&#8208;Phg synthesis from biobased L&#8208;Phe, with a potential for future industrial applications.

Forty millimolar L-phenylalanine afforded the synthesis of 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L-phenylglycine, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantiopure amino acids are of particular interest in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we report a multi-enzyme cascade for efficient production of L-phenylglycine (L-Phg) from biobased L-phenylalanine (L-Phe). We first attempted to engineer &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; for expressing L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD) from &lt;i&gt;Proteus mirabilis&lt;/i&gt;, hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from &lt;i&gt;Amycolatopsis orientalis&lt;/i&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-mandelate dehydrogenase (SMDH) from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt;, the endogenous aminotransferase (AT) encoded by &lt;i&gt;ilvE&lt;/i&gt; and L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. However, 10&#8197;mM L-Phe only afforded the synthesis of 7.21&#177;0.15&#8197;mM L-Phg. The accumulation of benzoylformic acid suggested that the transamination step might be rate-limiting. We next used leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; to bypass the use of L-glutamate as amine donor, and 40&#8197;mM L-Phe gave 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L-Phg, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion. In summary, this work demonstrates a concise four-step enzymatic cascade for L-Phg synthesis from biobased L-Phe, with a potential for future industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of Competitive Inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;Dependent Protein Kinase**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed to combat malaria. Isoxazole&#8208;based compounds were found to be potent, selective, and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is an enticing antimalarial drug target. Novel chemotypes are needed because existing inhibitors have safety issues that may prevent further development. This work demonstrates isoxazole&#8208;based compounds are potent ATP competitive inhibitors of PfPKG and discloses a new analogue in this series. Isoxazoles 3 and 5 had Ki values that are comparable to a known standard, 4&#8208;[2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(1&#8208;methylpiperidine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H pyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;yl] pyridine. They also exhibited excellent selectivity for PfPKG over the human orthologue and the gatekeeper mutant T618Q PfPKG, which mimics the less accessible binding site of the human orthologue. The human orthologue's larger binding site volume is predicted to explain the selectivity of the inhibitors for the P. falciparum enzyme.

         <title>An Engineered Cholesterol Oxidase Catalyses Enantioselective Oxidation of Non&#8208;steroidal Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Libraries of cholesterol oxidase variants were screened for activity towards secondary alcohols. The active variants oxidised a range of secondary alcohols including unactivated alcohols, and allylic and benzylic alcohols. In conjunction with a non&#8208;selective reducing agent, they effected the deracemisation of racemic alcohols to yield (R)&#8208;alcohols in high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
The enantioselective oxidation of 2&#176; alcohols to ketones is an important reaction in synthetic chemistry, especially if it can be achieved using O2&#8208;driven alcohol oxidases under mild reaction conditions. However to date, oxidation of secondary alcohols using alcohol oxidases has focused on activated benzylic or allylic substrates, with unactivated secondary alcohols showing poor activity. Here we show that cholesterol oxidase (EC&#8197;1.1.3.6) could be engineered for activity towards a range of aliphatic, cyclic, acyclic, allylic and benzylic secondary alcohols. Additionally, since the variants demonstrated high (S)&#8208;selectivity, deracemisation reactions were performed in the presence of ammonia borane to obtain enantiopure (R)&#8208;alcohols.

         <title>Dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;Branched Primer Assembled Gene Nanovector and Its Potential Applications in Genome Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;branched primer, branch&#8208;PCR provided a size&#8208;tunable method to construct gene nanovectors, which could carry the full CRISPR/Cas9 components but retain a biocompatible size (100&#8211;200&#8197;nm) with high serum stability. This size tunability of branch&#8208;PCR constructed gene nanovectors expands their application in genome editing.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used as an efficient genome editing toolkit for gene therapy. The delivery of vectors encoding the full CRISPR/Cas9 components including Cas9 gene and gRNA expression element into cells is the crucial step to effective genome editing. However, the cargo gene sequence for genome editing is usually large, which reduces the cargo encapsulation efficiency and affects the vector size. To obtain a nanovector with high cargo gene loading capacity and biocompatible size, we report the construction of a gene nanovector from branch&#8208;PCR with a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;branched primer and establish the correlation mapping between gene length and nanovector size. The results show that the size of nanovectors can be tuned according to the gene length. According to the findings, we constructed nanovectors carrying the full CRISPR/Cas9 components in 100&#8211;200&#8197;nm and validated their application in genome editing. The results show that this kind of nanovector exhibits higher serum stability than plasmids and can reach comparable genome editing efficiency with plasmids. Hence, this type of gene nanovector obtained through branch&#8208;PCR can carry large gene cargos and maintain a biocompatible nanoscale size, which we envisage will expand its medical applications in gene therapy.

         <title>The &#945;/&#946; Hydrolase AzpM Catalyzes Dipeptide Synthesis in Alazopeptin Biosynthesis Using Two Molecules of Carrier Protein&#8208;Tethered Amino Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alazopeptin biosynthesis includes a characteristic peptide&#8208;formation machinery that uses a hydrolase (AzpM) to synthesize a dipeptide composed of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine (DON). Detailed analyses using a DON analogue, azaserine, show that AzpM catalyzes the condensation of two DON molecules tethered to a carrier protein and the subsequent hydrolysis. Enzymatic synthesis of alazopeptin analogues composed of azaserine was also established.







Abstract
During the biosynthesis of alazopeptin, a tripeptide composed of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;L&#8208;norleucine (DON) and one of alanine, the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase AzpM synthesizes the DON&#8208;DON dipeptide using DON tethered to the carrier protein AzpF (DON&#8208;AzpF). However, whether AzpM catalyzes the condensation of DON&#8208;AzpF with DON or DON&#8208;AzpF remains unclear. Here, to distinguish between these two condensation possibilities, the reaction catalyzed by AzpM was examined in&#8197;vitro using a DON analogue, azaserine (AZS). We found that AzpM catalyzed the condensation between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON&#8208;AzpF, but not between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON. Possible reaction intermediates, DON&#8208;DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AZS&#8208;AzpF, were also detected during AzpM&#8208;catalyzed dipeptide formation from DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AzpF, respectively. From these results, we concluded that AzpM catalyzed the condensation of the two molecules of DON&#8208;AzpF and subsequent hydrolysis to produce DON&#8208;DON. Thus, AzpM is an unprecedented &#945;/&#946; hydrolase that catalyzes dipeptide synthesis from two molecules of a carrier protein&#8208;tethered amino acid.

         <title>Glyco&#8208;Steroidal Amphiphiles (GSAs) for Membrane Protein Structural Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthetically accessible glyco&#8208;diosgenin (GDN) variants were developed. Some of these agents confer enhanced membrane protein stability compared to DDM (n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;maltoside) and the original GDN.







Abstract
Integral membrane proteins pose considerable challenges to high resolution structural analysis. Maintaining membrane proteins in their native state during protein isolation is essential for structural study of these bio&#8208;macromolecules. Detergents are the most commonly used amphiphilic compounds for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution outside a lipid bilayer. We previously introduced a glyco&#8208;diosgenin (GDN) detergent that was shown to be highly effective at stabilizing a wide range of membrane proteins. This steroidal detergent has additionally gained attention due to its compatibility with membrane protein structure study via cryo&#8208;EM. However, synthetic inconvenience limits widespread use of GDN in membrane protein study. To improve its synthetic accessibility and to further enhance detergent efficacy for protein stabilization, we designed a new class of glyco&#8208;steroid&#8208;based detergents using three steroid units: cholestanol, cholesterol and diosgenin. These new detergents were efficiently prepared and showed marked efficacy for protein stabilization in evaluation with a few model membrane proteins including two G protein&#8208;coupled receptors. Some new agents were not only superior to a gold standard detergent, DDM (n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;maltoside), but were also more effective than the original GDN at preserving protein integrity long term. These agents represent valuable alternatives to GDN, and are likely to facilitate structural determination of challenging membrane proteins.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application of a Clickable Version of Epoxomicin for Proteasome Activity Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epoxomicin&#8208;alkyne probe described can be clicked to a variety of fluorophores. It can then be used in gel&#8208;based assays, microscopy, and flow cytometry to determine proteasome activity. It is sensitive enough to be able to detect both proteasome inhibition and stimulation by small molecules.







Abstract
Degradation of proteins by the proteasome is an essential cellular process and one that many wish to study in a variety of disease types. There are commercially available probes that can monitor proteasome activity in cells, but they typically contain common fluorophores that limit their simultaneous use with other activity&#8208;based probes. In order to exchange the fluorophore or incorporate an enrichment tag, the proteasome probe likely has to be synthesized which can be cumbersome. Here, we describe a simple synthetic procedure that only requires one purification step to generate epoxomicin, a selective proteasome inhibitor, with a terminal alkyne. Through a copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition, any moiety containing an azide can be incorporated into the probe. Many fluorophores are commercially available that contain an azide that can be &#8220;clicked&#8221;, allowing this proteasome activity probe to be included into already established assays to monitor both proteasome activity and other cellular activities of interest.

         <title>Immobilization of the Aspartate Ammonia&#8208;Lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 on Magnetic Nanoparticles: Characterization and Kinetics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aspartate ammonia&#8208;lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 (PfAAL) was isolated, expressed and characterized in this study. PfAAL was covalently immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles. Both the native and immobilized PfAAL were efficient biocatalysts in the ammonia elimination of aspartate. The effect of the viscosity of the reaction medium was investigated with the free and immobilized enzyme.







Abstract
Aspartate ammonia&#8208;lyases (AALs) catalyze the non&#8208;oxidative elimination of ammonia from l&#8208;aspartate to give fumarate and ammonia. In this work the AAL coding gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 was identified, isolated, and cloned into the pET&#8208;15b expression vector and expressed in E.&#8197;coli. The purified enzyme (PfAAL) showed optimal activity at pH&#8197;8.8, Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics in the ammonia elimination from l&#8208;aspartate, and no strong dependence on divalent metal ions for its activity. The purified PfAAL was covalently immobilized on epoxy&#8208;functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), and effective kinetics of the immobilized PfAAL&#8208;MNP was compared to the native solution form. Glycerol addition significantly enhanced the storability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP. Inhibiting effect of the growing viscosity (modulated by addition of glycerol or glucose) on the enzymatic activity was observed for the native and immobilized form of PfAAL, as previously described for other free enzymes. The storage stability and recyclability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP is promising for further biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Inhibiting erastin&#8208;induced ferroptotic cell death by purine&#8208;based chelators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis is a novel cell death event caused by increased lipid peroxidation leading to iron&#8208;dependent oxidative stress and associated with a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, ferroptosis inhibition has been emerging as a novel strategy to target the different pathologies. Here, we report the synthesis of two purine derivatives, 1 and 2, on iron chelation strategy and evaluate their potency to inhibit erastin induced ferroptosis. Both compounds showed efficient iron chelation in solution state as well as in the cellular environment. Crystal structure of purine derivative with iron demonstrated 2:1 (ligand to metal center) stoichiometry for iron and purine derivative complexation. The synthesized compounds also decrease the reactive oxygen species concentration in vitro cell culture. Compound 2 showed better potency towards the prevention of ferroptotic cell death as compared to commercially available iron chelator in erastin induced ferroptosis cell culture model. Such purine analogs are potential functional scaffolds for the development of a few target molecules for ferroptosis inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Formaldehyde Dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida to Favor Nicotinamide Cytosine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NAD&#8208;dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) was engineered and the mutant enzyme FalDH* was obtained with over 150&#8208;fold higher preference for the non&#8208;natural cofactor NCD.







Abstract
The enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) from Pseudomonas putida is of particular interest for biotechnological applications as it catalyzes the oxidation of formaldehyde independent of glutathione. However, the consumption of a stoichiometric amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) can be challenging at the metabolic level as this may affect many other NAD&#8208;linked processes. A potential solution is to engineer FalDH to utilize non&#8208;natural cofactors. Here we devised FalDH variants to favor nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) by structure&#8208;guided modification of the binding pocket for the adenine moiety of NAD. Several mutants were obtained and the best one FalDH 9B2 had over 150&#8208;fold higher preference for NCD than NAD. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the cofactor binding pocket shrunk to better fit NCD, a smaller&#8208;sized cofactor. FalDH 9B2 together with other NCD&#8208;linked enzymes offer opportunities to assemble orthogonal pathways for biological conversion of C1 molecules.

         <title>Opportunities for Expanding Encoded Chemical Diversification and Improving Hit Enrichment in mRNA&#8208;Displayed Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA&#8208;displayed libraries of peptides and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries of small molecules are compared and contrasted in this review with a focus on diversification reactions and selection approaches where the former can learn from developments in the latter. We conclude by outlining a path towards approaches that may offer discovery of hybrid small&#8208;molecule peptidomimetics.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded small&#8208;molecule libraries and mRNA displayed peptide libraries both use numerically large pools of oligonucleotide&#8208;tagged molecules to identify potential hits for protein targets. They differ dramatically, however, in the &#8216;drug&#8208;likeness&#8217; of the molecules that each can be used to discover. We give here an overview of the two techniques, comparing some advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest areas where particularly mRNA display can benefit from adopting advances developed with DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We outline cases where chemical modification of the peptide library has already been used in mRNA display, and survey opportunities to expand this using examples from DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We also propose potential opportunities for encoding such reactions within the mRNA/cDNA tag of an mRNA&#8208;displayed peptide library to allow a more diversity&#8208;oriented approach to library modification. Finally, we outline alternate approaches for enriching target&#8208;binding hits from a pooled and tagged library, and close by detailing several examples of how an adjusted mRNA&#8208;display based approach could be used to discover new &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; modified small peptides.

         <title>Rational Design of Self&#8208;Assembling Artificial Proteins Utilizing a Micelle&#8208;Assisted Protein Labeling Technology (MAPLabTech): Testing the Scope**

         <dc:description>
Advancement of micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling technology (MAPLabTech 3.0): In this work, we have demonstrated the synthesis of self&#8208;assembling artificial proteins by site&#8208;specific labeling of a single cysteine residue of globular proteins. This methodology should be broadly applicable to a wide range of natural and recombinant proteins containing an engineered cysteine residue.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling artificial proteins (SAPs) have gained enormous interest in recent years due to their applications in different fields. Synthesis of well&#8208;defined monodisperse SAPs is accomplished predominantly through genetic methods. However, the last decade has witnessed the use of a few chemical technologies for this purpose. In particular, micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling technology (MAPLabTech) has made huge progress in this area. The first generation MAPLabTech focused on site&#8208;specific labeling of the active&#8208;site residue of serine proteases to make SAPs. Further, this methodology was exploited for labeling of N&#8208;terminal residue of a globular protein to make functional SAPs. In this study, we describe the synthesis of novel SAPs by developing a chemical method for site&#8208;specific labeling of a surface&#8208;exposed cysteine residue of globular proteins. In addition, we disclose the synthesis of redox&#8208;sensitive SAPs and their systematic self&#8208;assembly and disassembly studies using size&#8208;exclusion chromatography. Altogether these studies further expand the scope of MAPLabTech in different fields such as vaccine design, targeted drug delivery, diagnostic imaging, biomaterials, and tissue engineering.

         <title>Spectroscopic and in&#8197;vitro Investigations of Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Nucleic Acid Repair and Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinorganic perspective on the AlkB as well as the TET enzyme families, Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases involved in nucleic acid repair and processing, and epigenetic gene regulation is presented in this review. Important spectroscopic techniques which can be useful for in&#8197;vitro examination of the structure and formation of those proteins and their active site, of the interaction with their substrates, as well as of mechanistic details are discussed together with their advantages and limitations.







Abstract
The activation of molecular oxygen for the highly selective functionalization and repair of DNA and RNA nucleobases is achieved by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/iron&#8208;dependent dioxygenases. Of special interest are the human homologues AlkBH of Escherichia coli EcAlkB and ten&#8208;eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in demethylation or dealkylation of DNA and RNA, although additional physiological functions are continuously being found. Given their importance, studying enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions, turnover and kinetic parameters is pivotal for the understanding of the mode of action of these enzymes. Diverse analytical methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been employed to study the changes in the active site and the overall enzyme structure upon substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor addition. Several methods are now available to assess the activity of these enzymes. By discussing limitations and possibilities of these techniques for EcAlkB, AlkBH and TET we aim to give a comprehensive synopsis from a bioinorganic point&#8208;of&#8208;view, addressing researchers from different disciplines working in the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field of epigenetic processes and DNA/RNA repair and modification.

         <title>Mapping the Conformational Landscape of the Neutral Network of RNA Sequences That Connect Two Functional Distinctly Different Ribozymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diversity of secondary structures of different ribozymes connected through several mutational steps were investigated. We mapped the mutational landscape in order to understand changes in secondary structure and their link to particular functions. This work further highlights the necessity for the utilization of different complementary techniques for the analysis of RNA secondary structures.







Abstract
During evolution of an RNA world, the development of enzymatic function was essential. Such enzymatic function was linked to RNA sequences capable of adopting specific RNA folds that possess catalytic pockets to promote catalysis. Within this primordial RNA world, initially evolved self&#8208;replicating ribozymes presumably mutated to ribozymes with new functions. Schultes and Bartel (Science 2000, 289, 448&#8211;452) investigated such conversion from one ribozyme to a new ribozyme with distinctly different catalytic functions. Within a neutral network that linked these two prototype ribozymes, a single RNA chain could be identified that exhibited both enzymatic functions. As commented by Schultes and Bartel, this system possessing one sequence with two enzymatic functions serves as a paradigm for an evolutionary system that allows neutral drifts by stepwise mutation from one ribozyme into a different ribozyme without loss of intermittent function. Here, we investigated this complex functional diversification of ancestral ribozymes by analyzing several RNA sequences within this neutral network between two ribozymes with class III ligase activity and with self&#8208;cleavage reactivity. We utilized rapid RNA sample preparation for NMR spectroscopic studies together with SHAPE analysis and in&#8208;line probing to characterize secondary structure changes within the neutral network. Our investigations allowed delineation of the secondary structure space and by comparison with the previously determined catalytic function allowed correlation of the structure&#8208;function relation of ribozyme function in this neutral network.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs): Promising Biocatalysts for the Environmentally Friendly Production of Aroma Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are promising biocatalysts that catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids to produce (one carbon&#8208;shortened) fatty aldehydes, which are used as flavors and fragrances. This comprehensive review summarizes the recent advances in the biotechnological utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with focus on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs together with analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity.







Abstract
Fatty aldehydes (FALs) can be derived from fatty acids (FAs) and related compounds and are frequently used as flavors and fragrances. Although chemical methods have been conventionally used, their selective biotechnological production aiming at more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly synthetic routes is in demand. &#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are heme&#8208;dependent oxidative enzymes biologically involved in the initial step of plant FA &#945;&#8208;oxidation during which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the C&#945;&#8208;position of a FA (Cn) to generate the intermediate FA hydroperoxide, which is subsequently converted into the shortened corresponding FAL (Cn&#8208;1). &#945;&#8208;DOXs are promising biocatalysts for the flavor and fragrance industries, they do not require NAD(P)H as cofactors or redox partner proteins, and they have a broad substrate scope. Here, we highlight recent advances in the biocatalytic utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with emphasis on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs as well as analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Synthetic Neoglycoconjugates of Hepta&#8208; and Nonamannoside Ligands for Eliciting Oligomannose&#8208;Specific HIV&#8208;1&#8208;Neutralizing Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannoside 3&#8208;aminopropyl derivatives were prepared in good overall yields using a block&#8208;wise assembly followed by conversion into neoglycoconjugates. CRM197 conjugates of the &#946;&#8208;variants showed comparable binding to Fabs of HIV&#8208;1 neutralizing PGT antibodies, but stronger binding of the heptamannosides by the corresponding IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Oligomannose&#8208;type glycans on the spike protein of HIV&#8208;1 constitute relevant epitopes to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Herein we describe an improved synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;linked hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl ligands that were subsequently converted into BSA and CRM197 neoglycoconjugates. We assembled the ligands from anomeric 3&#8208;azidopropyl spacer glycosides from select 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected thiocresyl mannoside donors. Chain extensions were achieved using [4+3] or [4+5] block synthesis of thiocresyl and trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors. Subsequent global deprotection generated the 3&#8208;aminopropyl oligosaccharide ligands. ELISA binding data obtained with the &#946;&#8208;anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl conjugates with a selection of HIV&#8208;1 bnAbs showed comparable binding of both mannosyl ligands by Fab fragments yet lesser binding of the nonasaccharide conjugate by the corresponding IgG antibodies. These results support previous observations that a complete Man9 structure might not be the preferred antigenic binding motif for some oligomannose&#8208;specific antibodies, and have implications for glycoside designs to elicit oligomannose&#8208;targeted HIV&#8208;1&#8208;neutralizing antibodies.

         <title>The pH&#8208;Dependence of the Hydration of 5&#8208;Formylcytosine: an Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has been identified and quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. We report a free energy of hydration for the hydration reactions of 5&#8201;fC and 5&#8201;fU. In case of 5&#8201;fC, acidification leads to an increased hydrate content of up to 0.5&#8201;% in aqueous solution.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formylcytosine is an important nucleobase in epigenetic regulation, whose hydrate form has been implicated in the formation of 5&#8208;carboxycytosine as well as oligonucleotide binding events. The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has now been quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. Small amounts of hydrate can be identified for the protonated form of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and for neutral 5&#8208;formyluracil. For neutral 5&#8208;formylcytosine, however, direct detection of the hydrate was not possible due to its very low abundance. This is in full agreement with theoretical estimates.

         <title>Dual Activities of Oxidation and Oxidative Decarboxylation by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual functions by a single active site are found in flavoenzyme oxidases. This is the first review to discuss and compare the reaction mechanisms of flavoenzymes catalyzing both oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation of l&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid. Recurrent features and factor controlling oxidative decarboxylation are proposed.







Abstract
Specific flavoenzyme oxidases catalyze oxidative decarboxylation in addition to their classical oxidation reactions in the same active sites. The mechanisms underlying oxidative decarboxylation by these enzymes and how they control their two activities are not clearly known. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of four enzymes from the l&#8208;amino acid oxidase and l&#8208;hydroxy acid oxidase families, including l&#8208;tryptophan 2&#8208;monooxygenase, l&#8208;phenylalanine 2&#8208;oxidase and l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase and lactate monooxygenase which catalyze substrate oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation. Apart from specific interactions to allow substrate oxidation by the flavin cofactor, specific binding of oxidized product in the active sites appears to be important for enabling subsequent decarboxylation by these enzymes. Based on recent findings of l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase, we propose that nucleophilic attack of H2O2 on the imino acid product is the mechanism enabling oxidative decarboxylation.

         <title>Strategies for Interference of Insulin Fibrillogenesis: Challenges and Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite of the fact that the world is celebrating the 100th year of the discovery of insulin, advancement in the domain of insulin stabilization remains unsaturated. An efficient, simpler, and an economically favorable solution is always welcome. This review will be useful for a broad range of researchers working in the development of aggregation&#8208;free insulin formulations or insulin analogues.







Abstract
The discovery of insulin came with very high hopes for diabetic patients. In 2021, the world celebrated the 100th anniversary of the discovery of this vital hormone. However, external use of insulin is highly affected by its aggregating tendency that occurs during its manufacturing, transportation, and improper handling which ultimately leads to its pharmaceutically and biologically ineffective form. In this review, we aim to discuss the various approaches used for decelerating insulin aggregation which results in the enhancement of its overall structural stability and usage. The approaches that are discussed are broadly classified as either a measure through excipient additions or by intrinsic modifications in the insulin native structure.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic description of Pdx2 catalytic mechanism is provided by QM/MM methodologies. Pdx2, the glutaminase subunit of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) synthase, is characterized by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad used to deaminate glutamine to glutamate. While being absent in humans, Pdx2 is essential for the development and replication of the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogens, which are responsible for two deadly diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, respectively. Pdx2 is thus a promising drug target for fighting these diseases. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;F. Pina et&#8197;al.

         <title>Oxidative Stress in Cancer Therapy: Friend or Enemy?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative stress and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells is described in this review, followed by discussion of the therapeutic strategies focused on ROS levels for cancer therapy. Clinically approved drugs with oxidative stress anticancer mechanisms of action are described and examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates with such mechanisms of action are highlighted.







Abstract
Excessive cellular oxidative stress is widely perceived as a key factor in pathophysiological conditions and cancer development. Healthy cells use several mechanisms to maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overall redox homeostasis to avoid damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Cancer cells, in contrast, exhibit elevated ROS levels and upregulated protective antioxidant pathways. Counterintuitively, such elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defence mechanisms in cancer cells provide a therapeutic opportunity for the development of drugs with different anticancer mechanisms of action (MoA). In this review, oxidative stress and the role of ROS in cells are described. The tumour&#8208;suppressive and tumour&#8208;promotive functions of ROS are discussed, and these two different therapeutic strategies (increasing or decreasing ROS to fight cancer) are compared. Clinically approved drugs with demonstrated oxidative stress anticancer MoAs are highlighted followed by description of examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates causing oxidative stress in cancer cells via novel MoAs.

         <title>Biocatalytic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Promising Materials for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous networks and attractive functions have been intelligently employed as supports to encase enzymes and protect them against harsh environments. More importantly, customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative guideline for constructing robust enzyme mimics. This review will introduce the concept of these biocatalytic MOFs, with special emphasis on how the biocatalytic processes operate in these materials can reverse the plight of native enzyme&#8208;based biosensing.

The highly efficient and specific catalysis of enzymes allows them to recognize a myriad of substrates, which enables biosensing. However, the fragility of natural enzymes severely restricts their practical applications.

         <title>Modern Strategies for the Diversification of the Supply of Natural Compounds: The Case of Alkaloid Painkillers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaloid pharmaceuticals supply&#8208;chain is highly dependent on opium poppy harvest. The biosynthesis of alkaloid painkillers encounters its first bottleneck in the enzymatic Pictet&#8208;Spengler stereoselective condensation of 4&#8208;HPAA and dopamine, to synthesize S&#8208;norcoclaurine. The enzyme mechanisms and possible methodology for the improvement of their efficiency are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived natural compounds have been used for treating diseases since prehistorical times. The supply of many plant&#8208;derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is primarily dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency adds an extra risk factor to ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Emerging technologies, such as biocatalysis, might help to solve this problem by diversifying the sources of supply of these compounds. Here we review the first committed step in the production of alkaloid painkillers, the production of S&#8208;norcoclaurine, and the enzymes involved. The improvement of these enzymes can be carried out experimentally by directed evolution and rational design strategies, supported by computational methods, to create variants that produce the S&#8208;norcoclaurine precursor for alkaloid painkillers in heterologous organisms, meeting the pharmaceutical industry standards and needs without depending on opium poppy crops.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Protein Manipulation Systems: From Function Regulation to Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami creates an ideal operation panel for positioning and manipulating individual proteins with nanoscale precision. This review provides an overview of the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems for protein function regulation and biological applications.







Abstract
Proteins directly participate in tremendous physiological processes and mediate a variety of cellular functions. However, precise manipulation of proteins with predefined relative position and stoichiometry for understanding protein&#8208;protein interactions and guiding cellular behaviors is still challenging. With superior programmability of DNA molecules, DNA origami technology is able to construct arbitrary nanostructures that can accurately control the arrangement of proteins with various functionalities to solve these problems. Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami&#8208;based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.

Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami-based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami-based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extension of the Terpene Chemical Space: the Very First Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to a unique biosynthetic scheme, the diversification of terpene structure could be envisioned through the structural modification of the two universal common terpene precursors IPP and DMAPP. This minireview covers the synthesis, the use as prenyl transferase substrates, and the synthetic application of IPP and DMAPP homologues developed for diversifying the terpene chemical space.







Abstract
The structural diversity of terpenes is particularly notable and many studies are carried out to increase it further. In the terpene biosynthetic pathway this diversity is accessible from only two common precursors, i.&#8201;e. isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Methods recently developed (e.&#8201;g. the Terpene Mini Path) have allowed DMAPP and IPP to be obtained from a two&#8208;step enzymatic conversion of industrially available isopentenol (IOH) and dimethylallyl alcohol (DMAOH) into their corresponding diphosphates. Easily available IOH and DMAOH analogues then offer quick access to modified terpenoids thus avoiding the tedious chemical synthesis of unnatural diphosphates. The aim of this minireview is to cover the literature devoted to the use of these analogues for widening the accessible terpene chemical space.

         <title>Bioinorganic Chemistry of Zinc in Relation to the Immune System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc's role in human immunity has been extensively covered from a biological perspective. The structural, thermodynamic, and inorganic chemistry of zinc in relation to proteins and pathways of the immune system has received less attention and is the topic of the present review.







Abstract
Zinc is well&#8208;known to have a central role in human inflammation and immunity and is itself an anti&#8208;inflammatory and antiviral agent. Despite its massively documented role in such processes, the underlying chemistry of zinc in relation to specific proteins and pathways of the immune system has not received much focus. This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc&#8208;based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hydrogel Nanoparticles: Synthetic Antibodies for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles have great potential as materials of the future in nanomedicine. We show that these synthetic antibodies can compete seriously with their biological counterparts for immunostaining of cell glycans and protein biomarkers, for targeted drug delivery, and as therapeutic agents for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) accounted for 10 million deaths in 2020. Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, etc.), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells. In this review, we describe an emerging class of targeting ligands, molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles for their application in the early detection of disease, with the aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One scaffold &#8211; different organelle sensors: The structure&#8208;organelle relationship (SOR) of an important synthetic intermediate targeting the nucleus and its transformation into other pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes is demonstrated. The fluorescent probes were synthesized using a single synthetic route. As shown in the cover picture, the assembly line illustrates that a common synthetic intermediate (rectangle shape) was transformed into another molecule (triangle or hexagonal shape) in a one&#8208;step reaction to target specific cell organelles in live microglial cells. The common intermediate targets the cell nucleus, the cationic probe targets mitochondria, whereas the amine&#8208;containing probe with pH&#8208;activable property targets acidic lysosomes. The graphic was created by Ryann Davis. More information can be found in the Communication by G. Chopra et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>
The three nitrogenase isoenzymes: The molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase, the vanadium (V) nitrogenase and the iron (Fe)&#8208;only nitrogenase, here depicted as superheroes, have a unique spectrum of activities for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The cover feature (created by Ehmad Chehrghani Bozcheloe) summarizes this minireview: the Mo nitrogenase has the highest activity for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), the V nitrogenase for the reduction of CO and the Fe&#8208;only nitrogenase for the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right tool can do the trick: A novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis was identified using the computer&#8208;assisted prediction tool Tome, and two variants with altered active sites were constructed based on homology models. All new enzyme variants showed significantly increased thermostability compared with the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens to date. The enzyme variants showed different substrate specificities and different activities in the presence of a range of co&#8208;solvents. The most stable variant was then immobilized and used for continuous production of enantiopure benzoin. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;S. Rabe et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. The results show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages. These results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia &#8211; the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens that rely on this mechanism to obtain PLP. For this reason, Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases. The results obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i)&#8197;activation of Cys87, (ii)&#8197;deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii)&#8197;hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv)&#8197;enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature (19.1&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) agree very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step (18.2&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;11), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site. This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)&#8197;it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)&#8197;the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii) Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process. Together, these results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.

         <title>A Specialized Dehydrogenase Provides l&#8208;Phenyllactate for FR900359 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenase FrsC is involved in biosynthesis of the Gq protein inhibiting natural product FR900359. Here, we biochemically characterized FrsC, catalyzing the formation of l&#8208;phenyllactate, and its subsequent incorporation into the FR assembly line followed by epimerization. A detailed bioinformatic analysis revealed that FrsC has evolved from primary metabolic enzymes to a specialized reductase accepting only aromatic substrates.







Abstract
d&#8208;Phenyllactate (PLA) is a component of the selective Gq protein inhibitor and nonribosomal cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). Here we report a detailed biochemical investigation of PLA biosynthesis and its incorporation into the natural product FR. The enzyme FrsC, member of the lactate/malate dehydrogenase superfamily, was shown to catalyze the formation of l&#8208;PLA from phenylpyruvate. FrsC was kinetically characterized and its substrate specificity determined. Incorporation of l&#8208;PLA was probed by assaying the adenylation domain FrsE&#8208;A3 and feeding studies with a Chromobacterium vaccinii &#916;frsC mutant, confirming preferred activation of l&#8208;PLA followed by on&#8208;line epimerization to d&#8208;PLA. Finally, detailed bioinformatic analyses of FrsC revealed its close relation to malate dehydrogenases from primary metabolism and suggest extensions in the substrate binding loop to be responsible for its adaptation to accepting larger aromatic substrates with high specificity.

         <title>The Small Open Reading Frame&#8208;Encoded Peptides: Advances in Methodologies and Functional Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small open reading frames (sORFs) were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of sORFs&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.







Abstract
Small open reading frames (sORFs) are an important class of genes with less than 100 codons. They were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that sORFs could encode a considerable number of polypeptides, many of which play important roles in both physiology and disease pathology. However, it has been technically challenging to directly detect sORF&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here, we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.

         <title>Oligo Pools as an Affordable Source of Synthetic DNA for Cost&#8208;Effective Library Construction in Protein&#8208; and Metabolic Pathway Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of large variant libraries is critical for rational protein engineering, directed evolution, and protein de novo design, but is constrained by the relatively high cost of DNA synthesis. Here, we consolidate methods that allow using array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools as DNA input &#8211; a cheap but error&#8208;prone source of DNA.







Abstract
The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user&#8208;defined sequences (up to &#8764;350&#8197;bases in length) have emerged as a low&#8208;cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost &#8804;10&#8201;% (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next&#8208;generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence&#8208;function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de&#8208;novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.

         <title>Mammalian Chemical Genomics towards Identifying Targets and Elucidating Modes&#8208;of&#8208;Action of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical genomic screens using shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA libraries in mammalian cultured cells play central roles in identifying modes of action of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances of chemical genomic approaches in mammalian cultured cells to identify the molecular target, modes of action, and synthetic lethal pathways of compounds of interest, with a focus on recent examples including our results are discussed.







Abstract
The step of identifying target molecules and elucidating the mode of action of bioactive compounds is a major bottleneck for drug discovery from phenotypic screening. Genetic screening for genes that affect drug sensitivity or phenotypes of mammalian cultured cells is a powerful tool to obtain clues to their modes of action. Chemical genomic screening systems for comprehensively identifying such genes or genetic pathways have been established using shRNA libraries for RNA interference&#8208;mediated mRNA knockdown or sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene knockout. The combination of chemical genomic screening in mammalian cells with other approaches such as biochemical searches for target molecules, phenotypic profiling, and yeast genetics provides a systematic way to elucidate the mode of action by converging various pieces of information regarding target molecules, target pathways, and synthetic lethal pathways.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical genomic&lt;/b&gt; screens using shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA libraries in mammalian cultured cells play central roles in identifying modes of action of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances of chemical genomic approaches in mammalian cultured cells to identify the molecular target, modes of action, and synthetic lethal pathways of compounds of interest, with a focus on recent examples including our results are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The step of identifying target molecules and elucidating the mode of action of bioactive compounds is a major bottleneck for drug discovery from phenotypic screening. Genetic screening for genes that affect drug sensitivity or phenotypes of mammalian cultured cells is a powerful tool to obtain clues to their modes of action. Chemical genomic screening systems for comprehensively identifying such genes or genetic pathways have been established using shRNA libraries for RNA interference-mediated mRNA knockdown or sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout. The combination of chemical genomic screening in mammalian cells with other approaches such as biochemical searches for target molecules, phenotypic profiling, and yeast genetics provides a systematic way to elucidate the mode of action by converging various pieces of information regarding target molecules, target pathways, and synthetic lethal pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Application of Biocatalysis in the Preparation and Resolution of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adducts and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction is an important carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reaction in organic synthesis. A new stereogenic centre is created in this reaction and much effort has been invested over the years into finding methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman products. In this review, the contribution of biocatalysis towards achieving this goal is discussed.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction affords highly functionalised allylic alcohols containing a new stereogenic centre. These MBH adducts are very versatile and have been transformed into a large range of products, some of which have medicinal potential. Several examples of asymmetric syntheses of MBH adducts have been reported, although a generally applicable method remains to be developed. Biocatalytic approaches for the synthesis and enzymatic kinetic resolution of MBH adducts have been reported, and are discussed in detail in this review. Enzymes able to catalyse the asymmetric MBH reaction have been identified, but selectivity and efficiency have generally been low. Lipases, esterases and nitrile&#8208;converting enzymes have all been successfully applied in the resolution of MBH adducts, with excellent selectivity being realised in most cases.

         <title>The Conversion of Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by Nitrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogenases reduce inert dinitrogen to bioavailable ammonia and thus &#8216;feed&#8217; the Earth's biosphere. To catalyze this challenging reaction, nitrogenases are equipped with a complex reduction machinery that also permits the remarkable conversion of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In particular, the formation of methane and hydrocarbons opens up the prospect of future biotechnological processes for carbon capture and utilization by nitrogenases.







Abstract
Nitrogenases are the only known family of enzymes that catalyze the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3). The N2 reduction drives biological nitrogen fixation and the global nitrogen cycle. Besides the conversion of N2, nitrogenases catalyze a whole range of other reductions, including the reduction of the small gaseous substrates carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to hydrocarbons. However, it remains an open question whether these &#8216;side reactivities&#8217; play a role under environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these reactivities and particularly the formation of hydrocarbons have spurred the interest in nitrogenases for biotechnological applications. There are three different isozymes of nitrogenase: the molybdenum and the alternative vanadium and iron&#8208;only nitrogenase. The isozymes differ in their metal content, structure, and substrate&#8208;dependent activity, despite their homology. This minireview focuses on the conversion of CO and CO2 to methane and higher hydrocarbons and aims to specify the differences in activity between the three nitrogenase isozymes.
