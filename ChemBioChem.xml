         <title>Staphylococcal SplA and SplB Serine Protease Allelic Variants Exhibit Different Substrate Specificities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biochemical characterization of Staphylococcus aureus serine proteases SplA and SplB allelic variants (recombinantly produced in E. coli and purified) reveals that allelic variation adds an extra layer of complexity to the functioning of virulence factors in S. aureus colonization and infection. This highlights the importance of considering allelic variation in the study of host&#8208;pathogen interactions.

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that is persistently colonizing nearly 30% of the human population and can cause life&#8208;threatening infections. S. aureus secretes a variety of virulence factors, such as a set of extracellular serine protease&#8208;like proteins (Spls). Spls are expressed by most clinical isolates of S. aureus, but their pathophysiological substrates and role during infection are largely unknown. Pathogens use allelic variation of virulence factors to allow an adaption to different host cells and their defense mechanisms. The differences of these variants are marginally characterized so far. Here, we performed a biochemical characterization of selected allelic variants of the S. aureus SplA and SplB. Our data suggests different variants show differences in their stability, enzymatic activity, and substrate specificity. For the recently identified Spl target proteins RickULP and SseL, different cleavage patterns were observed, upon treatment with different Spl allelic variants. One SplB variant strongly differed in its substrate recognition at the P3/P4 position, more closely resembling SplE than SplB wildtype in its substrate selectivity. Our data provide valuable insights into the evolution of bacterial virulence factors and highlight the importance of including allelic variation of virulence factors to fully understand their role in host&#8211;pathogen interaction.

         <title>Modulation of Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase Transition in Coacervates for Neurodegenerative Disease Treatments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the factors influencing the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition of coacervates, including physical stimuli, molecular modulators, and sequence changes.

Coacervates formed through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation represent a fundamental model for protocell and serve as a membraneless organelle in living cells, modulating various biological processes. During aging or under stress, protein misfolding and oligomerization trigger aberrant liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition (LSPT), a process driven by multivalent interactions. These phase transitions disrupt cellular equilibrium, leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The regulatory strategies is summarize to enhance molecular interactions in coacervate LSPT into three categories, including physical stimulation, molecular modulation, and sequence regulation. This review aims to establish a conceptual framework for modulating coacervate LSPT and further explores potential clinical treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Stereocontrol of Styrene Monooxygenases: Mechanistic Principles of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;Selective Epoxidations and Their Implications for Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene monooxygenases with different enantioselectivities allow olefins to adopt distinct binding orientations within the catalytic cavity, leading the O&#8208;atom of C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin (FADOOH) to attack either the Re&#8208;face or the Si&#8208;face of the substrate. This difference in attack direction ultimately determines the resulting enantioselectivity.

Numerous styrene monooxygenases (SMOs) have been identified and extensively applied in the asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes to prepare enantiopure epoxides, which are important intermediates in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine chemicals. A current challenge is development of engineered SMOs capable of catalyzing a broad range of substrates with complementary enantioselectivity, thereby enabling the production of both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;epoxides. Achieving this requires a deep understanding of the molecular basis underlying enantiocontrolling in SMO&#8208;catalyzed epoxidation. In this concept article, recent progress in elucidating the mechanisms of enantiocontrol by SMOs is summarized, with particular emphasis on the structural and mechanistic features that differentiate (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;selective SMOs. These insights not only expand fundamental knowledge of SMO catalysis but also provide a critical foundation for the rational design and protein engineering of highly efficient and versatile SMOs.

         <title>A Stable Bioisostere of Ester&#8208;Linked Ubiquitin Chains Enables Decoding of Protein Interactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ester&#8208;to&#8208;amide analog of an ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin dimer is chemically synthesized through a convergent approach involving the sequential chemoselective ligation of three peptide fragments generated through Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The hydrolysis&#8208;resistant ubiquitin dimer served as a chemical probe in the identification of potential reader of the ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin chain.

Protein ubiquitination is a pivotal posttranslational modification that regulates diverse biological processes depending on the type of ubiquitin chain linkage. Recently, ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains have been identified, yet their inherent hydrolytic instability has posed a significant challenge for biochemical investigations. In this study, a stable and isosteric amide analog of an ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin dimer, is chemically synthesized in which serine (Ser) at position 20 of the proximal ubiquitin is replaced with 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (Dap). The desired amide analog is synthesized using a convergent approach involving the sequential chemoselective ligation of three peptide fragments generated through Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Employing this chemically robust ubiquitin probe, a previously unrecognized interaction is uncovered between Ser20&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains and spliceosome&#8208;associated factors, notably ubiquitin&#8208;specific protease 39. These findings highlight the potential of the ester&#8208;to&#8208;amide bioisosteric strategy to unlock mechanistic insights into atypical ubiquitin modifications. The approach not only circumvents the intrinsic instability of ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains but also provides a broadly applicable framework for dissecting their biological roles, paving the way for future discoveries in ubiquitin signaling.

         <title>Synthesis of Lipid&#8208;Conjugated Heparan Sulfate Mimetics and Their Effect on Complement Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipid constructs containing sulfated maltose in monomeric or clustered (dimeric or trimeric) form are synthesized as complement inhibitors. The conjugation of maltose clusters with spacer&#8208;armed lipid is carried out with the use of CuAAC click reaction.

Heavily sulfated clusters of maltose are designed as mimetics of heparan sulfate (HS), exhibiting diverse biological activity properties of HS. Herein, the synthesis of three function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipid (FSL) constructs containing mono, di, and tri sulfated maltoses is reported. FSLs are a class of synthetic glycolipids, the key features of which are simplicity of synthesis and capacity to integrate into cell membranes with sustained retention. A copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reaction is employed for the conjugation of the sulfated maltose entities with the respective spacer&#8208;lipid block because acylation with activated esters failed to provide the desired products. One FSL construct, featuring a single sulfated maltose unit conjugated to the lipid, demonstrated dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of complement activation in a cellular system, with maximal efficacy observed at 15 &#181;g mL&#8722;1. These findings highlight the potential of FSL&#8208;based HS mimetics for modulating immune responses.

Hiring is one of the most crucial decisions made in a lab group. Herein, straightforward, practical, actionable advice is provided for a more equitable and inclusive approach to hiring. These tips should be impactful for new labs looking to establish their hiring processes, as well as for established labs who want to improve their processes.

Hiring decisions are some of the most important choices PIs make for their research groups. Whether it is undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, or other research assistants, trainees are pivotal for the success of a research group. Choosing an effective team can lead to synergy amongst researchers, high creativity, and groundbreaking science. Choosing an ineffective team can lead to infighting, toxicity, low morale, and scientific stagnation. These same hiring decisions are critical in creating an equitable and inclusive lab environment. Importantly, the challenges for creating productive and inclusive lab groups align: both can be achieved by 1) advertising broadly to ensure a high number of qualified potential researchers apply and 2) removing unconscious selection bias in the hiring process such that these highly qualified researchers are hired. Intentionally and deliberately incorporating these steps into the recruiting and selection processes aids in the recruitment of a more effective and inclusive research team. Herein, practical advice for recruiting for academic research labs are described. We focus on three areas: advertising your research positions, assessing candidates for research positions, and assessing your hiring practices. In each, we give guiding principles and practical tips for designing an equitable and inclusive hiring process .

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mercury (Hg) is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, where neuronal death is related to amyloid brain plaques containing aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides. We show that equimolar Hg(I) or Hg(II) ions inhibit normal A&#946; aggregation. Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8211;40) with an apparent binding affinity 28&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8&#8201;&#956;M. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of Hg.

Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. Mechanisms linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remain to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides. Here, we use transmission electron microscopy and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8211;40) and A&#946;(4&#8211;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8211;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effects on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) are compared. Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8211;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8&#8201;&#956;M, at 20&#8201;&#176;C in 20&#8201;mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13, and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8211;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards forming large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.

         <title>Chemical Surface Modification Tolerance of Primary and Immortalized Macrophages and Stem Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary and immortalized stem cells and macrophages are chemically modified via reactions with N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide&#8208;esters and hydrazides to display small molecule fluorophores or avidin proteins. Evaluation of the conjugation extents, uniformity, and persistence, and effects on cell morphology, viability, and chemotaxis is presented.

Cells are being utilized across various applications, including as self&#8208;regenerating materials, imaging and/or therapeutic entities, and delivery vehicles, and have the potential to do more. In biological and medical applications, specific cell types, including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have often been used on account of their recruitment to disease sites and desirable biodistribution properties. Typically, delivery applications involve the internalization of substrates within the cell, however, this approach presents drawbacks and is not amenable to some uses. Alternatively, chemically modifying cell surfaces using the toolbox of biocompatible chemistries has been broadly applied, but with few direct comparisons, including regarding assessment(s) of effects on the cells. In this work, we sought to compare commonly utilized N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester and hydrazide&#8208;based conjugations to immortalized and primary macrophages and MSCs. We incorporated both small molecules and avidin proteins using each approach, finding that cargo size plays a substantial role in modifications. Overall, conjugations were well&#8208;tolerated by primary and immortalized macrophages and MSCs; we observed no major impacts on viability and chemotactic response, but found some slight changes and trends depending on cell and modification type. This foundational work directly comparing the results and effects of multiple conjugation strategies across different cell types will benefit their use across a variety of applications.

         <title>Developing FGF2 Mutants with Selectively Reduced Heparan Sulfate Affinity to Explore their Impact on FGFR1 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism by which the coreceptor heparan sulfate (HS) contributes to Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling remains unclear. In this study, FGF2 mutants with selectively reduced HS affinity were rationally designed through in silico analysis. Analyses of designed mutants provided important insights, suggesting that the contribution of FGF2/HS interaction to FGF2/FGFR signaling may be limited.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)regulates signal transduction by forming complexes with its receptors, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and heparan sulfate (HS), playing a crucial role in biological systems. Although HS has been suggested to modulate FGF/FGFR signaling as a coreceptor, multiple hypotheses exist regarding how HS affects FGF/FGFR signaling and the mechanism remains unclear. Herein, to highlight the role of FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling, FGF2 mutants with reduced HS&#8208;binding affinity are rationally designed through in silico analysis. These FGF2 mutants exhibit reduced HS affinity by more than two orders of magnitude while maintaining binding affinity to FGFR1. In addition, these mutants retain their thermal stability. Cellular assays using the FGF2 mutant suggest that, contrary to previous reports, the contribution of the FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling may be limited. The mutant FGFs that specifically alter the interaction with HS, achieved in this study, would contribute to an understanding of the role of FGF/HS interaction in FGF/FGFR signaling.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the C&#63743;C Desaturation Catalyzed by an Fe(II) and &#945;KG&#8208;Dependent Oxygenase AndA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations, the mechanism of the C&#63743;C desaturation in anditomin biosynthesis is elucidated, catalyzed by the nonheme iron enzyme AndA. The results unveil a CO2&#8208;mediated dual hydrogen atom transfer pathway, where CO2 insertion suppresses hydroxyl rebound and generates a reactive Fe(III)&#8208;bicarbonate species to drive selective desaturation.

&lt;p&gt;Using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations, the mechanism of the C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C desaturation in anditomin biosynthesis is elucidated, catalyzed by the nonheme iron enzyme AndA. The results unveil a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated dual hydrogen atom transfer pathway, where CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion suppresses hydroxyl rebound and generates a reactive Fe(III)-bicarbonate species to drive selective desaturation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phenyl Urea as an Aglet for Stabilizing Trans Proline: A Mimic of Ile&#8211;Phe Zipper</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phenyl urea unit is proposed as an aglet to favor the trans&#8208;Pro peptide bond, stabilized by an n&#8594;&#960;* interaction. The phenyl urea&#8208;tagged Pro&#8211;Ile peptide, crystallized from nonaqueous solvent, reveals hydrophobic clustering of Ile and phenyl rings in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies, resembling the zipper structure as in coiled&#8208;coil peptides.

         <title>Immobilized Enzymes for ABO&#8208;Independent Blood Cell Transfusions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is developed to generate universal red blood cells and platelets using suitable glycosidases immobilized to polymethacrylate microparticles. This approach allows the efficient removal of the enzymes converting the A and B antigens before transfusion to avoid immune reactions and illustrates a promising method to counteract the demand for blood products.

The transfusion of blood products requires ABO compatibility due to A and B antigens on blood cells and their corresponding antibodies in plasma. The supply of red cell concentrates (RCCs) and platelet concentrates (PCs) is challenged by rising demand and declining numbers of donors. To counteract the supply limitations, a method is developed to generate universal RCCs and PCs. For this, the A antigen is enzymatically removed by two enzymes from Flavonifractor plautii working in concert and the B antigen is removed by galactosidases from Pedobacter panaciterrae (PpaGal_WT or the variant PpaGal_W260Y) and Akkermansia muciniphila (AmGH110A or AmGH110B). The glycosidases are immobilized on polymethacrylate microparticles and are removed by the 200&#8201;&#181;m filter of the mandatory transfusion set before the transfusion to avoid a possible immune reaction by the enzymes. B&#8208;positive red cells in RCCs are reduced below a 4% background signal within 48&#8201;h at 2&#8211;6&#8201;&#176;C. Pooled PCs showed a 34&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14% reduction in B&#8208;positive cells and a residual A&#8208;positive platelet population of 4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1% after 4&#8201;h of treatment at 20&#8211;24&#8201;&#176;C. This approach efficiently generates ABO&#8208;universal RCCs and PCs while preserving blood quality and reducing incompatibility risks.

         <title>Enzymatic Oxidation of Carbohydrate Byproducts for Use in Formation of Chitosan Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbohydrates, i.e., xylooligosaccharides derived from corn cobs and lactose derived from dairy byproducts, were selectively oxidized using fungal oxidoreductases AbPDH1 (pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus bisporus) and FgrGalOx (galactose oxidase from Fusarium graminearum). The resulting oxidized carbohydrates then crosslink chitosan, a crustacean shell biopolymer, to produce bio&#8208;based hydrogels for agricultural or biomedical applications.

Chitosan hydrogels are used in diverse applications ranging from pharmaceuticals and biomedical materials to food and agriculture. This study introduces a biology&#8208;inspired approach to create fully bio&#8208;based hydrogels by combining chitosan with bio&#8208;based di/polycarbonyl crosslinkers produced through the enzymatic oxidation of carbohydrates. Two such crosslinkers, Ox&#8208;XOS and Ox&#8208;Lac, were synthesized by oxidizing carbohydrates: Ox&#8208;XOS was produced by oxidizing xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus bisporus (AbPDH1), and Ox&#8208;Lac was produced by oxidizing lactose (Lac) with galactose oxidase from Fusarium graminearum (FgrGalOx). The efficacy of enzymatic oxidation of lactose and XOS was analyzed using liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, showing high degrees of oxidation, and carbonyl groups were confirmed using ATR&#8208;FTIR and 1H NMR. Compared with unmodified XOS, Ox&#8208;XOS showed a lower reaction temperature towards hexamethylenediamine by differential scanning calorimetry and demonstrated stronger gel formation ability with polyallylamine and chitosan. Rheological measurements showed O(10)$O(10)$&#8211;O(103)$O(10^{3})$ increases in the storage moduli (G&#8242;$G&amp;#x00026;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;prime;$) of chitosan hydrogels formed with Ox&#8208;Lac and Ox&#8208;XOS compared with unmodified lactose and XOS, indicating considerable increases in the hydrogels&#8217; resistance to deformation. These findings demonstrate the potential of enzymatically oxidized carbohydrates as crosslinkers to enhance chitosan hydrogels with potential utility in both high&#8208;value and large&#8208;volume sectors.

         <title>Dynamic Anchoring of Peptides to the Extracellular Matrix Enabled by Boronic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides are developed for reversible binding to sugar&#8208;rich structures (glycans) in cell&#8208;derived extracellular matrix models using boronic acid chemistry. By attaching a carboxy&#8208;phenyl&#8208;boronic acid group to the N&#8208;terminus of peptides, a modified myostatin inhibitor is synthesized that retaines biological activity comparable to standard inhibitors. This modification may improve how these peptides interact with tissues, offering potential benefits for drug delivery in future pharmacological studies.

Given the extracellular matrix (ECM) essential role in tissue development, maintenance, and repair, exploiting its glycan structures offers new opportunities for dynamic drug storage and targeted delivery of peptides via injectable solutions. This study investigates the reversible, pH&#8211;driven interaction between boronic acid&#8208;functionalized compounds and diol&#8208;rich glycans within cell&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrices (CDMs). An N&#8208;terminally functionalized model peptide was produced using carboxy&#8208;phenyl&#8208;boronic acid (CPBA), and its pH&#8208;dependent binding to the diol&#8208;rich structures of CDMs was demonstrated. A CPBA&#8208;conjugated myostatin inhibitor maintained its full potency as a prerequisite for future therapeutic application. The findings suggest N&#8208;terminally boronic acid&#8208;modified peptides as drug candidates for targeted delivery and storage to diol&#8208;rich glycans of the natural ECM.

By attaching a carboxy-phenyl-boronic acid group to the N-terminus of peptides, a modified myostatin inhibitor is synthesized that retaines biological activity comparable to standard inhibitors. This modification may improve how these peptides interact with tissues, offering potential benefits for drug delivery in future pharmacological studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the extracellular matrix (ECM) essential role in tissue development, maintenance, and repair, exploiting its glycan structures offers new opportunities for dynamic drug storage and targeted delivery of peptides via injectable solutions. This study investigates the reversible, pH&#8211;driven interaction between boronic acid-functionalized compounds and diol-rich glycans within cell-derived decellularized extracellular matrices (CDMs). An N-terminally functionalized model peptide was produced using carboxy-phenyl-boronic acid (CPBA), and its pH-dependent binding to the diol-rich structures of CDMs was demonstrated. A CPBA-conjugated myostatin inhibitor maintained its full potency as a prerequisite for future therapeutic application. The findings suggest N-terminally boronic acid-modified peptides as drug candidates for targeted delivery and storage to diol-rich glycans of the natural ECM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Electrochemical Aptasensors Utilizing AuNW/AuNC/PAA Nanocomposite for Label&#8208;Free Detection of IL&#8208;6 in Human and Mammalian Culture Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reports the development of a novel label&#8208;free electrochemical aptasensor based on a gold nanowire/gold nanocolloid/polyacrylamide (AuNW/AuNC/PAA) nanocomposite platform, enabling sensitive and specific detection of the pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6). The aptasensor demonstrates a wide detection range (0.1&#8211;1000&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1), high reproducibility, excellent selectivity, and strong performance in both spiked human serum and mammalian cell culture.

A versatile and highly sensitive sensing platform has been developed by incorporating a nanocomposite of gold nanowire (AuNW), gold nanocolloid (AuNC), and polyacrylamide (PAA) onto the surface of a screen&#8208;printed carbon electrode (SPCE). This innovative approach is designed for the efficient detection of interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6) in human serum and mammalian cell culture. The synthesized gold nanocomposite enhanced the SPCE's electrochemical signal via high conductivity, increased the electroactive surface for efficient electron transfer, and enabled thiolated aptamer immobilization through Au&#63743;S bonds. In this regard, the AuNW/AuNC/PAA nanocomposite and thiolated IL&#8208;6 aptamers were used to construct an IL&#8208;6 aptasensor for sensitive and selective detection of IL&#8208;6 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in 5&#8201;mM [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; as a redox probe. The fabricated aptasensor demonstrated sensitive detection of IL&#8208;6, with a detection range of 0.1&#8211;1000&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1. Moreover, the developed IL&#8208;6 aptasensor exhibited excellent stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. Its applicability was validated by IL&#8208;6 detection in human serum, showing 93.9%&#8211;104.8% recovery. Additionally, IL&#8208;6 levels in cell culture media were tested using both the aptasensor and a commercial ELISA kit, showing only a 1.38% difference, further confirming its reliability.

         <title>Isolable Cysteine Sulfenyl Iodide: Stabilization by a Molecular Cradle, Crystal Structure, and Biologically Relevant Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isolable cysteine sulfenyl iodide (Cys&#8211;SI) stabilized by a molecular cradle is reported. X&#8208;ray analysis and reactivity studies reveal hydrolysis to sulfenic acid, electrophilic substitution with indoles, and high reactivity toward amines and dimedone, providing direct evidence for long&#8208;standing proposals on iodine&#8208;mediated protein modification.

Cysteine sulfenyl iodides (Cys&#8211;SIs) have long been recognized as important intermediates in the oxidative modification of cysteine thiols since 1950s, implicated in pathways such as hydrolysis to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys&#8211;SOH) and electrophilic aromatic substitution with an indole ring of tryptophan to form Cys&#8211;Trp thioether linkages. Despite their proposed significance in both biological and chemical contexts, direct examination of Cys&#8211;SIs has been precluded by their intrinsic instability. Herein, the first isolation of a small&#8208;molecule Cys&#8211;SI, stabilized using a nanosized molecular cradle at the N&#8208;terminus of cysteine, is reported. The structure of the isolable Cys&#8211;SI is determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and its reactivity is investigated with a range of nucleophiles. Hydrolysis to Cys&#8211;SOH and reaction with an indole derivative provide direct chemical evidence for long&#8208;standing mechanistic proposals. Furthermore, rapid formation of sulfenamides with amines and high&#8208;yield adduct formation with dimedone, a canonical sulfenic&#8208;acid probe, reveal that Cys&#8211;SI possesses even greater electrophilicity than Cys&#8211;SOH. These results deliver a structurally defined reference for Cys&#8211;SI and inform mechanisms of iodine&#8208;mediated protein oxidation and peptide modification.

         <title>Polyvalent Thioesters as Multifunctional Chemical Anchors: Toward Synthesis of Homo/Hetero Peptide or Miniprotein Multimers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of multimeric peptides/miniproteins using polyvalent thioesters as chemical core units, beginning with polyvalent NHS&#8208;esters and employing native chemical ligation (NCL). Moreover, homo/hetero branching multimers were also synthesized by combining reverse thioether ligation with NCL. This modular approach should give access to peptide dendrimers with unique biological implications.

In this work, we develop a platform for multimerizing peptides/miniproteins using various polyvalent thioester cores derived from easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters. We employed native chemical ligation to attach multiple copies of peptide/miniprotein around a fixed multi&#8208;armed thioester core in a one&#8208;pot fashion, leading to the first&#8208;generation multimers. Further, using a reverse thioether ligation strategy, we synthesized second&#8208;generation branched homo/hetero multimers. The reactions proceed under an aqueous environment that closely mimics physiological conditions, forming multimeric products with yields ranging from 30% to 90%. The general utility of this strategy is showcased by the synthesis of multimeric linear and bicyclic peptides, bicyclic peptide&#8208;cell penetrating peptide conjugates, and multimeric miniproteins which show picomolar affinity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain. We believe that this modular approach of generating multimeric molecules should find broad applicability in peptide chemistry and chemical biology.

         <title>An Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Mechanism&#8208;Based Reactive Probe for Ratiometric Fluorescence Detection of Epinephrine in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epinephrine (EPI) or adrenaline is involved in various physiological processes of the sympathetic nervous system and may be linked to the progression of different serious diseases. An excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer mechanism&#8208;based reactive probe has been successfully developed for the selective ratiometric fluorescent detection of EPI in live cells.

Epinephrine (EPI), also known as adrenaline, is involved in various physiological processes of the sympathetic nervous system and may be linked to the progression of different serious diseases, including cancers, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases etc. There is an urgency in developing a fluorescence probe for the detection of EPI. An excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer mechanism (ESIPT)&#8208;based reactive probe HBT&#8208;EPI has been successfully developed for ratiometric fluorescent detection of EPI in physiological conditions. EPI undergoes a cascade of nucleophilic attack at the carbonothioate site of the probe using the secondary amine and &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl group to release the ESIPT&#8208;active 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) fluorophore. Thus, a ratiometric fluorescence response is obtained. The probe is highly selective for EPI detection compared to other catecholamine&#8208;based neurotransmitters. A minimum of 1&#8201;&#181;M of EPI can be easily detected using this probe. HBT&#8208;EPI has been successfully demonstrated for ratiometric fluorescence detection of EPI in live cells via confocal imaging.

         <title>Peptide Arginases from Cryptic Pathways Install Ornithine Residues in Uncharacterized Members of Orphan RiPP Families</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid ornithine into antibiotic peptides has shown potential in influencing antibacterial efficacy. Novel peptide arginases from cryptic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) pathways are identified and found to&#160; incorporate ornithine residues into various peptide sequences, complementing the existing peptide arginases and offering new opportunities for drug discovery.

Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are remarkable natural products with interesting chemical structures and potent bioactivities. RiPP pathways are abundant in all domains of life and harbor a large biosynthetic potential in the form of post&#8208;translationally acting enzymes. A relatively small number of RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters encode peptide arginases, a recently discovered maturase family capable of hydrolyzing arginine residues of RiPP core peptides to ornithines. In this study, members of the peptide arginase family (FlmR and OhkR), which are associated with uncharacterized precursors from orphan RiPP families, are identified. In&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro activity of FlmR and OhkR with the five associated precursor peptides (FlmA1&#8208;3 and OhkA1&#8208;2) is demonstrated and kinetic studies to biochemically characterize the enzymes are performed. Furthermore, in&#8201;silico structural analysis with AlphaFold 3 is used to predict precursor&#8211;arginase complexes, providing insights into how peptide arginases could bind their precursor substrates. In the case of OhkA&#8211;OhkR complexes, this analysis also allows a hypothesis as to which of the arginine residues of the core peptide is modified first, which is confirmed experimentally. This detailed biochemical and structural enzyme characterization is a prerequisite for the application of peptide arginases in peptide&#8208;based drug discovery platforms.

         <title>Introducing Quantitative Assessment of Michaelis Constant (Km) Accuracy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Michaelis constant (Km) is often reported with misleading confidence when only standard errors are considered. The accuracy confidence interval (ACI) framework is adapted to Km by recasting velocity&#8211;substrate data as a binding isotherm, propagating systematic uncertainties in enzyme and substrate concentrations. A free web tool (https://aci.sci.yorku.ca) implements ACI&#8208;Km for more reliable Km determination.

The Michaelis constant (Km) is central to enzyme kinetics, guiding variant selection, inhibitor screening, and metabolic modeling. However, Km obtained by nonlinear regression can be substantially inaccurate even when the reported standard error (SE) appears small. Common software reports SE but provides no accuracy metric. This gap is addressed by extending the accuracy confidence interval (ACI) framework to Km (ACI&#8208;Km) through a binding&#8208;isotherm formulation of the velocity&#8211;substrate fit. Given confidence intervals for concentration accuracy, the method quantifies how residual systematic uncertainties in enzyme and substrate concentrations ( E0 and S0) propagate into the determined Km values and provides a probabilistic interval expected to enclose the accurate value. The approach requires no additional kinetic experiments and is directly applicable to existing datasets. Concentration&#8208;accuracy intervals can be estimated from calibration data, reagent specifications, or quality&#8208;control records. ACI&#8208;Km is valid across a wide range of E0/Km conditions, including relatively high E0. A free web application (https://aci.sci.yorku.ca) implements ACI&#8208;Km. Tests on synthetic and experimental datasets show that Km &#177; SE can severely underestimate uncertainty, whereas ACI provides more reliable accuracy bounds for decision&#8208;making, complementing rather than replacing traditional precision metrics by providing quantitative diagnostic bounds for concentration&#8208;related uncertainties in Km determination.

         <title>Spontaneous Fusion of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Droplets: Effect of Coexisting Phospholipids on Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding phospholipid lecithin above the critical micelle concentration to ATPS droplets is reported to significantly slow down the processes of fusion, approaching migration, and merging. These findings highlight a simple yet effective strategy for stabilizing ATPS droplets, providing new insights into how lipid adsorption enhances droplet stability.

The stability of aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS) droplets is a key requirement for extending their utility beyond conventional applications, particularly as minimal models of biological cells and reaction compartments. However, the mechanisms by which their dynamic process in droplet size growth remain poorly understood. In this study, lecithin is demonstrated to effectively stabilize ATPS droplets by modulating two fundamental processes that determine their size evolution: 1) approaching migration driven by thermal motion and inter&#8208;droplet attraction and 2) the coalescence initiation time, defined as the delay between first contact and the onset of merging. Using dextran&#8208;rich droplets dispersed in a polyethylene glycol phase, significant suppression of both processes is shown that occurs only when lecithin concentrations exceed its critical micelle concentration. The findings indicate that lecithin coats droplet surfaces spontaneously to form a membrane&#8208;like layer, thereby reducing inter&#8208;droplet attraction and strongly inhibiting coalescence. This stabilization strategy offers a simple yet powerful means to control droplet dynamics, thereby opening up new possibilities for engineering ATPS droplets as versatile platforms for biochemical reactions and synthetic cell research.

         <title>Integrative In&#8201;Silico and In&#8201;Vitro Screening of Low Molecular Weight Compounds Targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Elements</title>

         <dc:description>
A combined virtual and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208;based screening approach identifies small molecules that bind conserved SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA structures. Diverse compound libraries are screened using full&#8208;atom refinement 2&#8208;generated ensembles of stem&#8208;loop 1 and the frameshift pseudoknot. Predicted hits are validated by ligand&#8208; and target&#8208;detected NMR, and preliminary structure&#8208;activity insights highlight determinants of binding. This strategy provides an efficient, broadly applicable method for discovering RNA&#8208;targeted antiviral candidates.

An approach combining virtual and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208;based screening is presented here to identify low molecular weight molecules (small molecules) targeting viral RNA elements from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. The so&#8208;called high&#8208;resolution RNA structural Fragment Assembly of RNA with Full&#8208;Atom Refinement 2 (FARFAR2) ensembles of the conserved 5&#8242;&#8208;terminal stem&#8208;loop 1 (SL1) and the pseudoknot of the &#8211;1 programed frameshift element are used as targets for binding of small molecules of three different virtual libraries of compounds. The resulting hits predicted by virtual screening are probed for their binding to the two RNA elements by ligand&#8208; and target&#8208;based NMR experiments. The results demonstrate that the integration of virtual and experimental NMR screening efficiently identifies RNA&#8208;binding small molecules as start molecular entities to advance RNA&#8208;targeted antiviral therapies in an efficient manner. The strategy does not only apply to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but also provides a rapid, highly specific route to discovering therapeutics for other RNA&#8208;based pathogens, highlighting the critical role of RNA structural data in enriching virtual drug discovery efforts.

Competitive elution of bound phages with a boronate inhibitor enriches dibasic peptide sequences that resemble the substrate recognition motif, yielding a micromolar bicyclic inhibitor with high proteolytic stability.

No specific vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infections. The viral protease NS2B&#8208;NS3 is essential for the replication of Zika and other orthoflaviviruses, making it a target for antiviral drug development. Traditional discovery of competitive inhibitors has relied on substrate recognition sequences, typically yielding multibasic peptides. Herein, a de novo strategy is presented for identifying competitive inhibitors using peptide phage display in combination with Bi(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8201;situ formation of bicyclic peptides. In an initial screening, phages displaying a library of randomized peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles are eluted by interrupting the phage&#8208;target interactions at low pH. This approach yields a small number of peptides biased toward the active site, characterized by dibasic motifs, but only one low&#8208;ranking sequence shows modest inhibitory activity. To enhance specificity, a second screening campaign employs competitive phage elution using the dibasic boronate inhibitor CN&#8208;714 that covalently binds to the catalytically active serine residue S135 of NS2B&#8208;NS3. This strategy enriches a larger pool of competitive inhibitors sharing the characteristic dibasic substrate recognition motif. The most potent peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycle identified and synthesized features a completely novel sequence, exhibits an inhibition constant of 3.9&#8201;&#181;M and displays remarkable proteolytic stability over 24&#8201;h.

         <title>Synthesis of the Abiraterone Derivatives 5&#945;&#8208; and 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;Abiraterone and Structural Determination of an Unknown Metabolite in Human Serum Derived from Oral Abiraterone Acetate</title>

Abiraterone (Abi) acetate, a prostate cancer treatment, is orally administered and hydrolyzed, and multiple metabolites are produced in serum by various enzymes. Two novel Abi derivatives, 5&#945;&#8208; and 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone, are synthesized. Then, an unknown metabolite in serum is identified to be 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone based on its extracted ion chromatogram retention time.

Abiraterone (Abi) acetate, an anticancer drug, produces metabolites in the serum of patients with prostate cancer. Three unknown metabolites of Abi are previously discovered and the structures of two of these compounds are determined by comparing their LC&#8208;based retention times with those of synthesized compounds. However, the structure of the third metabolite is not identified. Herein, two new Abi derivatives, 5&#945;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone (5&#945;&#8208;D1A) and 5&#946;&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;abiraterone (5&#946;&#8208;D1A), with a molecular weight of 348, are successfully synthesized as candidates for the third unknown metabolite. 5&#946;&#8208;D1A is confirmed as this third metabolite based on its retention time in the extracted ion chromatogram. The metabolic pathway may have formed 5&#946;&#8208;D1A rather than 5&#945;&#8208;D1A because of the higher activity of steroid 5&#946;&#8208;reductase compared with that of 5&#945;&#8208;reductase. These findings are expected to lead to the discovery of new metabolic pathways.

         <title>Discovery and Tuning of RNA Editing Guides via High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Chemical Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput screening platform (EMERGe) uncovered a noncanonical GUG&#8208;centered loop that supports ADAR2&#8208;mediated RNA editing at otherwise refractory 5&#8242;GA sites. Through systematic structure&#8211;activity studies and motif&#8208;specific chemical optimization, a fully stabilized guide RNA was developed that retains activity in&#8201;vitro and in cells, establishing a pipeline for guide RNA discovery and design.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) catalyze the deamination of adenosine to inosine in double&#8208;stranded RNA. Because inosine is read as guanosine during translation, this process enables programmable A&#8208;to&#8208;G recoding at the transcript level. ADARs can be harnessed for therapeutic correction of pathogenic mutations through site&#8208;directed RNA editing with guide RNAs. To expand the design space of editing&#8208;enabling guides, we applied EMERGe, a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, to identify motifs targeting a premature termination codon in the MeCP2 transcript associated with Rett syndrome. This uncovered a guide RNA motif that supported efficient ADAR2&#8208;mediated editing in&#8201;vitro, featuring a 5&#8242;&#8208;GUG&#8208;3' sequence predicted to form an asymmetric loop. To enable therapeutic application, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies and chemical optimization were performed, yielding a fully modified guide RNA with 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl, 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro, and phosphorothioate linkages. This stabilized guide retained the activity of unmodified RNA and showed enhanced nuclease resistance. The optimized guide induces dose&#8208;dependent editing at two MECP2 loci in reporter assays in HEK293T cells, demonstrating that EMERGe&#8208;selected motifs can be rendered viable in cells through targeted chemical modification. These findings highlight the utility of EMERGe as a discovery platform and establish a pipeline for identifying and optimizing editing&#8208;enabling guide RNA features beyond traditional design rules.

         <title>Development of a Genetically Encoded and Potent PDE6D Inhibitor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PDE6D is a trafficking chaperone of prenylated proteins. Current small molecule PDE6D inhibitors target its hydrophobic pocket, rendering them typically poorly water soluble. Herein, PDE6D binders are generated by combining parts of the K&#8208;Ras4B and INPP5E C&#8208;termini. The genetically encoded high&#8208;affinity PDE6D inhibitor SNAP&#8208;STI is thus generated. Like in natural PDE6D cargo, high affinity is achieved at the entrance of the hydrophobic pocket.

PDE6D is a trafficking chaperone of prenylated proteins, such as small GTPases. Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed against it, given that the oncogene K&#8208;Ras is one of the cargo proteins. Inhibitor development suffers from the fact that inhibitors against the hydrophobic pocket of PDE6D are typically poorly water&#8208;soluble. Herein, the development of genetically encoded inhibitors that are inspired by high&#8208;affinity natural cargo of PDE6D is described. The most potent inhibitor, SNAP&#8208;STI, encodes merely a farnesylated tetra&#8208;peptide, which efficiently blocks PDE6D binding of farnesylated cargo. Direct comparison with small molecule PDE6D inhibitors suggests its higher potency. It is shown that inhibition of K&#8208;Ras membrane anchorage and K&#8208;RasG12C&#8208;dependent MAPK signaling by SNAP&#8208;STI is weak, consistent with what is observed after PDE6D knockdown. The data therefore further support that PDE6D is not a suitable surrogate target for efficient inhibition of K&#8208;Ras membrane anchorage and MAPK&#8208;activity. Nonetheless, by exploiting contacts at the pocket entry, a generalizable strategy to design high&#8208;affinity PDE6D inhibitors is established, providing powerful tools for PDE6D biology and target validation.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Live&#8208;Cell Mapping of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions Using Chemogenetic Split Reporters and Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mapping protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPI) at high spatial resolution is essential for understanding biological processes. An approach is introduced that combines the chemogenetic split fluorescent reporter splitFAST2 with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy for sub&#8208;diffraction imaging of PPI. As the fluorescence of splitFAST2 is activated only where the two proteins interact, this system allows for highly precise and unambiguous localization in live cells, enhanced further by the rapid super&#8208;resolution imaging capabilities of STED.

The ability to map protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPI) within living cells at high spatial resolution is essential for unraveling their roles in cellular biology. Although several super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques are available, visualizing PPI below the diffraction limit of light across entire live cells remains a challenge. An approach is introduced that combines the chemogenetic split fluorescent reporter splitFAST2 with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy for sub&#8208;diffraction imaging of PPI. As the fluorescence of splitFAST2 is activated only where the two proteins interact, this system allows for highly precise and unambiguous localization in live cells, enhanced further by the rapid super&#8208;resolution imaging capabilities of STED. The improved spatial resolution of the approach enabled us to precisely map the subcellular localization of inducible interactions or constitutive interactions. Beyond simply detecting PPIs below the diffraction limit in whole living cells, splitFAST2 also serves as the basis for fluorescent probes with very low background, enabling effective subdiffraction imaging of repetitive cellular structures like filamentous actin and microtubules.

As the fluorescence of splitFAST2 is activated only where the two proteins interact, this system allows for highly precise and unambiguous localization in live cells, enhanced further by the rapid super-resolution imaging capabilities of STED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to map protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPI) within living cells at high spatial resolution is essential for unraveling their roles in cellular biology. Although several super-resolution microscopy techniques are available, visualizing PPI below the diffraction limit of light across entire live cells remains a challenge. An approach is introduced that combines the chemogenetic split fluorescent reporter splitFAST2 with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy for sub-diffraction imaging of PPI. As the fluorescence of splitFAST2 is activated only where the two proteins interact, this system allows for highly precise and unambiguous localization in live cells, enhanced further by the rapid super-resolution imaging capabilities of STED. The improved spatial resolution of the approach enabled us to precisely map the subcellular localization of inducible interactions or constitutive interactions. Beyond simply detecting PPIs below the diffraction limit in whole living cells, splitFAST2 also serves as the basis for fluorescent probes with very low background, enabling effective subdiffraction imaging of repetitive cellular structures like filamentous actin and microtubules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Granzyme A Turn&#8208;ON Fluorescent Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quenched activity&#8208;based probe, featuring the Ile&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asn&#8211;Arg recognition sequence, a phenyl phosphinate ester warhead, and a near&#8208;infrared sulfo&#8208;Cy5/QSY21 fluorophore/quencher pair, generates a fluorescence signal only upon reaction with active granzyme A (GzmA). With its high reactivity, selectivity, and cell permeability, this turn&#8208;ON probe enables a robust detection of GzmA activity in complex proteomes.

Granzyme A (GzmA), a serine protease highly expressed in cytotoxic immune cells, plays complex roles in antitumor immunity and inflammation. While elevated GzmA levels correlate with favorable outcomes in certain cancers, extracellular GzmA has been implicated in promoting tumorigenesis via inflammatory pathways. These contrasting functions highlight the need for selective tools that can detect GzmA activity with high spatiotemporal resolution in native biological contexts. A series of quenched activity&#8208;based probes that fluoresce only upon covalent binding to active GzmA have been developed. The lead probe, featuring the Ile&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asn&#8211;Arg recognition sequence, a phenyl phosphinate ester warhead, and a near&#8208;infrared sulfo&#8208;Cy5/QSY21 fluorophore/quencher pair, exhibits high reactivity, selectivity, and cell permeability. It enables robust detection of GzmA in vitro and in cells, with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. These activatable probes will support downstream activity&#8208;based protein profiling and enable noninvasive imaging of the enzyme activity, offering a powerful means for dissecting the multifaceted biology of GzmA within the tumor immune microenvironment.

DNA&#8208;Based Ultrasensitive Cu(II) Sensor: Troponyl&#8208;Thymidine Oligo (T*4T) Forms Copper&#8208;Mediated Duplex Structure</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report describes the development of a novel DNA&#8208;based Cu(II) sensor utilizing naturally occurring nonbenzenoid aromatic scaffold Tropolone. Biophysical studies confirmed the formation of self&#8208;assembled duplex&#8208;like dimer structure of the synthesized troponyl&#8208;DNA T*4T with Cu(II) ion, which is further utilized to develop a conductometric&#8208;based Cu(II) sensing device.

DNA&#8208;metal complexes provide new dimensions in synthesizing DNA&#8208;based conducting biomaterials such as aptamers, DNAzymes, and their metal base pairing duplex structure. Structural modifications in the native DNA generate metal&#8208;specific binding sites in addition to phosphate backbone and nucleobase sites. One of the natural nonbenzenoid aromatic molecules, Tropolone, exhibits ion&#8208;specific binding with Cu(II) ion. In the repertoire of DNA metal sensors, troponyl&#8208;DNA can be explored for developing DNA&#8208;based Cu&#8208;sensors owing to the excellent Cu2+ binding affinity of Tropolone ligand. This report describes the synthesis of DNA penta&#8208;oligomer containing the repeated sequence of tr&#8208;dTnucleoside (T*) as (5&#8242;&#8208;T*T*T*T*T&#8208;3&#8242;) and its binding affinity with Cu(II) ions. Its Cu(II) mediated duplex&#8208;like dimer structure shows promising electrical conductivity at pico&#8208;molar [Cu2+] in acetonitrile. Hence, troponyl&#8208;DNA can be applied for making Cu(II) ion sensing devices.

         <title>A Tetrasaccharide Containing a Galactofuranosyl Determinant of Mucins from Trypanosoma cruzi Inhibits the Parasite Adhesion on Triatoma infestans Rectum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the tetrasaccharide &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galp&#8208;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]&#8208;D&#8208;GlcNAc bearing the Galf(&#946;1&#8211;4)[Galp(&#946;1&#8211;6)]GlcNAc motif, a structural element of Trypanosoma cruzi core&#8208;2 mucin glycans is reported. The &#945;&#8208;benzyl glycoside inhibits epimastigote parasite adhesion to the vector Triatoma infestans rectal ampoule emphasizing this motif as a key adhesion determinant. It also acts as a sialic acid acceptor in TcTS&#8208;catalyzed assays.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite transmitted to humans via the feces of blood&#8208;sucking triatomine vectors such as Triatoma infestans. It has been shown that galactofuranose&#8208;containing oligosaccharides present in mucins of T. cruzi are involved in parasite adhesion to the T. infestans rectal ampoule, a key step in the differentiation programme from dividing epimastigote to nondividing mammal&#8208;infective metacyclic forms of the parasite. To further characterize this process, the &#945;&#8208;benzyl glycoside of &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galp&#8208;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]&#8208;D&#8208;GlcNAc is synthesized and its alditol derivative is spectroscopically characterized. The tetrasaccharide component of this glycoside is a substructure of the O&#8208;linked pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures found in the T. cruzi epimastigote mucins. The tetrasaccharide glycoside inhibits parasite adhesion to the rectal ampoule of T. infestans, suggesting that some or all of the binding capacity of T. cruzi epimastigotes resides within this O&#8208;glycan tetrasaccharide substructure. Since T. cruzi mucin O&#8208;linked glycans are known to be acceptors for T. cruzi trans&#8208;sialidase, it is investigated whether the tetrasaccharide substructure acts as an acceptor substrate for this activity. The successful transfer of sialic acid to the tetrasaccharide glycoside indicates that further elaboration to the pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures is not essential for sialic acid transfer.

The cover illustrates the first isolable cysteine sulfenyl iodide (Cys&#8208;SI), stabilized by a nanosized molecular cradle installed at the N&#8208;terminus of cysteine. This stabilization enabled direct structural and reactivity studies of the long&#8208;hypothesized intermediate in cysteine thiol oxidation. The Cys&#8208;SI exhibits high electrophilicity toward nucleophiles, including an indole ring, providing chemical evidence supporting mechanistic proposals for iodine mediated protein modification. More details can be found in the Research Article by Kei Goto and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.202500619).

Molecular Sensing Using Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted attention due to several advantages, such as optical properties and easy functionalization. In particular, aggregation of AuNPs induced by target molecules can be monitored via optical or electrochemical methods for molecular sensing. This review aims to highlight molecular sensing strategies focusing on aggregation mechanisms of AuNPs and detection methods, including one using dark&#8208;field microscopy.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as powerful tools in the molecular sensing field for developing highly sensitive and selective molecular detection methods due to their unique properties, such as optical features and ease of surface modification. The core principle of AuNP&#8208;based sensors involves target molecule&#8208;induced aggregation, dispersion, or assembly of AuNPs through specific interactions with target molecules. These interactions cause changes in optical or electrochemical properties, which can be monitored through visible color shifts, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals, electrochemical techniques, and changes in scattering intensity. This review aims to highlight molecular detection strategies focusing on surface modification and aggregation mechanisms of AuNPs. It also introduces representative applications using colorimetric methods, SERS, electrochemical assays, and dark&#8208;field microscopy.

         <title>Strategies for the Generation of Bispecific Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 24, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispecific antibodies can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or epitopes, thereby exhibiting cooperative therapeutic effects in various diseases. This review summarizes the genetic engineering and chemical conjugation strategies that have been developed to facilitate the preparation of bispecific antibodies. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods, as well as the technical challenges that currently remain in the preparation of bispecific antibodies are also discussed.

Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are engineered immunoglobulins that can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or two distinct epitopes on the same antigen. They exhibit cooperative therapeutic effects surpassing those of natural monoclonal antibodies, such as bridging the immune cells and tumor cells to stimulate targeted immune response, or blocking codependent signaling pathways. These advantages make them attractive therapeutic reagents for various diseases such as cancers, immunodeficiency syndromes, and ophthalmic disorders. However, the unique structural characteristics of BsAbs pose various challenges to their preparation. In the past few decades, various types of BsAbs have been designed and prepared through genetic engineering or chemical conjugation strategies, many of which have been approved as drugs or entered clinical trials. This review provides a systematic summary of these strategies and their corresponding principles, and focuses on the application of modern genetic engineering and chemical conjugation methods in the generation of BsAbs.

Computational Analysis Uncovering Contrasts in G&#8208;Quadruplex Propensity and Aptamer Enrichment in SELEX&#8208;Derived Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer selection&#8208;derived RNA libraries targeting a DNA G&#8208;quadruplex are profiled by both sequence abundance and three G&#8208;quadruplex&#160;(G4)&#8208;prediction tools. High G4 scores failed to match enrichment or binding, revealing that current G4 predictors alone cannot reliably prioritize functional aptamers and must be combined with abundance&#8208;based and experimental validation workflows.

G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid structures with biological and therapeutic significance, and they are found in many aptamer sequences. Using c&#8208;kit 1 G4 DNA as a target, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has been carried out using an RNA library, resulting in G4&#8208;rich aptamers. Herein, this article investigates the relationship between predicted G4&#8208;forming potential and aptamer enrichment by analyzing high&#8208;throughput SELEX libraries using three G4 prediction tools: G4NN, G4Hunter, and QGRS Mapper. While the tools demonstrate strong internal consistency and overlap in identifying G4&#8208;prone sequences, their predictions show limited concordance with experimental abundance and enrichment trends across SELEX rounds. Only a small fraction of sequences display both high G4 scores and consistent enrichment. Experimental validation using electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that strong predicted G4&#8208;forming sequences often lack strong binding activity, whereas highly enriched aptamers with strong binding activities may show weaker G4 signatures computationally. These findings suggest that current G4&#8208;prediction tools alone are insufficient for aptamer candidate selection and highlight the need for integrative evaluation strategies that combine structural prediction with empirical performance data.

         <title>Dual COX&#8208;2/5&#8208;LOX Inhibition by Novel Thymol Derivatives: From Molecular Modeling to In Vitro Validation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8201;silico studies on a series of novel thymol derivatives reveal improved binding affinities, enhanced stability, and persistent interactions within the active pockets of COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX enzymes, with respect to thymol and its halogenated derivatives. Cell&#8208;free assays highlight T3 as the most potent COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, while T1 and T3 exhibit similar activity on 5&#8208;LOX.

Dual cyclooxygenase&#8208;2/5&#8208;lipoxygenase (COX&#8208;2/5&#8208;LOX) inhibitors constitute safer alternatives to classical nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs, widely used to effectively manage inflammation. In this article, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations guide the synthesis of novel thymol derivatives that interact with both COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX active sites. Ligands are designed with the aim of improving thymol bioactivity, selectivity, stability, as well as pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, &#8211;Br, &#8211;F, and &#8211;CF3 inclusion on thymol is here evaluated, screening COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX interactions with thymol (T), 4&#8208;fluorothymol (FT), 4&#8208;bromothymol (BT), isopropyl thymyl succinate (T1), 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl thymyl succinate (T2), and 1&#8242;,1&#8242;,1&#8242;,3&#8242;,3&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8217;&#8208;thymyl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxobutanoate (T3). Molecular modeling reveals that the estimated ligands can establish favorable interactions with both COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX active pockets, highlighting T1&#8211;T3 as the most promising compounds. In&#8201;vitro assays identify T3 as the most active COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, while T2 results as the most effective ligand for 5&#8208;LOX. Interestingly, cavity analysis of the COX&#8208;2 entry site reveals that T3 insertion is favored over T1 and T2 due to its greater polarity, conferred by the presence of a free phenolic group (OH) able to establish H&#8208;bonds with surrounding residues.

In&#8201;vitro assays identify &lt;b&gt;T3&lt;/b&gt; as the most active COX-2 inhibitor, while &lt;b&gt;T2&lt;/b&gt; results as the most effective ligand for 5-LOX. Interestingly, cavity analysis of the COX-2 entry site reveals that &lt;b&gt;T3&lt;/b&gt; insertion is favored over &lt;b&gt;T1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;T2&lt;/b&gt; due to its greater polarity, conferred by the presence of a free phenolic group (OH) able to establish H-bonds with surrounding residues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three Recent para&#8208;Nitrobenzyl&#8208;Based Hypoxia Probes: Promising Directions for Sensitivity, Reversibility, or Near&#8208;IR Emission</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progresses on nitroaromatics&#8208;based hypoxia probes address the challenges with respect to sensitivity, reversibility, and in&#8201;vivo capability.

Hypoxia bioimaging attracts tremendous attention due to its profound implications in diagnosis of a range of pathological conditions. Nitroaromatics&#8208;based fluorescent probes are the most popular approach to tackle this problem. Despite intensive efforts of the field over the past 15&#8201;years and the development of a range of such probes, three challenges are still not addressed, i.e., highly sensitive probes necessitating a one&#8208;electron reduction, real&#8208;time monitoring probes with reversible sensing capability, and near&#8208;infrared probes with in&#8201;vivo imaging potentials. Three groups have recently reported notable progresses regarding these challenges, which may spur another wave of development along this line of research and meet the need of real&#8208;world applications from researchers and doctors.

         <title>Engineering Biocompatible Metal&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Advanced Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective treatment of bacterial infections requires metal nanoparticles (MNPs) that eradicate pathogens at the infection site without impairing tissue&#8208;cell proliferation or extracellular matrix remodeling. This review highlights recent engineering strategies that improve the biocompatibility of MNPs while maintaining their antibacterial efficacy.

The rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance has rendered many conventional antibiotics ineffective, complicating the management of bacterial infections and leading to severe community&#8208; and hospital&#8208;acquired diseases. This growing resistance crisis poses a major threat to global public health and the stability of healthcare systems. Metal&#8208;based nanoparticles have recently gained significant attention as alternative antibacterial agents because of their broad&#8208;spectrum activity and low likelihood of inducing bacterial resistance. However, their clinical translation remains limited by nonspecific cytotoxicity and poor biocompatibility, which can adversely affect mammalian cells. To overcome these challenges, recent research has focused on engineering strategies that enhance the biocompatibility of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) without compromising their antibacterial efficacy. This review summarizes the latest advances in the rational design, surface modification, and functionalization of biocompatible metal&#8208;based nanoplatforms for infection treatment. Themechanisms of antibacterial action, approaches to minimize off&#8208;target toxicity, and potential clinical application. Together, these insights highlight the promise of engineered MNPs as next&#8208;generation antibacterial therapeutics capable of addressing the escalating threat of multidrug&#8208;resistant infections.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Inducing Agents via Metabolite Self&#8208;Assembly Expands the Boundary of Prion Concept beyond Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origin of Prion&#8208;like Amyloid Nucleating Nanostructures via Metabolite Self&#8208;assembly.

The prion concept fundamentally signifies the intrinsic cross&#8208;seeding potential of misfolded protein&#8208;generated amyloid entities to efficiently induce amyloid aggregation in normally folded proteins leading to formation of cytotoxic amyloid structures. A conformational crosstalk between the prion particle and the interacting protein appears critical for the molecular origin of seeded&#8208;aggregation. However, the intricacies of protein specificity, as a prerequisite for the onset of cross&#8208;seeding, hold negligible relevance to the pathobiology of amyloid&#8208;linked diseases because the amyloid&#8208;deposits are heteroprotein assemblies, and there is adequate evidence that substantiates the occurrence of sequence&#8208;independent amyloid&#8208;cross&#8208;seeding/co&#8208;aggregation reactions between diverse protein types. Importantly, extensive research on the self&#8208;assembly of single metabolites into cytotoxic amyloid&#8208;like entities containing cross&#8208;seeding competent conformers has certainly widened the boundary of prion concept much beyond the territory of proteins and peptides. Three important observations: 1) sequence&#8208;independent cross&#8208;seeding and co&#8208;aggregation among proteins; 2) efficient amyloid&#8208;cross&#8208;seeding of proteins triggered by self&#8208;assembled metabolite&#8208;nanostructures, and 3) molecular self&#8208;assembly of metabolites induced by pre&#8208;formed protein amyloid&#8208;seeds, propose a synergetic interplay between the amyloidogenic proteins and self&#8208;assembly&#8208;prone metabolites that can act as a key regulator for the overall amyloidogenesis mechanism. This review on the self&#8208;assembly of biologically relevant metabolites into amyloid&#8208;mimicking nanostructures mainly highlights their cytotoxic properties and cross&#8208;seeding potential, particularly focusing on the significance of the metabolite&#8208;aggregation in the etiology of amyloid hypothesis.

         <title>Simultaneous Visualization of Distinct Posttranslational Modification States of &#946;&#8208;Catenin Using Genetic Code Expansion and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to visualize, within the same cell, three distinct posttranslational forms of &#946;&#8208;catenin: wild&#8208;type, phosphomimetic (T41E), and synthetic T41C&#8208;GlcNAc, using genetic code expansion and fluorescence microscopy is developed. This strategy reveals how modifications at T41 alter &#946;&#8208;catenin localization and stability.

A novel strategy based on genetic code expansion combined with click chemistry for the simultaneous visualization of distinct posttranslational modification (PTM) states of a single protein within living cells. As a model, it is focused on threonine 41 (T41) of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a regulatory hotspot implicated in epithelial cancers and known to be phosphorylated, O&#8208;GlcNAcylated, or left unmodified. Using site&#8208;specific incorporation of the unnatural phenylselenocysteine, a &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;EGFP fusion protein is engineered allowing selective installation of a S&#8208;GlcNAc moiety via oxidative elimination and thiol&#8208;Michael ligation. Additional &#946;&#8208;catenin variants, phosphomimetic T41E&#8208;mCherry and wild&#8208;type&#8208;blue fluorescent protein fusions, are produced to represent other PTM states. All constructs are successfully introduced into Hep3B and HeLa cells by lipofection or TAT&#8208;mediated transduction. Fluorescence microscopy revealed distinct subcellular localization profiles for each PTM form. Notably, the S&#8208;GlcNAcylated &#946;&#8208;catenin exhibited enhanced resistance to proteasomal degradation, consistent with known roles of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in protein stability. This approach provides a versatile platform to functionally probe PTMs in a comparative, cell&#8208;based context.

         <title>A Thermostable Class III Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate Synthetase from Pyrolobus fumarii 1A: Characterization and Application Potential for Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class III phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PfPRS) from the hyper thermophilic archaeon Pyrolobus fumarii 1A was identified and characterized. PfPRS exhibited exceptional thermal and pH stability, retaining high activity even at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Its robust catalytic features, along with exploratory co&#8208;immobilization for nucleotide regeneration, highlight its promise for biocatalytic applications.

Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) functions as a central metabolic intermediate, supplying ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate moieties for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, certain amino acids, and a range of essential cofactors. In this study, a thermostable phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PfPRS) was identified from the hyper thermophilic archaeon Pyrolobus fumarii 1A, a hyper thermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 90&#8211;113&#8201;&#176;C. The prs gene was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Peak catalytic activity of PfPRS was observed at approximately pH 7.5 and 55&#8201;&#176;C and retained over 85% of its activity after 2&#8201;h of incubation across pH 4.0&#8211;10.5. PfPRS exhibited high thermal stability. The enzyme exhibited half&#8208;lives of 12&#8201;h at 90&#8201;&#176;C, 5&#8201;h at 95&#8201;&#176;C, and 3&#8201;h at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Among the nucleotides tested as diphosphate donors, PfPRS showed a strong preference for ATP, whereas ADP served as an effective inhibitor. Kinetic analysis revealed Km values of 35&#8201;&#181;M for R5P and 46&#8201;&#181;M for ATP, with turnover rates (kcat) of 71&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 56&#8201;s&#8722;1. PfPRS was co&#8208;immobilized with polyphosphate kinase 2 (DrPPK2) from Deinococcus radiodurans using a cross&#8208;linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) system to enable ATP regeneration and to explore the feasibility of using PfPRS for PRPP biosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) functions as a central metabolic intermediate, supplying ribose-5-phosphate moieties for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, certain amino acids, and a range of essential cofactors. In this study, a thermostable phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (&lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;PRS) was identified from the hyper thermophilic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Pyrolobus fumarii&lt;/i&gt; 1A, a hyper thermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 90&#8211;113&#8201;&#176;C. The &lt;i&gt;prs&lt;/i&gt; gene was heterologously expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Peak catalytic activity of &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;PRS was observed at approximately pH 7.5 and 55&#8201;&#176;C and retained over 85% of its activity after 2&#8201;h of incubation across pH 4.0&#8211;10.5. &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;PRS exhibited high thermal stability. The enzyme exhibited half-lives of 12&#8201;h at 90&#8201;&#176;C, 5&#8201;h at 95&#8201;&#176;C, and 3&#8201;h at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Among the nucleotides tested as diphosphate donors, &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;PRS showed a strong preference for ATP, whereas ADP served as an effective inhibitor. Kinetic analysis revealed &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; values of 35&#8201;&#181;M for R5P and 46&#8201;&#181;M for ATP, with turnover rates (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;) of 71&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 56&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;PRS was co-immobilized with polyphosphate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;PPK2) from &lt;i&gt;Deinococcus radiodurans&lt;/i&gt; using a cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) system to enable ATP regeneration and to explore the feasibility of using &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;PRS for PRPP biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Robust Bioprocess for the Global Incorporation of Noncanonical Amino Acids in Auxotrophic Hosts Produces Labeled Proteins at the Gram Scale</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust bioprocess enables global incorporation of noncanonical amino acids in both shake flask and bioreactor cultures, producing gram&#8208;per&#8208;liter titers of efficiently labeled proteins. A versatile Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) auxotroph platform supports broad compatibility with various noncanonical amino acids and target proteins, facilitating flexible and scalable designer protein production.

This study presents a robust bioprocess for the global incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins, enabling gram&#8208;scale production in auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains. The two&#8208;phase approach adapts from shake flask to bioreactor cultures and relies on cost&#8208;effective synthetic minimal media with glucose as the sole carbon source and yeast extract as an amino acid supply. It supports both external ncAA supplementation and in situ biosynthesis. A versatile E. coli BL21(DE3) auxotroph platform ensures broad ncAA and protein compatibility. Model proteins, such as a thermophilic lipase (TTL) and an oxidoreductase are labeled with biosynthesized norleucine (Nle), synthetic fluoroprolines, and fluorophenylalanine. Under optimal conditions, we achieved titers of up to 2&#8201;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with near&#8208;quantitative incorporation. To demonstrate the utility of the bioprocess for applications that require substantial amounts of proteins, the crystal structure of Nle&#8208;labeled TTL is solved. Future work should optimize media composition and feeding strategies to improve ncAA bioavailability and integrate biosynthesis pathways into the host genome to reduce metabolic burden and eliminate antibiotic use. These advances will make the process a cost&#8208;effective industrial platform for designer protein production.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Phase Enzymatic Cascade for Indigo Synthesis from Anthranilate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This five&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for indigo synthesis is derived from the natural biosynthetic route starting from anthranilate. A two&#8208;phase system addresses enzyme incompatibility, and process engineering through stepwise parameter optimization for each phase results in a titer of 183&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 indigo. This work establishes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enzymatic platform that expands the toolbox for designing bio&#8208;based indigo synthesis.

Herein, an enzymatic in&#8201;vitro synthesis route to indigo, the dye that gives denim its renowned color, is described. The proposed five&#8208;step enzymatic pathway is derived from the natural biosynthesis route starts from anthranilate. In the context of the bio&#8208;based economy, this method provides an alternative to the current method of indigo synthesis, which relies on petroleum&#8208;based building blocks. First, the enzymes are assessed by stepwise addition to detect intermediate compounds, to ensure cascade function. A two&#8208;phase system is designed in response to differences in melting temperatures of the enzymes. A titer of 183&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 indigo is reached through stepwise parameter optimization for each phase, followed by process engineering to enhance the indigo titer. Continuous supplementation of the cosubstrate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate is necessary to maintain indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate (IGP) formation in the first phase. During the second phase, complete uptake of IGP by ZmBX1 remains challenging, and formation of significant byproducts is observed. Despite attempts to resolve these issues, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Although the yield must be significantly improved for an economically viable process, an enzymatic cascade based on bio&#8208;based materials remains a potential alternative for sustainable denim dye synthesis by circumventing host toxicity observed in whole&#8208;cell approaches.

         <title>Advancements in Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals: Innovations in Diagnosis and Therapy for Enhanced Cancer Management</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiopharmaceuticals enable precise cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy by combining radioactive isotopes with carrier molecules. This review summarizes advances from 2014 to 2025, emphasizing probe design, click chemistry, novel targets, and nanodelivery systems. It highlights clinical progress, theranostic innovations, and future challenges in scalability, regulation, and AI&#8208;driven personalized treatment planning in precision oncology

Radiopharmaceuticals (RPhs) represent a breakthrough in nuclear medicine due to their ability to provide precise diagnosis and targeted therapy for cancer by incorporating radioactive isotopes into carrier molecules. This review systematically discusses the recent advances in the development of RPhs, focusing on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art probe design strategies and click chemistry applications that accelerate RPh syntheses and improve targeting efficiency. The manuscript synthesizes literature from multiple databases spanning January 2014 to April 2025, encompassing diagnostic modalities including positron emission tomography (PET) and single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, and therapeutic applications utilizing alpha and beta emitters such as 225Ac and 177Lu. Clinically approved agents, such as 177Lu&#8208;DOTATATE and 177Lu&#8208;PSMA&#8208;617, are used for neuroendocrine tumors and metastatic castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer, respectively, with significant therapeutic efficacy. The review focuses on new targets, such as fibroblast activation protein, CXCR4 chemokine receptors, and gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptors, and new delivery systems using nanotechnology to improve biodistribution and tumor accumulation. Challenges regarding production scalability, regulatory frameworks, and integrating artificial intelligence for personalized dosimetry and treatment planning remain crucial. Combination therapeutic approaches using targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) in synergy with chemotherapy and immunotherapy and external beam radiation are showing promising results in refractory cancers. The potential avenues include theranostics, predictive modeling for patient selection, and new molecular targeting strategies. This review highlights the transformative potential of RPhs in precision oncology, providing an overview of the current clinical applications and future research trajectories toward improved cancer management.

         <title>Design and Fabrication of a Versatile Microreactor to Study Transaminase&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Biocatalysts in Flow</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile microdevice loaded with an immobilized amine transaminase can be operated as either a packed&#8208;bed or fluidized microreactor depending on the flow direction. This setup is very useful to characterize the performance of immobilized enzymes under different reactor configurations.

Microfluidics is a very attractive discipline for implementing more versatile high&#8208;throughput screening methods to improve enzymes. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microfluidics set&#8208;ups are mainly devoted to screening enzymes in solution, while screening of enzyme immobilization protocols using microfluidics is scarce. In this work, a microreactor device is designed, fabricated and applied to test different heterogeneous biocatalysts with transaminase activity. This microsystem set&#8208;up can be operated in two different modes: packed&#8208;bed (PBR) and fluidized (FBR) microreactors without exchanging the sample. Using the same sample to run the two modes, the fidelity of the comparison is increased between the two fluid dynamic regimes. Moreover, by testing different carriers under different modes, a Histagged transaminase is found from Pseudomonas fluorescens immobilized on agarose porous microbeads functionalized with cobalt&#8208;chelates and operated as FBR maximizes the STY, and minimizes the equilibration times. This device exemplifies the potential of microreactors for prototyping more efficient heterogeneous biocatalysts.

         <title>Comparative Binding Studies of the Chelators Methylolanthanin and Rhodopetrobactin B to Lanthanides and Ferric Iron</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the investigation of the lanthanide (Ln) and Fe&#8208;binding properties of the putative lanthanophore methylolanthanin (MLL) and the siderophore rhodopetrobactin B (RPB B) are reported. While both chelators bind Lns, they unexpectedly precipitate with Lns under biologically relevant conditions and thereby challenge the proposed classic siderophore&#8208;like Ln uptake.

The question of lanthanide (Ln) uptake in Ln&#8208;using bacteria has gained a lot of attention in recent years, and the existence of specific Ln&#8208;binding metallophores, termed lanthanophores, has been postulated. Here, the recently isolated metallophore methylolanthanin (MLL), which is shown to be involved in Ln metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 along the structurally related siderophore rhodopetrobactin B (RPB B), is investigated. The total synthesis of both chelators as well as Ln&#8208;binding investigations employing a multitude of spectroscopic methods is reported. Compared to MLL, RPB B has a higher binding affinity for Fe3+. Unexpectedly, both metallophores seem to precipitate Lns under biologically relevant conditions (pH and concentration range). Therefore, a solubility product of &#8722;12.07 &#177; 0.24 mol2&#8201;L&#8722;2 for the precipitated Eu3+&#8208;MLL complex is reported. Furthermore, a combination of single&#8208;cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography&#8208;Mass Spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) analysis of bacterial supernatant to investigate the Nd accumulation as well as MLL secretion under Fe limitation in M. extorquens AM1 is used. Finally, ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations are used to investigate the RPB B and MLL complexation in the gas phase with Fe3+ and all rare earth elements (except Pm). The results challenge the classical siderophore&#8208;like Ln uptake (via simple solubilization) through MLL and underline again a potential complex interplay between Fe3+ and Ln3+ in microbial Ln uptake.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosylation at Tyrosine 10 Promotes the Astrocyte Clearance of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptide 1&#8211;42</title>

Tyr10 O&#8208;glycosylation stabilizes A&#946;42 oligomers, promotes the endocytosis by astrocytes via TLR4 and SR&#8208;A, improves intracellular degradation and IDE secretion, and ultimately rescues spatial cognitive deficits in AD&#8208;like mice, uncovering novel role of Tyr10 O&#8208;glycan in regulating A&#946; clearance in the brain.

Therapies targeting amyloid &#946; (A&#946;), especially promoting A&#946; clearance, have attracted increasing attention in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the regulatory factors in A&#946; metabolism remain poorly understood. Herein, three homogeneously glycosylated A&#946;42 peptides are utilized to explore the impacts of Tyr10 O&#8208;glycosylation on A&#946; clearance in astrocytes. Based on various biochemical and cellular assays, it is shown that the introduced &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;glycan stabilizes the A&#946; oligomers and enhances A&#946;42 endocytosis and autophagy in astrocytes, which ultimately promotes the intracellular degradation of A&#946;42 and the secretion of A&#946;&#8208;degrading enzymes. Particularly, a disaccharide, Gal&#946;1&#8208;3GalNAc, exhibits the most substantial clearance&#8208;enhancing effect. Moreover, experiments with AD&#8208;like model mice show protective effects from the disaccharide modification in alleviating A&#946;42&#8208;induced impairment of spatial cognitive performance. Thus, beyond showing the influences induced by particular O&#8208;glycosylation on A&#946;42 degradation, the study provides implications of a possible role of Tyr10 O&#8208;glycan in regulating A&#946; clearance in the brain.

         <title>Differentiating the Substrate Profiles of Inflammatory Caspases Using Extended F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer&#8208;Based Peptide Substrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammatory caspases are key players in the innate immune response. Their specificity profiles are investigated using F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer peptide&#8208;based assays, allowing for incorporation of amino acids on both sides of the cleaved aspartic acid residue. Structural analyses led to the conclusion that having an amino acid on the prime side allows the substrate to adopt a different conformation than without it there.

Human inflammatory caspases (caspase&#8208;1, &#8208;4, and &#8208;5) are key players in the innate immune response. These enzymes have been shown to cleave proinflammatory substrates, implicating them in many inflammatory disease states. Their activity is frequently assessed using in&#8201;vitro fluorogenic assays, with all three human inflammatory caspases preferring the same WEHD tetrapeptide. The study examines the specificity of these enzymes C&#8208;terminal to the cleaved aspartate residue with F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer peptide&#8208;based assays using 7&#8208;methoxycoumaryl alanine [A(MCA)] as the donor and lysine&#8208;conjugated dabsyl [K(Dab)] as the quencher. The P4&#8211;P1 peptide sequences A(MCA)EHD, A(MCA)VAD, and A(MCA)QPD are varied on the C&#8208;terminal (prime) side of the peptide. Historically, caspase&#8208;4 and caspase&#8208;5 have been grouped together in their reactivity. Herein, caspase&#8208;5 only appreciably cleaves the A(MCA)EHDGK(Dab) peptide, whereas caspase&#8208;4 displays broader reactivity. All base sequences react more considerably with caspase&#8208;4 when a glycine is included C&#8208;terminal to Asp. The specificity of caspase&#8208;1 at this position varies based on the P3&#8211;P1 sequence of the peptide. These results highlight the interconnectedness of the prime and nonprime side amino acid sequences and the different behavior of each enzyme, which can be useful in understanding these potential drug targets.

         <title>Human Protein Z as the Second Known Heme&#8208;Binding Protein from the Endogenous Blood Coagulation Inhibitor System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein Z is a vitamin K&#8208;dependent anticoagulant with elusive molecular functions. Herein, it is shown that heme binds to protein Z and induces conformational changes. One histidine&#8208;based heme&#8208;binding motif is identified. High heme&#8208;binding affinity and functional effects are demonstrated on protein level. These findings shed new light on the structural and functional roles of protein Z in hemolysis&#8208;driven coagulation disorders.

Protein Z (PZ) is a vitamin&#8208;K&#8208;dependent glycoprotein that serves as an anticoagulant cofactor in blood. Although it is homologous to the serine proteases of blood coagulation, PZ has no enzymatic activity. It binds to the PZ&#8208;dependent protease inhibitor and supports inactivation of factor Xa. In addition, an inhibitory effect on thrombin is described. Clinically, changed PZ levels increase the risk for thrombosis. The related activated protein C (APC) is described as the first anticoagulant protein that binds heme under hemolytic conditions leading to its inhibition. However, the network of inhibitors of blood coagulation is still underexplored with respect to their role in heme&#8208;triggered effects and the regulation thereof. PZ seems to be an interesting candidate in this context due to its homology to APC. Using PZ&#8208;derived peptides as models for potential heme&#8208;binding sites in PZ together with in silico studies, one specific heme&#8208;binding site in PZ is identified. Binding studies on protein level demonstrate binding characteristics similar to APC. Finally, the inhibitory effect of PZ toward thrombin is increased in the presence of heme, providing also insights into a potential functional consequence of the PZ&#8211;heme interaction. In addition, the anticoagulant function of PZ is dampened in the presence of heme in an aPTT&#8208;based clotting assay, suggesting a tendency toward heme&#8208;induced prothrombotic actions. In future, this will support mapping the diverse effects of heme within blood coagulation.

         <title>Exploring the Substitution of the C21&#8208;OAc Moiety in [11]Cytochalasans: Synthesis and Evaluation of Fluorophore Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via in&#8201;silico docking of pyrichalasin H on G&#8208; and F&#8208;actin, the C21&#8208;OAc moiety is identified as a modifiable site tolerated for actin binding. Fluorescent [11]cytochalasan probes from pyrichalasin H and epoxycytochalasin C are obtained by selective C21&#8208;OAc hydrolysis and acylation. The conjugates retain actin binding and bioactivity, establishing C21&#8208;OAc as a versatile handle for functionalization.

The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cellular organization and dynamics, yet the tools available for targeting actin function remain limited. Cytochalasans represent a large class of actin&#8208;targeting natural products that are readily cell permeable with varying cytotoxicity and actin&#8208;targeting capabilities in mammalian cells. Their pharmacologic exploitation not only requires an understanding of their mode of action but also exact knowledge of how they can be derivatized without affecting their bioactivity. Herein, the design, synthesis, and evaluation of five fluorescently labeled [11]cytochalasan derivatives generated from pyrichalasin H (PyriH) and 19,20&#8208;epoxycytochalasin C (EpoxyCytoC) are reported. Guided by molecular docking, the C21&#8208;OAc moiety is identified as a promising site for tag attachment without disrupting actin binding. Semisynthetic modifications enable the conjugation of different dyes to PyriH and EpoxyCytoC scaffolds. Moreover, the effect of linkers separating cytochalasans and dyes is analyzed.

     alt="Exploring the Substitution of the C21-OAc Moiety in [11]Cytochalasans: Synthesis and Evaluation of Fluorophore Conjugates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via in&#8201;silico docking of pyrichalasin H on G- and F-actin, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;21-OAc moiety is identified as a modifiable site tolerated for actin binding. Fluorescent [11]cytochalasan probes from pyrichalasin H and epoxycytochalasin C are obtained by selective &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;21-OAc hydrolysis and acylation. The conjugates retain actin binding and bioactivity, establishing &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;21-OAc as a versatile handle for functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cellular organization and dynamics, yet the tools available for targeting actin function remain limited. Cytochalasans represent a large class of actin-targeting natural products that are readily cell permeable with varying cytotoxicity and actin-targeting capabilities in mammalian cells. Their pharmacologic exploitation not only requires an understanding of their mode of action but also exact knowledge of how they can be derivatized without affecting their bioactivity. Herein, the design, synthesis, and evaluation of five fluorescently labeled [11]cytochalasan derivatives generated from pyrichalasin H (&lt;b&gt;PyriH&lt;/b&gt;) and 19,20-epoxycytochalasin C (&lt;b&gt;EpoxyCytoC&lt;/b&gt;) are reported. Guided by molecular docking, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;21-OAc moiety is identified as a promising site for tag attachment without disrupting actin binding. Semisynthetic modifications enable the conjugation of different dyes to &lt;b&gt;PyriH&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;EpoxyCytoC&lt;/b&gt; scaffolds. Moreover, the effect of linkers separating cytochalasans and dyes is analyzed.

Together, this study compares permeability, cytotoxicity, and actin binding of five novel [11]cytochalasan probes bearing substitutions of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;21-OAc moiety.

         <title>Nanomolar Affinity Host&#8208;Dye Reporter Pairs from Fluorescently Labeled Oligoarginine Peptides and p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dependence of the binding affinity of oligoarginine peptides to p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (CX4) on peptide length, C&#8208;terminal functionality, and fluorescent labeling is reported. The fluorescent peptides can be excited in the visible range with common lasers and show nanomolar affinity and efficient quenching upon CX4 binding, which enables their use as modular host&#8208;dye reporter pairs for peptide sensing.

Oligoarginine peptides are of interest as cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) and play important roles in gene regulation and immune response. Complexation of oligoarginine peptides by the supramolecular host p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (CX4) is well&#8208;established and has led to the use of CX4 derivatives as effective counterion activators for arginine&#8208;rich CPPs and to the application of CX4 in peptide sensing. Herein, a systematic binding study between oligoarginine peptides with CX4 is reported. The results show that the binding affinity increases with increasing peptide length from &#8776;104&#8201;M&#8211;1 for the peptide H&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;OH to nanomolar affinities for peptides with more than four arginine residues. Within the series, C&#8208;terminal carboxamides show higher affinities than the respective carboxylates. In addition, the influence of fluorescent dye labeling is investigated with sulforhodamine B (SRB) and fluorescein (FL) dye labels. Efficient fluorescent quenching is observed after complexation of the labeled peptides by CX4, which prompted the exploration of the complexes as reporter pairs for chemosensing applications. The results suggest that the combination of fluorescently labeled oligoarginine peptides with CX4 affords a modular platform of host&#8208;dye reporter pairs for the detection of polycationic peptides with tailorable excitation and emission wavelengths and tailorable binding affinity down to the nanomolar affinity range.

         <title>Alteration of CD40 Protein Expression by Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B p50 Subunit</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategy for incorporation of phosphorylated tyrosine into the p50 subunit of human NF&#8208;&#954;B.

Protein phosphorylation is critical to selective gene expression; the proteins that regulate transcription are often phosphorylated at multiple sites. Serine and threonine phosphorylation in transcription factors such as NF&#8208;&#954;B has been studied, and specific serines are involved in transcriptional activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of NF&#8208;&#954;B p50 subunit can also facilitate the NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;mediated expression of CD40 protein. This study seeks to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylations at positions not normally phosphorylated in vivo could nonetheless affect protein expression mediated by NF&#8208;&#954;B. The alterations studied included p50 analogs having pTyr at positions 59 and 61, which do not contain Tyr naturally, and an analog containing a metabolically stable tyrosine methylene phosphonate at position 60. Additionally, to explore the structural basis for enhanced NF&#8208;&#954;B binding to CD40 promoter DNA by tyrosine phosphorylation, an analog of NF&#8208;&#954;B p50 containing pTyr at both positions 60 and 82 is prepared. The results reflected changes in the ability of the modified NF&#8208;&#954;Bs containing an altered p50 subunit to bind to CD40 promoter DNA in vitro, and to direct the synthesis of CD40 in cellulo.

         <title>Multifaceted Effects of a Multiple Nitric Oxide Photoreleaser and its Photoproducts on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light&#8208;activatable NO photodonor sequentially releases two NO molecules accompanied by two stable photoproducts, showing differentiated effects on the &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation.

Aberrant aggregation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides into insoluble fibrils is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the post&#8208;translational modifications influencing A&#946; behavior, nitration and nitrosation by nitric oxide (NO) derivatives play a key role, though their impact on aggregation and toxicity remains unclear. This contribution explores the effects on A&#946; aggregation induced by an NO photodonor (NOPD) releasing two NO molecules via a stepwise mechanism under the control of visible blue light. Significant reduction of protein aggregation is observed when a considerable amount NO (&#8776;120&#8201;&#181;M) is photoreleased during the early stages of the protein aggregation. In contrast, long&#8208;term release of a similar NO concentration is ineffective. On the other hand, proaggregative effect is induced by the NOPD kept in the dark. The stable photoproducts formed after the release of the first and the second molecule of NO also show a protein aggregation inhibitory effect both individually and in combination. Dynamic simulation studies are also reported to shed light on the binding of NOPD and its photoproducts with key A&#946;1&#8211;40 residues.

         <title>From Structure to Function: Development of Relaxin&#8208;3 Analogs and their Role in RXFP3 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the current understanding of the relaxin&#8208;3/the relaxin family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) system and recent developments in peptidomimetics and small&#8208;molecule ligands targeting the system.

Relaxin&#8208;3 is a two&#8208;chain neuropeptide of the insulin/relaxin superfamily and the cognate ligand for the G protein&#8208;coupled receptor RXFP3. Since its discovery, the relaxin&#8208;3/RXFP3 signaling system has emerged as a key regulator of feeding behavior, stress responses, arousal, addiction, and cognitive function. Recent structural studies, including the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy structures of RXFP3 bound to relaxin&#8208;3 and small molecules, have provided significant insights into ligand&#8211;receptor interactions. Together with mutagenesis and pharmacological studies, these advances have facilitated the design of diverse RXFP3 ligands, ranging from simplified and/or stapled single&#8208;chain analogs of relaxin&#8208;3 to grafted scaffolds and small&#8208;molecule modulators. Such tools have been instrumental for probing relaxin&#8208;3 biology in&#8201;vivo and highlight the system's therapeutic potential for treating anxiety, depression, obesity, binge eating, and alcohol use disorder. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, receptor subtype selectivity, pharmacokinetic optimization, and safe long&#8208;term modulation. This review summarizes current knowledge of relaxin&#8208;3 structure, receptor interactions, and pharmacology and highlights how advances in peptide chemistry, structural biology, and small&#8208;molecule design are enabling the rational development of RXFP3&#8208;targeted therapeutics.

Photo&#8208;induced ultra&#8208;fast duplex invasion via ultra&#8208;fast photo&#8208;crosslinker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK), aiming for fast high&#8208;efficiency invasion.

Genomic DNA stores genetic information and regulates functions of various biological processes. Genetic diseases can be caused by abnormal gene expression. Genetic manipulation requires sequence&#8208;selective recognition of double&#8208;stranded DNAs, various chemical approaches for double&#8208;duplex invasion have been developed. In the previous research, a photo&#8208;induced double&#8208;duplex invasion (pDDI) is introduced that uses artificial nucleotides, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK) as photo&#8208;crosslinker and 5&#8208;cyanouridine (CU) as inter&#8208;probe photo&#8208;crosslinking inhibitor. In this study, while investigating the invasion mechanism of the pDDI, the invasion independence of pDDI probes is discovered and proposed a photo&#8208;induced duplex invasion (pDI) that achieves fast invasion using only CNVK while still maintaining a high invasion efficiency. This rapid pDI approach provides a powerful new tool for site&#8208;specific manipulation of genomic DNA.

         <title>From Molecule to Meaning: Click and Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters for Plant Systems, Biological Imaging, and Artistic Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of chemical biology, plant imaging, and contemporary art, this review introduces the concept of chembioart. By tracing how chemical reporters illuminate plant biomolecules in vivo, their role not only in advancing scientific understanding but also in inspiring transdisciplinary collaborations and visual expression&#160;is highlighted.

Chemical biology has reshaped the ability to investigate complex biological systems at the molecular level. In this context, chemical reporters have become important tools for labeling and tracking biomolecules in living systems with spatial and temporal precision. In plant biology, they provide an alternative to genetic approaches and allow the study of dynamic processes in species or organs that are not easily accessible. Through the use of click and bioorthogonal chemistry, small&#8208;molecule probes can be metabolically incorporated into specific molecular scaffolds such as sugars, monolignols, amino acids, and lipids. These probes make it possible to follow events like glycosylation, lignification, lipid turnover, or protein synthesis in living plant tissues. This review presents an overview of current chemical reporter strategies, from molecular design and synthetic considerations to their application in plant imaging. Herein, how these tools have contributed to the development of plant chemical biology by enabling precise and modular investigations of plant structure and metabolism is described. Herein, it is also examined how chemical reporters have entered interdisciplinary contexts, including collaborations between science and the arts. By converting molecular&#8208;level information into visual and sensory formats, these approaches open new perspectives for research, education, and communication across scientific and creative disciplines.
