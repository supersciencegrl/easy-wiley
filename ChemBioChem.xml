         <title>Probing the Role of Chirality in Phospholipid Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular handedness, or chirality, can determine the nature of molecular interactions. A key feature of life is the homochirality of biological molecules, including phospholipids. Chemical probes have been used to understand stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes, which has been applied to the development of safer therapeutics and selective chemical tools.







Abstract
Nucleotides, amino acids, sugars, and lipids are almost ubiquitously homochiral within individual cells on Earth. While oligonucleotides and proteins exist as one natural chirality throughout the tree of life, two stereoisomers of phospholipids have separately emerged in archaea and bacteria, an evolutionary divergence known as &#8220;the lipid divide&#8221;. Within this review, we focus on the emergence of phospholipid homochirality and compare the stability of synthetic homochiral and heterochiral membranes in&#8197;vitro. We discuss chemical probes designed to study the stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes in&#8197;vitro. Overall, we aim to highlight studies that help elucidate the determinants of stereospecific interactions between lipids, peptides, and small molecule ligands. Continued work in understanding the drivers of favorable interactions between chiral molecules and biological membranes will lead to the design of increasingly selective chemical tools for bioorthogonal labeling of lipid membranes and safer membrane&#8208;associating pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Complex&#8208;Based G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Selective Luminescent &#8216;Light&#8208;up&#8217; Probe for RNase H Activity Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex&#8208;based, highly selective photoluminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; probe for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA has been developed and utilized for selective RNase H activity detection. The PL light&#8208;up is solely due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide sidearm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was supported by molecular docking analysis.







Abstract
A bis&#8208;heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complex, 1[PF6]2 of benzothiazole amide substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (bmbbipy) has been synthesized for the selective detection of G&#8208;quadruplex (GQ) DNA and luminescence&#8208;assay&#8208;based RNase H activity monitoring. Compound 1[PF6]2 exhibited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in water. Aggregate formation was supported by DLS, UV&#8208;vis, and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy results, and the morphology of aggregated particles was witnessed by SEM and TEM. 1[PF6]2 acted as an efficient GQ DNA&#8208;selective luminescent light&#8208;up probe over single&#8208;stranded and double&#8208;stranded DNA. The competency of 1[PF6]2 for selective GQ structure detection was established by PL and CD spectroscopy. For 1[PF6]2, the PL light&#8208;up is exclusively due to the rigidification of the benzothiazole amide side arm in the presence of GQ&#8208;DNA. The interaction between the probe and GQ&#8208;DNA was analyzed by molecular docking analysis. The GQ structure detection capability of 1[PF6]2 was further applied in the luminescent &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; RNase H activity detection. The assay utilized an RNA:DNA hybrid, obtained from 22AG2&#8208;RNA and 22AG2&#8208;DNA sequences. RNase H solely hydrolyzed the RNA of the RNA:DNA duplex and released G&#8208;rich 22AG2&#8208;DNA, which was detected via the PL enhancement of 1[PF6]2. The selectivity of RNase H activity detection over various other restriction enzymes was also demonstrated.

         <title>S&#8208;Denitrosylase&#8208;like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Conjugated with Xaa&#8208;His Dipeptide: Role of Proline Spacer as a Key Activity Booster</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study developed dipeptide&#8208;conjugated 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine (1), i.e., 1&#8208;Xaa&#8208;His, as a new class of S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic. The synthesized compounds, especially 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His, remarkably promoted S&#8208;denitrosylation of nitrosothiols (RSNO) via a catalytic cycle involving the reversible redox reaction between the diselenide and its corresponding diselenol ([SeH,SeH]) form with coexisting reductant thiols (R'SH), during which the [SeH,SeH] form as a key reactive species reduces RSNO to the corresponding thiol (RSH). Structural analyses of 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His suggested that the peptide backbone of [SeH,SeH] is rigidly bent to form a &#947;&#8208;turn, possibly including an NH&#183;&#183;&#183;Se hydrogen bond between the imidazole ring of His and selenol group, thus stabilizing the [SeH,SeH] form thermodynamically, and dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the synthetic compounds were found to prohibit S&#8208;nitrosylation&#8208;induced protein misfolding in the presence of RSNO, eventually implying their potential as a drug seed for misfolding diseases caused by the dysregulation of the S&#8208;denitrosylation system.</dc:description>

         <title>A Yeast Chronological Lifespan Assay to Assess Activity of Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2553-2560, August 3, 2021. </description>

A chronological lifespan (CLS) assay using various strains of yeast to monitor the effect of proteasome stimulation with small molecules is described.







Abstract
Aging is characterized by changes in several cellular processes, including dysregulation of proteostasis. Current research has shown long&#8208;lived rodents display elevated proteasome activity throughout life and proteasome dysfunction is linked to shorter lifespans in a transgenic mouse model. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is one of the main pathways leading to cellular protein clearance and quality maintenance. Reduction in proteasome activity is associated with aging and its related pathologies. Small molecule stimulators of the proteasome have been proposed to help alleviate cellular stress related to unwanted protein accumulation. Here we have described the development of techniques to monitor the impact of proteasome stimulation in wild&#8208;type yeast and a strain that has impaired proteasome expression. We validated our chronological lifespan assay using both types of yeast with a variety of small molecule stimulators at different concentrations. By modifying the media conditions for the yeast, molecules can be evaluated for their potential to increase chronological lifespan in five days. Additionally, our assay conditions can be used to monitor the activity of proteasome stimulators in modulating the degradation of a YFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein fusion protein produced by yeast. We anticipate these methods to be valuable for those wishing to study the impact of increasing proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation of proteins in a eukaryotic model organism.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is characterized by changes in several cellular processes, including dysregulation of proteostasis. Current research has shown long-lived rodents display elevated proteasome activity throughout life and proteasome dysfunction is linked to shorter lifespans in a transgenic mouse model. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is one of the main pathways leading to cellular protein clearance and quality maintenance. Reduction in proteasome activity is associated with aging and its related pathologies. Small molecule stimulators of the proteasome have been proposed to help alleviate cellular stress related to unwanted protein accumulation. Here we have described the development of techniques to monitor the impact of proteasome stimulation in wild-type yeast and a strain that has impaired proteasome expression. We validated our chronological lifespan assay using both types of yeast with a variety of small molecule stimulators at different concentrations. By modifying the media conditions for the yeast, molecules can be evaluated for their potential to increase chronological lifespan in five days. Additionally, our assay conditions can be used to monitor the activity of proteasome stimulators in modulating the degradation of a YFP-&#945;-synuclein fusion protein produced by yeast. We anticipate these methods to be valuable for those wishing to study the impact of increasing proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins in a eukaryotic model organism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2540-2545, August 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellobiose was synthesized and evaluated for its effects on E. coli biofilms . The impact of the synthetic disaccharide on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays revealing an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate. Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo red binding to bacterial cells. Lastly, single electron microscopy reveals the disaccharide increased the production of curli fibers.







Abstract
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria growing in complex, multicellular enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Recently, a zwitterionic cellulose derivative produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined to play an important role in the formation and assembly of biofilms. In order to produce a minimal, yet structurally defined tool compound to probe the biology of the naturally occurring polymer, we have synthesized a zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose (pEtN cellobiose) and evaluated its biofilm activity in the Gram&#8208;negative bacterium E. coli, a pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of UTIs. The impact of synthetic pEtN cellobiose on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays which revealed an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate compared to untreated samples. Additionally, Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo Red binding to bacterial cells. These results reveal new opportunities to study the impact glycopolymers have on cellular adhesion in Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

         <title>Photothermal Responsive Singlet Oxygen Nanocarriers for Hypoxic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2546-2552, August 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia in the tumor cells has been demonstrated to restrict the outcomes of photodynamic therapy. Here, we designed photothermal responsive singlet oxygen nanocarriers, which bear the endoperoxide of 1,4&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene, to ablate cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The unique O2&#8208;independent singlet oxygen&#8208;generation process suggests that the nanocarriers can be used as novel cancer phototherapy agents.







Abstract
Hypoxia in aggressively proliferating tumor cells has been demonstrated to restrict the efficiency of photodynamic therapy owing to its oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from photosensitizers under light irradiation. To address this problem, we propose a small&#8208;molecule dye&#8208;based 1O2 capturing agent, B1. B1 not only bears a near&#8208;infrared absorbing azo&#8208;boron dipyrromethene backbone, but also has 1,4&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene, which facilitates the capture of 1O2 to form endoperoxide (B1&#8208;SO). B1&#8208;SO undergoes a reversible reaction via near&#8208;infrared photothermal stimulation, thus allowing 1O2 release. Based on this mechanism, stable B1&#8208;SO containing micelles (B1&#8208;SO NPs) were prepared and employed as 1O2 nanocarriers to ablate cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. Taking advantage of this O2&#8208;independent 1O2 releasing ability, B1&#8208;SO NPs were demonstrated to have efficient cytotoxicity under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, especially in a hypoxic environment. The unique O2&#8208;independent 1O2 generation process of B1&#8208;SO NPs suggests they can be used as novel cancer phototherapy agents.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Optical Ligands That Selectively Detect A&#946; Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2568-2581, August 3, 2021. </description>

Molecular matchmaking: Ligands MK&#8208;6240 and b&#8208;TVBT2 are selective for aggregated tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). When combining the azaindole moiety of MK&#8208;6240 with the methyl&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;carboxylate unit of b&#8208;TVBT2, the resulting ligand, termed HS&#8208;276, does not show binding to tau but instead high selectivity for A&#946; aggregates in AD brain tissue. By introducing small structural alterations of the HS&#8208;276 scaffold, the binding properties change.







Abstract
In several neurodegenerative diseases, the presence of aggregates of specific proteins in the brain is a significant pathological hallmark; thus, developing ligands able to bind to the aggregated proteins is essential for any effort related to imaging and therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based ligands containing nitrogen heterocycles. The ligands selectively recognized amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates in brain tissue from individuals diagnosed neuropathologically as having Alzheimer's disease (AD). The selectivity for A&#946; was dependent on the position of nitrogen in the heterocyclic compounds, and the ability to bind A&#946; was shown to be reduced when introducing anionic substituents on the thiophene backbone. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of ligands that can differentiate between aggregated proteinaceous species comprised of distinct proteins. These ligands might also be powerful tools for studying the pathogenesis of A&#946; aggregation and for designing molecules for imaging of A&#946; pathology.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) of Intracellular Transport by Means of Doubly Labelled siRNA Architectures</title>

siRNA traffic lights: RNA is labelled at internal positions of the sequence by two different fluorescent dyes that undergo interstrand energy transfer. The emission is shifted to green after processing of siRNA into single stranded antisense RNA, potentially binding to target mRNA. This allowed imaging of siRNA by microscopy, using the fluorescence lifetime of the donor dye.







Abstract
For monitoring the intracellular pathway of small interfering RNA (siRNA), both strands were labelled at internal positions by two ATTO dyes as an interstrand F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer pair. siRNA double strands show red emission and a short donor lifetime as readout, whereas siRNA antisense single strands show green emission and a long donor lifetime. This readout signals if GFP silencing can be expected (green) or not (red). We attached both dyes to three structurally different alkyne anchors by postsynthetic modifications. There is only a slight preference for the ribofuranoside anchors with the dyes at their 2&#8217;&#8208;positions. For the first time, the delivery and fate of siRNA in live HeLa cells was tracked by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), which revealed a clear relationship between intracellular transport using different transfection methods and knockdown of GFP expression, which demonstrates the potential of our siRNA architectures as a tool for future development of effective siRNA.

An emerging tool against the pandemic war: Thanks to the identification of the RGD sequence on the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, RGD&#8208;recognizing integrins have recently received important attention. Among them, &#945;V&#946;6 may be an intriguing target not only for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry, but also for the diagnosis/treatment of COVID&#8208;19 related fibrosis.







Abstract
The outbreak of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has been an extraordinary event that constituted a global health emergency. As the novel coronavirus is continuing to spread over the world, the need for therapeutic agents to control this pandemic is increasing. &#945;V&#946;6 Integrin may be an intriguing target not only for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry, but also for the diagnosis/treatment of COVID&#8208;19 related fibrosis, an emerging type of fibrotic disease which will probably affect a significant part of the recovered patients. In this short article, the possible role of this integrin for fighting COVID&#8208;19 is discussed on the basis of recently published evidence, showing how its underestimated involvement may be interesting for the development of novel pharmacological tools.

Escherichia coli produces a phosphoethanolamine modified cellulose that is required for extracellular matrix assembly and biofilm scaffolds. A synthetic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose mimics the behavior of the naturally occurring polymer, inducing curli production and increasing biofilm formation. The discovery has implications for understanding microbial biofilms and the generation of new cellulosic probes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Gaddy, S.&#8197;D. Townsend et&#8197;al.

Acyclic xeno nucleic acid (XNA) oligomers with polyanion backbones generally suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation due to their flexible scaffold. However, recent studies have revealed that some acyclic XNAs can enable the formation of highly stable duplexes. This minireview summarizes hybridization properties of negatively charged acyclic XNA. Instead of cyclic nucleic acids, such acyclic XNAs have potential for use as novel biological tools. More information can be found in the Minireview by K. Murayama and H. Asanuma.

Oligomers composed of various acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) have been designed. This minireview highlights the design of acyclic XNA scaffolds with polyanion backbone and hybridization properties of acyclic XNA oligomers. Thermal stabilities of such acyclic XNA duplexes strongly depend on the structure of the scaffold.







Abstract
Xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) are analogues of DNA and RNA that have a non&#8208;ribose artificial scaffold. XNAs are possible prebiotic genetic carriers as well as alternative genetic systems in artificial life. In addition, XNA oligomers can be used as biological tools. Acyclic XNAs, which do not have cyclic scaffolds, are attractive due to facile their synthesis and remarkably high nuclease resistance. To maximize the performance of XNAs, a negatively charged backbone is preferable to provide sufficient water solubility; however, acyclic XNAs containing polyanionic backbones suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation, because of the high flexibility of the acyclic nature. Herein, we review the relationships between the structure and duplex hybridization properties of various acyclic XNA oligomers with polyanion backbones.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field: A Review</title>

Ionic liquids for biological imaging: This work comprehensively reviews the use of ionic liquids for preparing hard&#8208;to&#8208;image, non&#8208;conductive, soft, and/or wet, biological materials for electron microscopy. Commonly used ionic liquids and their application to biomaterials for imaging are summarized to illicit sample&#8208;specific best practices. While the technique has risen in popularity and holds promise for several biological fields, key challenges must be solved to allow for its widespread adoption in microscopy.







Abstract
For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapor pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of in&#8197;situ physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL, in&#8197;situ microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;Benzoyllysine by Engineering Methanomethylophilus alvus Pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2530-2534, August 3, 2021. </description>

Two Methanomethylophilus alvus PylRS mutants were engineered to genetically encode &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;benzoyllysine &#8208; a newly discovered histone post&#8208;translational modification &#8208; into proteins in E. coli and mammalian cells with high efficiency. Mutations at different locations in M. alvus PylRS active site (pink and yellow) were able to achieve high specificity for the same amino acid substrate (grey).







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications regulate protein structure and function. Lysine benzoylation is a newly discovered histone modification with unique physiological relevance. To construct proteins with this modification site&#8208;specifically, we generated orthogonal tRNAPyl&#8208;MaBzKRS pairs by engineering Methanomethylophilus alvus pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase, allowing the genetic incorporation of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;benzoyllysine (BzK) into proteins with high efficiency in E. coli and mammalian cells. Two types of MaBzKRS were identified to incorporate BzK using mutations located at different positions of the amino acid binding pocket. These MaBzKRS are small in size and highly expressed, which will afford broad utilities in studying the biological effects of lysine benzoylation.

&lt;p&gt;Post-translational modifications regulate protein structure and function. Lysine benzoylation is a newly discovered histone modification with unique physiological relevance.

         <title>Methemoglobin&#8208;Albumin Cluster Incorporating Protoporphyrin IX: Dual Functional Protein Drug for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2526-2529, August 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell protein cluster comprising a methemoglobin (metHb) at the center and human serum albumin containing protoporphyrin IX (HSA&#8208;PPIX) at the periphery was synthesized as a unique photosensitizer with O2&#8208;generation property. The metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2&#160;is protein drug showing dual task for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis, photophysical properties, and photodynamic activity of a methemoglobin (metHb) wrapped covalently by human serum albumins (HSAs) incorporating protoporphyrin IX (PPIX): a metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 cluster. The metHb core catalyzes H2O2 disproportionation to generate O2 in tumor tissue. The HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 shell acts as a photosensitizer for 1O2 formation. The metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 cluster acts as a dual functional protein drug for photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2535-2539, August 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine mimic, amino acid SeHF, which has low pKa and strong nucleophilicity under physiological conditions, could significantly improve the enzymatic activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter phosphotriesterase. This approach could be used in metalloenzyme design in the future.







Abstract
Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzymes. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single&#8208;atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The arPTE&#8208;(Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in kcat and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in kcat/KM at pH&#8197;7.0. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activity.

         <title>Carbon Monoxide is an Inhibitor of HIF Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain 2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 15, Page 2521-2525, August 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenously produced gasotransmitter that is involved in a range of physiological roles including the stabilisation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor that regulates oxygen homeostasis. Herein, by using CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;2 as a CO donor, we show that CO is an inhibitor of HIF PHD2, one of the most important oxygen sensing enzymes in humans that regulates HIF stability at the protein level.







Abstract
Hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) is an important oxygen sensor in animals. By using the CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;2 (CORM&#8208;2) as an in&#8197;situ CO donor, we demonstrate that CO is an inhibitor of PHD2. This report provides further evidence about the emerging role of CO in oxygen sensing and homeostasis.

A chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates is reported. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain.







Abstract
The reversible nature of disulfide functionality has been exploited to design intelligent materials such as nanocapsules, micelles, vesicles, inorganic nanoparticles, peptide and nucleic acid nanodevices. Herein, we report a new chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The disulfide functionality is strategically placed between the dendron and protein domains. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the protein assemblies is demonstrated using a suitable redox trigger.

         <title>The Chemical Biology&#8208;Medicinal Chemistry Continuum: EFMC&#8242;s Vision</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scientific continuum? EFMC covers the field of chemical biology to medicinal chemistry. What are these disciplines, and how do they differentiate, if at all? This article discusses EFMC's current understanding of chemical biology, and its relation to medicinal chemistry, biology and biochemistry. Chemical biology includes many activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools, and their use to probe, characterize or influence biological systems.







Abstract
The European Federation for Medicinal chemistry and Chemical biology (EFMC) is a federation of learned societies. It groups organizations of European scientists working in a dynamic field spanning chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. New ideas, tools, and technologies emerging from a wide array of scientific disciplines continuously energize this rapidly evolving area. Medicinal chemistry is the design, synthesis, and optimization of biologically active molecules aimed at discovering new drug candidates &#8211; a mission that in many ways overlaps with the scope of chemical biology. Chemical biology is by now a mature field of science for which a more precise definition of what it encompasses, in the frame of EFMC, is timely. This article discusses chemical biology as currently understood by EFMC, including all activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools and their use to probe, characterize, or influence biological systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A scientific continuum?&lt;/b&gt; EFMC covers the field of chemical biology to medicinal chemistry. What are these disciplines, and how do they differentiate, if at all? This article discusses EFMC's current understanding of chemical biology, and its relation to medicinal chemistry, biology and biochemistry. Chemical biology includes many activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools, and their use to probe, characterize or influence biological systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;uropean &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;ederation for &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;edicinal chemistry and &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;hemical biology (EFMC) is a federation of learned societies. It groups organizations of European scientists working in a dynamic field spanning chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. New ideas, tools, and technologies emerging from a wide array of scientific disciplines continuously energize this rapidly evolving area. Medicinal chemistry is the design, synthesis, and optimization of biologically active molecules aimed at discovering new drug candidates &#8211; a mission that in many ways overlaps with the scope of chemical biology. Chemical biology is by now a mature field of science for which a more precise definition of what it encompasses, in the frame of EFMC, is timely. This article discusses chemical biology as currently understood by EFMC, including all activities dealing with the design and synthesis of biologically active chemical tools and their use to probe, characterize, or influence biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enzymatic Assays to Explore Viral mRNA Capping Machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To escape recognition by the host innate immune system, viruses often incorporate 5&#8242; caps into their mRNAs. The differences in mRNA capping make this process an interesting therapeutic target. Here, we review methods to explore the enzymes involved in cap biosynthesis. Such methods allow inhibitor selection, facilitating antiviral drug discovery, which is especially important considering the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks.







Abstract
In eukaryotes, mRNA is modified by the addition of the 7&#8208;methylguanosine (m7G) 5&#8242; cap to protect mRNA from premature degradation, thereby enhancing translation and enabling differentiation between self (endogenous) and non&#8208;self RNAs (e.&#8201;g., viral ones). Viruses often develop their own mRNA capping pathways to augment the expression of their proteins and escape host innate immune response. Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and facilitate drug discovery, e.&#8201;g., against viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks, such as beta&#8208;coronaviruses SARS&#8208;CoV (2002), MARS&#8208;CoV (2012), and the most recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, proper methods for the screening of large compound libraries are required to identify lead structures that could serve as a basis for rational antiviral drug design. This review summarizes the methods that allow the monitoring of the activity and inhibition of enzymes involved in mRNA capping.

         <title>An Advanced &#8216;clickECM&#8217; that Can be Modified by the Inverse&#8208;Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the natural environment of the cells in tissue and therefore is a promising biomaterial in a variety of applications. Depending on the purpose it is necessary to equip the ECM with specific addressable functional groups for further modification with bioactive molecules, for controllable cross linking and/or covalent binding to surfaces. Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) enables the specific modification of the ECM with such functional groups without affecting the native structure of the ECM. In a previous approach (S. M. Ruff, S. Keller, D. E. Wieland, V. Wittmann, G. E. M. Tovar, M. Bach, P. J. Kluger,  Acta Biomater.  2017  ,  52  , 159&#8208;170), we demonstrated the modification of an ECM with azido groups which can be addressed by bioorthogonal copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Here we demonstrate the modification of an ECM with dienophiles (terminal alkenes, cyclopropene) which can be addressed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. This reaction is cell friendly as there are no cytotoxic catalysts needed. We show the equipment of the ECM with a bioactive molecule (enzyme) and prove the functional groups itself not to influence cellular behavior. Thus, this new material has great potential for its use as biomaterial which can be individually modified in a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Solid&#8208;Phase Assay for Substrate Profiling and Directed Evolution of Transketolase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (wild type or variants) in combination with donor (&#945;&#8208;ketoacids) and acceptor substrates (aldehydes), obviating enzyme extraction.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes, and specifically transketolases, form one of the most important families of biocatalytic tools for enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation yielding various hydroxyketones of biological interest. To enable substrate profiling of transketolases for acceptance of different donors and acceptors, a&#8197;simple, direct colorimetric assay based on pH reaction variation was developed to establish a&#8197;high&#8208;throughput solid&#8208;phase assay. This assay reduces the screening effort in the directed evolution of transketolases, as only active variants are selected for further analysis. Transketolase activity is detected as bicarbonate anions released from the &#945;&#8208;ketoacid donor substrate, which causes the pH to rise. A&#8197;pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase variants, obviating enzyme extraction.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;PAINT Enables Investigation of Endogenous Talin with Molecular Scale Resolution in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PIPKI&#947;&#8208;peptide&#8208;PAINT approach is introduced in this study to enable quantitative investigation of the cell adhesion protein talin with single&#8208;molecule resolution in cells. The technique does not require genetic modifications and allows the analysis of endogenously expressed molecules. The first application reveals atypical adhesion structures in differentiating mesenchymal stem cells.







Abstract
Talin is a cell adhesion molecule that is indispensable for the development and function of multicellular organisms. Despite its central role for many cell biological processes, suitable methods to investigate the nanoscale organization of talin in its native environment are missing. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining single&#8208;molecule resolved PAINT (points accumulation in nanoscale topography) imaging with the IRIS (image reconstruction by integrating exchangeable single&#8208;molecule localization) approach, enabling the quantitative analysis of genetically unmodified talin molecules in cells. We demonstrate that a previously reported peptide can be utilized to specifically label the two major talin isoforms expressed in mammalian tissues with a localization precision of &lt;10&#8197;nm. Our experiments show that the methodology performs equally well as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;molecule localization techniques, and the first applications reveal a thus far undescribed cell adhesion structure in differentiating stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this peptide&#8208;PAINT technique to mouse tissues paving the way to single&#8208;protein imaging of endogenous talin proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Comparisons of &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Propensity Among Peptides with Homochiral or Heterochiral Strands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As predicted by Pauling and Corey, pairing of homochiral (all&#8208;L) peptide strands leads to pleated &#946;&#8208;sheets, while pairing of L and D strands leads to rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets. Our evidence indicates that heterochiral strand pairing in aqueous solution is less favorable than homochiral strand pairing.







Abstract
Assemblies of racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides have attracted attention for biomedical applications because racemic forms of peptides can self&#8208;associate more avidly than do single enantiomers. In 1953, Pauling and Corey proposed &#8220;rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; modes of H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated interstrand assembly for alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;peptide strands; this structural hypothesis was complementary to their proposal of &#8220;pleated &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8221; assembly for L&#8208;peptides. Although no high&#8208;resolution structure has been reported for a rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet, there is strong evidence for the occurrence of rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets in some racemic peptide assemblies. Here we compare propensities of peptide diastereomers in aqueous solution to form a minimum increment of &#946;&#8208;sheet in which two antiparallel strands associate. &#946;&#8208;Hairpin folding is observed for homochiral peptides with aligned nonpolar side chains, but no &#946;&#8208;hairpin population can be detected for diastereomers in which one strand contains L residues and the other contains D residues. These observations suggest that rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are stabilized by interactions between &#946;&#8208;sheet layers rather than interactions within these layers.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Imaging and Identification of Bacterial Toxins Causing Mushroom Soft Rot and Cavity Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of genome mining, metabolic profiling, and imaging techniques (MALDI and UV Raman spectroscopy) provided insight into the arsenal of antifungals produced by the mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola. Targeted gene knockouts and bioassays link these antifungals to prevalent symptoms of mushroom soft rot, browning, and impaired mycelium growth.







Abstract
Soft rot disease of edible mushrooms leads to rapid degeneration of fungal tissue and thus severely affects farming productivity worldwide. The bacterial mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola has been identified as the cause. Yet, little is known about the molecular basis of the infection, the spatial distribution and the biological role of antifungal agents and toxins involved in this infectious disease. We combine genome mining, metabolic profiling, MALDI&#8208;Imaging and UV Raman spectroscopy, to detect, identify and visualize a complex of chemical mediators and toxins produced by the pathogen during the infection process, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin, and sinapigladioside. Furthermore, targeted gene knockouts and in&#8197;vitro assays link antifungal agents to prevalent symptoms of soft rot, mushroom browning, and impaired mycelium growth. Comparisons of related pathogenic, mutualistic and environmental Burkholderia spp. indicate that the arsenal of antifungal agents may have paved the way for ancestral bacteria to colonize niches where frequent, antagonistic interactions with fungi occur. Our findings not only demonstrate the power of label&#8208;free, in&#8197;vivo detection of polyyne virulence factors by Raman imaging, but may also inspire new approaches to disease control.

         <title>Synthesis of KUE&#8208;siRNA Conjugates for Prostate Cancer Cell&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates were constructed based on propargyl&#8208;terminated siRNAs and lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE) ligands. These siRNA conjugates could selectively enter prostate cancer cells expressing prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to mediate the specific gene knockdown.







Abstract
The delivery of siRNAs to selectively target cells poses a great challenge in RNAi&#8208;based cancer therapy. The lack of suitable cell&#8208;targeting methods seriously restricts the advance in delivering siRNAs to extrahepatic tissues. Based on prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting ligands, we have synthesized a series of lysine&#8208;urea&#8208;glutamate (KUE)&#8208;siRNA conjugates and verified their effective cell uptake and gene silencing properties in prostate cancers. The results indicated that the KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates could selectively enter PSMA+ LNCaP cells, eventually down&#8208;regulating STAT3 expression. Based on post&#8208;synthesis modification and receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, this strategy of constructing ligand&#8208;siRNA conjugates might provide a general method of siRNA delivery for cell&#8208;targeted gene silencing.

         <title>Sphaeropsidin A: a Pimarane Diterpene with Interesting Biological Activities and Promising Practical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fungal pimarane diterpene sphaeropsidin A (SphA) has shown promising application in agriculture and medicine. This article reviews its biosynthetic origins, fungal sources, preparation of semisynthetic derivatives and biological activities as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies.







Abstract
Sphaeropsidin A (SphA) is a tetracyclic pimarane diterpene, first isolated as the main phytotoxin produced by Diplodia cupressi the causal agent of a severe canker disease of Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens&#8197;L.). It was also produced, together with several analogues, by different pathogenic Diplodia species and other fungi and showed a broad array of biological activities suggesting its promising application in agriculture and medicine. The anticancer activity of SphA is very potent and cell specific. Recent studies have revealed its unique mode of action. This minireview reports the structures of SphA and its family of natural analogues, their biosynthetic origins, their fungal sources, and biological activities. The preparation of various SphA derivatives is also described as well as the results of structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies and on their potential practical applications.

         <title>Evaluation of an E. coli Cell Extract Prepared by Lysozyme&#8208;Assisted Sonication via Gene Expression, Phage Assembly and Proteomics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
E. coli extracts can be prepared using a simple combination of lysozyme incubation and ultrasonication. We evaluate their performance in cell&#8208;free protein expression via the expression of reporter proteins, the assembly of bacteriophages, and using proteomics. Our results show a synergistic effect of both lysis methods.







Abstract
Over the past decades, starting from crude cell extracts, a variety of successful preparation protocols and optimized reaction conditions have been established for the production of cell&#8208;free gene expression systems. One of the crucial steps during the preparation of cell extract&#8208;based expression systems is the cell lysis procedure itself, which largely determines the quality of the active components of the extract. Here we evaluate the utility of an E. coli cell extract, which was prepared using a combination of lysozyme incubation and a gentle sonication step. As quality measure, we demonstrate the cell&#8208;free expression of YFP at concentrations up to 0.6&#8197;mg/mL. In addition, we produced and assembled T7 bacteriophages up to a titer of 108&#8197;PFU/mL. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantitative proteomics was used to compare the produced extracts with each other and with a commercial extract. The differences in protein composition were surprisingly small between lysozyme&#8208;assisted sonication (LAS) extracts, but we observed an increase in the release of DNA&#8208;binding proteins for increasing numbers of sonication cycles. Proteins taking part in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, amino acid and nucleotide related pathways were found to be more abundant in the LAS extract, while proteins related to RNA modification and processing, DNA modification and replication, transcription regulation, initiation, termination and the TCA cycle were found enriched in the commercial extract.

         <title>Recent Developments and Strategies for Mutually Orthogonal Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of mutually exclusive &#8216;orthogonal bioorthogonal&#8217; reaction pairs has received increasing attention over the past decade. This minireview discusses strategies that have been employed to achieve successful dual and triple ligation systems that display both good kinetics and minimal cross&#8208;reactivities. These tools have potential applications for the observation of simultaneous biological processes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Over the past decade, several different metal&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions have been developed to enable simultaneous double&#8208;click labeling with minimal&#8208;to&#8208;no competing cross&#8208;reactivities; such transformations are termed &#8216;mutually orthogonal&#8217;. More recently, several examples of successful triple ligation strategies have also been described. In this minireview, we discuss selected aspects of the development of orthogonal bioorthogonal reactions over the past decade, including general strategies to drive future innovations to achieve simultaneous, mutually orthogonal click reactions in one pot.

         <title>The Innate Immune Glycoprotein Lactoferrin Represses the Helicobacter pylori cag Type IV Secretion System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution light microscopy of Helicobacter pylori&#8208;infected gastric tissue (400&#215; magnification): The picture shows a composite fluorescent image of gastric tissue stained with eosin (pseudo&#8208;colored blue) producing lactoferrin (pseudocolored overlay cyan), with the structure of lactoferrin in an inset (circular panel). H. pylori is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial pathogen that infects the stomach and causes ulcers and gastric cancer. The host innate immune system produces the glycoprotein lactoferrin as part of the antimicrobial response to bacterial infection, and this molecule can repress the oncogenic activity of the H. pylori cag T4SS in an iron&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Engineered RebH Halogenase Variants Demonstrating a Specificity Switch from Tryptophan towards Novel Indole Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two engineered halogenase enzymes were developed by switching substrate specificity of the parental enzyme from tryptophan to indole compounds. They can halogenate several industrially important indole derivatives more efficiently than the parental enzyme; this includes enzymatic chlorination/bromination of novel substrates that were not reported previously. The engineered enzymes could be useful in regioselective synthesis of drug intermediates.







Abstract
Activating industrially important aromatic hydrocarbons by installing halogen atoms is extremely important in organic synthesis and often improves the pharmacological properties of drug molecules. To this end, tryptophan halogenase enzymes are potentially valuable tools for regioselective halogenation of arenes, including various industrially important indole derivatives and similar scaffolds. Although endogenous enzymes show reasonable substrate scope towards indole compounds, their efficacy can often be improved by engineering. Using a structure&#8208;guided semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis approach, we have developed two RebH variants with expanded biocatalytic repertoires that can efficiently halogenate several novel indole substrates and produce important pharmaceutical intermediates. Interestingly, the engineered enzymes are completely inactive towards their natural substrate tryptophan in spite of their high tolerance to various functional groups in the indole ring. Computational modelling and molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic insights into the role of gatekeeper residues in the substrate binding site and the dramatic switch in substrate specificity when these are mutated.

         <title>Building siRNAs with cubes: synthesis and evaluation of cubane&#8208;modified siRNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cubane molecules hold great potential for medicinal chemistry applications due to its inherent stability and low toxicity. In this manuscript, we report the synthesis of a cubane derivative phosphoramidite for the incorporation of cubane into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Synthetic siRNAs rely on chemical modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profiles. However, they are still able to mediate sequence&#8208;specific gene silencing via the endogenous RNA interference pathway. We designed a library of siRNAs bearing the cubane at different positions within the sense and antisense strands. All siRNAs showed excellent gene&#8208;silencing activity, with IC  50  values ranging from 45.4 to 305 pM. Incorporating the cubane modification in both the sense and antisense strand led to viable duplexes with good biological activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of siRNAs bearing a cubane derivative within the backbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Natural Products of Commensal Microbiota as an Environmental Selection Pressure for the Rise of New Variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico studies suggest that NPs like bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) produced by bacteria residing in the respiratory tract can interfere with the binding of the original strain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to the ACE2 receptor but not with the binding of the emerging variants having the N501Y mutation. Thus, it is hypothesized that NPs of respiratory tract bacteria are an environmental selection pressure for the rise of new variants of the virus with higher infectivity rate.







Abstract
Since the emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, little attention has been paid to the interplay between the interaction of virus and commensal microbiota. Here, we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations to study the interaction of some of the known metabolites and natural products (NPs) produced by commensal microbiota with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The results predict that NPs of commensal microbiota such as bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs), of which some are siderophores, bind to the wild&#8208;type RBD and interfere with its binding to the ACE2 receptor. N501Y mutation, which is present in many of the emerging variants of the virus, abolishes the predicted binding pocket of bile acids and NRPs. Based on these findings, available experimental data showing that bile acids reduce the binding affinity of wild&#8208;type RBD to the ACE2 receptor, and the data suggesting that the respiratory tract microbiota affect viral infection we put forward the following proposal: mutations such as N501Y enable the RBD to bind to the ACE2 receptor more effectively in the presence of NPs produced by the respiratory tract bacteria thereby, increasing the infectivity rate of the virus. We hope our data stimulate future works to better understand the interactions of NPs produced by commensal microbiota with respiratory viruses like SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>An Autophagy&#8208;Disrupting Small Molecule Promotes Cancer Cell Death via Caspase Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel autophagy inhibitor (autophazole, Atz) is reported which was identified by cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. Autophazole was found to disrupt lysosomal function, thereby leading to inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Atz induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization&#8208;associated apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
A novel autophagy inhibitor, autophazole (Atz), which promoted cancer cell death via caspase activation, is described. This compound was identified from cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. The results showed that Atz was internalized into lysosomes of cells where it induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). This process generated nonfunctional autolysosomes, thereby inhibiting autophagy. In addition, Atz was found to promote LMP&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Specifically, LMP induced by Atz caused release of cathepsins from lysosomes into the cytosol. Cathepsins in the cytosol cleaved Bid to generate tBid, which subsequently activated Bax to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This event led to cancer cell death via caspase activation. Overall, the findings suggest that Atz will serve as a new chemical probe in efforts aimed at gaining a better understanding of the autophagic process.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Hydroxylated Vitamin D3 Derivatives and Their Metabolism by CYP27B1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of CYP27B1 in C1 hydroxylation of a series of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated D3 derivatives was explored. We found that the 24R and 26R metabolites were more effectively hydroxylated at C1 by CYP27B1 compared to the corresponding S diastereomers. However, CYP27B1 showed almost no activity towards either of the diastereomers of the 23&#8208;hydroxylated derivative. This is the first report to show that CYP27B1 metabolizes 26&#8208;hydroxylated D3, converting 25,26D3 to the corresponding 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated compound, 1,25,26D3.







Abstract
1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (abbreviated here as 1,25D3) is a hormonally active form of vitamin D3 (D3), and is produced from D3 by CYP27&#8197;A1&#8208;mediated hydroxylation at C25, followed by CYP27B1&#8208;mediated hydroxylation at C1. Further hydroxylation of 25D3 and 1,25D3 occurs at C23, C24 and C26 to generate corresponding metabolites, except for 1,25R,26D3. Since the capability of CYP27B1 to hydroxylate C1 of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated metabolites other than 23S,25D3 and 24R,25D3 has not been examined, we have here explored the role of CYP27B1 in the C1 hydroxylation of a series of side&#8208;chain&#8208;hydroxylated D3 derivatives. We found that CYP27B1 hydroxylates the R diastereomers of 24,25D3 and 25,26D3 more effectively than the S diastereomers, but shows almost no activity towards either diastereomer of 23,25D3. This is the first report to show that CYP27B1 metabolizes 25,26D3 to the corresponding 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivative, 1,25,26D3. It will be interesting to examine the physiological relevance of this finding.

         <title>Potential of Single&#8208;Molecule Live&#8208;Cell Imaging for Chemical Translational Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the dynamics of the cell&#8216;s molecular systems. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging of biomolecules in living cells, especially for G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, are introduced. The potential of a single&#8208;molecule imaging approach for chemical translational biology is discussed based on the recent progress in single&#8208;molecule imaging methods.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the motility of molecules in living cells. Considering the relationship between the motility of molecules and their function, information obtained from single&#8208;molecule imaging involves essential clues for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the processes of target molecules, and translation to applied sciences such as drug discovery. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging studies on G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are mainly introduced, and recent techniques of single&#8208;molecule imaging for overcoming the limitation of single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging are discussed. Based on these studies, the prospects of single&#8208;molecule imaging will be outlined.

         <dc:description>
Ubiquitination plays a prominent role in cell signaling networks. Enzymes governing ubiquitination include the conjugation machinery along with the deconjugating enzymes &#8208; deubiquitases. A MspA nanopore is demonstrated as a sensor for discriminating and quantifying various ubiquitin proteins. Real&#8208;time measurement of polymeric ubiquitin chain disassembly by a deubiquitinating enzyme was performed and enzyme kinetics were determined. The implementation of MspA into arrays could enable high throughput characterizations of unknown deubiquitinases as well as drug screening against disease&#8208;related enzymes. More information can be found in the Communication by Min Chen et&#8197;al.

         <title>Forward Chemical Genetic Screen for Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxins Uncovers New Covalent Fragments that Target GPX4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of propiolamide&#8208;based GPX4 inhibitors was discovered in an unbiased screen of 930 electrophilic fragments under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We show that the novel GPX4 inhibitors displayed normoxia&#8208;selective toxicity, which can be expanded to canonical ferroptosis inducers in three different cell lines. This underscores the importance of tumor oxygenation when developing GPX4 inhibitors for therapeutic use.







Abstract
The identification of growth inhibitory compounds with the ability to selectively target the cellular oxygenation state may be of therapeutic interest. Here, a phenotypic screen of a&#8197;covalent fragment library revealed diverse compounds containing propiolamide warheads with selective toxicity for liver cancer cells in normoxic conditions. Target identification and validation through CETSA and direct pulldown experiments demonstrated that several compounds target glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) and induce ferroptotic cell death. Although being an oxidative cell death mechanism, ferroptosis can be induced also under hypoxic conditions. Prompted by the selective toxicity discovered in the screen, we mapped the oxygen&#8208;dependence of several ferroptosis&#8208;inducing compounds across three different cell lines. These studies revealed combinations with notable reductions in sensitivity under hypoxic conditions. These observations are mechanistically interesting and may be relevant for the use of ferroptosis&#8208;inducers as anti&#8208;cancer agents.

         <title>Characterization of Fluorescent Proteins with Intramolecular Photostabilization**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental strategy is introduced to characterize the effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. &#945;&#8208;GFP variant A206C/L221C allowed attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides (trolox, nitrophenyl, cyclooctatetraene and azobenzene) on the &#946;&#8208;barrel in proximity to the chromophore. Increases of photostability were found upon conjugation of azobenzene with a photostability mechanism to be elucidated.







Abstract
Genetically encodable fluorescent proteins have revolutionized biological imaging in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. Despite their importance, their photophysical properties, i.&#8201;e., brightness, count&#8208;rate and photostability, are relatively poor compared to synthetic organic fluorophores or quantum dots. Intramolecular photostabilizers were recently rediscovered as an effective approach to improve photophysical properties of organic fluorophores. Here, direct conjugation of triplet&#8208;state quenchers or redox&#8208;active substances creates high local concentrations of photostabilizer around the fluorophore. In this paper, we screen for effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. We produced a double cysteine mutant (A206C/L221C) of &#945;&#8208;GFP for attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides on the &#946;&#8208;barrel near the chromophore. Whereas labelling with photostabilizers such as trolox, a&#8197;nitrophenyl group, and cyclooctatetraene, which are often used for organic fluorophores, had no effect on &#945;&#8208;GFP&#8208;photostability, a substantial increase of photostability was found upon conjugation to azobenzene. Although the mechanism of the photostabilizing effects remains to be elucidated, we speculate that the higher triplet&#8208;energy of azobenzene might be crucial for triplet&#8208;quenching of fluorophores in the blue spectral range. Our study paves the way for the development of fluorescent proteins with photostabilizers in the protein barrel by methods such as unnatural amino acid incorporation.

         <title>Enzymatic Asymmetric Reduction of Unfunctionalized C=C Bonds with Archaeal Geranylgeranyl Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases were tested for the biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of isolated unfunctionalized C=C bonds. The reduction of acyclic terpene chains with different head groups showed great tolerance for substrates, without affecting cyclic or terminal C=C bonds. Moreover, the introduction of a succinate hemiester significantly increased conversion. The reaction is highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (ee&gt;99&#8201;%).







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of activated C=C bonds such as enones is well established for non&#8208;enzymatic methods as well as in biocatalysis. However, the asymmetric reduction of unfunctionalized C=C bonds is mainly performed with transition metal catalysts whereas biocatalytic approaches are lacking. We have tested two FAD&#8208;dependent archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases (GGR) for the asymmetric reduction of isolated C=C bonds. The reduction of up to four double bonds in terpene chains with different chain lengths and head groups was confirmed. Methyl&#8208;branched E&#8208;alkenes were chemoselectively reduced in the presence of cyclic, terminal or activated alkenes. Using a removable succinate &#8220;spacer&#8221;, farnesol and geraniol could be quantitatively reduced (&gt;99&#8201;%). The reduction is strictly (R)&#8208;selective (enantiomeric excess &gt;99&#8201;%). Hence, GGRs are promising biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of unactivated isolated C=C bonds, opening new opportunities for the synthesis of enantiopure branched alkyl chains.

         <title>Enhancement of the Catalytic Activity of Hammerhead Ribozymes by Organic Cations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapentylammonium (TPeA) ions can enhance the turnover activity of the long&#8208;chain hammerhead ribozyme. The bulky cation decreases the stability of base&#8208;paired secondary structures of duplex, hairpin and self&#8208;forming structures that are formed by the ribozyme and substrate strands, but does not greatly destabilize the folded tertiary ribozyme&#8208;substrate complex.







Abstract
Catalytic turnover is important for the application of ribozymes to biotechnology. However, the turnover is often impaired because of the intrinsic high stability of base pairs with cleaved RNA products. Here, organic cations were used as additives to improve the catalytic performance of hammerhead ribozyme constructs that exhibit different kinetic behaviors. Kinetic analysis of substrate cleavage demonstrated that bulky cations, specifically tetra&#8208;substituted ammonium ions containing pentyl groups or a benzyl group, have the ability to greatly increase the turnover rate of the ribozymes. Thermal stability analysis of RNA structures revealed that the bulky cations promote the dissociation of cleaved products and refolding of incorrectly folded structures with small disruption of the catalytic structure. The use of bulky cations is a convenient method for enhancing the catalytic activity of hammerhead ribozymes, and the approach may be useful for advancing ribozyme technologies.

This picture shows the 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) motif which chelates the zinc ion of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). To identify non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases, the TFMAL motif was discovered by screening a metal chelator chemical library. Subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design led to the discovery of compounds that exhibit sufficient HDAC6 inhibitory activity and selectivity in both in vitro and in cellulo experiments. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Suzuki et&#8197;al.

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP) &#8211; A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Known since the 1890s, diamidophosphate (DAP) has been investigated within the context of its inorganic chemistry. In 1999, with the demonstration of DAP&#8217;s potential as a phosphorylating agent of sugars in aqueous medium, began the exciting phase of research about DAP&#8217;s role as a plausible prebiotic phosphorylating agent. More recently, in the last five years, there has been a steady increase in the publications that have documented the surprising versatility of DAP enabling the emergence of many classes of biomolecules of life, such as the nucleic acids, peptides and protocells. Thus, though in its infancy, DAP seems to be uniquely positioned to play a central role in modelling abiotic&#8208; to prebiotic&#8208;chemical evolution. In this context, there is a need for systematic investigations for (a) establishing DAP&#8217;s likely availability on the early Earth and (b) developing DAP&#8217;s potential as a tool for use in synthetic and bioorganic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Light Energy Conversion with Biomimetic Vesicle Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicles can be used for the compartmentalization of chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembly of reaction partners. This minireview highlights recent advances in biomimetic and light&#8208;induced energy conversions with liposomes and polymersomes, relevant in the context of energy transfer, electron transfer, photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable self&#8208;assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane&#8208;facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer. The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer&#8208;membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light&#8208;driven reactions.

The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer-membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light-driven reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>PEGylated Oligothioetheramide Prodrugs Activated by Host Serum Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High host toxicity presents a challenging barrier to clinical application of small&#8208;molecule antibiotics. PEG conjugation incorporating a reactivation mechanism triggered by host proteases effectively reduces toxicity through controlled release of the antibiotic. While highlighting the utility of synthetic, proteolytically stable compounds like oligoTEAs, this approach is translatable to similar therapeutics.







Abstract
Due to the increasing prominence of antibiotic resistance, novel drug discovery and delivery approaches targeting bacteria are essential. In this work we evaluate a prodrug design to improve the cytotoxic profile of polycationic oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs), which are promising antimicrobials. Herein we chemically modify the oligoTEA, PDT&#8208;4G, with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) and show that 1, 2, and 5&#8197;kDa PEGs mitigate cytotoxicity. As PEGylation reduces antibacterial activity, we evaluate two peptide linkers which, unlike oligoTEAs, are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in serum. To gain insight into the prodrug reactivation, two linkers were tested, the 5&#8208;residue peptide sequence LMPTG, and the dipeptide sequence VC&#8208;PABC. In the presence of 20&#8201;% serum, prodrugs made with the VC&#8208;PABC linker successfully inhibited bacterial growth. Overall, we observed reactivation of oligoTEAs facilitated by serum protease cleavage of the peptide linkers. This work opens the door to the future design of antimicrobial prodrugs with tunable release profiles.

         <title>Identification of Novel Histone Deacetylase 6&#8208;Selective Inhibitors Bearing 3,3,3&#8208;Trifluorolactic Amide (TFLAM) Motif as a Zinc Binding Group</title>

Non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors: We identified isoindoline compounds bearing 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel zinc binding group by screening a compound library and the subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design (SBDD). The identified inhibitor exhibited potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced Treg cell differentiation.







Abstract
Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer and immunological diseases. Most of the previously reported HDAC6 inhibitors have a hydroxamate group as a zinc binding group (ZBG), which coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion of HDAC6. The hydroxamate group is liable to metabolically generate mutagenetic hydroxylamine; therefore, non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors would be advantageous. In this study, to identify novel non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors, screening of a chemical library and the subsequent structural optimization were performed, which led to the identification of HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel ZBG. The identified inhibitor showed potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>

         <dc:description>
Few methods exist to site&#8208;specifically label loops of globular proteins without interfering with the function of the protein. A modular &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive perfluoro&#8208;aromatic probe was synthesized in only two&#8208;steps and used to selectively modify an internal, surface exposed loop of the major capsid protein of JC polyomavirus (VP1). The perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl probe reacts selectively with the cysteine in the &#960;&#8208;clamp (Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe) over 6 native cysteines present in VP1. Using microscopy, fluorescently labeled &#960;&#8208;clamp VP1 can be observed binding and entering human glial cells. More information can be found in the Communication by F.&#8197;M. Rossi, C.&#8197;D.&#8197;S. Nelson et&#8197;al.

         <title>Evaluation of Naturally Occurring HIF&#8208;1 Inhibitors for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1) leads to expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Six naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified using the developed cell&#8208;based assay. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors are thus effective in decreasing PDK1, which causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.







Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe progressive disorder characterized by high pulmonary artery pressure. Chronic hypoxia causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) is a key enzyme in Warburg effect increased by hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1). We constructed a cell&#8208;based luciferase assay system for HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors. Using this system, six HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified. Among these inhibitors, the effect of tagitinin&#8197;C (1) on PASMC was investigated. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. This result indicates that HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors effectively decrease PDK1 activity, which is a cause of the metabolic disorder and Warburg effect observed in PASMCs. Identifying naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors could provide novel insights into the development of PAH medications.

         <title>Photosensitized Oxidative Dimerization at Tyrosine by a Water&#8208;Soluble 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide</title>

We report an aerobic, visible light&#8208;dependent oxidation of Tyr&#8208;containing substrates promoted by a water&#8208;soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based photosensitizer. The developed procedure demonstrates the generation of o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers.







Abstract
The oxidation of proteins generates reactive amino acid (AA) residue intermediates, leading to protein modification and cross&#8208;linking. Aerobic studies with peptides and photosensitizers allow for the controlled generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive AA residue intermediates, providing mechanistic insights as to how natural protein modifications form. Such studies have inspired the development of abiotic methods for protein modification and crosslinking, including applications of biomedical importance. Dityrosine linkages derived from oxidation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues represent one of the more well&#8208;understood oxidation&#8208;induced modifications. Here we demonstrate an aerobic, visible light&#8208;dependent oxidation reaction of Tyr&#8208;containing substrates promoted by a water&#8208;soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based photosensitizer. The developed procedure converts Tyr&#8208;containing substrates into o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers. The regioselectively formed o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linkage is consistent with dimeric standards prepared using a known enzymatic method. A crossover study with two peptides provides a statistical mixture of three distinct o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers, supporting a mechanism that involves Tyr residue oxidation followed by intermolecular combination.

A crossover study with two peptides provides a statistical mixture of three distinct &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;o&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-Tyr-Tyr linked dimers, supporting a mechanism that involves Tyr residue oxidation followed by intermolecular combination.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Core Steps to the Azaphilone Family of Fungal Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azaphilones are a polyketide&#8208;based family of fungal natural products with a highly oxygenated bicyclic pyrone&#8208;quinone structure, many of which have useful and interesting bioactivities. This minireview reveals the common steps in azaphilone biosynthetic pathways to aid the use of genome mining to identify orphan azaphilone biosynthetic gene clusters.







Abstract
Azaphilones are a family of polyketide&#8208;based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This minireview explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome&#8208;mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis Assisted Discovery of Proline&#8208;Rich Macrocyclic Peptides in Marine Sponges</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting an integrated approach of chemoenzymatic synthesis of standards and HCD&#8208;MSn fragmentation, we have sequenced proline&#8208;rich cyclopeptide natural products from marine sponges. Our MSn fragmentation workflow successfully differentiated between leucine and isoleucine residues in the cyclopeptides and can be used to sequence low abundance cyclic peptides from sub&#8208;gram amounts of sponge biomass.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich macrocyclic peptides (PRMPs) are natural products present in geographically and phylogenetically dispersed marine sponges. The large diversity and low abundance of PRMPs in sponge metabolomes precludes isolation and structure elucidation of each individual PRMP congener. Here, using standards developed via biomimetic enzymatic synthesis of PRMPs, a mass spectrometry&#8208;based workflow to sequence PRMPs was developed and validated to reveal that the diversity of PRMPs in marine sponges is much greater than that has been realized by natural product isolation&#8208;based strategies. Findings are placed in the context of diversity&#8208;oriented transamidative macrocyclization of peptide substrates in sponge holobionts.

         <title>Stacked Thiazole Orange Dyes in DNA Capable of Switching Emissive Behavior in Response to Structural Transitions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;color fluorescent nucleic acids: Nucleic acids possessing multiple thiazole orange (TO) dyes were synthesized and their fluorescent behavior was investigated. The TO&#8208;conjugated DNA showed a spectral change from the typical monomer emission to the excimer&#8208;type red&#8208;shifted emission, which were dependent upon both the state of the DNA structure (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA) and the arrangement of the TO dyes.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids with the capability of generating fluorescence in response to hybridization events, microenvironment or structural changes are valuable as structural probes and chemical sensors. We now demonstrate the enzyme&#8208;assisted preparation of nucleic acids possessing multiple thiazole orange (TO) dyes and their fluorescent behavior, that show a spectral change from the typical monomer emission to the excimer&#8208;type red&#8208;shifted emission. We found that the fluorescent response and emission wavelength of the TO dyes were dependent on both the state of the DNA structure (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA) and the arrangement of the TO dyes. We showed that the fluorescent behavior of the TO dyes can be applied for the detection of RNA molecules, suggesting that our approach for preparing the fluorescent nucleic acids functionalized with multiple TO dyes could be useful to design a fluorescence bioimaging and detection technique of biomolecules.

         <title>The Innate Immune Glycoprotein Lactoferrin Represses the Helicobacter pylori cag Type IV Secretion System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicobacter pylori infection results in enhanced host production of lactoferrin which participates in nutritional immunity and can also serve as a source of nutrient iron for this pathogen, which can repress a major oncogenic virulence factor, the cag T4SS.







Abstract
Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric diseases including gastric cancer. Despite development of a robust immune response, H.&#8197;pylori persists in the gastric niche. Progression of gastric inflammation to serious disease outcomes is associated with infection with H.&#8197;pylori strains which encode the cag Type&#8197;IV Secretion System (cag&#8197;T4SS). The cag T4SS is responsible for translocating the oncogenic protein CagA into host cells and inducing pro&#8208;inflammatory and carcinogenic signaling cascades. Our previous work demonstrated that nutrient iron modulates the activity of the T4SS and biogenesis of T4SS pili. In response to H.&#8197;pylori infection, the host produces a variety of antimicrobial molecules, including the iron&#8208;binding glycoprotein, lactoferrin. Our work shows that apo&#8208;lactoferrin exerts antimicrobial activity against H.&#8197;pylori under iron&#8208;limited conditions, while holo&#8208;lactoferrin enhances bacterial growth. Culturing H.&#8197;pylori in the presence of holo&#8208;lactoferrin prior to co&#8208;culture with gastric epithelial cells, results in repression of the cag&#8197;T4SS activity. Concomitantly, a decrease in biogenesis of cag&#8197;T4SS pili at the host&#8208;pathogen interface was observed under these culture conditions by high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy analyses. Taken together, these results indicate that acquisition of alternate sources of nutrient iron plays a role in regulating the pro&#8208;inflammatory activity of a bacterial secretion system and present novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of H.&#8197;pylori&#8208;related disease.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single synthesis and screening strategy yields covalent inhibitors that inactivate bifunctional DNA polymerase &#946; by modifying lysine residues in different active site domains and prevent DNA binding.







Abstract
DNA polymerase &#946; (Pol &#946;) is a frequently overexpressed and/or mutated bifunctional repair enzyme. Pol &#946; possesses polymerase and lyase active sites, that are employed in two steps of base excision repair. Pol &#946; is an attractive therapeutic target for which there is a need for inhibitors. Two mechanistically inspired covalent inhibitors (1, IC50=21.0&#8197;&#956;M; 9, IC50=18.7&#8197;&#956;M) that modify lysine residues in different Pol &#946; active sites are characterized. Despite modifying lysine residues in different active sites, 1 and 9 inactivate the polymerase and lyase activities of Pol &#946;. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments indicate that they do so by preventing DNA binding. Inhibitors 1 and 9 provide the basis for a general approach to preparing domain selective inhibitors of bifunctional polymerases. Such molecules could prove to be useful tools for studying the role of wild type and mutant forms of Pol &#946; and other polymerases in DNA repair.

         <title>Discovery of the Class I Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide Arcumycin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lasso peptides are a family of natural products that have shown potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. Using a targeted genome mining approach, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides. We validated this approach with the isolation, structural validation, and investigation of bioactivity of a novel class&#8197;I lasso peptide arcumycin.







Abstract
Lasso peptides are a structurally diverse superfamily of conformationally constrained peptide natural products, of which a subset exhibits broad antimicrobial activity. Although advances in bioinformatics have increased our knowledge of strains harboring the biosynthetic machinery for lasso peptide production, relating peptide sequence to bioactivity remains a continuous challenge. To this end, genome mining investigation of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides was performed to correlate predicted structure with antibiotic activity. Bioinformatic evaluation revealed eight putative novel class I lasso peptide sequences. Fermentation of one of these hits, Streptomyces NRRL F&#8208;5639, resulted in the production of a novel class I lasso peptide, arcumycin. Arcumycin exhibited antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis (4&#8197;&#956;g/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL), and Micrococcus luteus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL). Arcumycin treatment of B. subtilis liaI&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal promoter fusion reporter strain resulted in upregulation of the liaRS system by the promoter liaI, indicating arcumycin interferes with lipid&#8197;II biosynthesis. Cumulatively, the results illustrate the relationship between phylogenetically related lasso peptides and their bioactivity as validated through the isolation, structural determination, and evaluation of bioactivity of the novel class&#8197;I antimicrobial lasso peptide arcumycin.

         <title>Preliminary Structural Data Revealed That the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 B.1.617 Variant's RBD Binds to ACE2 Receptor Stronger Than the Wild Type to Enhance the Infectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biomolecular simulation techniques were used in this study to explore the impact of specific mutations in the B.1.617 variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on the binding of receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. The analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic stability, residual flexibility, and structural compactness.







Abstract
The evolution of new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants around the globe has made the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic more worrisome, further pressuring the health care system and immunity. Novel variations that are unique to the receptor&#8208;binding motif (RBM) of the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i.&#8201;e. L452R&#8208;E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R&#8208;E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic&#8208;stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural&#8208;dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Conjugation of a Cationic Metalloporphyrin to BSA and HSA via &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugates: We present a method for the conjugation between alkyne&#8208;functionalized BSA and HSA with a cationic azido&#8208;metalloporphyrin that yields conjugates that possess photodynamic activity when evaluated against human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29). Their natural fluorescent properties allow for determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting their potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
In this study, we present a convenient method for the labelling of tyrosine residues on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) and report for the first time their subsequent bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with porphyrins via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry. We demonstrate that these serum proteins can be labelled with an alkyne&#8208;diazonium heterobifunctional linker and can then undergo chemo&#8208;selective bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with a water&#8208;soluble azido metalloporphyrin via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield protein&#8208;conjugates that retain their photodynamic properties. In our hands, this method was found to be highly reproducible, scalable, and tuneable which allows for the production of bioconjugates where the porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugate not only retains an ability to generate singlet oxygen but possess an enhanced relative singlet oxygen quantum yields relative to the porphyrin alone. Furthermore, we have investigated the photochemical properties of these conjugates through photospectrometric techniques and have determined that the porphyrin macrocycles remain appreciably photostable under light irradiation. Our phototoxic protein&#8208;photosensitizer&#8208;conjugates show excellent photodynamic activity against a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (HT&#8208;29) with cell viabilities of 7.7&#177;0.5&#8201;% (IC50 8.76&#177;2.14&#8197;&#956;M) and 1.7&#177;1.9&#8201;% (IC50 8.48&#177;5.11&#8197;&#956;M) for BSA and HAS, respectively, when irradiated with 20&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of white&#8208;light. Importantly, neither of the conjugates was found to possess any significant &#8220;dark&#8221; toxicity even at concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the natural fluorescent properties of the bioconjugates allowed for the determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting the potential theranostic applications of these unique protein&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugates.

Intracellular delivery of catalase DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells to activate a ROS&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein (RNase A&#8208;NBC) for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and potential cancer treatment.







Abstract
The conditional control of protein function in response to the physiological change of cells is of great interest for studying protein function in biological settings and developing protein therapeutics. We report herein that catalase (CAT) DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells by knocking down catalase expression, which could further activate a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, in&#8197;situ. Using an optimized lipid nanoparticle delivery system to simultaneously introduce CAT DNAzyme and RNase A&#8208;NBC into cells, we show that the pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, could be activated in a significantly enhanced manner to prohibit tumor cell growth in different types of cancer cells. We believe the methodology of regulating pro&#8208;protein activity using DNAzyme biocatalysis to differentiate intracellular environment could further be extended to other functional proteins, and even fundamental investigations in living systems to develop pro&#8208;protein therapeutics.

We believe the methodology of regulating pro-protein activity using DNAzyme biocatalysis to differentiate intracellular environment could further be extended to other functional proteins, and even fundamental investigations in living systems to develop pro-protein therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multicomponent Bioluminescence Imaging with Naphthylamino Luciferins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthylamino luciferins were used for rapid, multi&#8208;component bioluminescent imaging. The analogues were synthesized using a modular route, and activities were measured in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. Mutant luciferases were identified that could differentiate the substrates, and the unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs were compatible with existing bioluminescent probes. These substrates add to the growing set of bioluminescent tools for multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Bioluminescent tools have been used for decades to image processes in complex tissues and preclinical models. However, few distinct probes are available to probe multicellular interactions. We and others are addressing this limitation by engineering new luciferases that can selectively process synthetic luciferin analogues. In this work, we explored naphthylamino luciferins as orthogonal bioluminescent probes. Three analogues were prepared using an optimized synthetic route. The luciferins were found to be robust emitters with native luciferase in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. We further screened the analogues against libraries of luciferase mutants to identify unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs. The new probes can be used in conjunction with existing bioluminescent tools for multi&#8208;component imaging.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor can occur naturally as a constituent of essential oils of several plants, including Cinnamomum camphora, or it can be obtained chemically from optically pure &#945;&#8208;pinene, which itself must be isolated from plants. Camphor is well known for its characteristic pungent odor and health benefits. While (+)&#8208;camphor can be isolated from various natural sources, (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor is more difficult to obtain. In our work, we demonstrate facile enantioselective kinetic resolution of renewable isobornyl esters for the synthesis of the valuable (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hofer, R. Kourist et&#8197;al.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Selenocysteine Incorporation into Proteins by Genetic Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native Sec incorporation is highly species&#8208;dependent, which makes it challenging to express selenoproteins recombinantly. This article reviews recent progress in the method development for selenoprotein production, including the uses of engineered tRNA, allo&#8208;tRNA and Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element as well as genetic code expansion approaches for efficient site&#8208;specific Sec incorporation.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation in vivo is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe the progress in selenoprotein production methodology.

         <title>Approaches to Introduce Helical Structure in Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides with a Bimane Group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical structure can be introduced into short peptides, known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha, by macrocyclization with an inherently fluorescent bimane linker. Alternatively, a bimane&#8208;modification on a cysteine residue stabilises helicity in a tryptophan&#8208;containing, or to a lesser extent, a tyrosine&#8208;containing sequence.







Abstract
An i&#8722;i+4 or i&#8722;i+3 bimane&#8208;containing linker was introduced into a peptide known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), in order to stabilise an &#945;&#8208;helical geometry. These macrocycles were studied by CD and NMR to reveal the i&#8722;i+4 constrained peptide adopts a 310&#8208;helical structure in solution, and an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation on interaction with the ER&#945; coactivator recruitment surface in silico. An acyclic bimane&#8208;modified peptide is also helical, when it includes a tryptophan or tyrosine residue; but is significantly less helical with a phenylalanine or alanine residue, which indicates such a bimane modification influences peptide structure in a sequence dependent manner. The fluorescence intensity of the bimane appears influenced by peptide conformation, where helical peptides displayed a fluorescence increase when TFE was added to phosphate buffer, compared to a decrease for less helical peptides. This study presents the bimane as a useful modification to influence peptide structure as an acyclic peptide modification, or as a side&#8208;chain constraint to give a macrocycle.

         <title>Lessons in Organic Fluorescent Probe Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of molecular science. This review provides an overview of the methods used to discover fluorescent natural products, beginning with classical synthetic approaches. Here, lessons are presented that provide modern examples for classical methods and identify new classics that chart novel avenues for probe discovery. The central focus of this work embodies an understanding of the fundamental properties that guide the development of fluorescent probes and the challenges within their design.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes have gained profound use in biotechnology, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, molecular and cell biology. The development of methods for the translation of fluorophores into fluorescent probes continues to be a robust field for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists, alike. Access to new experimental designs has enabled molecular diversification and led to the identification of new approaches to probe discovery. This review provides a synopsis of the recent lessons in modern fluorescent probe discovery.

         <title>Recent Advances in Bioactive Artificial Ionophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure&#8208;activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.







Abstract
Several life&#8208;threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non&#8208;toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations.

     alt="Recent Advances in Bioactive Artificial Ionophores"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recent progress&lt;/b&gt; in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure-activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several life-threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non-toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations. In addition, their ability to disrupt cellular homeostasis and to alter lysosomal pH endow ionophores as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Overall, critically outlining the advances in artificial ionophores in terms of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ion transport, possible modes of action and biological activities enables us to propose possible future roadmaps in this research area.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advances in Strategies and Tools Available for Interrogation of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New exciting strategies are being used to study and control O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, an overview of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided.







Abstract
The attachment of a single O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of numerous proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and plays an important role as a regulator of various cellular processes in both healthy and disease states. Advances in strategies and tools that allow for the detection of dynamic O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins have helped to enhance our initial and ongoing understanding of its dynamic effects on cellular stimuli and given insights into its link to the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases. Furthermore, chemical genetic strategies and related tools have been successfully applied to a myriad of biological systems with a new level of spatiotemporal and molecular precision. These strategies have started to be used in studying and controlling O&#8208;GlcNAcylation both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, overviews of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided. In addition, chemical genetic strategies that have already been applied or are potentially usable in O&#8208;GlcNAc functional are also discussed.

         <title>Protein Macrocyclization for Tertiary Structure Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein function is often tightly linked to a particular tertiary structure. For many protein applications it is required to stabilize the tertiary structure and prevent unfolding. Here, we summarize strategies that have been used to cyclize expressed proteins aiming for the stabilization of their native fold.







Abstract
Proteins possess unique molecular recognition capabilities and enzymatic activities, features that are usually tied to a particular tertiary structure. To make use of proteins for biotechnological and biomedical purposes, it is often required to enforce their tertiary structure in order to ensure sufficient stability under the conditions inherent to the application of interest. The introduction of intramolecular crosslinks has proven efficient in stabilizing native protein folds. Herein, we give an overview of methods that allow the macrocyclization of expressed proteins, discussing involved reaction mechanisms and structural implications.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), by the fungus Pleurotus sapidus resulted in the formation of two vanilla&#8208;like aroma compounds: The highly valuable piperonal, which is used for the aromatization of different sweets and dairy products, such as chocolate and ice cream, and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde. The conversion was identified as the result of a co&#8208;oxidative reaction catalyzed by a lipoxygenase of P. sapidus in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. More information can be found in the Communication by N.&#8208;K. Krahe et&#8197;al.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane transporters are flexible proteins that cycle between structurally diverse conformations during transport. Yet, little is known about structural ensembles along transport paths, the transition speed between them, and particularly about the coupling between structures and transport. In this review the power of single&#8208;molecule FRET to answer some of these questions is highlighted and key studies on a broad variety of membranes transporters are discussed. More information can be found in the Review by H. Hofmann, C. L&#246;w et&#8197;al.

         <title>Chemoproteomics for Plasmodium Parasite Drug Target Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding drugs&#8217; mechanism of action is integral to successful antimalarial drug development. Recent advances in chemoproteomic methods have created an avenue to globally profile drug targets in the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Some of these strategies even allow direct measurement in living intracellular parasites. The cover feature highlights the achievement of probing the drug&#8211;protein interactome in an intact Plasmodium&#8208;infected erythrocyte. More information can be found in the review article by E.&#8197;R. Derbyshire et&#8197;al.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme engineering for the synthesis of a cosmetic ingredient: The osmolyte 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol is widely applied as a bioactive moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and personal&#8208;care products. It is produced on an industrial scale by exploiting the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of a sucrose phosphorylase, but the enzyme currently used suffers from poor thermostability. A homologous sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable was engineered to drastically improve its catalytic performance for the synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol, enabling the production of this compound at elevated temperatures. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Desmet et&#8197;al.

         <title>Strategies for Covalent Labeling of Long RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating long RNAs: This review discusses currently available approaches for the introduction of reporter groups into large RNA molecules at internal positions in a site&#8208;specific fashion to allow visualization, tracking and structural investigations on long RNAs.







Abstract
The introduction of chemical modifications into long RNA molecules at specific positions for visualization, biophysical investigations, diagnostic and therapeutic applications still remains challenging. In this review, we present recent approaches for covalent internal labeling of long RNAs. Topics included are the assembly of large modified RNAs via enzymatic ligation of short synthetic oligonucleotides and synthetic biology approaches preparing site&#8208;specifically modified RNAs via in&#8197;vitro transcription using an expanded genetic alphabet. Moreover, recent approaches to employ deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) and ribozymes for RNA labeling and RNA methyltransferase based labeling strategies are presented. We discuss the potentials and limits of the individual methods, their applicability for RNAs with several hundred to thousands of nucleotides in length and indicate future directions in the field.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time and Label&#8208;Free Measurement of Deubiquitinase Activity with a MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MspA nanopore is demonstrated as a sensor for discriminating and quantifying various ubiquitin proteins. Real&#8208;time measurement of polymeric ubiquitin chain disassembly by a deubiquitinating enzyme was performed and enzyme kinetics were determined.







Abstract
Covalently attaching ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins as a post&#8208;translational modification can result in altered function of modified proteins. Enzymes regulating Ub as a post&#8208;translational modification, such as ligases and deubiquitinases, are challenging to characterize in part due to the low throughput of in&#8208;vitro assays. Single&#8208;molecule nanopore based assays have the advantage of detecting proteins with high specificity and resolution, and in a label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time fashion. Here we demonstrate the use of a MspA nanopore for discriminating and quantifying Ub proteins. We further applied the MspA pore to measure the Ub&#8208;chain disassembly activity of UCH37, a proteasome associated deubiquitinase. The implementation of this MspA system into nanopore arrays could enable high throughput characterizations of unknown deubiquitinases as well as drug screening against disease related enzymes.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are a valuable tool for upcycling side&#8208;stream from renewable sources. We have found that EstB from Burkholderia gladioli could achieve high enantiopurity in upcycling &#945;&#8208;pinene, a side&#8208;product from turpentine production, whereas common lipases and esterases could not. This reaction can be easily integrated with the existing chemical synthetic route for the production of the racemic camphor with minimal adjustments as the route goes through an intermediate isobornyl acetate.







Abstract
Racemic camphor and isoborneol are readily available as industrial side products, whereas (1R)&#8208;camphor is available from natural sources. Optically pure (1S)&#8208;camphor, however, is much more difficult to obtain. The synthesis of racemic camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene proceeds via an intermediary racemic isobornyl ester, which is then hydrolyzed and oxidized to give camphor. We reasoned that enantioselective hydrolysis of isobornyl esters would give facile access to optically pure isoborneol and camphor isomers, respectively. While screening of a set of commercial lipases and esterases in the kinetic resolution of racemic monoterpenols did not lead to the identification of any enantioselective enzymes, the cephalosporin Esterase B from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB) and Esterase C (EstC) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed outstanding enantioselectivity (E&gt;100) towards the butyryl esters of isoborneol, borneol and fenchol. The enantioselectivity was higher with increasing chain length of the acyl moiety of the substrate. The kinetic resolution of isobornyl butyrate can be easily integrated into the production of camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene and thus allows the facile synthesis of optically pure monoterpenols from a renewable side&#8208;product.

         <title>Metal Complexes as Antiviral Agents for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes for COVID&#8208;19&#8201;targets: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has caused a global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. Herein, metal complexes that have been reported to inhibit various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 enzymes and their proposed mechanism of action are discussed.







Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome &#8211; coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), the infectious agent responsible for COVID&#8208;19 &#8211; has caused more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide and triggered a global pandemic. Even with successful vaccines being delivered, there is an urgent need for novel treatments to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and other emerging viral diseases. While several organic small molecule drug candidates are in development, some effort has also been devoted towards the application of metal complexes as potential antiviral agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Herein, the metal complexes that have been reported to show antiviral activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 or one of its target proteins are described and their proposed mechanisms of action are discussed.

         <title>Substrate Protection in Controlled Enzymatic Transformation of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly specific enzymes make protecting groups unnecessary in biology but some enzymes including proteases and kinases have multiple biological substrates and there is strong interest to stop a specific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction without inhibiting the enzyme itself. Recent developments in peptide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles allow precise protection of peptide substrates and open up previously impossible ways to manipulate enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Proteins are involved in practically every single biological process. The many enzymes involved in their synthesis, cleavage, and posttranslational modification (PTM) carry out highly specific tasks with no usage of protecting groups. Yet, the chemists&#8217; strategy of protection/deprotection potentially can be highly useful, for example, when a specific biochemical reaction catalyzed by a broad&#8208;specificity enzyme needs to be inhibited, during infection of cells by enveloped viruses, in the invasion and spread of cancer cells, and upon mechanistic investigation of signal&#8208;transduction pathways. Doing so requires highly specific binding of peptide substrates in aqueous solution with biologically competitive affinities. Recent development of peptide&#8208;imprinted cross&#8208;linked micelles allows such protection and affords previously impossible ways of manipulating peptides and proteins in enzymatic transformations.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of promiscuous halide methyltransferases enables the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues from alkyl iodides and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine. This facilitates the synthesis of analogues with alkyl groups larger than methyl groups, which can readily be used by methyltransferases. These processes provide access to diverse alkylated products with altered bioactivities, expanding the synthetic potential of methyltransferases. We expect a toolbox of protein&#8208;engineered halide methyltransferase variants to pave the way towards versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The evolution of promiscuous halide methyltransferases&lt;/b&gt; enables the enzymatic synthesis of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-methionine analogues from alkyl iodides and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-homocysteine. This facilitates the synthesis of analogues with alkyl groups larger than methyl groups, which can readily be used by methyltransferases. These processes provide access to diverse alkylated products with altered bioactivities, expanding the synthetic potential of methyltransferases. We expect a toolbox of protein-engineered halide methyltransferase variants to pave the way towards versatile chemo- and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.
