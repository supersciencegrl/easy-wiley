         <title>Noncanonical Functions of Ketosynthase Domains in Type I Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ketosynthase (KS) domain plays a central role in the biosynthesis of polyketide natural products. This work reviews the diverse functions of type I PKS KS domains in natural product biosynthesis, including canonical Claisen condensation and noncanonical reactions, such as decarboxylation, acyl transfer, Dickmann condensation, Micheal addition, C&#8722;N bond formation, aldol&#8208;lactonization bicyclization and decarbonylation.







Abstract
Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are remarkable molecular machines that can synthesize structurally complex polyketide natural products with a wide range of biological activities. In these molecular machines, ketosynthase (KS) domains play a central role, typically by catalyzing decarboxylative Claisen condensation for polyketide chain extension. Noncanonical KS domains with catalytic functions rather than Claisen condensation have increasingly been evidenced, further demonstrating the capability of type I PKSs for structural diversity. This review provides an overview of the reactions involving unusual KS activities, including PKS priming, acyl transfer, Dieckmann condensation, Michael addition, aldol&#8208;lactonization bicyclization, C&#8722;N bond formation and decarbonylation. Insights into these reactions can deepen the understanding of PKS&#8208;based assembly line chemistry and guide the efforts for rational engineering of polyketide&#8208;related molecules.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Multiplexed Assessment of Aromatic Prenyltransferase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate promiscuity of a panel of diverse aromatic prenyltransferases is assessed through a rapid substrate&#8208;multiplexed screen. PriB is identified as a remarkably promiscuous enzyme relative to other well&#8208;studied prenyltransferases. We further identify a new thermostable prenyltransferase with high activity that is suitable for future biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
An increasingly effective strategy to identify synthetically useful enzymes is to sample the diversity already present in Nature. Here, we construct and assay a panel of phylogenetically diverse aromatic prenyltransferases (PTs). These enzymes catalyze a variety of C&#8722;C bond forming reactions in natural product biosynthesis and are emerging as tools for synthetic chemistry and biology. Homolog screening was further empowered through substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening, which provides direct information on enzyme specificity. We perform a head&#8208;to&#8208;head assessment of the model members of the PT family and further identify homologs with divergent sequences that rival these superb enzymes. This effort revealed the first bacterial O&#8722;Tyr PT and, together, provide valuable benchmarking for future synthetic applications of PTs.

         <title>Mono&#8208;Palmitoyl&#8208;N&#8208;Alkylurea Ligands as Specific Activators of Human Toll&#8208;Like Receptor 2/6 Heterodimer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The derivatives of the synthetic hTLR2 agonist mini&#8208;UPam were synthesized and biologically evaluated to explore its TLR heterodimer specificity. Mini&#8208;Upam is similar to the well&#8208;known immunostimulatory lipopeptide Pam2CysSK4, which is a potential adjuvant for synthetic vaccines. Our research shows that mini&#8208;UPam and its more lipophilic alkylurea derivatives require the heterodimer hTLR2/hTLR6, rather than hTLR2/hTLR1, to exert their immunostimulatory activity.







Abstract
Ligands for Toll&#8208;like&#8208;receptor 2 (TLR2) have demonstrated significant potential as immune&#8208;stimulating components in synthetic vaccines. Activation of TLR2 relies on the formation of dimeric complexes with either TLR1 or TLR6 and the nature of these dimers can impact therapeutic outcomes. The lipopeptide&#8208;based TLR2 ligands Pam3CysSK4 and Pam2CysSK4 have been extensively studied, and their recognition by different TLR&#8208;receptor heterodimers, TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6, respectively, has been established. However, the high lipophilicity of these ligands, containing multiple palmitoyl residues, can result in solubility issues when used as vaccine adjuvants. To address this, we previously synthesized a less lipophilic ligand containing a single palmitoyl chain called mini&#8208;UPam, which effectively stimulates human moDC maturation. We here probe the receptor&#8208;dimer specificity of several mini&#8208;Upam derivatives and reveal that these mini&#8208;UPam are hTLR2/TLR6 selective ligands and that the introduction of longer urea alkyl chains does not shift the binding specificity to hTLR2/TLR1 heterodimers, in contrast to their Pam2CysSK4 and Pam3CysSK4 counterparts, pointing to a different binding mode of the UPam ligands.

         <title>Sequence Context in DNA i&#8208;Motifs Can Nurture Very Stable and Persistent Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA i&#8208;motifs adjacent to duplex form kinetically trapped partially folded species. The species are well resolved on thermal melting curves. In this work, we study dynamics of partial folds and ways to control fully folded population.







Abstract
I&#8208;motifs are non&#8208;canonical DNA structures with recognized biological significance and a proven utility in material engineering. Consequently, understanding and control of i&#8208;motif properties is essential to sustain progress across both disciplines. In this work, we systematically investigate how proximity to the most common form of DNA, a double&#8208;stranded duplex, influences the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of adjacent i&#8208;motifs. We demonstrate that double&#8208;stranded stems in i&#8208;motif loops promote kinetic trapping of very stable and persistent partially folded conformations. Further, we investigate pathways toward rational control over a folding topology makeup.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Protein Degradation by Smart PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart PROTACs can be activated at the site of diseased tissue in response to specific stimuli, such as GSH, ROS, hypoxia, light, and X&#8208;ray radiation. This enables controllable PROTAC function for precision therapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic modality in drug discovery. PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that effectively bridge proteins of interest (POIs) with E3 ubiquitin ligases, such that, the target proteins are tagged with ubiquitin and subsequently degraded via the proteasome. Despite significant progress in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), the application of conventional PROTAC degraders still faces significant challenges, including systemic toxicity induced by non&#8208;tissue&#8208;specific targeting. To address this issue, a variety of smart PROTACs that can be activated by specific stimuli, have been developed for achieving conditional and spatiotemporal modulation of protein levels. Here, on the basis of our contributions, we overview recent advances of smart PROTACs, including tumor microenvironment&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;responsive PROTACs, that enable controllable TPD. The design strategy, case studies, potential applications and challenges will be focused on.

         <title>An Expanded Substrate Spectrum of Sulfide:Quinone Oxidoreductase Found in Pollutant Degrading Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfide:qunione oxidoreductase (Sqr) reaction generates reactive sulfur species (RSS), coupling sulfide oxidation and CoQ reduction. Thiols as nucleophiles attack the disulfide bridge, and sulfur transfers to a thiophilic acceptor (Acc&#8722;) such as GSH or another thiol. The variants of key residues and the flexible linker fused RHOD (Rhodanese) with FadH2 (Sqr), likely facilitating sulfur transfer and modulating RSS pool.







Abstract
Sulfide:Quinone Oxidoreductase (Sqr) Catalyzes The Initial Procedure On Sulfide Transformation, Alongside Sulfide (H2S, S2&#8722;) Oxidization Coupled With Coenzyme Q (Coq) Reducing And Reactive Sulfur Species (RSS) Production. Here, We Assessed The Reactivity Of Propanethiol (PT) As An Alternative Substrate For Sqr To Maintain Intracellular Homeostasis In Strain S&#8208;1 Capable Of Degrading Emerging Sulfur&#8208;Containing Pollutants. We Deleted A Gene Encoding Sqr, And Serial Transcriptional Difference Induced By RSS Dynamics Was Therefore Revealed. Next, The Reaction Properties Of Two Sqr Homologs From Strains JMP134 And S&#8208;1 Were Comparatively Characterized, Respectively. As A Result, An Additional Role Of Sqr In Yielding RSS From PT Was Found In Reaction Mixture Prepared By Cell&#8208;Free Extracts Or Purified Enzymes. Interestingly, The Transformation Velocity Of PT By Sqr Was Slower Than That Of Sulfides. From This Scenario, It Was A Rate&#8208;Determining Step That PT As A Nucleophilic Compound Can Be Added Into Sqr Cysteine To Form Disulfide Bond And Likely Serve Nonoptimal Sulfur Recipient. In Addition, The Role Of Persulfidation Driven By RSS In Combating Oxidative And Sulfur Stresses Required To Be Further Clarified. Nevertheless, This Promiscuity Of Sqr&#8208;Binding Organosulfur Compounds And Its Catalytic Modulation Underscored That Expanded Substrates Might Benefit Sulfide Homeostasis In Thiol&#8208;Degrading Bacteria.

         <title>In vivo and in vitro Reconstitution of Biosynthesis of N&#8208;Prenylated Phenazines Revealing Diverse Phenazine&#8208;Modifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for natural phenazines. The class II terpene cyclase Pzm1 catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form monocyclic FPP. The prenyltransferases PzmP and LavP function as the N&#8208;prenyltransferases of the phenazine&#8208;backbone, followed by the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the flavin monooxygenases PzmS and LavS to yield phenazinomycin and lavanducyanin, respectively.







Abstract
Phenazine natural products play various roles such as signal molecules, antibiotics, or electron carriers in their producer strains. Among these products, phenazinomycin and lavanducyanin, which are produced by Streptomyces species, are characterized by an N&#8208;alkyl modification. Herein, we established the biosynthetic pathways for these two phenazine natural products. Gene&#8208;disruption experiments and in&#8197;vitro reconstitution of the phenazine&#8208;tailoring pathway revealed the late steps of the biosynthetic pathway of the phenazines. The class II terpene cyclase homolog Pzm1 catalyzes the cyclization reaction of farnesyl diphosphate to form monocyclic farnesyl diphosphate. Additionally, the prenyltransferase homolog PzmP functions as the N&#8208;prenyltransferase of 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid. The flavin monooxygenase homolog PzmS catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of prenylated 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid to yield phenazinomycin. This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for phenazine natural products.

         <title>Human 8&#8208;Oxoguanine Glycosylase OGG1 Cleaves Abasic Sites and Covalently Conjugates to 3&#8242;&#8208;DNA Termini via Cysteine and Histidine Addition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human 8&#8208;oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) reacts with the most frequently generated DNA lesion, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, to form covalent DNA&#8208;protein cross&#8208;links (OGG1&#8208;DPCs). Using a battery of biochemical experiments and mass spectrometry, we determined that OGG1&#8208;DPCs result from cysteine and histidine addition to incised AP sites at 3&#8242;&#8208;DNA termini.







Abstract
8&#8208;Oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) repairs the major oxidative DNA damage, 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine. It has been reported that OGG1 incises the most frequently formed DNA lesion, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, and in the process a stable DNA&#8208;OGG1 cross&#8208;link is formed. However, the chemical structure of the adduct is not characterized. Here, we report that DNA&#8208;OGG1 cross&#8208;links result from cysteine and histidine addition to incised AP sites at 3&#8242;&#8208;DNA termini.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase Catalysis Mediated by Type I Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study evaluated the light&#8208;driven oxidation of PASC using LPMOs mediated by typical photodynamic therapy (PDT) photosensitizers. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Type I PDT methylene blue (MB) photosensitizer irradiated by light was able to fuel LPMO reaction even without addition of the chemical reducing agents. Using MB and porphyrin as models, we demonstrated that the LPMO peroxigenase reaction can only be driven by Type I, but not Type II, light&#8208;irradiated photosensitizers.







Abstract
The use of light as abundant, renewable, and clean energy source to boost lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) reactions represents an exciting and yet under&#8208;explored opportunity. Herein we demonstrated that photosensitizers, commonly used in photodynamic therapy, which act through the photocatalytic Type I mechanism can drive the oxidation of PASC by LPMOs, whereas Type II photosensitizers are not capable of promoting the LPMO activity. We analyzed Type I and Type II photosensitizers (methylene blue and tetraiodide salt of meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridyl) porphyrin, respectively) and demonstrated that, even without an addition of external reductant, Type I was capable of boosting Thermothelomyces thermophila MtLPMO9A activity in the presence of light. We also evaluated the photobiosystem in the presence and/or absence of molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and investigated the role of superoxide radical in the methylene blue fueled reactions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3), a chemical scavenger of H2O2, acts by safeguarding the enzyme from oxidative damage caused by accumulation of H2O2 early in photosensitizer&#8208;driven LPMO reactions. Finally, the results of the present work demonstrated that light&#8208;driven LPMO reactions mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) Type I photosensitizers, which also includes molecules such as curcumin and riboflavin, is a general phenomenon.

         <title>The Anti&#8208;Cancer Stem Cell Properties of Copper(II)&#8208;Terpyridine Complexes with Attached Salicylaldehyde Moieties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reports on the anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes are relatively sparse. Here the synthesis, characterisation, and anti&#8208;breast CSC activity of two new copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes with bidentate salicylaldehyde moieties is reported. Insight into the solution stability and the cytotoxic mechanism of action of the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes is also provided.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterisation, and anti&#8208;breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of two copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes with bidentate salicylaldehyde moieties (2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde for 1 and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde for 2). The copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 are stable in biologically relevant aqueous solutions and display micromolar potency towards breast CSCs. The most effective complex 1 is 5&#8208;fold and 6.6&#8208;fold more potent towards breast CSCs than salinomycin and cisplatin, respectively. The copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 also decrease the formation and viability of three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres within the micromolar range. Notably complex 1 is up to 7&#8208;fold more potent towards mammospheres than salinomycin or cisplatin. Mechanistic studies suggest that the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 are able to readily enter breast CSCs, elevate intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, induce DNA damage (presumably by oxidative DNA cleavage), and evoke apoptosis that is independent of caspases. This study shows that the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine motif is a useful building block for the design of anti&#8208;breast CSC agents and reinforces the therapeutic potential of copper coordination complexes.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis, characterisation, and anti-breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of two copper(II)-terpyridine complexes with bidentate salicylaldehyde moieties (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). The copper(II)-terpyridine complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are stable in biologically relevant aqueous solutions and display micromolar potency towards breast CSCs. The most effective complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is 5-fold and 6.6-fold more potent towards breast CSCs than salinomycin and cisplatin, respectively. The copper(II)-terpyridine complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; also decrease the formation and viability of three-dimensionally cultured mammospheres within the micromolar range. Notably complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is up to 7-fold more potent towards mammospheres than salinomycin or cisplatin. Mechanistic studies suggest that the copper(II)-terpyridine complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are able to readily enter breast CSCs, elevate intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, induce DNA damage (presumably by oxidative DNA cleavage), and evoke apoptosis that is independent of caspases. This study shows that the copper(II)-terpyridine motif is a useful building block for the design of anti-breast CSC agents and reinforces the therapeutic potential of copper coordination complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Modification of Protein by Chemical Probe in Living Cells for Structural and Interaction Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we summarize membrane&#8208;permeable chemical probes targeting cysteine, lysine, tyrosine, histidine, methionine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, and their applications with protein mass spectrometry for the intracellular studies of protein structural conformations and biomolecular interactions.







Abstract
Cellular activities are predominantly carried out by proteins that can dynamically adopt different structural conformations and differentially interact with other biomolecules according to cellular needs. Chemical probes are small molecules used to selectively interact and modulate the activities of specific proteins to study their functions such as the validation of potential drug targets. The remarkable performance of AlphaFold algorithms in the prediction of protein structures has pivoted interest toward elucidating the intracellular dynamics of protein structural conformation where covalent modification of proteins by chemical probes could be used to shed light upon. However, due to the barrier to entry by cell membrane and the general unfavorable reactive conditions of the intracellular environment, most studies using reactive chemical probes are still conducted on purified proteins and cell lysates. Nevertheless, recent progresses have been made in designing chemical probes with improved membrane permeability, stability and reactivity. This paper surveys the literature on recent advancements in membrane&#8208;permeable chemical probes and their applications with protein mass spectrometry for the intracellular studies of protein structural conformations and biomolecular interactions.

         <title>Photoswitchable Detergents for Light&#8208;Controlled Liposome Lysis and Channel Gating</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable detergents provide an additional opportunity for spatiotemporal membrane modulation alongside photolipids. Here, we describe three classes of visible light&#8208;sensitive surfactants with azobenzene tails. The detergents enabled the light&#8208;induced vesicle rupture as well as spatiotemporal activation of a mechanosensitive channel and expand the toolbox for photostimulation of membranes.







Abstract
Modulation of membrane properties via photoswitchable lipids has attracted attention due to the unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of their functional control. Beside lipids, detergents are another prominent class for selective membrane perturbations owing to their ease of handling and spontaneous insertion in lipid bilayers. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of three classes of visible light&#8208;sensitive surfactants with various azobenzene tail chain lengths. The photoswitchable detergents show water&#8208;solubility and micellization as well as undergo reversible isomerization under blue&#8208;/green light illumination. We demonstrate that the light&#8208;induced structural change of azobenzene can lead to vesicle rupture, making them a tool for controlled cargo release from vehicles. Via spontaneous insertion into the plasma membrane of mammalian cells transiently transfected with MscL, we used the azobenzene&#8208;derived detergents to optically activate the transmembrane mechanosensitive channel. This led to the rapid controlled uptake of membrane&#8208;impermeable molecules. Since detergents are extensively used in biochemistry and biotechnology, we propose that the photoswitchable detergents will be useful tools for the spatiotemporal modulation of membrane properties. Additionally, our work provides a design strategy for new detergents in membrane (protein) research.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Based Discovery of New Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) show biotechnological promise by producing alka(e)nes from natural fatty acids. Using a cavity based search, 30 distant or unrelated enzymes with potential FAP&#8208;activity were identified either from the PDB&#8216;s flavoproteins of from homology models. Docking experiments and in&#8197;vitro characterization led to the discovery of four photodecarboxylases.







Abstract
Light&#8208;dependent fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) hold significant potential for biotechnology, due to their capability to produce alka(e)nes directly from the corresponding (un)saturated natural fatty acids requiring light as the only reagent. This study expands the family of FAPs through cavity&#8208;based enzyme discovery methods. Thirty enzyme candidates with potential photodecarboxylation activity were identified by matching the cavities of four related template structures against the Protein Data Bank's flavoproteins, a library of proteins identified via the Foldseek Search Server, and homology models of sequences resulting from BLAST. Subsequent docking experiments narrowed this library to ten promising enzymes, which were expressed and assessed in&#8197;vitro, identifying four photodecarboxylases. Out of these enzymes, the GMC oxidoreductase from Coccomyxa sp. Obi (CoFAP) was characterized in detail, which revealed high activity in the decarboxylation reactions of palmitic acid and octanoic acid and a broad pH tolerance (pH&#8197;6.5&#8211;9.5).

         <title>Determinants of Product Outcome in Two Sesquiterpene Synthases from the Thermotolerant Bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nerolidol synthase (NerS) and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene synthase (BerS) from the thermotolerant bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans were characterised using a combined computational and experimental approach. An isomerisation step early in the reaction cascade was found to be a key determinant of product outcome, and NerS was found to possess catalytic activity up to 55&#8201;&#176;C. Mutagenesis of BerS yielded two variants with improved product titres and altered reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Rubrobacter radiotolerans nerolidol synthase (NerS) and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene synthase (BerS) are among the first terpene synthases (TPSs) discovered from thermotolerant bacteria, and, despite sharing the same substrate, make terpenoid products with different carbon scaffolds. Here, the potential thermostability of NerS and BerS was investigated, and NerS was found to retain activity up to 55&#8201;&#176;C. A library of 22 NerS and BerS variants was designed to probe the differing reaction mechanisms of NerS and BerS, including residues putatively involved in substrate sequestration, cation&#8208;&#960; stabilisation of reactive intermediates, and shaping of the active site contour. Two BerS variants showed improved in&#8197;vivo titres vs the WT enzyme, and also yielded different ratios of the related sesquiterpenoids (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;farnesene and trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene. BerS&#8722;L86F was proposed to encourage substrate isomerisation by cation&#8208;&#960; stabilisation of the first cationic intermediate, resulting in a greater proportion of trans&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bergamotene. By contrast, BerS&#8722;S82L significantly preferred (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;farnesene formation, attributed to steric blocking of the isomerisation step, consistent with what has been observed in several plant TPSs. Our work highlights the importance of isomerisation as a key determinant of product outcome in TPSs, and shows how a combined computational and experimental approach can characterise TPSs and variants with improved and altered functionality.

Bis (cholesterol&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether)&#8208;pillar[5]arene compound 1 has been successfully synthesized through a click reaction, which could spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers to form ion channel and show significant transport activity of K+ superior to Na+.







Abstract
In this study, we have successfully synthesized bis (cholesterol&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether)&#8208;pillar[5]arene compound 1 through a click reaction, which could spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers to form ion channel due to the membrane anchor cholesterol group and show significant transport activity of K+ superior to Na+, with a permeability ratio of K+/Na+ equal to 4.58. Compound 1 two crown ether modules act as selective filters similar to natural K+ channel, which are determined to 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 binding stoichiometry to K+ by Job's plot and NMR titration. This structurally unambiguously unimolecule artificial channel provides ideas for constructing highly K+/Na+ selective molecular filters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we have successfully synthesized bis (cholesterol-dibenzo-18-crown-6-ether)-pillar[5]arene compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; through a click reaction, which could spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers to form ion channel due to the membrane anchor cholesterol group and show significant transport activity of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; superior to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with a permeability ratio of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; equal to 4.58. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; two crown ether modules act as selective filters similar to natural K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, which are determined to 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 binding stoichiometry to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by Job's plot and NMR titration. This structurally unambiguously unimolecule artificial channel provides ideas for constructing highly K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selective molecular filters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Second Methylation in Psilocybin Biosynthesis Is Enabled by a Hydrogen Bonding Network Extending into the Secondary Sphere Surrounding the Methyltransferase Active Site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

M at work: PsiM is the methyltransferase that completes psilocybin biosynthesis in magic mushrooms. Crystal structures and kinetic analyses of the wild type enzyme and two engineered variants provided profound insight into why the residue Asn247 is key for PsiM's capability to dimethylate.







Abstract
The Psilocybe cubensis SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferase, PsiM, catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of psilocybin. Likely evolved from monomethylating RNA methyltransferases, PsiM acquired a key amino acid exchange in the secondary sphere of the active site, M247&#8197;N, which is responsible for its capacity to dimethylate. Two variants, PsiMN247M and PsiMN247A, were generated to further examine the role of Asn247 for mono&#8208; and dimethylation in PsiM. Herein, we present the kinetic profiles of both variants and crystal structures at resolutions between 0.9 and 1.0&#8197;&#197;. Each variant was crystallized as a ternary complex with the non&#8208;methylated acceptor substrate, norbaeocystin and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine, and in a second complex with the cofactor analog, sinefungin, and the monomethylated substrate, baeocystin. Consistent with the inability of the variants to catalyze a second methyl transfer, these structures reveal catalytically non&#8208;productive conformations and a high level of disorder of the methylamine group of baeocystin. Additionally, both variants exhibit destabilization in the &#946;5&#8208;&#946;7 sheets and a conserved &#946;&#8208;turn of the core Rossmann fold, causing 20&#8208;fold reduced substrate binding and 2&#8208;fold lower catalytic efficiency even with norbaeocystin. Our structural and kinetic analyses of the variants suggest that Asn247 is essential to allow enough space in the active site for multiple methylations while also participating in a network of hydrogen bonds that stabilizes secondary structure elements in the immediate vicinity of the active site for optimal methylation of norbaeocystin.

         <title>Amide Synthesis from Decarboxylative Coupling of Isocyanates and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative coupling between carboxylic acids and isocyanates to prepare amides is reviewed. Complementary to the classical carboxylic acid/amine reaction, this protocol does not require the activation of carboxylic acid, thus providing new solutions to the problems caused by the carboxylic acid activation strategy.







Abstract
Isocyanates are versatile electrophiles that can react with a wide range of nucleophiles to afford important organic structures. Although the reactions between isocyanates and alcohols, amines and organometallic reagents have been well established, the synthesis of amides through the decarboxylative condensation of carboxylic acids and isocyanates is less appreciated. In this review, the synthesis of isocyanates and its application on amide synthesis through the condensation with carboxylic acids are summarized and discussed. It is our hope that this review will attract more attention to this less mentioned transformation and inspire new developments in the fields of organic synthesis, polymer synthesis and chemical biology.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Folding in a Dopamine&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding and ligand&#8208;induced structure formation of a dopamine&#8208;binding DNA aptamer as a function of stem length is reported. All constructs show folding with ligand binding, but only aptamers with a short stem are functional biosensors.







Abstract
Aptamers are often employed as molecular recognition elements in the development of different types of biosensors. Many of these biosensors take advantage of the aptamer having a ligand&#8208;induced structure&#8208;formation binding mechanism. However, this binding mechanism is poorly understood. Here we use isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to study the binding and ligand&#8208;induced structural change exhibited by a dopamine&#8208;binding DNA aptamer. We analysed a series of aptamers where we shorten the terminal stem that contains the 5' and 3' termini of the aptamer sequence. All aptamers bind dopamine in an enthalpically driven process coupled with an unfavorable entropy. A general trend of the aptamer having a weaker binding affinity is observed as the terminal stem is shortened. For all aptamers studied, numerous signals appear in the imino region of the 1H NMR spectrum indicating that new structure forms with ligand binding. However, it is only when this region of structure formation in the aptamer is brought close to the sensor surface that we obtain a functional electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.

         <title>Selenium(II)&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Chemistry: A Good Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Parallel Synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded Library Synthesis and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry involves a nucleophilic substitution, in which the nitrogen at the electrophilic selenium(II) center is replaced by a suitable nucleophile, facilitating the flexible and efficient formation of linkages around the Se(II) core.







Abstract
The continuous development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is crucial for advancing the frontiers of click chemistry. Selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry, a versatile chemistry in click chemistry, represents an all&#8208;encompassing term for nucleophilic substitution events that replace nitrogen at an electrophilic selenium(II) center, enabling the flexible and efficient assembly of linkages around a Se(II) core. Several SeNEx chemistries have been developed inspired by the biochemical reaction between Ebselen and cysteine residue, and demonstrated significant potential in on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, selenium&#8208;containing DNA&#8208;encoded library (SeDEL) synthesis, as well as peptide and protein bioconjugation. This concept aims to present the origins, advancements, and applications of selenium(II)&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry while also outlining the potential directions for future research in this field.

         <title>Mitochondrial viscosity probes:&#160;iridium(III) complexes induce apoptosis in HeLa cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial viscosity has emerged as a promising biomarker for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, yet accurately measuring viscosity at the subcellular level remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized and characterized three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8208;Ir3) containing 5&#8208;fluorouracil derivatives as&#160;ligands. Among these, Ir1&#160;selectively induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered a cascade of events leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of Ir1&#160;demonstrated high sensitivity to intracellular viscosity changes, enabling real&#8208;time fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of cellular micro&#8208;viscosity during apoptosis. These findings underscore the potential of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for&#160;both therapeutic and diagnostic applications at the subcellular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Insights into the Reaction Mechanisms of Non&#8208;Heme Diiron Enzymes Containing Oxoiron(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxoiron(IV) complexes are key intermediates in the catalytic reactions of some non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. These enzymes, across various subfamilies, activate dioxygen to generate high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo species, which, in turn, drive the activation of substrates and mediate a variety of challenging oxidative transformations. In this review, we summarize the structures, formation mechanisms, and functions of high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo intermediates &#160;in eight representative diiron enzymes (sMMO, RNR, ToMO, MIOX, PhnZ, SCD1, AlkB, and SznF) spanning five subfamilies. We also categorize and analyze the structural and mechanistic differences among these enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Antimycobacterial Evaluation of Novel Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazolines and Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazole&#8208;enaminones are suitable starting materials for the regioselective synthesis of pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines and the respective pyrazole&#8208;isoxazoles, obtained in excellent yields. The obtained bi&#8208;heterocycles are potential antimycobacterial agents, as they show significant inhibition of bacterial growth with a time&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent bactericidal effect. Both series of compounds show positive in&#8197;vitro profiles, without altering cell viability, NO production or dsDNA release.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of a new series of pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines, at very good yields, from the cyclocondensation reaction of pyrazole&#8208;enaminones with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Dehydration of the pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines furnished another new series of the respective pyrazole&#8208;isoxazoles, at excellent yields. Both series of the obtained compounds were screened for antimycobacterial activity, and compounds 4&#8201;f and 5&#8201;c showed significant inhibition of bacterial growth with a time&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent bactericidal effect. Cytotoxicity tests in VERO cell line did not indicate toxicity of compounds 4&#8201;f and 5&#8201;c regarding cellular prediction, NO production or dsDNA release. However, both compounds were associated with an increase in total ROS levels, providing induction of oxidative stress, but without compromising cellular targets. These results highlight compounds 4&#8201;f and 5&#8201;c as promising candidates for antimycobacterial treatment with a favorable safety profile.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on the Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Interaction with Clicked Peptide&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates: a Vision Toward the Detection of A&#946; Peptides in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three porphyrin&#8208;peptide conjugates have been synthesized by copper catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and their interaction with A&#946;42 investigated using different experimental techniques. The zinc containing peptide conjugate can evoke an induced dichroic signal upon its interaction with A&#946;42. The peptide systems are not cytotoxic and can be taken up by differentiated SH&#8208;SY&#8208;5Y cells.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial form of dementia mainly affecting people in the elderly, but no effective cure is available. According to the amyloid hypothesis the aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric toxic species is believed to concur with the onset and progression of the disease heavily. By using a click chemistry approach, we conjugated a suitable designed peptide sequence to a metalloporphyrin moiety to obtain three hybrid peptide systems to be studied for their interaction with Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides. The aim is to get new tools for the diagnosis and therapy in AD. The results described in this study, which were obtained through spectroscopic techniques (UV&#8208;Vis, CD, bis&#8208;Ans and intrinsic porphyrin Fluorescence), Microfluidics (GCI) and cell biology (MTT, Live cell imaging and flow cytometry), reveal interesting features about the structure&#8208;activity relationships connecting these conjugates with the interaction with A&#946;, as well as on their potential use as sensing systems. In our opinion the data reported in this paper make the porphyrin&#8208;peptide conjugates highly compelling for further exploration as spectroscopic probes to detect A&#946; biomarkers in biological fluids.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformation for the Preparation of Chromopyrrolic Acid and 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;Chromopyrrolic Acid in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a combination of two enzymes (LaStaO/LzrO and VioB) into the E. coli strain, a whole&#8208;cell biotransformation method was developed. Chromopyrrolic acid and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid could be produced in hundred milligram per liter level by feeding L&#8208;tryptophan and 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, respectively, to the working culture or phosphate buffer&#8208;resuspended culture.







Abstract
Chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) and its congeners are important intermediates for the biosynthesis and synthesis of various dimeric tryptophan natural products. We have constructed two E. coli strains (CPA001/CPA002) harboring a single plasmid carrying genes coding for a combination of two enzymes (LaStaO/LzrO and VioB) that are able to convert L&#8208;tryptophan (L&#8208;Trp)/5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryotophan (5&#8208;Cl&#8722;L&#8208;Trp) to chromopyrrolic acid (CPA)/5,5&#8217;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid (5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA). Effect on the production of CPA were evaluated by varying the parameters of strain cultivation and biotransformation process. Under the optimized conditions, up to 325&#8197;mg/L of CPA and 275&#8197;mg/L of 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA could be obtained by supplementing L&#8208;Trp and 5&#8208;Cl&#8722;L&#8208;Trp, respectively, to a working culture of CPA001, or to a phosphate buffer&#8208;resuspended culture of CPA002. The practicability of this whole&#8208;cell biotransformation system could also be served as a potential platform for the preparation of CPA congeners.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Modification of Native IgGs with Flexible Drug&#8208;Load</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ADC generation from native IgG: using short, positively charged peptides like RAK enables the direct modification of IgG at the glutamine Q295 without the need for engineering. Using azide&#8208; and thiol&#8208;group containing RAK, the generation of ADCs with different drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios (DARs) is demonstrated and their properties analyzed in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo.







Abstract
Homogeneous, site&#8208;specifically conjugated antibodies have shown to result in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with improved efficacy and tolerability compared to stochastically conjugated ADCs. However, precisely controlling the drug load as well as attaching multiple payload moieties to the antibody remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the simple and direct modification of native IgG&#8208;antibodies at the residue glutamine 295 (Q295) without the need for any protein engineering with flexible drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios of one or multiple payloads. The conjugation is enabled through short, positively charged lysine containing peptides and native, commercially available microbial transglutaminase. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, HER2&#8208;targeting ADCs based on trastuzumab were generated with drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios (DARs) of 2 and 4 of the same or different payloads using orthogonal conjugation chemistries. Quantitative biodistribution studies performed with 111In&#8208;radiolabeled conjugates showed high tumour uptake and low accumulation of radioactivity in non&#8208;targeted tissues. A single dose study of trastuzumab conjugated to the highly potent payload &#945;&#8208;Amanitin demonstrated complete and long&#8208;lasting tumour remission and was well&#8208;tolerated at all dose levels tested.

         <title>A Single Interfacial Point Mutation Rescues Solution Structure Determination of the Complex of HMG&#8208;D with a DNA Bulge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Line&#8208;broadening due to intermediate rate dynamics within an interface can confound NMR structure determination of complexes. In this study, a carefully selected point mutation was shown to rescue the NMR properties of such a system, a complex of the protein HMG&#8208;D with a dA2 bulge DNA ligand designed to mimic a natural bend, allowing high&#8208;resolution structure determination to succeed and correcting a previously proposed structural model.







Abstract
Broadening of signals from atoms at interfaces can often be a limiting factor in applying solution NMR to the structure determination of complexes. Common contributors to such problems include exchange between free and bound states and the increased molecular weight of complexes relative to the free components, but another cause that can be more difficult to deal with occurs when conformational dynamics within the interface takes place at an intermediate rate on the chemical shift timescale. In this work we show how a carefully chosen mutation in the protein HMG&#8208;D rescued such a situation, making possible high&#8208;resolution structure determination of its complex with a dA2 bulge DNA ligand designed to mimic a natural DNA bend, and thereby revealing a new spatial organization of the complex.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Discovery of Substrate Peptide Sequences for E3 Ubiquitin Ligases Using a cDNA Display Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells utilize ubiquitin as a posttranslational protein modifier to convey various signals such as proteasomal degradation. The disfunction of ubiquitylation or following proteasomal degradation can give rise to the accumulation and aggregation of improperly ubquitylated proteins, which is known to be a general causation of many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the characterization of substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases is crucial in biological and pharmaceutical sciences. In this study, we developed a novel high&#8208;throughput screening system for substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases using a cDNA display method, which enables covalent conjugation between peptide sequences and their corresponding cDNA sequences. First, we focused on the MDM2 E3 ligase and its known peptide substrate as a model to establish the screening method, and confirmed that cDNA display method was compatible with in vitro ubiquitylation. Then, we demonstrated identification of MDM2 substrate sequences from random libraries to identify a novel motif (VKFTGGQLA). Bioinformatics analysis of the hit sequences was performed to gain insight about endogenous substrate proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;based Activation of C2&#945;&#8208;lactylthiamin Diphosphate Decarboxylation on Bacterial 1&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose 5&#8208;phosphate Synthase</title>

DXP synthase operates in bacterial metabolism with potential roles in metabolic adaptation. Its ligand gated mechanism poises DXPS to sense and respond to chemical cues. Here we took first steps to investigate the chemical scope of ligand&#8208;induced carbanion formation on DXPS, identifying a variety of aldehyde &#8220;triggers&#8221; of LThDP decarboxylation.







Abstract
1&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose 5&#8208;phosphate synthase (DXPS) catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent formation of DXP from pyruvate (donor substrate) and d&#8208;glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate (d&#8208;GAP, acceptor substrate) in bacterial central metabolism. DXPS uses a ligand&#8208;gated mechanism in which binding of a small molecule &#8220;trigger&#8221; activates the first enzyme&#8208;bound intermediate, C2&#945;&#8208;lactylThDP (LThDP), to form the reactive carbanion via LThDP decarboxylation. d&#8208;GAP is the natural acceptor substrate for DXPS and also serves a role as a trigger to induce LThDP decarboxylation in the gated step. Additionally, we have shown that O2 and d&#8208;glyceraldehyde (d&#8208;GA) can induce LThDP decarboxylation. We hypothesize this ligand&#8208;gated mechanism poises DXPS to sense and respond to cellular cues in metabolic remodeling during bacterial adaptation. Here we sought to characterize features of small molecule inducers of LThDP decarboxylation. Using a combination of CD, NMR and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy aldehyde moiety of d&#8208;GAP is sufficient to induce LThDP decarboxylation en route to DXP formation. A variety of aliphatic aldehydes also induce LThDP decarboxylation. The study highlights the capacity of DXPS to respond to different molecular cues, lending support to potential multifunctionality of DXPS and its metabolic regulation by this mechanism.

         <title>Chemical Tools for Probing the Ub/Ubl Conjugation Cascades</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (Ubl) regulate a diverse array of cellular pathways. Ub/Ubl conjugation is orchestrated by a cascade of specialized E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Here, we review chemical tools and methods implemented to probe enzymatic activities and to capture and characterize fleeting chemical and conformational states within Ub and Ubl conjugation cascades.







Abstract
Conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) and structurally related ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (Ubls), essential for many cellular processes, employs multi&#8208;step reactions orchestrated by specific E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. The E1 enzyme activates the Ub/Ubl C&#8208;terminus in an ATP&#8208;dependent process that results in the formation of a thioester linkage with the E1 active site cysteine. The thioester&#8208;activated Ub/Ubl is transferred to the active site of an E2 enzyme which then interacts with an E3 enzyme to promote conjugation to the target substrate. The E1&#8208;E2&#8208;E3 enzymatic cascades utilize labile intermediates, extensive conformational changes, and vast combinatorial diversity of short&#8208;lived protein&#8208;protein complexes to conjugate Ub/Ubl to various substrates in a regulated manner. In this review, we discuss various chemical tools and methods used to study the consecutive steps of Ub/Ubl activation and conjugation, which are often too elusive for direct studies. We focus on methods developed to probe enzymatic activities and capture and characterize stable mimics of the transient intermediates and transition states, thereby providing insights into fundamental mechanisms in the Ub/Ubl conjugation pathways.

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Guided Engineering of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase for Aliphatic Ester Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, aliphatic esters are produced by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) from ketone substrates. Through an artificial enzyme cascade, esters are converted into aldehydes, which are detected by a bacterial luciferase. This set&#8208;up presents the first genetically encoded biosensor system monitoring BVMO activity and greatly accelerated the bioluminescence&#8208;based selection of active enzyme variants, omitting initial low&#8208;throughput chromatographic analysis.







Abstract
Esters are valuable aroma compounds and can be produced enzymatically by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) from (aliphatic) ketone precursors. However, a genetically encoded biosensor system for the assessment of BVMO activity and the detection of reaction products is missing. In this work, we assembled a synthetic enzyme cascade &#8211; featuring an esterase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, and LuxAB &#8211; in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Target esters are produced by a BVMO, subsequently cleaved, and the corresponding alcohol oxidized through the artificial pathway. Ultimately, aldehyde products are detected in&#8197;vivo by LuxAB, a luciferase from Photorhabdus luminescens that emits bioluminescence upon the oxidation of aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylates. This biosensor system greatly accelerated the screening and selection of active BVMO variants from a focused library, omitting commonly used low&#8208;throughput chromatographic analysis. Engineered enzymes accepted linear aliphatic ketones such as 2&#8208;undecanone and 2&#8208;dodecanone and exhibited improved ester formation.

         <title>Synthesis and Antiproliferative Activity of Cisplatin&#8208;3&#8211;Chloropiperidine Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and characterization of two novel cisplatin&#8208; alkylating agents conjugates. Combining cisplatin with a sterically demanding cyclic nitrogen mustard. Cytotoxicity of the ligands and the complexes examined with MTT assays. The novel conjugates displayed a high antiproliferative potency against 5 human cancer cell lines. Both complexes were able to largely circumvent the acquired cisplatin resistance of A2780cisR ovarian cancer cells.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of two novel cisplatin&#8208; alkylating agents conjugates. Combining a platinum based cytostatic agent with a sterically demanding alkylating agent could potentially induce further DNA damage, block cell repair mechanisms and keep the substrate active against resistant tumor cell lines. The 3&#8208;chloropiperidines utilized as ligands in this work are cyclic representatives of the N&#8208;mustard family and were not able to coordinate platinum on their own. The introduction of a second coordination site, in form of a pyridine moiety, led to the isolation of the desired conjugates. They were characterized with HRMS, CHN&#8208;analyses and XRD. We concluded this work by examining the cytotoxicity of the ligands and the obtained complexes with MTT assays in human cancer cell lines. While the ligands showed hardly any activity, the novel conjugates both displayed a high antiproliferative and cytotoxic potency in a panel of three cell lines. Moreover, both complexes were able to largely circumvent the acquired cisplatin resistance of A2780cisR ovarian cancer cells, both in the MTT assay and a flow&#8208;cytometric apoptosis assay.

         <title>Expanding the Repertoire of ceDAF&#8208;12 Ligands for Modulation of the Steroid Endocrine System in C. Elegans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C. elegans steroid endocrine system serves as a simple model for studying steroid hormone signaling pathways in animals. This work introduces synthetic steroids as new tools for manipulation of the system that, acting as ligands for the ceDAF&#8208;12 nuclear receptor, selectively influence development, reproduction, and ageing.







Abstract
Steroid hormones are essential for the biological processes of eukaryotic organisms. The steroid endocrine system of C. elegans, which includes dafachronic acids (DA) and the nuclear receptor ceDAF&#8208;12, provides a simple model for exploring the role of steroid hormone signaling pathways in animals. In this study, we show for the first time the feasibility of designing synthetic steroids that can modulate different physiological processes, such as development, reproduction and ageing, in relation to ceDAF&#8208;12. Our results not only confirm the conclusions derived from genetic studies linking these processes but also provide new chemical tools to selectively manipulate them, as we found that different compounds produce different phenotypic results. The structures of these compounds are much more diverse than those of endogenous hormones and analogues previously described by other researchers, allowing further development of the chemical modulation of the steroid endocrine system in C. elegans and related nematodes.

         <title>5&#8217;&#8208;Methoxyarmillane, a Bioactive Sesquiterpenoid Aryl Ester from the Fungus Armillaria ostoyae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8217;&#8208;Methoxyarmillane was isolated from cultures of Armillaria ostoyae in an optimized medium and the structure was elucidated by UHPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;HR&#8208;MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. It showed toxicity against Madin&#8208;Darby canine kidney&#8197;II and human lung cancer Calu&#8208;3 cells as well as bioactivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, but not against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Septoria tritici.







Abstract
Higher fungi of the genus Armillaria belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota produce bioactive sesquiterpenoid aryl esters called melleolides. A bioactivity&#8208;guided discovery process led to the identification of the new melleolide 5&#8217;&#8208;methoxyarmillane (1) in organic extracts from the mycelium of Armillaria ostoyae. Remarkably, supplementation of rapeseed oil to the culture medium potato dextrose broth increased the production of 1 by a factor of six during the course of the 35&#8197;days fermentation. Compound 1 was isolated and its structure elucidated by UHPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;HR&#8208;MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. It showed toxicity against Madin&#8208;Darby canine kidney&#8197;II (MDCK&#8197;II, IC50 19.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL, 44.1&#8197;&#956;M) and human lung cancer Calu&#8208;3 cells (IC50 15.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL, 34.9&#8197;&#956;M) as well as moderate bioactivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC 8&#8197;mg/mL, 18.4&#8197;&#956;M) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC 16&#8197;mg/mL, 36.8&#8197;&#956;M), but not against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Septoria tritici. No inhibitory effects of 1 against the influenza viruses H3N2, H1N1pdm, B/Malaysia, and B/Massachusetts were observed.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Substrates for Enhancing Activatable Cyclopropene Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal ligations have been optimized for speed, but new features, like click&#8208;to&#8208;release and cell&#8208;type reaction control, substantially expand their capabilities in cells and organisms. In this report, we explored a variety of diene reaction partners for modular activatable cyclopropenes, identifying the quinone/catechol as a redox activatable substrate for inverse electron demand Diels Alder reactions with activatable cyclopropenes







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry has become a mainstay in chemical biology and is making inroads in the clinic with recent advances in protein targeting and drug release. Since the field's beginning, a major focus has been on designing bioorthogonal reagents with good selectivity, reactivity, and stability in complex biological environments. More recently, chemists have imbued reagents with new functionalities like click&#8208;and&#8208;release or light/enzyme&#8208;controllable reactivity. We have previously developed a controllable cyclopropene&#8208;based bioorthogonal ligation, which has excellent stability in physiological conditions and can be triggered to react with tetrazines by exposure to enzymes, biologically significant small molecules, or light spanning the visual spectrum. Here, to improve reactivity and gain a better understanding of this system, we screened diene reaction partners for the cyclopropene. We found that a cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair is 26 times faster than reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Additionally, we showed that the reaction of the cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair can be activated by two orthogonal mechanisms: caging group removal on the cyclopropene and oxidation/reduction of the quinone. Finally, we demonstrated that this caged cyclopropene&#8211;quinone can be used as an imaging tool to label the membranes of fixed, cultured cells.

         <title>Selective Dissolution of Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Crystals Using a Pyrophosphate Specific Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint deposits of insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) cause pseudo&#8208;gout, a type of arthritis. CPPD's insolubility is driven by electrostatic interaction of di&#8208;cationic calcium ions with tetra&#8208;anionic pyrophosphate ions. This interaction can be effectively disrupted through the use of a molecule (PPS&#8208;1) that presents surrogate di&#8208;cations in a spatially ordered array. Using PPS&#8208;1 we were able to dissolve CPPD selectively over the closely related mineral hydroxy apatite.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;gout is caused by the deposition of highly insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joints of sufferers. This leads to inflammation and ultimately joint damage. The insolubility of CPPD is driven by the strong attraction of di&#8208;cationic calcium ions with tetra&#8208;anionic pyrophosphate ions. One of the challenges of dissolving CPPD is that a related mineral, hydroxy apatite (HA) is present in larger amounts in the form of bone and also contains strongly interacting calcium and phosphate ions. Our aim in this work was to selectively dissolve CPPD in preference to HA. To accomplish this, we used a known receptor for pyrophosphate that contains two complexed zinc ions that are ideally spaced to interact with the tetra&#8208;anion of pyrophosphate. We hypothesized that such a molecule could act as a preorganized tetra&#8208;cation that would be able to outcompete the two calcium ions present in the crystal lattice of CPPD. We demonstrate both visually and through analysis of released phosphorous that this molecule is able to preferentially dissolve CPPD over the closely related HA and thus can form the basis for a possible approach for the treatment of pseudo&#8208;gout.

&lt;p&gt;Joint deposits of insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) cause pseudo-gout, a type of arthritis. CPPD's insolubility is driven by electrostatic interaction of di-cationic calcium ions with tetra-anionic pyrophosphate ions. This interaction can be effectively disrupted through the use of a molecule (PPS-1) that presents surrogate di-cations in a spatially ordered array. Using PPS-1 we were able to dissolve CPPD selectively over the closely related mineral hydroxy apatite.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Multifunctional Probe for Colorimetric Copper Sensing, Lysosome Labelling and Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble, fluorescence and colorimetric copper probe (LysoBC1) has been synthesized and fully characterized; this system responds to both cupric ion and pH variation in aqueous environment. Live cell imaging shows that LysoBC1 is able to selectively accumulate into lysosome while the copper binding ability allowed us to monitor the dynamic tracking of the metal.







Abstract
We report a water&#8208;soluble fluorescence and colorimetric copper probe (LysoBC1); this system can also serve for lysosome labeling and for the dynamic tracking of Cu2+ in living cells. The sensing mechanism takes advantage of the synergic action by the following three components: i)&#8197;a lysosome targeting unit, ii)&#8197;the spirolactam ring&#8208;opening for the selective copper chelation and iii)&#8197;the metal&#8208;mediated hydrolysis of the rhodamine moiety for fluorescence enhancement. In aqueous environment the molecule acts as a fluorescent reversible pH sensor and as colorimetric probe for Cu2+ at physiological pH; the hydrolysis of the copper targeting unit resulted in a 50&#8208;fold increase of the fluorescence intensity. Most importantly, in&#8197;vitro cell analyses in undifferentiated (SH SY5Y) and differentiated (d&#8208;SH SY5Y) neuroblastoma cells, LysoBC1 is able to selectively accumulate into lysosome while the copper binding ability allowed us to monitor intracellular copper accumulation into lysosome.

         <title>Uracil&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Linking in RNA and Inhibition of miRNA Function by 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinyl&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine Deoxynucleosides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the synthesis of a cross&#8208;linkable nucleoside (2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;propynyl&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine deoxyriboside; dADpVP). dADpVP selectively reacted with counter uridine with high reactivity upon duplex hybridization. The structural determination of the cross&#8208;linked adduct revealed that cross&#8208;linking occurred at the N&#8208;3 of uridine. We investigated if the incorporation of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides into microRNA inhibitors enabled a more effective inhibition of endogenous miRNA function.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through RNA interference. Consequently, miRNA inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), have attracted attention for treating miRNA overexpression. To achieve efficient inhibition, we developed 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine (AVP) nucleosides that form covalent bonds with uridine counterparts in RNA. We demonstrated that mRNA cross&#8208;linked with AVP&#8208;conjugated antisense oligonucleotides with AVP were protected from gene silencing by exogenous miRNA. However, endogenous miRNA function could not be inhibited in cells, probably because of slow cross&#8208;linking kinetics. We recently developed ADpVP, an AVP derivative bearing a 7&#8208;propynyl group &#8211; which boasts faster reaction rate than the original AVP. Here, we synthesized dADpVP &#8211; a deoxy analog of ADpVP &#8211; through a simplified synthesis protocol. Evaluation of the cross&#8208;linking reaction revealed that the reaction kinetics of dADpVP were comparable to those of ADpVP. In addition, structural analysis of the cross&#8208;linked adduct discovered N3 linkage against uridine. Incorporating dADpVP into two types of miRNA inhibitors revealed a marginal impact on AMO efficacy yet improved the performance of target site blockers. These results indicate the potential of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides for indirect miRNA function inhibition.

         <title>Elucidating Evolutionary Mechanisms and Variants of the Hammerhead Ribozyme Using In Vitro Selection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generated single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and triple&#8208;mutation libraries to explore the sequence requirements and evolution of a full&#8208;length hammerhead ribozyme. We identified many hammerhead variants, some of which possess mutations at previously considered essential nucleotides. We also present a novel methodological approach for evaluating the sequence&#8208;function relationships of functional nucleic acids by leveraging evolutionary trends observed during in&#8197;vitro selection.







Abstract
The Hammerhead Ribozyme (HHR) is a ubiquitous RNA enzyme that catalyzes site&#8208;specific intramolecular cleavage. While mutations to its catalytic core have traditionally been viewed as detrimental to its activity, several discoveries of naturally occurring variants of the full&#8208;length ribozyme challenge this notion, suggesting a deeper understanding of HHR evolution and functionality. By systematically introducing mutations at key nucleotide positions within the catalytic core, we generated single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and triple&#8208;mutation libraries to explore the sequence requirements and evolution of a full&#8208;length HHR. In vitro selection revealed many novel hammerhead variants, some of which possess mutations at nucleotides previously considered to be essential. We also demonstrate that the evolutionary trajectory of each nucleotide in the catalytic core directly correlates with their functional importance, potentially giving researchers a novel method to assess the sequence requirements of functional nucleic acids.

         <title>Bio&#8208;electrocatalytic Alkene Reduction Using Ene&#8208;Reductases with Methyl Viologen as Electron Mediator</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes using ene&#8208;reductases faces hurdles in flavin mononucleotide cofactor regeneration. Electrochemical MV2+ regeneration offers a cost&#8208;effective remedy. Our bio&#8208;electrocatalytic system, with TOYE or PETNR as enzymes, MV2+ and substrate in an H&#8208;type reactor cell, efficiently catalyzes alkene reduction under constant potential. This study underscores the promise of bio&#8208;electrocatalytic asymmetric hydrogenation.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation of alkene moieties is important for the synthesis of chiral molecules, but achieving high stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Biocatalysis using ene&#8208;reductases (EReds) offers a viable solution. However, the need for NAD(P)H cofactors limits large&#8208;scale applications. Here, we explored an electrochemical alternative for recycling flavin&#8208;containing EReds using methyl viologen as a mediator. For this, we built a bio&#8208;electrocatalytic setup with an H&#8208;type glass reactor cell, proton exchange membrane, and carbon cloth electrode. Experimental results confirm the mediator's electrochemical reduction and enzymatic consumption. Optimization showed increased product concentration at longer reaction times with better reproducibility within 4&#8211;6&#8197;h. We tested two enzymes, Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase (PETNR) and the Thermostable Old Yellow Enzyme (TOYE), using different alkene substrates. TOYE showed higher productivity for the reduction of 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one (1.20&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1), 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one (1.40&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pentanal (0.40&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1), with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 11&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. PETNR outperformed TOYE in terms of enantioselectivity for the reduction of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pentanal (ee 59&#8201;% &#177; 7&#8201;% (S)). Notably, TOYE achieved promising results also in reducing ketoisophorone, a challenging substrate, with similar enantiomeric excess compared to published values using NADH.

We tested two enzymes, Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase (PETNR) and the Thermostable Old Yellow Enzyme (TOYE), using different alkene substrates. TOYE showed higher productivity for the reduction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (1.20&#8197;mM&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), 2-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one (1.40&#8197;mM&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 2-methyl-2-pentanal (0.40&#8197;mM&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 11&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. PETNR outperformed TOYE in terms of enantioselectivity for the reduction of 2-methyl-2-pentanal (ee 59&#8201;% &#177; 7&#8201;% (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)). Notably, TOYE achieved promising results also in reducing ketoisophorone, a challenging substrate, with similar enantiomeric excess compared to published values using NADH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Condensation Domain Editing of the FR900359 Assembly Line Yields a Novel Analog Amenable to Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensation domain editing of the FR900359 assembly line, yielded a novel analog of FR, missing the N&#8208;acylation of its Hle side chain. The resulting &#945;&#8208;amino group was shown to be amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization of the FR&#8208;scaffold by standard amide coupling procedures. This strategy provided access to nine semisynthetic derivatives of FR, which were profiled concerning their antiproliferative effects against four melanoma cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The natural product FR900359 (FR) has generated significant attention lately, due to its characteristics as potent and selective inhibitor of Gq/11 mediated signal transduction of associated G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). This makes FR both a widely used pharmacological tool compound and a lead molecule for targeted cancer therapy. The exploration of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) of the scaffold by total synthesis has been complicated by its structural complexity and its incompatibility with standard approaches of solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Options for late&#8208;stage functionalization of FR are limited due to a lack of tractable functional groups. Here we present a mixed approach combining (i) genetic engineering of the FR&#8208;assembly line in Chromobacterium vaccinii, to obtain a novel FR analog featuring a primary amine, with (ii) its subsequent synthetic modification and biological profiling for further SAR exploration of the FR scaffold.

         <title>Comparative Study of Immobilized Biolipasa&#8208;R for Second Generation Biodiesel Production from an Acid Oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biolipasa&#8208;R immobilized via adsorption on diatomaceous earth and commercial carriers efficiently catalyzes the production of fatty acid methyl esters from acid oils, for the preparation of second&#8208;generation biodiesel. It's performance in this process is superior to benchmark enzyme Novozym&#174; 435.







Abstract
The primary objective of this work is to develop a sustainable biocatalytic transesterification process for low&#8208;grade oils, aligning with EU green technology requirements for the shift to second generation biodiesel. Thus, we investigated the immobilization and subsequent application of the lipase Biolipasa&#8208;R on transesterification processes to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from both a sunflower oil and an acid oil which is a bioproduct of the biodiesel industry. The lipase was immobilized on biomaterials, such as diatomaceous earth, with a yield of 60&#8201;%, and commercial carriers such as methacrylic resins with a yield of 100&#8201;%. The enzyme demonstrated superior activity when immobilized on diatomaceous earth, particularly in reactions involving the acid oil, outperforming the benchmark enzyme Novozym&#174; 435 (95.1&#8201;% and 35&#8201;% conversion respectively). This work highlights the potential of Biolipasa&#8208;R as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient biocatalyst for biodiesel production and emphasizes the environmental benefits of utilizing industrial byproducts and eco&#8208;friendly immobilization techniques. The findings suggest that Biolipasa&#8208;R is a promising candidate for industrial applications in biodiesel production, offering a sustainable solution for waste management and energy generation.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Binding Oligonucleotide Backbone Modifications for Targeting a DNA&#8208;Processing Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA oligonucleotides bearing a modified internucleotide linkage that enables chelation of zinc ions were synthesized. Modifications included urea, squaramide, sulfanylacetamide and sulfinylacetamide moieties. The interaction of the oligonucleotides with the zinc&#8208;dependent DNA repair enzyme SNM1A was studied. The oligonucleotides were capable of strong binding to SNM1A, and the most potent compound inhibited SNM1A activity with an IC50 of 231&#8197;nM.







Abstract
A series of chemically&#8208;modified oligonucleotides for targeting the DNA repair nuclease SNM1A have been designed and synthesised. Each oligonucleotide contains a modified internucleotide linkage designed to both mimic the native phosphodiester backbone and chelate to the catalytic zinc ion(s) in the SNM1A active site. Dinucleoside phosphoramidites containing urea, squaramide, sulfanylacetamide, and sulfinylacetamide linkages were prepared and employed successfully in solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. All the modified oligonucleotides were found to interact with SNM1A in a gel electrophoresis&#8208;based assay, demonstrating the first examples of inhibition of DNA damage repair enzymes for many of these groups in oligonucleotides. One strand containing a sulfinylacetamide&#8208;linkage was found to have the strongest interaction with SNM1A and was further tested in a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay. This allowed an IC50 value of 231&#8197;nM to be determined, significantly lower than previously reported substrate&#8208;mimics targeting this enzyme. It is expected that these modified oligonucleotides will serve as a scaffold for the future development of fluorescent or biotin&#8208;labelled probes for the in&#8197;vivo study of DNA repair processes.

Abstract
We report a novel, reversible, cell&#8208;permeable, pH&#8208;sensor, TRapH. TRapH afforded a pH&#8208;sensitive ratiometric emission response in the pH range ~3&#8211;6, enabling imaging and quantification of pH in living cells. The biological&#8208;applicability of TRapH was illustrated via live&#8208;tracking of intracellular pH dynamics in living mammalian cells induced by a synthetic H+&#8208;transporter.

         <title>Isolation and Molecular Characterization of the LTA Precursor Molecule Glc2&#8208;DAG, a Potential Target for Antibiotics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glycolipid diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2DAG) is the precursor molecule of Lipoteichoic acid, a vital component of cell envelops of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Here we report the isolation of the 13C&#8208;isotope labelled diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2DAG) from bacterial membranes and the use solid&#8208;state NMR to characterize Glc2DAG in membranes.







Abstract
Bacterial infections present a major global health threat, often displaying resistance to various antibiotics. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a vital component of bacterial cell envelopes of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, crucial for cell integrity, cell division, and host inflammation.

&lt;p&gt;The glycolipid diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2DAG) is the precursor molecule of Lipoteichoic acid, a vital component of cell envelops of Gram-positive bacteria. Here we report the isolation of the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-isotope labelled diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2DAG) from bacterial membranes and the use solid-state NMR to characterize Glc2DAG in membranes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections present a major global health threat, often displaying resistance to various antibiotics. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a vital component of bacterial cell envelopes of Gram-positive bacteria, crucial for cell integrity, cell division, and host inflammation. Due to its essential role for bacteria, LTA and its biosynthesis are also attractive drug targets, however, there is only scant molecular knowledge on LTA and its precursor molecules in membranes. Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DAG), the glycolipid precursor molecule that anchors LTA in the bacterial plasma-membrane. Using a tailored growth medium and purification protocols, we isolated &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-isotope labelled Glc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DAG from bacteria, which can then be used for high-resolution NMR studies. Using solution-state and solid-state NMR, we show an in-depth molecular characterization of Glc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DAG, including in native-like membranes. Our approach may help to identify antibiotics that directly target LTA precursor molecules, and it offers a tool for future investigations into the role of Glc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DAG in bacterial physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging the Gap in the Structure&#8211;Function Paradigm of Enzymatic PET Degradation&#8211;Aromatic Residue Driven Balanced Interactions with Catalytic and Anchoring Subsite</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic PET hydrolysis activity is primarily regulated by a delicate equilibrium between binding interactions at the catalytic subsite (S1) and the anchoring subsite (S3), predominantly influenced by the aromatic residues Tyr, Trp, and Phe.







Abstract
Understanding all parameters contributing to enzyme activity is crucial in enzyme catalysis. For enzymatic PET degradation, this involves examining the formation of the enzyme&#8208;PET complex. In IsPETase (WT), a PET&#8208;degrading enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis, mutating two non&#8208;catalytic residues (DM) significantly enhances activity. Such mutations, depending on their position in the tertiary structure, fine&#8208;tune enzyme function. However, detailed molecular insights into these mutations&#8217; structure&#8208;function relationship for PET degradation are lacking. This study characterizes IsPETase's catalytic ability compared to WT TfCut2 using molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical methods. We explore the conformational landscape of the enzyme&#8208;PET complex and quantify residue&#8208;wise interaction energy. Notably, aromatic and hydrophobic residues Tyr, Trp, and Ile in the catalytic subsite S1, and aromatic Phe and polar Asn in the anchoring subsite S3, crucially optimize PET binding. These residues enhance PET specificity over non&#8208;aromatic plastics. Our findings suggest that the balance between binding at subsite S1 and subsite S3, which is influenced by cooperative mutations, underlies catalytic activity. This balance shows a positive correlation with experimentally obtained kcat/Km values: WT TfCut2&lt;WT IsPETase&#8810;DM IsPETase.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent Acylation of Peptide Lysine Residues by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We used in&#8197;vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate Lys of a peptide substrate. The peptide modification reaction is specific to a particular Lys position, depends on the amino acid sequence context, and can be performed on a preparatively useful scale.







Abstract
Methods for modifying intact peptides are useful but can be unselective with regard to amino acid position and sequence context. In this work, we used in&#8197;vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate a Lys residue of a short peptide in sequence&#8208;dependent fashion. The DNAzymes do not acylate Lys when placed at other residues in the peptide, and the acylation activity depends on the Lys sequence context. A high acylation yield is observed on the preparative nanomole scale. These findings are promising for further development of DNAzymes for broader application to top&#8208;down Lys acylation of peptide and protein substrates.

         <title>A Single Enzyme in Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols: Bidirectional Catalysis by Hydroxynitrile Lyase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Baliospermum montanum hydroxynitrile lyase (BmHNL)&#8217;s catalytic scope in enantiocomplementary synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols was illustrated. It exhibited broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity towards Henry and retro&#8208;Henry reaction in the production of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols respectively.







Abstract
A single enzyme, Baliospermum montanum hydroxynitrile lyase (BmHNL), without alteration, enabled bidirectional catalysis in enantiocomplementary synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols. BmHNL catalyzed promiscuous Henry (24 examples) and retro&#8208;Henry reaction (22 examples) provided up to &gt;99&#8201;% and 50&#8201;% conversion to (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols respectively, while both cases displayed up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. The broad substrate scope and high stereoselectivity of BmHNL represents its synthetic applications in sustainable production of diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols. Kinetic parameters of BmHNL was determined for Henry and retro&#8208;Henry reaction, which reveals poor catalytic efficiency for both the promiscuous transformations, however, the former has better efficiency than the latter. Practical applicability of the biocatalyst and transformation was illustrated by preparative scale synthesis of chiral intermediates of (S)&#8208;Tembamide, and (S)&#8208;Micanozole.

         <title>Integrating Biocatalysts into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Disentangling the Roles of Affinity, Molecular Weight, and Size</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating biocatalysts within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) shows huge promise for enhancing stability and sustaining activity in organic solvents. Here we report on investigates how biocatalyst size, weight, and affinity affect their incorporation into MOF pores, using NU&#8208;1000 as a model. Techniques like fluorescence tagging and 3D&#8208;STED microscopy helped identify which biocatalysts were internalized or excluded, revealing significant variations in their catalytic functions.







Abstract
The integration of biocatalysts within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is attracting growing interest due to its potential to both enhance biocatalyst stability and sustain biocatalyst activity in organic solvents. However, the factors that facilitate the post&#8208;synthetic infiltration of such large molecules into MOF pores remain unclear. This systematic study enabled the identification of the influence of biocatalyst molecular size, molecular weight and affinity on the uptake by an archetypal MOF, NU&#8208;1000. We analyzed a range of six biocatalysts with molecular weights from 1.9&#8197;kDa to 44.4&#8197;kDa, respectively. By employing a combination of fluorescence tagging and 3D&#8208;STED confocal laser scanning microscopy, we distinguished between biocatalysts that were internalized within the MOF pores and those sterically excluded. The catalytic functions of the biocatalysts hosted within the MOF were investigated and found to show strong variations relative to the solvated case, ranging from a two&#8208;fold increase to a strong decrease.

         <title>Engineering of a Malonyl&#8208;CoA Ligase for Production of Fluorinated Polyketide Extender Units</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally diverse malonyl&#8208;CoA building blocks are required to regioselectively diversify macrolide compounds. Specifically, fluorinated building blocks represent pathways to introduce fluorine into drug&#8208;like compounds. Herein, the biosynthesis of a tertiary fluorinated malonyl&#8208;CoA is described via mutagenesis of the malonyl&#8208;CoA ligase, MatB, from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Mutation provided a variant with a shifted product profile, providing a mutant relevant for macrolide biosynthesis.







Abstract
Enzymatic platforms for producing malonyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;based extender units required for polyketide biosynthesis are often based on malonyl&#8208;CoA ligases such as MatB from Rhizobium trifolii and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. However, despite broad interest in the fluorination of polyketides and prior success with engineering MatB homologs, the suitability of MatB for accessing the tertiary substituted fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA needed to produce flurithromycin and solithromycin has not yet been reported. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;guided engineering of a MatB homolog to optimize the production of fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, resulting in a variant with increased conversion and providing a platform to produce a suitable building block mixture for fluorinated macrolide production. Additionally, the mutant demonstrated broad utility for various substituted malonyl&#8208;CoAs. The MatB mutant sets the stage to access fluorinated macrolides by coupling it with altered PKS machinery to install fluorinated malonyl&#8208;CoA into macrolide scaffolds.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through RNA interference. Consequently, miRNA inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), have attracted attention for treating miRNA overexpression. In article 10.1002/cbic.202400417, Fumi Nagatsugi and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the cross&#8208;linkable nucleoside (2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;propynyl&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine deoxyriboside; dADpVP) reacted to counter uridine with high reactivity upon duplex hybridization. Moreover, the oligonucleotide containing dADpVP targeting the miRNA binding site in mRNA 3&#8242;UTR effectively inhibit the miR21 function in cells by covalent formation.

         <dc:description>
In article 10.1002/cbic.202400319, Simon H. Friedman and co&#8208;workers have shown that a di&#8208;zinc complex (green circles and purple lines) can selectively dissolve crystalline calcium pyrophosphate (blue circles and red/orange space filling structure), while minimally dissolving hydroxy apatite, the main inorganic component of bone (cyan). It is effective because the complex pre&#8208;organizes electrostatically complementary zinc ions which then displace the crystalline calcium ions. Calcium pyrophosphate is the causative agent in pseudo&#8208;gout, a disease that affects millions.

         <title>Heavy Metal Detection with Organic Moiety&#8208;Based Sensors: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 21, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on accuracy, selectivity, and sensitivity, this paper examines the necessity of sophisticated heavy metal detection methods. Using terpyridine, porphyrin, coumarin, and Schiff bases as organic moiety&#8208;based techniques, it also addresses recent advancements in fluorescence chemosensors for multi&#8208;ion detection, highlighting detection limitations, stoichiometry, Solvent systems, metal bindings, and applications.







Abstract
Heavy metal hazardous and enduring characteristics present a noteworthy risk to both human well&#8208;being and the ecosystem. Heavy metal level monitoring requires accurate and dependable detection techniques. This review emphasizes the requirement for sophisticated detection methods that can address the issues like sensitivity, selectivity, cost and ease of use for the detection of heavy metal ions and allow for more accurate and trustworthy monitoring using various organic moieties. It offers a thorough overview of cutting&#8208;edge organic moiety&#8208;based heavy metal detection techniques. It primarily discusses four different types of substituted core structures, including coumarin, porphyrin, Schiff bases, and terpyridine, along with their mechanisms, methods, detection limits, and appropriate metal bindings. These moieties exhibit strong coordination with heavy metal ions because of their distinct structural characteristics. They produce stable complexes with complicated ligand&#8208;metal interactions that are useful in a variety of applications, including sensing and catalysis. Each probe was chosen based on its propensity or capacity to identify important analytes in practical applications. To increase the effectiveness and productivity of fluorescence sensing, researchers have recently been working to create new fluorescence chemosensors that can identify many ions at once.

         <title>Covalent Labeling of Matrix Metalloproteases with Affinity&#8208;Based Probes Containing Tuned Reactive N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfonamide Cleavable Linkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Original affinity&#8208;based probes with a N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamide (NASA) cleavable linker were designed to covalently modify several human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs). The electrophilicity of the cleavable linker was optimized to reduced unspecific reactivity of the probes in complex biological matrices. The probes, tested in varied proteomes containing MMP&#8208;13, showed improved selectivity and reduced off&#8208;target propensity.







Abstract
Original covalent probes with an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamide cleavable linker were developed to target a broad set of human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs). The electrophilicity of this cleavable linker was modulated to improve the selectivity of the probes as well as reduce their unspecific reactivity in complex biological matrices. We first demonstrated that targeting the S3 subsite of MMPs enables access to broad&#8208;spectrum affinity&#8208;based probes that exclusively react with the active version of these proteases. The probes were further assessed in proteomes of varying complexity, where human MMP&#8208;13 was artificially introduced at known concentration and the resulting labeled MMP was imaged by in&#8208;gel fluorescence imaging. We showed that the less reactive probe was still able to covalently modify MMP&#8208;13 while exhibiting reduced off&#8208;target unspecific reactivity. This study clearly demonstrated the importance of finely controlling the reactivity of the NASA warhead to improve the selectivity of covalent probes in complex biological systems.

&lt;p&gt;Original affinity-based probes with a N-acyl-N-alkyl sulfonamide (NASA) cleavable linker were designed to covalently modify several human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs). The electrophilicity of the cleavable linker was optimized to reduced unspecific reactivity of the probes in complex biological matrices. The probes, tested in varied proteomes containing MMP-13, showed improved selectivity and reduced off-target propensity.

&lt;p&gt;Original covalent probes with an N-acyl-N-alkyl sulfonamide cleavable linker were developed to target a broad set of human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs).

         <title>ER Oxidoreductin 1&#8208;Like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Drives Protein Disulfide Isomerase in an Electron Relay System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide formation generally involves a two&#8208;electron oxidation reaction between cysteine residues. Additionally, disulfide formation is an essential post&#8208;translational modification for the structural maturation of proteins. This oxidative folding is precisely controlled by an electron relay network constructed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), with a CGHC sequence as the redox&#8208;active site, and its family enzymes. Creating reagents that mimic the functions of these enzymes facilitates folding during chemical protein synthesis. In this study, we aimed to imitate a biological electron relay system using cyclic diselenide compounds as surrogates for endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), which is responsible for the re&#8208;oxidation of PDI. Oxidized PDI (PDIox) introduces disulfide bonds into substrate proteins, resulting in its conversion to reduced PDI (PDIred). The PDIred is then re&#8208;oxidized to PDIox by a coexisting cyclic diselenide compound, thereby restoring the function of PDI as a disulfide&#8208;forming agent. The produced diselenol state is readily oxidized to the original diselenide state with molecular oxygen, continuously sustaining the PDI catalytic cycle. This artificial electron relay system regulating enzymatic PDI function effectively promotes the oxidative folding of disulfide&#8208;containing proteins, such as insulin&#8212;a hypoglycemic formulation&#8212;by enhancing both yield and reaction velocity.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein condensates unfold G&#8208;quadruplex resembling a helicase activity.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;less organelles, formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, participate in many vital cellular processes and have received extensive attention recently. A notable form of noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structure, G&#8208;quadruplex (G4), interacts with the scaffolding proteins in these membrane&#8208;less organelles and becomes an integral part of this condensed phase. However, the structure and stability features of the integrated G4 remain poorly characterized. Herein, we employed NMR along with other biophysical methods to investigate the conformation of a G4 within condensates formed by a disordered protein known as DDX4N1. We discovered that the human telomeric sequence MHT24, which forms a G4 structure in a non&#8208;condensed phase solution of protein DDX4N1, unfolds when it is within DDX4N1 condensates due to phase separation. Our findings provide an instance of a protein acquiring new functionality through phase separation process, which deepen our understanding of how protein condensates regulate G4 structure and their functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Amyloid Fibril Formation on Neuronal Cells in the Coexistence of A&#946;40 and A&#946;42</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On neuronal membranes, A&#946;40 alone and A&#946;42 alone form less toxic and more toxic fibrils, respectively. In their coexistence, A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 form less toxic mixed fibrils, suggesting the possibility that A&#946;40 has a protective role against A&#946;42&#8208;induced cell death.







Abstract
The abnormal aggregation and subsequent deposition of amyloid &#946;&#8208;protein (A&#946;) in the brain are considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The two major species of A&#946; are A&#946;40 and A&#946;42, present at an approximate ratio of 9&#8201;:&#8201;1. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal membranes are an important platform of amyloidogenesis by A&#946;. However, information on the aggregational behaviors of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 on membranes is lacking. In this study, the aggregation and resultant cytotoxicity of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 at a physiologically relevant ratio were investigated by fluorescence techniques. We found that the degree of coexistence of both A&#946;s in aggregates increased as the assembly proceeded, and reached a maximum in fibrils. Cross&#8208;seeding experiments supported the hypothesis that A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 interact with each other in the fibrillar states when formed on membranes. However, the cytotoxicity of the mixed fibrils was weaker than that of A&#946;42 fibrils, suggesting the possibility that A&#946;40 attenuates the toxicity of A&#946;42 by forming mixed fibrils. In contrast, the degree of coexistence was significantly lower in aqueous phase aggregation, highlighting different aggregation mechanisms between in membranes and in the aqueous phase.

         <dc:description>
In this Concept, we summarize and discuss the latest advancements in disulfide&#8208;bonded peptide and protein folding, with a particular focus on biomimetic folding strategies that mimic the oxidative folding process in organisms. These strategies include artificial chaperone&#8208;assisted folding, glycosylation&#8208;assisted folding, and organic oxidative folding. We also anticipate the existing challenges and potential future research directions.







Abstract
Disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides and proteins, including hormones, toxins, growth factors, and others, are abundant in living organisms. These molecules play crucial physiological roles such as regulating cell and organism growth, development, and metabolism. They have also found widespread applications as drugs or tool molecules in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. However, the chemical synthesis of disulfide&#8208;bonded proteins is complicated by the challenges associated with their folding. This review focuses on the latest advancements in disulfide&#8208;bonded peptide and protein folding technologies. Particularly, it highlights biomimetic folding strategies that emulate the naturally occurring oxidative folding processes in nature. These strategies include chaperone&#8208;assisted folding, glycosylation&#8208;assisted folding, and organic&#8208;based oxidative folding methods. The review also anticipates future directions in folding technology. Such research offers innovative approaches for the chemical synthesis of complex proteins that are otherwise difficult to fold.

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of a New Antitumor Pyranonaphthoquinone from Streptomyces tanashiensis DSM 731: Insights from Single&#8208;Molecule Stretching Assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;molecule stretching assay&#8208;based molecular networking strategy can effectively dereplicate known compounds and identify new bioactive natural products. This approach led to the discovery of a new pyranonaphthoquinone (PNQ), methyl kalafunginate (1), with potent antitumor bioactivity. Moreover, compound 1 was found to be a non&#8208;enzymatic product of kalafungin (4) in methanol, providing valuable insights into the formation mechanism of PNQs.







Abstract
Guided by molecular networking based on single&#8208;molecule stretching assay, an unprecedented pyranonaphthoquinone, methyl kalafunginate (1) and five known compounds 2&#8211;6 were isolated from Streptomyces tanashiensis DSM 731. Compound 1 was characterized through a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis, ECD calculation, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Interestingly, we discovered that compound 1 was spontaneously converted from kalafungin (4) in methanol solution. All isolated compounds, except for compound 3, were assessed for their cytotoxic potential against a panel of five human cancer cell lines: A549, HepG2, BxPC&#8208;3, SW620, and C4&#8208;2B. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 exhibited remarkable cytotoxicity with IC50 values below 2.382&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting their potential as promising anticancer agents. These findings highlight the significance of using a combined approach of single&#8208;molecule stretching assays and molecular networking for efficiently discovering novel natural products with potential therapeutic applications.

Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was characterized through a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis, ECD calculation, and X-ray crystallography. Interestingly, we discovered that compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was spontaneously converted from kalafungin (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) in methanol solution. All isolated compounds, except for compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, were assessed for their cytotoxic potential against a panel of five human cancer cell lines: A549, HepG2, BxPC-3, SW620, and C4-2B. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; exhibited remarkable cytotoxicity with &lt;i&gt;IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; values below 2.382&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting their potential as promising anticancer agents. These findings highlight the significance of using a combined approach of single-molecule stretching assays and molecular networking for efficiently discovering novel natural products with potential therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selenol Switch Assay for Selenoprotein Derivatization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;Selenol Switch&#8221; assay, which relies on the conversion of the selenocysteine residue to the electrophilic dehydroalanine followed by nucleophiles labelling, for selective derivatization of selenoproteins is developed based on the unique reactivity of selenium. The abundance of selenoproteins in mouse tissues determined by the Selenol Switch assay and ICP&#8208;MS gives consistent results.







Abstract
Selenoproteins are a class of protein that have selenocysteine (Sec) residues, and essential for diverse cellular functions. Although the human genome encodes 25 selenoproteins, nearly half of these selenoproteins&#8217; function is not clear. This is largely due to the lack of convenient methods to study selenoproteins. We report in this work a novel Selenol Switch assay to exclusively derivatize selenoproteins. The Selenol Switch assay relies on the selective conversion of the Sec residue to the electrophilic dehydroalanine (DHA) residue, which is then labeled by nucleophiles. The multiple reactions of the Selenol Switch assay are readily performed in a single test tube, and the conversion yield is nearly quantitative. The abundance of selenoproteins in mouse tissues determined by the Selenol Switch assay is consistent with that from the classical ICP&#8208;MS assay, validating the reliability of the Selenol Switch assay in studying selenoproteins.

         <title>SnO2 Encapsulated in Alginate Matrix: Evaluation and Optimization of Bioinspired Nanoadsorbents for Azo Dye Removal</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of SnO2 nanoparticles in alginate matrix using CaCl2 as cross&#8208;linker ensures effective and economic removal of azo dye. Encapsulation efficiency is primarily determined by concentration of alginate and cross&#8208;linker. SnO2 NPs maintain consistent adsorption efficiency in different physical forms. This method is proposed as a sustainable approach for development of prototype for treatment of textile and related effluents.







Abstract
Synthesized SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate potential capacity to adsorb toxic azo Congo red dye. The formation of rutile phase SnO2 NPs was confirmed using Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and spherical morphology was corroborated through SEM imaging. TEM analysis confirms average particle size of SnO2 NPs is nearly 3&#8197;nm. High azo dye removal efficiency is attributed to large surface area and presence of oxygen vacancies which were substantiated through BET and XPS analysis, respectively. To mitigate the leaching of NPs in treated water, NPs are encapsulated in sodium alginate (SA) matrix, which is proposed as an environmentally friendly, biocompatible, and economic solution. This study specifically focuses on investigating the parameters for the encapsulation of NPs within a sodium alginate matrix using CaCl2 as cross&#8208;linker. This work investigates the effect of physical shape of encapsulation, effect of SA and cross&#8208;linker (CaCl2) concentration on the feasibility of NP encapsulation and overall adsorption efficiency. Experimental results indicated that the physical form of encapsulation, such as spherical, wire&#8208;like, or irregular shape maintained consistent adsorption efficiency, which indicates its versatility. For effective encapsulation of NPs and adsorption, SA and CaCl2 concentration are suggested to be within the range of 0.2&#8211;0.3&#8197;g and &gt;0.5&#8197;M, respectively.

         <title>Optimizing Transfection Efficiency of Spermine Polar Head Cholesterol&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids with Amino Acid Linker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spermine polar head cholesterol&#8208;based cationic lipids with amino acid spacers exhibited greater transfection efficiency compared to commercially available reagent under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions.







Abstract
In this work, a series of spermine polar head cholesterol&#8208;based cationic lipids with various amino acid spacers were synthesized and evaluated as non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. The physicochemical properties of the resulting lipoplexes, formed from these lipids and DOPE, were assessed, including zeta&#8208;potential, DNA binding and DNA protection from serum. Transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity were examined under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum&#8208;containing conditions. The results showed that the physicochemical properties of cationic lipids, both with and without amino acid spacers, were not significantly different. Cationic liposomes composed of lipid Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol, which has a 6&#8208;aminohexanoic acid spacer, and DOPE exhibited greater transfection efficiency in HeLa cells compared to Lipofectamine3000, both in the absence and presence of 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum. Additionally, lipid Sper&#8208;His&#8208;Chol with a histidine spacer and Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol showed higher efficiency than Lipofectamine3000 against HEK293T under 40&#8201;% serum conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of amino acids into the cationic lipids can significantly enhance their DNA delivery efficiency. Specifically, certain amino acid modifications improved transfection efficiency while maintaining low cytotoxicity. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;tailored cationic lipids as promising vectors for enhanced DNA delivery.

         <title>High Content Screening Assay of Inhibitors of the Legionella Pneumophila Histone Methyltransferase RomA in Infected Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The set&#8208;up and validation of a high content screening assay allowed the evaluation of an epigenetic chemical library of 477 compounds for their ability to inhibit H3&#8197;K14methylation in host cells infected by Legionella.







Abstract
Resistance to anti&#8208;microbial agents is a world&#8208;wide health threat. Thus, there is an urgent need for new treatments. An alternative approach to disarm pathogens consists in developing drugs targeting epigenetic modifiers. Bacterial pathogens can manipulate epigenetic regulatory systems of the host to bypass defences to proliferate and survive. One example is Legionella pneumophila, a Gram&#8208;negative intracellular pathogen that targets host chromatin with a specific, secreted bacterial SET&#8208;domain methyltransferase named RomA. This histone methyltransferase specifically methylates H3&#8197;K14 during infection and is responsible for changing the host epigenetic landscape upon L. pneumophila infection. To inhibit RomA activity during infection, we developed a reliable high&#8208;content imaging screening assay, which we used to screen an in&#8208;house chemical library developed to inhibit DNA and histone methyltransferases. This assay was optimised using monocytic leukemic THP&#8208;1 cells differentiated into macrophages infected with L. pneumophila in a 96&#8208; or 384&#8208;well plate format using the Opera Phenix (Perkin Elmer) confocal microscope, combined with Columbus software for automated image acquisition and analysis. H3&#8197;K14 methylation was followed in infected, single cells and cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel. A first pilot screening of 477 compounds identified a potential starting point for inhibitors of H3&#8197;K14 methylation.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Visual Screen for the Directed Evolution of C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;threonine Aldolase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;TA) catalyzes the reversible condensation of glycine and aldehydes to form &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. Currently, few high&#8208;throughput methods are available for engineering L&#8208;TAs with enhanced C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This study introduces a novel screening method that couples ketone reductase, which specifically catalyzes the oxidation of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine (L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS), with the simultaneous synthesis of NADPH.

L&#8208;Threonine aldolase (L&#8208;TA) is a pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible condensation of glycine and aldehydes to form &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. The combination of directed evolution and efficient high&#8208;throughput screening methods is an effective strategy for enhancing the enzyme's catalytic performance. However, few feasible high&#8208;throughput methods exist for engineering the C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;TAs. Here, we present a novel method of screening for variants with improved C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity; this method couples an L&#8208;threo&#8208;phenylserine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the specific oxidation of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine (L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS), with the concurrent synthesis of NADPH, which is easily detectable via 340&#8208;nm UV absorption. This enables the visual detection of L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS produced by L&#8208;TA through the measurement of generated NADPH. Using this method, we discover an L&#8208;TA variant with significantly higher diastereoselectivity, increasing from 0.98&#8201;% de (for the wild&#8208;type) to 71.9&#8201;% de.

         <title>Effect of O&#8208;Acetylation on the Antigenicity and Glycoconjugate Immunogenicity of the Streptococcus Pneumoniae Serotype 7F Capsular Polysaccharide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How much does the acetate group matter in pneumococcal serotype 7F? Capsular polysaccharides of this bacterial serotype were modified to have different levels of O&#8208;acetylation and then conjugated to tetanus toxoid to produce antibacterial glycoconjugates. Antigenicity and immunological studies shed light on the importance of this moiety in the quality of the immune response.







Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterial pathogen causing diseases as severe as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Most commercial pneumococcal conjugate vaccines contain the 7F serotype, which is epidemiologically relevant and highly invasive. This serotype contains an O&#8208;acetyl group at the internal L&#8208;rhamnose of its polysaccharide repeating unit. Herein we report on the role of the O&#8208;acetyl moiety of 7F polysaccharide in both antigen recognition and the induction of a protective antibody response against 7F. Fully and partially de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 7F polysaccharides were chemically prepared and compared with the O&#8208;acetylated counterpart in their antigenicity and immunogenicity of their tetanus toxoid glycoconjugates. These comparative studies showed a slight but consistent decrease in the antigenicity for the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharide, but not for the partly de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated variant. The glycoconjugates derived from the O&#8208;acetylated and the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharides had similar sizes and polysaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;protein ratio, and all proved both to be immunogenic and induce opsonophagocytic responses in mice. Nevertheless, the immune response elicited by the O&#8208;acetylated glycoconjugate was better in both quantity and quality, proving that the O&#8208;acetyl group is not strictly necessary but also not irrelevant for the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the 7F serotype polysaccharide and its glycoconjugates.

         <dc:description>
The HLADH catalysis of the S&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 2&#8208;pentanone, operating in presence of the biomimetic co&#8208;factor, N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide, 1, occurred via the direct hydride transfer to form the S&#8208;2&#8208;pentoxy anion, followed by a water bridge, connecting the Ser48 proton relay to the final release step of the chiral S&#8208;2&#8208;pentanol.







Abstract
The enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH), was investigated via a hybrid computational approach, for molecular reactions involved in chiral synthesis of S&#8208;alcohols, when the natural co&#8208;factor, 1,4&#8208;dihyronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 1,4&#8208;NADH, was replaced with biomimetic co&#8208;factor, N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide, 1. We surmised that different hydride and proton transfer mechanisms were involved using co&#8208;factor, 1. An alternative mechanism, where the hydride transfer step occurred, via an &#951;1&#8208;keto&#8208;S&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;5,6&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide&#8208;Zn(II) complex, was previously investigated with a model of the HLADH&#8722;Zn(II) catalytic site (J. Organometal. Chem. 2021, 943, 121810). Presently, we studied canonical and alternative mechanisms compared to models of the entire enzyme structure. We disproved the &#951;2&#8208;Zn(II) complex, and discovered a canonical hydride transfer from biomimetic 1,4&#8208;NADH, 1, to the Zn(II) bound prochiral ketone substrate, followed by a new proton relay, consisting of a water chain connecting His51 to Ser48 that accomplished the S&#8208;alkoxy anion's protonation to yield the final S&#8208;alcohol product. The HLADH catalysis, with biomimetic co&#8208;factor, 1, that replaced the ribose group, the 5&#8242;&#8208;diphosphate groups, and the adenine nucleotide with a N&#8208;benzyl group, has provided a new paradigm for the design of other structures of 1,4&#8208;NADH biomimetic co&#8208;factors, including their economic value in biocatalysis reactions.

We disproved the &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Zn(II) complex, and discovered a canonical hydride transfer from biomimetic 1,4-NADH, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, to the Zn(II) bound prochiral ketone substrate, followed by a new proton relay, consisting of a water chain connecting His51 to Ser48 that accomplished the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxy anion's protonation to yield the final &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-alcohol product. The HLADH catalysis, with biomimetic co-factor, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, that replaced the ribose group, the 5&#8242;-diphosphate groups, and the adenine nucleotide with a N-benzyl group, has provided a new paradigm for the design of other structures of 1,4-NADH biomimetic co-factors, including their economic value in biocatalysis reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>REPROGRAMMING OF GLUCOSE METABOLISM FOR REVISITING HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA RESISTANCE TO TRANSCATHETER HEPATIC ARTERIAL CHEMOEMBOLIZATION</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is recognized globally as one of the most lethal tumors, presenting a significant menace to patients' lives owing to its exceptional aggressiveness and tendency to recur. Transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy, as a first&#8208;line treatment option for patients with advanced HCC, has been proven effective. However, it is disheartening that nearly 40% of patients exhibit resistance to this therapy. Consequently, this review delves into the metabolic aspects of glucose metabolism to explore the underlying mechanisms behind TACE treatment resistance and to propose potentially fruitful therapeutic strategies. The ultimate objective is to present novel insights for the development of personalized treatment methods targeting HCC.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling of Mo&#8208; and V&#8208;Nitrogenases Permits Protein&#8208;Mediated Protection from Oxygen Deactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenases catalyze dinitrogen (N2) fixation to ammonia (NH3). While these enzymes are highly sensitive to deactivation by molecular oxygen (O2) they can be produced by obligate aerobes for diazotrophy, necessitating a mechanism by which nitrogenase can be protected from deactivation. In the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, one mode of such protection involves an O2&#8208;responsive ferredoxin&#8208;type protein (&#8220;Shethna protein II&#8221;, or &#8220;FeSII&#8221;) which is thought to bind with Mo&#8208;dependent nitrogenase&#8217;s two component proteins (NifH and NifDK) to form a catalytically stalled yet O2&#8208;tolerant tripartite protein complex. This protection mechanism has been reported for Mo&#8208;nitrogenase, however, in vitro assays with V&#8208;nitrogenase suggest that this mechanism is not universal to the three known nitrogenase isoforms. Here we report that the reductase of the V&#8208;nitrogenase (VnfH) can engage in this FeSII&#8208;mediated protection mechanism when cross&#8208;coupled with Mo&#8208;nitrogenase NifDK. Interestingly, the cross&#8208;coupling of the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase reductase NifH with the V&#8208;nitrogenase VnfDGK protein does not yield such protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Close Proximity of Cholesterol Anchors in Membrane Induces the Dissociation of Amphiphilic DNA Strand from Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic DNA nanotechnology is appealing for membrane surface engineering due to their versatility and programmability. To modulate the dynamic interactions between the DNA functional units immobilized on membrane surface, membrane&#8208;anchored DNA functional units often come into close proximity each other due to DNA base pairing, which also leads to the close contact of the hydrophobic anchors in membrane. However, whether the close contact of hydrophobic anchors induces the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA structures from membrane surface is not concerned. Herein, we utilized cholesterol&#8208;labeled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a simplified amphiphilic DNA structure to investigate the stability of membrane anchored DNA strands upon the closely contact of cholesterol anchors. The close contact of cholesterol&#8208;labeled ssDNA molecules driven by toe&#8208;hold mediated strand displacement reaction leads to approximately 41 % membrane anchored ssDNA dissociation from membrane surface, indicating the proximal cholesterol anchors in membrane could reduce the anchoring stability of cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands. This work enhances our understanding of the interactions between amphiphilic DNA and membranes, and provides valuable insights for the design of future DNA constructs intended for applications involving dynamic DNA reactions on membrane surface.</dc:description>

         <title>The Multifunctional Preprotein Binding Domain of SecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SecA protein has evolved to perform multiple tasks. Its Preprotein Binding Domain (PBD) is a key module, adopting three conformational states. The PBD's inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;protomeric interactions, along with biophysical data, reveal the influence of these states on the translocation process. Key elements provide stabilization and promote the activation of the ATPase motor, described as the Prl phenotype.







Abstract
Sec&#8208;pathway is the main protein secretion pathway in prokaryotes and is essential for their survival. The motor protein SecA is the main coordinator of the pathway in bacteria as it is has evolved to perform multiple tasks, acting like a &#8220;swiss army knife&#8221;, from binding pre&#8208;proteins to altering its oligomeric and conformational states. This study focuses on the role of its Preprotein Binding Domain (PBD), which is a key protein module that identified in three conformational states (Wide&#8208;Open (WO), Open (O) and Closed (C)). A thorough analysis was conducted to identify PBD's inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;protomeric interactions, highlighting the most significant and conserved ones. Both crystallographic and biophysical data indicate that the WO state is the main during dimerization, while the monomeric structure can adopt all three states. C&#8208;tail, StemPBD and 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD are important elements for the stabilization of different oligomeric and conformational states, as they offer specific interactions. Alterations in the lipophilicity of the StemPBD causes increased proteins dynamics or/and Prl phenotype. In the C state, 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD interacts and opens the ATPase motor. We hypothesize that this partial opening of the motor with the increased dynamics describes the Prl phenotype.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews recent advancements in DNA hydrogels for cancer theranostic applications. We aim to offer insights and inspiration for developing novel and effective methods for cancer diagnosis and therapy using DNA hydrogels.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, because of their precise pairing and simple composition, have emerged as excellent materials for the formation of gels. The application of DNA hydrogels in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer has expanded significantly through research on the properties and functions of nucleic acids. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs) such as aptamers, Small interfering RNA (siRNA), and DNAzymes have been incorporated into DNA hydrogels to enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. This review discusses various methods for forming DNA hydrogels, with a focus on pure DNA hydrogels. We then explore the innovative applications of DNA hydrogels in cancer diagnosis and therapy. DNA hydrogels have become essential biomedical materials, and this review provides an overview of current research findings and the status of DNA hydrogels in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, while also exploring future research directions.

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complex with Substituted Benzimidazole: pH Directed Organelle&#8208;Specific Localization Within Lysosome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four mononuclear iridium(III) complexes with two isomeric pairs of bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands were synthesized along with their detailed electrochemical, photophysical and pH dependent emission spectral study. The emission sensing of acid&#8208;base, ammonia and biogenic amines are reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome with great precision.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and pH dependent emission spectral behaviour of four emissive iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) with two isomeric pairs of bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands. The imidazolyl hydrogen(N&#8722;H) has been replaced by phenyl groups (N&#8722;Ph) in two ligands to understand the impact of hydrogen bonding on the photophysical properties of the complexes and it indeed plays interesting role in the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics. The pH dependent electronic spectral change is observed for two of the complexes. The enhancement of emission intensity is observed at different wavelength for pH&lt;7 and pH&gt;7 for Ir1 and Ir3. The emission sensing of biogenic amines with pka values ranging from 5.80&#8211;9.74 is reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome (pH=4.5&#8211;5) and thus image this organelle with great precision.

     alt="Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complex with Substituted Benzimidazole: pH Directed Organelle-Specific Localization Within Lysosome"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four mononuclear iridium(III) complexes with two isomeric pairs of bis-trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands were synthesized along with their detailed electrochemical, photophysical and pH dependent emission spectral study. The emission sensing of acid-base, ammonia and biogenic amines are reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome with great precision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis and pH dependent emission spectral behaviour of four emissive iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) with two isomeric pairs of &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands. The imidazolyl hydrogen(N&#8722;H) has been replaced by phenyl groups (N&#8722;Ph) in two ligands to understand the impact of hydrogen bonding on the photophysical properties of the complexes and it indeed plays interesting role in the charge-transfer dynamics. The pH dependent electronic spectral change is observed for two of the complexes. The enhancement of emission intensity is observed at different wavelength for pH&amp;lt;7 and pH&amp;gt;7 for Ir1 and Ir3. The emission sensing of biogenic amines with pk&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 5.80&#8211;9.74 is reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome (pH=4.5&#8211;5) and thus image this organelle with great precision. The detail electronic spectra and electrochemical behaviour were reported here along with TDDFT results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Noncanonical Substrate Library for Protease Profiling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded noncanonical peptide library is conjugated with a biotin molecule at its N&#8208;terminus for immobilization on a solid support. Upon protease hydrolysis, the substrate peptides are hydrolyzed, and the attached DNA tags are released to identify the sequences of the peptides. This technology is useful for discovering protease substrate preferences.







Abstract
Profiling the substrate sequence preferences of proteases is important for understanding both biological functions as well as for designing protease inhibitors. Several methods are available for profiling the sequence specificity of proteases. However, there is currently no rapid and high&#8208;throughput method to profile specificity of proteases for noncanonical substrates. In this study, we described a strategy to use a DNA&#8208;encoded noncanonical substrate library to identify the protease substrates composed of both canonical and noncanonical amino acids. This approach uses a DNA&#8208;encoded peptide library and introduces a biotin molecule at the N&#8208;terminus to immobilize the library on a solid support. Upon protease hydrolysis, the released DNA tag of the substrate peptides can be sequenced to identify the substrate structures. Using this approach, we profiled trypsin and fibroblast activation protein &#945; and discovered noncanonical substrates that were more efficiently cleaved than the commonly used substrates. The identified substrates of FAP were further used to design corresponding covalent inhibitors containing non&#8208;canonical sequences with high potency for the target protease. Overall, our approach can aid in the development of new protease substrates and inhibitors.

         <title>Untangling the Complexity and Impact of Tau Protein Ubiquitination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tau is a neuronal protein that aggregates under pathological conditions. This concept article highlights recent advances in understanding how ubiquitination of tau plays a role in both physiological and pathological conditions. We focus on enzymatic and semi&#8208;synthetic conjugation, aggregation, conformational transitions, and clearance mechanisms.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered protein highly expressed in neuronal axons. In healthy neurons, tau regulates microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth. However, pathological conditions can trigger aberrant tau aggregation into insoluble filaments, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau undergoes diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs), suggesting complex regulation and potentially varied functions. Among PTMs, the role and mechanisms of ubiquitination in physiology and disease have remained enigmatic. The past three decades have witnessed the emergence of key studies on tau protein ubiquitination. In this concept, we discuss how these investigations have begun to shed light on the ubiquitination patterns of physiological and pathological tau, the responsible enzymatic machinery, and the influence of ubiquitination on tau aggregation. We also provide an overview of the semi&#8208;synthetic methods that have enabled in&#8197;vitro investigations of conformational transitions of tau induced by ubiquitin modification. Finally, we discuss future perspectives in the field necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tau ubiquitination and clearance.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;like Aggregation Propensities of Metabolites&#8208; Homogentisic Acid, N&#8208;Acetyl Aspartic Acid and Isovaleric Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of metabolites which gets accumulated in rare inborn errors of metabolisms namely alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia were studied. The results presented strongly suggest their aggregation may follow an amyloidogenic pathway.







Abstract
The transformation of metabolites into amyloidogenic aggregates represent an intriguing dimension in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders, including alkaptonuria, canavan disease, and isovaleric acidemia. Central to this phenomenon are the metabolites homogentisic acid (HA), N&#8208;acetyl aspartic acid (NAA), and isovaleric acid (IVA), which we found, weave an intricate network of self&#8208;assembled structures. Leveraging an array of microscopy techniques, we traced the morphological behavior of these assemblies that exhibit concentration and time&#8208;dependent morphological transitions from isolated globules to clustered aggregates. MD simulation studies suggest significant role of hydrogen bonding interactions in the aggregation process. While displaying strong amyloidogenic propensity in solution, these aged aggregates were significantly cytotoxic to mouse neural N2a cell lines. In vivo effect in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode further validated cytotoxicity of aggregates. Our findings provide fresh insights to amyloidogenic nature of HA, NAA, and IVA aggregates and their possible role in associated metabolic disorders such as alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia.

         <title>The Structural Diversity of Encapsulin Protein Shells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulin nanocompartments are one of the most diverse and widespread classes of prokaryotic protein compartments. This review focuses on the structural diversity of encapsulins with a focus on shell structure, pore properties, and domain insertions and fusions found within the encapsulin shell protein.







Abstract
Subcellular compartmentalization is a universal feature of all cells. Spatially distinct compartments, be they lipid&#8208; or protein&#8208;based, enable cells to optimize local reaction environments, store nutrients, and sequester toxic processes. Prokaryotes generally lack intracellular membrane systems and usually rely on protein&#8208;based compartments and organelles to regulate and optimize their metabolism. Encapsulins are one of the most diverse and widespread classes of prokaryotic protein compartments. They self&#8208;assemble into icosahedral protein shells and are able to specifically internalize dedicated cargo enzymes. This review discusses the structural diversity of encapsulin protein shells, focusing on shell assembly, symmetry, and dynamics. The properties and functions of pores found within encapsulin shells will also be discussed. In addition, fusion and insertion domains embedded within encapsulin shell protomers will be highlighted. Finally, future research directions for basic encapsulin biology, with a focus on the structural understand of encapsulins, are briefly outlined.

They self-assemble into icosahedral protein shells and are able to specifically internalize dedicated cargo enzymes. This review discusses the structural diversity of encapsulin protein shells, focusing on shell assembly, symmetry, and dynamics. The properties and functions of pores found within encapsulin shells will also be discussed. In addition, fusion and insertion domains embedded within encapsulin shell protomers will be highlighted. Finally, future research directions for basic encapsulin biology, with a focus on the structural understand of encapsulins, are briefly outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Thermostable Heme Protein Fold Adapted for Stereoselective C&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation Using Peroxygenase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber as a source of a thermostable protein fold for biocatalyst design. By modifying the I&#8208;helix, we have transformed it into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE) that enantioselectively oxidises &#946;&#8208;ionone into (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ionone with 94&#8201;% e.e. The enzyme exhibited high stability, resisting 20&#8197;mM H2O2 and 20&#8201;% organic solvent, withstanding 60&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;hour and 30&#8201;&#176;C for 365&#8197;days, and supported over 1700 turnovers.







Abstract
Thermostable protein folds of natural and synthetic origin are highly sought&#8208;after templates for biocatalyst generation due to their enhanced stability to elevated temperatures which overcomes one of the major limitations of applying enzymes for synthesis. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are a family of heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases that catalyse the oxidation of their substrates in a highly stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner. The CYP enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber binds the norisoprenoid &#946;&#8208;ionone and was employed as a scaffold for catalyst design. The I&#8208;helix was modified to convert this enzyme from a monooxygenase into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE), enabling the enantioselective oxidation of &#946;&#8208;ionone to (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ionone (94&#8201;% e.e.). The enzyme was resistant to 20&#8197;mM H2O2, 20&#8201;% (v/v) of organic solvent, supported over 1700 turnovers and was fully functional after incubation at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h and 30&#8201;&#176;C for 365&#8197;days. The reaction was scaled&#8208;up to generate multi milligram quantities of the product for characterisation. Overall, we demonstrate that sourcing a CYP protein fold from an extremophile enabled the design of a highly stable enzyme for stereoselective C&#8722;H bond activation only using H2O2 as the oxidant, providing a viable strategy for future biocatalyst design.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzymatic Cascade for Toxicant Degradation and Sugar Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot biocatalytic cascade for sugar acid production not only breaks down hazardous chemicals and generates benzoquinone but also enhances antioxidant activity and water uptake in hydrogels. This is achieved through the coordinated action of multiple enzymes, including organophosphate hydrolase (OPD), HadA monooxygenase (HadA), thermostable flavin reductase (C1&#8208;A58P), Bacillus simplex formate dehydrogenase (BsFDH), and pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH).







Abstract
This study introduces a novel one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade approach for converting toxicants and continuously generating an electron acceptor for production of sugar acids. This method offers a promising solution to concerns about pesticide toxicity and environmental contamination by transforming hazardous substances into a useful electron acceptor. This acceptor is then utilized to produce valuable chemicals with broad industrial applications, particularly in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. The cascade reaction employs organophosphate hydrolase (OPD) to convert pesticides into 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP), which is subsequently transformed into 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone by HadA monooxygenase (HadA). 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone serves as an electron acceptor in the catalysis of sugar acid formation via pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH). The results indicate that this cascade reaction effectively converts lactose to lactobionic acid and xylose to 2&#8208;keto&#8208;xylonic acid. The latter can be further processed into xylonic acid through NaBH4 reduction. Notably, the one&#8208;pot reaction yields up to 10&#8201;% higher compared to the direct addition of 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. The synthesized xylonic acid exhibits exceptional water uptake properties in hydrogels, and the synthesized lactobionic acid shows antioxidant activity comparable to well&#8208;established antioxidants. These findings demonstrate the technological viability of these reaction cascades for various applications.

         <title>Discovery of 18F Labeled AZD5213 Derivatives as Novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Radioligands Targeting Histamine Subtype&#8208;3 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design and radiosynthesis of two H3 radioligands for PET imaging, namely, [18F]1 and [18F]2. Both radioligands exhibited high radio yields and stability in rodents, NHPs, and human serums. ARG and PET studies revealed that [18F]1 and [18F]2 have moderate uptake in rodent brains but no blocking effects by the pretreatment of unlabeled compounds 1 and 2.







Abstract
The histamine subtype 3 (H3) receptor is an important drug target in the central nervous system (CNS), and PET imaging offers a promising technique for the noninvasive evaluation of CNS disease related to the H3 receptor. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated the binding effects of [18F]H3&#8211;2404 and [18F]H3&#8211;2405 by modifying the structure of AZD5213, a selective H3 antagonist. These two radioligands were prepared in high radiochemical yields and displayed stability in serum. The in&#8197;vitro autoradiographic study in rat brain tissue and the following in&#8197;vivo PET studies in mice demonstrated sufficient brain uptake but predominantly non&#8208;specific distribution in rodent brain. Although these data suggest that [18F]H3&#8211;2404 and [18F]H3&#8211;2405 are unsuitable as PET tracers for brain imaging of the H3 receptor, this study provides a valuable attempt for optimizing 18F labeled radiotracers based on AZD5213.

         <title>Hydrophobic Domain Modulation of Chemical Responsiveness in a Bolaamphiphile&#8208;Based Supramolecular Monomer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils modulation of the hydrophobic domain length on the supramolecular polymerization and degradation of self&#8208;immolative squaramide&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles. Spacers less than eight methylenes yield spherical nanostructures, while above polymerize into supramolecular filaments degradable by glutathione through cyclization&#8208;elimination of the self&#8208;immolative spacer with distinct kinetics ranging from hours to days.







Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative chemistries that respond in an irreversible manner to external stimuli are highly attractive to permanently degrade filamentous supramolecular biomaterials. Within the monomer, a balance needs to be struck between its capacity to be supramolecularly polymerized and degraded at an appropriate rate for a given application. Herein, we unravel the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships of a library of squaramide&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles bearing a central disulfide&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative spacer to construct supramolecular polymers responsive to chemical stimuli in aqueous solutions. We examine the impact of changing the alkyl domain length (2 to 12 methylene units) on the formation of supramolecular filaments and their rate of degradation in response to a biological antioxidant, glutathione. A minimum of an octyl spacer is required to robustly form supramolecular polymers that can be irreversibly degraded through a cyclization&#8208;elimination reaction of the self&#8208;immolative spacer triggered by thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. Further increasing the peripheral alkyl chain length to a decyl spacer increases the ordered packing of the amphiphiles, hindering their chemical degradation. This study provides a framework to design chemically responsive filamentous supramolecular polymers based on bolaamphiphiles that can be irreversibly degraded in aqueous solutions for their eventual application as biomedical materials.

         <title>Optogenetic Tools for Regulating RNA Metabolism and Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely review of various current chemical and genetically encodable strategies to photocontrol the transcription, splicing, post&#8208;transcriptional modification, translation, degradation, and phase separation properties and functions of cellular RNA molecules.







Abstract
RNA molecules play a vital role in linking genetic information with various cellular processes. In recent years, a variety of optogenetic tools have been engineered for regulating cellular RNA metabolism and functions. These highly desirable tools can offer non&#8208;intrusive control with spatial precision, remote operation, and biocompatibility. Here, we would like to review these currently available approaches that can regulate RNAs with light: from non&#8208;genetically encodable chemically modified oligonucleotides to genetically encoded RNA aptamers that recognize photosensitive small&#8208;molecule or protein ligands. Some key applications of these optogenetic tools will also be highlighted to illustrate how they have been used for regulating all aspects of the RNA life cycle: from RNA synthesis, maturation, modification, and translation to their degradation, localization, and phase separation control. Some current challenges and potential practical utilizations of these RNA optogenetic tools will also be discussed.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cyclization by Vanadium Chloroperoxidase for Synthesis of 4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones belong to the class of the secondary metabolite 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins. They exhibit a wide range of biological activities. These compounds can be synthesized through halocyclization using hypervalent iodine species or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, followed by hydrolysis. Nonetheless, the reactions required specific conditions and generated toxic byproducts. In this study, Curvularia inaequalis vanadium chloroperoxidase (CiVCPO) catalyzed the chemoenzymatic cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids with different electron&#8208;donating groups (1a&#8208;1e) to produce good yields of 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones (3a&#8208;3e) by adding KBr and H2O2 in citrate buffer (pH 5). The reaction mixture contained 30% DMSO to improve substrate solubility without enzyme activity loss. The condition is more environmentally friendly than chemical methods. Therefore, it offers an alternative approach for synthesizing 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct Effects of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein Segments on Structural Stability, Amyloidogenic Potential, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloidosis is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins, called amyloid fibrils, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. Recent studies on the amyloidogenesis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8209;2 protein segments have raised concerns on their potential link to post&#8208;infection neurodegeneration, however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the structure, stability, and amyloidogenic propensity of a nine&#8208;residue segment (SK9) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein and their impact on neuronal protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) aggregation. Specifically, the amino acid sequence of the SK9 wildtype has been modified from a basic and positively charged peptide (SFYVYSRVK), to a nearly neutral and more hydrophobic peptide (SAAVASAVK, labelled as SK9 var1), and to an acidic and positively charged peptide (SFYVYSRVK, labelled as SK9 var2). Our findings reveal that the SK9 wildtype exhibited a pronounced amyloidogenic propensity due to its disordered and unstable nature, while the SK9 variants possessed more ordered and stable structures preventing the amyloid formation. Significantly, the SK9 wildtype demonstrated distinct effect on &#945;Syn aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology to facilitate the formation of &#945;Syn aggregates with enhanced resistance against enzymatic degradation. This study highlights the potential of modifying short peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune their properties, providing insights into understanding and regulating viral&#8208;induced amyloid aggregations.</dc:description>

         <title>Previously Published Phosphatase Probes have Limited Utility Due to their Unspecific Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study evaluates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) probes targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases, including three direct electrophiles and three quinone methide&#8208;based traps. Despite previously reported success in purified enzyme assays, all probes show unspecific labelling or non&#8208;activity&#8208;based behaviour. Quinone methide&#8208;based traps also cause &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, limiting their potential for ABPP and inhibitor development in phosphatase research.







Abstract
This study explores the use of activity&#8208;based protein profiling to study protein tyrosine phosphatases. With the discovery of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors, this enzyme family has resurfaced as interesting drug targets. Therefore, we envisioned that previously described direct electrophiles and quinone methide&#8208;based traps targeting phosphatases could be applied in competitive activity&#8208;based protein profiling assays. This study evaluates three direct electrophiles, specifically, a vinyl sulfonate, a vinyl sulfone, and an &#945;&#8208;bromobenzylphosphonate as well as three quinone methide&#8208;based traps as activity&#8208;based probes. For all these moieties it was previously shown that they could selectively engage in assays with purified or overexpressed phosphatases in bacterial lysates. However, this study demonstrates that probes based on these moieties all suffer from unspecific labelling. Direct electrophiles were either unspecific or not activity&#8208;based, while quinone methide&#8208;based traps showed dependence on phosphatase activity but also resulted in unspecific labelling due to diffusion after activation. This phenomenon, termed &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, occurred even with catalytically inactive SHP2 mutants. We concluded that alternative strategies or chemistries are needed to apply activity&#8208;based protein profiling in phosphatase research. Moreover, this study shows that quinone methide&#8208;based designs have limited potential in probe and inhibitor development strategies due to their intrinsic reactivity.

         <title>Enhancing Cellular and Enzymatic Properties Through In Vivo Continuous Evolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous evolution, as a powerful tool in evolutionary engineering, is discussed in this article based on non&#8208;targeted, targeted and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation. The aim is to provide researchers with guidance for selecting appropriate evolutionary tools and to offer insights for the development of future continuous evolution.







Abstract
Directed evolution seeks to evolve target genes at a rate far exceeding the natural mutation rate, thereby endowing cellular and enzymatic properties with desired traits. In vivo continuous directed evolution achieves these purposes by generating libraries within living cells, enabling a continuous cycle of mutant generation and selection, enhancing the exploration of gene variants. Continuous evolution has become powerful tools for unraveling evolution mechanism and improving cellular and enzymatic properties. This review categorizes current continuous evolution into three distinct classes: non&#8208;targeted chromosomal, targeted chromosomal, and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation approaches. It also compares various continuous evolution strategies based on different principles, providing a reference for selecting suitable methods for specific evolutionary goals. Furthermore, this review discusses the two primary limitations for further widespread application of in&#8197;vivo continuous evolution, which are lack of general applicability and insufficient mutagenic capability. We envision that developing generally applicable mutagenic components and methods to enhance mutation rates for in&#8197;vivo continuous evolution are promising future directions for wide range applications of continuous evolution.

         <title>Synthesis of Substituted Acyclic and Cyclic N&#8208;Alkylhydrazines by Enzymatic Reductive Hydrazinations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine reductases (IREDs) offer promising synthesis routes for chiral amines. We have demonstrated reductive amination of diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines, catalyzed by Myxococcus stipitatus IRED. Incorporating a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system showcases the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlighting IREDs&#8217; biocatalytic potential.







Abstract
Imine reductases (IREDs) provide promising opportunities for the synthesis of various chiral amines. Initially, asymmetric imine reduction was reported, followed by reductive aminations of aldehydes and ketones via imines. Herein we present the reductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), catalyzed by the IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus. In analogy to IRED&#8208;catalyzed reductive aminations, various carbonyls and dicarbonyls could react with simple hydrazines to produce substituted acyclic and cyclic N&#8208;alkylhydrazines. By incorporating and scaling up a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system, we demonstrated the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of an H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlightling the potential of IREDs in biocatalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of a 13C/2H Labeled Building Block to Probe the Phosphotyrosine Interactome Using Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protected 13C/2H&#8208;labeled phosphotyrosine (pTyr) building block was synthesized from commercially available isotope sources for use in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The resulting isolated &#1013;&#8208;aromatic 13C&#8208;1H correlations provide valuable data for studying interactions with pTyr&#8208;binding proteins at atomic resolution using NMR spectroscopy techniques. As an initial demonstration, intermolecular NOE and chemical shift perturbation data were recorded to visualize the binding of a pTyr&#8208;containing peptide, derived from the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor to the PLC&#947;&#8208;1 SH2 domain.







Abstract
Phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition coordinates the assembly of protein complexes, thus controlling key events of cell cycle, cell development and programmed cell death. Although many aspects of membrane receptor function and intracellular signal transduction have been deciphered in the last decades, the details of how phosphorylation alters protein&#8208;protein interaction and creates regulating switches of protein activity and localization often remains unclear. We developed a synthetic route to a protected phophotyrosine building block with isolated 13C&#8208;1H spins in the aromatic ring. The compound can be used for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and readily applied to study affinity, dynamics and interactions on an atomic level using NMR spectroscopy. As a first example, we prepared an isotopologue of a pTyr containing 12mer peptide (pY1021) as part of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor to analyze the binding to the phospholipase C&#8208;&#947; (PLC&#947;&#8208;1) SH2 domain.

         <title>Marker&#8208;dependent cleavage of RNA by binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz) and binary DNA machines (biDNM)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) can be used to suppress specific RNA in cells and thus have been explored for gene therapy. Despite extensive effort, there is no clinically significant OGT for treating cancer. Low efficiency of OGT is one of the problems. Earlier, we proposed to address this problem by suppressing most vital genes in cancer cells e.g. housekeeping genes. To achieve specific activation of the OGT agents in cancer but not in normal cells, we designed binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz), which is activated by cancer&#8208;related nucleic acid sequences. This work is devoted to BiDz optimization using cancer marker&#8208;related sequence as an activator and three folded RNA targets. To achieve efficient binding of folded RNA, the BiDz design was equipped with RNA binding/unwinding arms, a construction that was dabbed &#8216;BiDz machines&#8217; (BiDM). BiDM was designed to have improved both iRNA cleavage rates and RNA recognition in comparison with BiDz. Further development of DNA nanotechnology&#8208;inspired agents can advance OGT technology in treating cancer, viral infections, and genetic disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid and Sensitive MicroPlate Assay (MPSA) Using an Alkyne&#8208;Modified CMP&#8208;Sialic Acid Donor to Evaluate Human Sialyltransferase Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human sialyltransferases primarily utilize CMP&#8208;Sias, especially transferring Neu5Ac from CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac to various acceptors. Advances in chemical biology have led to the synthesis of novel CMP&#8208;Sia donors suitable for bioorthogonal reactions in cell&#8208;based assays. However, the compatibility of these donors with all human enzymes remains uncertain. We synthesized a non&#8208;natural CMP&#8208;Sia donor with an alkyne modification on the N&#8208;acyl group of Neu5Ac, which was effectively used by human ST6Gal I and ST3Gal I. A sensitive MicroPlate Sialyltransferase Assay (MPSA) was developed and expanded to a panel of 13 human STs acting on glycoproteins. All assayed enzymes tolerated CMP&#8208;SiaNAl, allowing for the determination of kinetic parameters and turnover numbers. This study enhances the biochemical characterization of human sialyltransferases and opens new avenues for developing sialyltransferase inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Support for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Peptidyl&#8208;tRNA Mimics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrolysis&#8208;resistant RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates that mimic peptidyl&#8208;tRNAs are often required for structural and functional studies of protein synthesis at the ribosome. These conjugates can be synthesized by solid&#8208;phase chemical synthesis, which allows maximum flexibility in both the peptide and RNA sequence. The commonly used strategy is based on (3&#8217;&#8208;N&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine solid supports, which already contain the first C&#8208;terminal amino acid of the target peptidyl chain. This is a limitation in the sense that different individual supports must be synthesized for different C&#8208;terminal amino acids. In this study, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by introducing a novel universal support. The key is a free ribose 3&#8217;&#8208;NH2 group that can be coupled to any amino acid. This is made possible by a photocleavable ether moiety that links the ribose 2&#8217;&#8208;O to the support, thus avoiding the typical O&#8208;to&#8208;N migration that occurs when using 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;acyl linked solid supports. Once assembled, the conjugate is readily cleaved by UV irradiation. The structural integrity of the obtained peptidyl&#8208;RNA conjugates was verified by mass spectrometry analysis. In conclusion, the new photocleavable solid support makes the synthesis of 3&#8217;&#8208;peptidyl tRNA mimics of different peptidyl chains significantly more efficient compared to the commonly used approaches.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrolysis-resistant RNA-peptide conjugates that mimic peptidyl-tRNAs are often required for structural and functional studies of protein synthesis at the ribosome. These conjugates can be synthesized by solid-phase chemical synthesis, which allows maximum flexibility in both the peptide and RNA sequence. The commonly used strategy is based on (3&#8217;-N-aminoacyl)-3&#8217;-amino-3&#8217;-deoxyadenosine solid supports, which already contain the first C-terminal amino acid of the target peptidyl chain. This is a limitation in the sense that different individual supports must be synthesized for different C-terminal amino acids. In this study, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by introducing a novel universal support. The key is a free ribose 3&#8217;-NH2 group that can be coupled to any amino acid.

         <title>Evaluation of Potency and Specificity of Cryptophycin&#8208;Loaded Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enhanced variant of the antimitotic toxin cryptophycin was conjugated to the anti&#8208;Her2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) Trastuzumab upon Michael addition. Either antibodies with freed hinge&#8208;region cysteines or THIOMAB formats with engineered cysteines in the mAbs light chain were added to a maleimide derivative of cryptophycin. These Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs) showed retained binding to Her2 positive tumor cells and highly efficient cell killing in double&#8208;digit pM range on high Her2&#8208;expressing SK&#8208;BR&#8208;3 cells. Two ADCs (DAR&#160;6, DAR&#160;3) showed superior cell killing of the cell lines JIMT&#8208;1 and RT112 with medium receptor expression level in comparison with a DAR&#160;6 MMAE ADC serving as reference. The observed cell cytotoxicity is target&#8208;dependent since no impact on cell viability was observed for low Her2&#8208;expressing MDA&#8208;MB468 cells. Particularly the DAR&#160;3 ADC in THIOMAB format exhibiting desirable biophysical properties and high potency emerged as a promising candidate for further in vivo investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their unique attributes, including reversibility, specificity, directionality, and tunability, supramolecular biomaterials have evolved as an excellent alternative to conventional biomaterials like polymers, ceramics, and metals. Supramolecular hydrogels, in particular, have garnered significant interest because their fibrous architecture, high water content, and interconnected 3D network resemble the extracellular matrix to some extent. Consequently, supramolecular hydrogels have been used to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. Supramolecular conductive hydrogels combine the advantages of supramolecular soft materials with the electrical properties of metals, making them highly relevant for electrogenic tissue engineering. Given the versatile applications of these hydrogels, it is essential to periodically review high&#8208;quality research in this area. In this review, we focus on recent advances in supramolecular conductive hydrogels, particularly their applications in tissue engineering. We discuss the conductive components of these hydrogels and highlight notable reports on their use in cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering. Additionally, we outline potential future developments in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Compounds: Extended Ring Systems for Improved Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate compounds with varying degrees of aromatic functionality have been synthesized and fully characterized. This includes cyclic voltammetry and the analysis of four new structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The compounds cytotoxic potential has been determined by MTT screening against pancreatic carcinoma (MIA PaCa&#8208;2), ovarian adenocarcinoma (A2780), breast adenocarcinomas (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7) and normal epithelial retinal (ARPE&#8208;19). The compounds show a general trend, where increasing the number of aromatic rings in the molecule yields an increase in cytotoxicity and follows the trend anthracenyl &gt; naphthyl &gt; phenyl &gt; methyl. The compounds are particularly sensitive to the triple negative cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, and the potential modes of action have been studied by production of reactive oxygen species using fluorescence microscopy and cell morphology using Scanning Electron Microscopy. All assays highlight the ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate with an anthracenyl substituent to be the lead compound in this library. The decomposition was also observed within cells, to give a cytotoxic fluorescent molecule, which has been visualized by confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Precursor&#8208;Directed Biosynthesis of Panepoxydone Derivatives with Nitric Oxide Production Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Panepoxydone is a natural NF&#8208;&#1082;B inhibitor isolated from basidiomycetes belonging to the genus Panus and Lentinus. It is biosynthesized from prenylhydroquinone through successive hydroxylation, epoxidation, and reduction reactions. In this study, we establish an efficient precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis strategy for the structural expansion of panepoxydone based on its biosynthetic pathway. Supplementation of the panepoxydone&#8208;producing strain, Panus rudis, with various prenylhydroquinone analogues enabled the production of fourteen previously undescribed panepoxydone derivatives, panepoxyquinoid A&#8208;N (2&#8722;14). The obtained panepoxydone derivatives together with their parental molecules were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on LPS&#8208;induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds 1, 5&#8208;6, 10&#8208;11, and 14&#8208;15 displayed significant suppressive effects on LPS&#8208;induced NO production with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 to 30.1 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanozymes as Antibacterial Agents: New Concerns in Design and Enhancement Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes exhibiting natural enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities as antibacterial agents present several advantages, including high stability, low cost, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity, ease of preparation and storage, and minimal bacterial resistance. Consequently, they have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the rapid expansion of antimicrobial nanozyme research has resulted in pioneering reviews that do not comprehensively address emerging concerns and enhancement strategies within this field. This paper first summarizes the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of nanozymes; subsequently, we outline new research considerations for designing antibacterial nanozymes with enhanced functionality and biosafety features such as degradable, imageable, targeted, and bacterial&#8208;binding nanozymes as well as those capable of selectively targeting pathogenic bacteria while sparing normal cells and probiotics. Furthermore, we review novel enhancement strategies involving external physical stimuli (light or ultrasound), the introduction of extrinsic small molecules, and self&#8208;supplying H2O2 to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes under physiological conditions characterized by low concentrations of H2O2 and O2. Additionally, we present non&#8208;redox nanozymes that operate independently of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) alongside those designed to combat less common pathogenic bacteria. Finally, we discuss current issues, challenges faced in the field, and future prospects for antibacterial nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel concept for cleavable linkers applicable to conjugation chemistry &#8211; design, synthesis and characterization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linkers with disulfide bonds are the only cleavable linkers that utilize physiological thiol gradients as a trigger to initiate the intracellular drug release cascade. Herein, we present a novel concept exploiting the thiol gradient phenomena to design a new class of cleavable linker with no disulfide bond. To support the concept, an electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamide&#8208;based cleavable linker amenable to conjugation of drug molecules with targeting agents, was developed. Modulating the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl sulfonamide was critical to the balance between the stability and drug release. Favorable stability and payload release in human serum under physiologically relevant thiol concentrations was demonstrated with two potent cytotoxics. Intracellular payload release was further validated in cell&#8208;based assay in context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugate generated from monoclonal antibody and sulfonamide containing linker. To support the proposed release mechanism, possible downstream by&#8208;products formed from the drug&#8208;linker adduct were characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Perspective on Oxygen Activation Chemistry by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze a panoply of chemical transformations essential for living organisms. Through oxygen activation, flavoenzymes could generate diverse flavin&#8208;oxygen species that mediate numerous redox and non&#8208;redox transformations. In this review, we highlight the extensive oxygen activation chemistry at two sites of the flavin cofactor: C4a and N5 sites. Oxygen activation at the C4a site generates flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H) species for various monooxygenation reactions, while activation at the N5 site produces negatively charged flavin&#8208;N5OOH species, which act as highly reactive nucleophiles or bases. The selective oxygen activation at either the C4a or N5 site depends on the nature of substrates and is controlled by the active site architecture. These insights have expanded our understanding of oxygen activation chemistry in flavoenzymes and will serve as a foundation for future efforts in enzyme engineering and redesign.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding mode of cyclic chemerin&#8208;9 peptide and chemerinS157 protein at CMKLR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is activated by the adipokine and chemoattractant protein chemerin. Cryo&#8208;EM structures of chemerin&#8208;9&#8208;CMKLR1&#8208;Gi have been published, where chemerin&#8208;9 is the nonapeptide of the C terminus of chemerinS157. Chemerin&#8208;9 is as active as the full&#8208;length protein in Ca2+&#8208;release but shows differences in equilibrium read&#8208;outs. An equally potent cyclic chemerin&#8208;9 variant (cC9) was reported previously. Now, we have built a computational model of CMKLR1 to investigate the binding mode of cC9 and chemerinS157 in comparison to chemerin&#8208;9. Differences were investigated using CMKLR1 variants. Double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis identified CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 as the relevant position for Phe8&#8208;binding of cC9. Energy contribution revealed slight differences in Phe8&#8208;binding to CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 and space for larger residues. This was confirmed as the chemerin&#8208;9 variant with 1&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;L&#8208;alanine at position 8 showed a 4&#8208;fold increased potency of 2 nM&#160; (pEC50=8.6&#177;0.15). While chemerin&#8208;9 and cC9 share their interactions at the CMKLR1, chemerinS157 tolerates most mutations of CMKLR1 in the deep binding site. The computational model of chemerinS157 suggests a &#946;&#8208;sheet interaction between the N&#8208;terminal CMKLR1&#8208;segment I25VVL28 and the &#946;&#8208;sheet D108KVLGRLVH116 of ChemS157, which was confirmed experimentally. Our data expand the knowledge by identifying the binding mode of chemerinS157 and cC9 at CMKLR1 facilitating future structure&#8208;based drug design.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving CsOAC Activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for directed Production of Olivetolic Acid through Rational Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. It is produced through a unique interaction between the two proteins, olivetol synthase (CsOLS) and olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC). When the OA biosynthesis is transferred to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, olivetol (OL) is produced as a side product, even with a high enhancement of copy number of CsOAC. In order to increase the OA titer while decreasing the OL titer in S. cerevisiae, rational design was applied to CsOAC using in silico approaches such as protein&#8208;ligand docking to find potential protein variants. In vivo screening and also testing different approaches for both proteins was applied to identify the best performing variants of CsOAC. Four variants were identified that gave the desired properties. The best CsOAC variant, G82A/L92Y, resulted in a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in OA production and a shift in the ratio between the two products towards OA.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;based Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer has long been a significant threat to human life and health. The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, which possess the same specificity and affinity as antibodies, are advantageous due to their synthetic accessibility and ease of modification, providing novel insights for immune checkpoint research. In this review, we outline the key aptamers currently developed for immune checkpoints such as CTLA&#8208;4, PD&#8208;1, PD&#8208;L1 and Siglec&#8208;15. We explore their potential in therapeutic strategies, including functionalizing or engineering aptamers for covalent binding, valency control, and nanostructure assembly, as well as investigating molecular mechanisms such as glycosylated protein functions and cell&#8208;cell interactions. Finally, the future applications of aptamers in immunotherapy are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and evaluation of peptide inhibitors targeting the dimerization of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) seriously impacted public health. The evolutionarily conserved viral chymotrypsin&#8208;like main protease (Mpro) is an important target for anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 drug development. Previous studies have shown that the eight N&#8208;terminal amino acids (N8) of SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro are essential for its dimerization, and are used to design inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro dimerization. Here, we established a simple readout assay using SDS&#8208;PAGE and Coomassie blue staining to measure inhibitory activity of N8 peptide derived from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. To optimize its inhibitory effect, we then modified the side&#8208;chain length, charge, and hydrophilicity of the N8 peptide, and introduced a mutated Mpro recognition sequence. As a result, we obtained a series of potent peptide inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro, with N8&#8208;A24 being the most efficient with an IC50 value of 1.44 mM. We observed that N8&#8208;A24 reduced Mpro dimerization with an IC50 value of 0.86 mM. Molecular docking revealed that N8&#8208;A24 formed hydrogen bond interactions with critical dimeric interface residues, thus inhibiting its dimerization and activity. In conclusion, our study not only discovers a series of peptide inhibitors targeting the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro dimerization, but also provides a promising strategy for the rational design of new inhibitors against COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The diazo group is an important functional group in organic synthesis because it confers high reactivity to the compounds and has been applied in various chemical reactions, such as the Sandmeyer reaction, Wolff rearrangement, cyclopropanation, and C&#8208;N bond formation with active methylene compounds. Previously, we revealed that 3&#8208;diazoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;DAA), which is potentially produced by several actinomycete species and contains an aromatic diazo group, is a biosynthetic intermediate of avenalumic acid. In this study, we aimed to construct a production system for phenyldiazene derivatives by adding several active methylene compounds to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing recombinant actinomycete. First, acetoacetanilide and its derivatives, which have an active methylene and are raw materials for arylide yellow dyes, were individually added to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing actinomycete. When their metabolites were analyzed, each expected compound with a phenyldiazenyl moiety was detected in the culture extract. Moreover, we established a one&#8208;pot in vitro enzymatic production system for the same phenyldiazene derivatives using a highly reactive diazotase, CmaA6. These results showed that the diazo group of natural products is an attractive tool for expanding the structural diversity of natural products both in vivo and in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Multipartite Fluorogenic Sensors for Monitoring Tyrosine Phosphatase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic substrates are essential tools for studying the activity of many enzymes including the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Here, we have taken the first step toward the development of genetically encodable sensors for PTP activity using fluorescent and fluorogen&#8208;activating proteins. The Fluorescence&#8208;Activating and absorption Shifting Tag (FAST) is a small protein that becomes fluorescent upon binding to a small molecule dye. We demonstrate that FAST protein can be used as a sensor for PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of phosphorylated dye molecules. Phosphorylated 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (pHBR) is not able to bind to the FAST protein and induce fluorescence, but provides a sensitive assay for PTP activity, readily detecting 100 pM concentrations of PTP1B in the presence of FAST with a kcat value of 19 &#177; 1 s&#8208;1 and a KM value of 93 &#177; 3 &#181;M. In addition, while phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of split GFP does not result in appreciable change in fluorescence of the reconstituted protein, phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of the split FAST protein abrogates fluorescence. Upon PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide, the ability of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal components to form a fluorescent complex with the small molecule dye is restored, leading to fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidrug Resistance Reversed by Maleimide Interactions. A Biological and Synthetic Overview for an Emerging Field</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multidrug Resistance (MDR) can be considered one of the most frightening adaptation types in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and eukaryotic cells. It allows the organisms to survive the attack of many drugs used in the daily basis. This force the development of new and more complex, highly specific drugs to fight diseases. Given the high usage of medicaments, poor variation in active chemical cores, and self&#8208;medication, the appearance of MDR is more frequent each time, and has been established as a serious medical and social problem. Over the years it has been possible the identification of several genes and proteins responsible for MDR and with that the development of blockers of them to reach MDR reversion and try to avoid a global problem. These mechanisms also have been observed in cancer cells, and several calcium channel blockers have been successful in MDR reversion, and the maleimide can be found included in them. In this review we explore the history, mechanisms, reversion efforts, and we specifically focused on the maleimide synthesis as MDR&#8208;reversers in co&#8208;administration, as well as their biological applications in a urge to expand the available information and explore a very plausible MDR reversion source</dc:description>

         <title>Structural studies and functional validation of Eugenol and Ferulic acid against Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is commonly occurring pathogen&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; associated with nosocomial infections. Infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) nature and their tendency to form biofilms. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches of treatment. In this regard, targeting an important&#160; protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface&#8208;exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it&#8217;s a promising drug target for the development of anti&#8208;microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development.&#160;To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have&#160;purified E. faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA&#916;N59).&#160; Structural studies&#160;along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were done and&#160;confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti&#8208;biofilm assays and inhibition assay of selected ligands were also done against E. faecalis individually and in synergistic combinations.&#160; Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to EfSrtA&#916;N59 with significant interactions and show promising results.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine learning guided rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;based lysine dioxygenase improves its total turnover number</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective C&#8208;H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure&#8208;based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure&#8208;based machine&#8208;learning algorithm with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before&#8208;hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2&#8208;fold higher yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN = 160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low&#8208;barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre&#8208;existing protein engineering strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a Versatile Immunoproteasome Activity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immunoproteasome (iCP) has gained significant interest in recent years as it has been discovered to be significantly expressed under inflammatory conditions, as well as playing significant roles in several diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, viral infection, and cancer. Selective inhibitors have been generated as a method to overcome the off&#8208;target effects of current proteasome inhibitor therapeutics. However, selective probes that allow for monitoring this protein complex remain limited, hindering our understanding of the iCP. Current probes are non&#8208;selective, not commercially available, or require difficult synthesis. Here, we describe the modular synthesis and application of an iCP&#8208;selective probe. The modular nature of the synthetic strategy can enable the incorporation of different fluorophores and covalent warheads, demonstrating the versatility of this probe.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Complex&#8208;Gold Nanoparticle Hybrid for Biofilm Inhibition and Eradication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofilms, which are resistant to conventional antimicrobial treatments, pose significant challenges in medical and industrial environments. This study introduces manganese complex&#8208;gold nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;DPA&#8208;AuNPs) as a hybrid strategy for biofilm inhibition and eradication. Upon exposure to green light, these nanoparticles significantly enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. This activity substantially reduces the regrowth potential of the surviving bacteria within the biofilm, with marked efficacy noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.

This study introduces manganese complex-gold nanoparticles (Mn-DPA-AuNPs) as a hybrid strategy for biofilm inhibition and eradication. Upon exposure to green light, these nanoparticles significantly enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. This activity substantially reduces the regrowth potential of the surviving bacteria within the biofilm, with marked efficacy noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. This study highlights the potential of integrating manganese complexes with gold nanoparticles to develop advanced antimicrobial agents against resistant biofilms, offering a promising approach to enhance microbial control in diverse settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous compatible post&#8208;synthetic on&#8208;column conjugation of nucleic acids using amino&#8208;modifiers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid conjugation methodologies involves linking the nucleic acid sequence to other (bio)molecules covalently. This typically allows for nucleic acid property enhancement whether it be for therapeutic purposes, biosensing, etc. Here, we report a streamlined aqueous compatible on&#8208;column conjugation methodology using nucleic acids containing a site&#8208;specific amino&#8208;modifier. Both monophosphates and carboxylates were amenable to the conjugation strategy, allowing for the introduction of a variety of useful handles including azide, aryl, and hydrophobic groups in DNA. We find that an on&#8208;column approach is superior to post&#8208;synthetic template&#8208;directed synthesis, mainly with respect to product purification and recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>The industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp derived monosaccharides d&#8208;Galacturonic acid and l&#8208;Arabinose.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review provides a perspective on the industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp (SBP) derived monosaccharides. The broad application of these monosaccharides could contribute to bio&#8208;based alternatives and sustainable practices, essential for the transition towards a more circular economy. This review focuses on the utilization and application of two SBP monosaccharides, d&#8208;galacturonic acid (d&#8208;GalA) and l&#8208;arabinose (l&#8208;Ara), derived from pectin and hemicellulose. These polysaccharides are major components of sugar beet pulp, an important side stream of sucrose production. d&#8208;GalA and l&#8208;Ara are therefore abundant in biomass and offer unique molecular structures amenable to selective chemical or enzymatic modifications. We review their application in various industrial applications such as the development and production of bioactive compounds, home and personal care products, and other industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile and efficient protein association through chemically modified Sphingomyelin Nanosystems (SNs) for enhanced delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are biological macromolecules well known to regulate many cellular signaling mechanisms. For instance, they are very appealing for their application as therapeutic agents, presenting high specificity and activity. Nonetheless, they suffer from unfolding, instability and low bioavailability making their administration through systemic and other routes very tough. To overcome these drawbacks, drug delivery systems and nanotechnology have arisen to deliver biomolecules in a sustained manner while, at the same time, increasing dose availability, protecting the cargo without compromising proteins' bioactivity, and enhancing intracellular delivery. In this work, we proposed the optimization of sphingomyelin nanosystems (SNs) for the delivery of a wide collection of proteins (ranging from 10&#8208;500 kDa and pI) using diverse chemical association strategies. We have further characterized SNs by varied analytical methodologies. We have also carried out in vitro experiments to validate the potential of the developed formulations. As the final goal, we aim to obtain evidence of the potential use of SNs for the development of protein therapeutics.</dc:description>
