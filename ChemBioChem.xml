         <title>Peptides for Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation: An Emerging Biomaterial</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advances in peptides for liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and highlights their crucial role in drug delivery, catalysis, biosensing, and detection. We focus on the strategies used to design LLPS peptide sequences and emphasize their potential biomedical applications. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as next&#8208;generation biomaterials.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) refers to a spontaneous separation behavior of biomacromolecules under specific physiological conditions, playing a crucial role in regulating various biological processes. Recent advances in synthetic peptides have greatly improved our understanding of peptide&#8208;based coacervate droplets and expanded their applications in biomedicine. Numerous peptide sequences have been reported that undergo phase separation, enabling the concentration and sequestration of different guest molecules for purposes such as drug delivery, catalytic performance, and bioanalytical techniques. Particularly, some of these peptides offer significant advantages in controlled drug release, efficient cell transfection, accelerated reaction kinetics, and selective biomarker detection. This review provides an overview of recent developments in peptide&#8208;based LLPS, exploring various strategies for designing peptide sequences and their biomedical applications. It also addresses the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as promising biomaterials.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterisation of a Bacterial Lactoperoxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the biochemical and structural characterization of CyanoPOX, a heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16. Expressed in E.&#8197;coli, the enzyme exhibits properties similar to bovine lactoperoxidase despite low sequence identity. CyanoPOX demonstrates optimal activity in slightly acidic conditions and efficiently oxidizes various substrates. Structural analysis reveals a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor and a conserved active site pocket.







Abstract
Peroxidases belong to a group of enzymes that are widely found in animals, plants and microorganisms. These enzymes are effective biocatalysts for a wide range of oxidations on various substrates. This work presents a biochemical and structural characterization of a novel heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16, CyanoPOX. This cyanobacterial enzyme was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble, heme&#8208;containing monomeric enzyme. Although CyanoPOX shares relatively low sequence identity (37&#8201;%) with bovine lactoperoxidase, it displays comparable biochemical properties. CyanoPOX is most stable and active in slightly acidic conditions (pH 6&#8211;6.5) and moderately thermostable (melting temperature around 48&#8201;&#176;C). Several compounds that are typical substrates for mammalian lactoperoxidases were tested to establish the catalytic potential of CyanoPOX. Potassium iodide showed the highest catalytic efficiency (126&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), while various aromatic compounds were also readily converted. Structural elucidation of CyanoPOX confirmed the presence of a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor that is situated in the central core of the protein. Except for a highly similar overall structure, CyanoPOX also has a conserved active site pocket when compared with mammalian lactoperoxidases. Due to its catalytic properties and high expression in a bacterial host, this newly discovered peroxidase shows promise for applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework as Selective Fluorescence Sensors for Cancer Inducing Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as formaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol, are overexpressed in some terminal diseases like cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer&#8217;s, etc. Therefore, high&#8208;precision detection and quantification of VOCs is imperative for early diagnosis of such detrimental diseases. Non&#8208;invasive and accurate fluorescence&#8208;based detection of such analytes has garnered widespread attention. The inherent luminescent properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), resulting from their extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation, have made them suitable for sensing applications. Structural tunability and strong covalent linkers facilitate sensing by COFs. Appropriate choices of linker and skeletal units of the COF can help detect various biologically important analytes selectively. The most common linkers used in this regard is the imine linker, which can undergo excellent hydrogen bonding with different protic VOCs e.g., ethanol, methanol, etc. Besides imine detection, hydrogen bonding also proved useful for detection of aldehydes. Suitable combinations of donors and acceptors enable the COFs to have specific charge transfer interactions with many electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor VOCs. In this review, we have highlighted the syntheses of selective COFs incorporating linkers designed for sensing cancer&#8208;inducing VOCs. A detailed discussion of the interaction mechanisms between COFs and these VOCs is provided, along with examples from recent literature in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective NanoBRET Probe to Assess MAGL Inhibition in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new intracellular NanoBRET assay was developed to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. To this end, a potent reversible preclinical inhibitor was linked to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 fluorophore by means of structure&#8208;based design, and MAGL was engineered with a fused nanoluciferase (Nluc) protein as a suitable donor counterpart. The assay was validated using representative irreversible and reversible MAGL inhibitors, followed by profiling of over 1&#8217;900 project compounds. This study demonstrates the advantages of cell&#8208;based assays in accelerating compound profiling in early project stages.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;free enzymatic assays are highly useful tools in early compound profiling due to their robustness and scalability. However, their inadequacy to reflect the complexity of target engagement in a cellular environment may lead to a significantly divergent pharmacology that is eventually observed in cells. The discrepancy that emerges from properties like permeability and unspecific protein binding may largely mislead lead compound selection to undergo further chemical optimization. We report the development of a new intracellular NanoBRET assay to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. Based on a reverse design approach, a highly potent, reversible preclinical inhibitor was conjugated to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 acceptor fluorophore while retaining its overall balanced properties. An engineered MAGL&#8208;nanoluciferase (Nluc) fusion protein provided a suitable donor counterpart for the facile interrogation of intracellular ligand activity. Validation of assay conditions using a selection of known MAGL inhibitors set the stage for the evaluation of over 1&#8217;900 MAGL drug candidates derived from our discovery program. This evaluation enabled us to select compounds for further development based not only on target engagement, but also on favorable physicochemical parameters like permeability and protein binding. This study highlights the advantages of cell&#8208;based target engagement assays for accelerating compound profiling and progress at the early stages of drug discovery programs.

         <title>Design of a Bioluminescent Assay Platform for Quantitative Measurement of Histone Acetyltransferase Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive novel bioluminescent system was developed that can accurately quantify the kinetics of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) catalyzed acylation reactions. This system utilizes acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 and firefly luciferase for a coupled reaction that generates luminescence proportional to acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA) concentrations allowing for determination of AcCoA consumption by a HAT catalyzed reaction. This system can be used in high throughput for inhibition studies.







Abstract
Protein acetylation and acylation are widespread post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Histone acetyltransferase (HATs) enzymes catalyze the addition of short&#8208;chain acyl moieties to lysine residues on cellular proteins. Many HAT members are found to be dysregulated in human diseases, especially oncological processes. Screening potent and selective HAT inhibitors has promising application for therapeutic innovation. A biochemical assay for quantification of HAT activity utilizing luminescent output is highly desirable to improve upon limitations associated with the classic radiometric assay formats. Here we report the design of a bioluminescent technological platform for robust and sensitive quantification of HAT activity. This platform utilizes the metabolic enzyme acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) for a coupled reaction with firefly luciferase to generate luminescent signal relative to the HAT&#8208;catalyzed acetylation reaction. The biochemical assay was implemented in microtiter plate format and our results showed this assay sensitively detected catalytic activity of HAT enzyme p300, accurately measured its steady&#8208;state kinetic parameters of histone acetylation and measured the inhibitory potency of HAT inhibitor. This platform demonstrated excellent robustness, reproducibility, and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, with a screening window Z&#8217;=0.79. Our new bioluminescent design provides an alternative means for HAT enzymatic activity quantitation and HAT inhibitor screening.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein acetylation and acylation are widespread post-translational modifications (PTMs) in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Histone acetyltransferase (HATs) enzymes catalyze the addition of short-chain acyl moieties to lysine residues on cellular proteins. Many HAT members are found to be dysregulated in human diseases, especially oncological processes. Screening potent and selective HAT inhibitors has promising application for therapeutic innovation. A biochemical assay for quantification of HAT activity utilizing luminescent output is highly desirable to improve upon limitations associated with the classic radiometric assay formats. Here we report the design of a bioluminescent technological platform for robust and sensitive quantification of HAT activity. This platform utilizes the metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) for a coupled reaction with firefly luciferase to generate luminescent signal relative to the HAT-catalyzed acetylation reaction. The biochemical assay was implemented in microtiter plate format and our results showed this assay sensitively detected catalytic activity of HAT enzyme p300, accurately measured its steady-state kinetic parameters of histone acetylation and measured the inhibitory potency of HAT inhibitor. This platform demonstrated excellent robustness, reproducibility, and signal-to-background ratios, with a screening window Z&#8217;=0.79. Our new bioluminescent design provides an alternative means for HAT enzymatic activity quantitation and HAT inhibitor screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Antioxidants on Mechanical Properties and ROS Levels of Neuronal Cells Exposed to &#946;&#8208;Amyloid Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effects of antioxidants on oxidative stress and mechanical properties of neuronal cells exposed to &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregates. Using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy and electrochemical methods, it was highlighted how NAC and SOD1 reduce ROS&#8208;induced cellular stiffness, revealing a link between oxidative stress and cytoskeletal dynamics relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
This study aims to investigate the potential role of antioxidants in oxidative stress and its consequent impact on the mechanical properties of neuronal cells, particularly the stress induced by amyloid&#8208;beta (1&#8211;42) (A&#946;42) aggregates. A key aspect of our research involved using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy (SICM) to assess the mechanical properties (Young's modulus) of neuronal cells under oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured in single&#8208;cell using the electrochemical method by low&#8208;invasive Pt nanoelectrode. We investigated the effects of the low molecular weight antioxidant N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) on the physiological and mechanical properties of neuronal cells using SICM. Using electrochemical method and SICM, NAC effectively reduces oxidative stress and restores Young's Modulus in SH&#8208;SY5Y cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide and A&#946;42 oligomers. Our study first examined the influence of SOD1 on intracellular ROS levels in the presence of A&#946; oligomers. The investigation into the effects of SOD1 and its nanoparticle form SOD1 on SH&#8208;SY5Y cells reveals impacts on mechanical properties and oxidative stress. The combined use of SICM and electrochemical measurements provided a comprehensive understanding of how oxidative stress, including that triggered by the A&#946; oligomers affects the mechanical properties of cells.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction and Conformational Change in the Alpha&#8208;Helical Membrane Transporter BtuCD&#8208;F in the Native Cellular Envelope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, the &#945;&#8208;helical membrane proteins are located in the inner membrane (IM) and further nanoconfined into the complex cellular envelope, which additionally consists of the periplasm and the outer membrane (OM). Here, we show that the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair combined with pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy can be used to observe the conformational change of a membrane transporter in the cellular envelope.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins perform numerous critical functions essential for the survival of living organisms. Traditionally, these proteins are extracted from membranes using detergent solubilization and reconstitution into liposomes or nanodiscs. However, these processes often obscure the effects of nanoconfinement and the native environment on the structure and conformational heterogeneity of the target protein. We demonstrate that pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy, combined with the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair, enables the selective observation of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD&#8722;F in its native cellular envelope. Despite the high levels of non&#8208;specific labeling in the envelope, this orthogonal approach combined with the long phase&#8208;memory time for the Gd3+ spin enables the observation of the target protein complex at a few micromolar concentrations with high resolution. In the native envelope, vitamin B12 induces a distinct conformational shift at the BtuCD&#8208;BtuF interface, which is not observed in the micelles. This approach offers a general strategy for investigating protein&#8208;protein and protein&#8208;ligand/drug interactions and conformational changes of the alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins in their native envelope context.

Abstract
The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress in the field of biocatalysis. One of the most frequently utilized enzymes in diverse biocatalytic applications is NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs).

         <title>Towards Bacterial Resistance via the Membrane Strategy: Enzymatic, Biophysical and Biomimetic Studies of the Lipid cis&#8208;trans Isomerase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti), a heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, induces a swift membrane rigidification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under stress conditions that impede bacterial growth. This study provides understanding of the enzyme's heme coordination and redox state as well as some insights into the catalytic mechanism and reveals that phospholipids, alongside fatty acids, serve as substrate for this metalloenzyme.







Abstract
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti) is a periplasmic heme&#8208;c enzyme found in several bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen known for causing nosocomial infections. This metalloenzyme catalyzes the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids in order to rapidly modulate membrane fluidity in response to stresses that impede bacterial growth. As a consequence, breakthrough in the elucidation of the mechanism of this metalloenzyme might lead to new strategies to combat bacterial antibiotic resistance. We report the first comprehensive biochemical, electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Cti enzyme. This has been possible by the successful purification of Cti from P. aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;Cti) in favorable yields with enzyme activity of 0.41&#8197;&#956;mol/min/mg when tested with palmitoleic acid. Through a synergistic approach involving enzymology, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, Raman spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electrochemistry, we identified the heme coordination and redox state, pinpointing Met163 as the sixth ligand of the FeII of heme&#8208;c in Pa&#8208;Cti. Significantly, the development of an innovative assay based on liposomes demonstrated for the first time that Cti catalyzes cis&#8208;trans isomerization directly using phospholipids as substrates without the need of protein partners, answering the important question about the substrate of Cti within the bacterial membrane.

&lt;p&gt;The lipid &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerase (Cti) is a periplasmic heme-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; enzyme found in several bacteria including &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, a pathogen known for causing nosocomial infections. This metalloenzyme catalyzes the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids in order to rapidly modulate membrane fluidity in response to stresses that impede bacterial growth. As a consequence, breakthrough in the elucidation of the mechanism of this metalloenzyme might lead to new strategies to combat bacterial antibiotic resistance. We report the first comprehensive biochemical, electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Cti enzyme. This has been possible by the successful purification of Cti from &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pa&lt;/i&gt;-Cti) in favorable yields with enzyme activity of 0.41&#8197;&#956;mol/min/mg when tested with palmitoleic acid. Through a synergistic approach involving enzymology, site-directed mutagenesis, Raman spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electrochemistry, we identified the heme coordination and redox state, pinpointing Met163 as the sixth ligand of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; of heme-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Pa&lt;/i&gt;-Cti. Significantly, the development of an innovative assay based on liposomes demonstrated for the first time that Cti catalyzes &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerization directly using phospholipids as substrates without the need of protein partners, answering the important question about the substrate of Cti within the bacterial membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concise Affinity&#8208;Based Purification of Ligated mRNA for Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of Nucleosugar Modification Patterns</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a two&#8208;step affinity purification method for ligated sugar&#8208;modified mRNA. The purification is based on oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to 3&#8217; poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA. This method provides a new platform for rapid optimization of chemically modified mRNAs and advancement of their pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
Position&#8208;specific nucleoside sugar modifications have been shown to improve the translational activity and stability of chemically synthesized mRNA. For pharmaceutical applications of chemically modified mRNAs, a rapid purification methodology is imperative to identify the optimal modification pattern. However, while the chemical synthesis of mRNAs can be accomplished by splint ligation of oligonucleotide fragments, the current purification method for ligated mRNAs based on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tends to be time consuming. In this study, we developed a two&#8208;step affinity purification method for rapid sample preparation. In this method, ligated mRNA is captured by oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to the 3&#8217;&#8208;poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA, respectively. Therefore, the target mRNA can be isolated from a complex mixture of splint ligations. Using this method, six sugar&#8208;modified mRNAs were simultaneously purified, and the translational activities of these mRNAs were evaluated immediately after purification. The results demonstrate that this methodology is suitable for the rapid preparation of various chemically synthesized mRNAs to identify their optimal modification patterns.

         <title>Protein Condensates Unfold G&#8208;Quadruplex Resembling a Helicase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of biomolecules plays a significant role in intracellular condensation. Our findings of G4 unfolding within protein condensates reveal intriguing insights into how a protein gain a new function through the formation of condensates, enriching our comprehension of cellular processes at the molecular level.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;less organelles, formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, participate in many vital cellular processes and have received extensive attention recently. A notable form of noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structure, G&#8208;quadruplex (G4), interacts with the scaffolding proteins in these membrane&#8208;less organelles and becomes an integral part of this condensed phase. However, the structure and stability features of the integrated G4 remain poorly characterized. Herein, we employed NMR along with other biophysical methods to investigate the conformation of a G4 within condensates formed by a disordered protein known as DDX4N1. We discovered that the human telomeric sequence MHT24, which forms a G4 structure in a non&#8208;condensed phase solution of protein DDX4N1, unfolds when it is within DDX4N1 condensates due to phase separation. Our findings provide an instance of a protein acquiring new functionality through phase separation process, which deepen our understanding of how protein condensates regulate G4 structure and their functions.

         <title>Chondroitin Sulfate&#8208;Coated Heteroduplex&#8208;Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[60]fullerene&#8208;based molecular spherical nucleic acids (MSNAs) were used as hybridization&#8208;mediated carriers for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate (CS) tetrasaccharides. The impact of the MSNA&#8208;carriers and the CS&#8208;halo on the cellular uptake and suppression of Tau&#8208;protein was studied with hippocampal neurons in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids (MSNAs) are atomically uniform dendritic nanostructures and potential delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The radial formulation combined with covalent conjugation may hide the oligonucleotide content and simultaneously enhance the role of appropriate conjugate groups on the outer sphere. The conjugate halo may be modulated to affect the delivery properties of the MSNAs. In the present study, [60]fullerene&#8208;based molecular spherical nucleic acids, consisting of a 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide and a ribonucleotide sequence, were used as hybridization&#8208;mediated carriers (&#8220;DNA and RNA&#8208;carriers&#8221;) for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, (i.&#8201;e. Tau&#8208;ASO) and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides (CS) with different sulfation patterns. The impact of the MSNA carriers, CS&#8208;moieties on the conjugates and the CS&#8208;decorations on the MSNAs on cellular uptake and &#8208; activity (Tau&#8208;suppression) of the Tau&#8208;ASO was studied with hippocampal neurons in&#8197;vitro. The formation and stability of these heteroduplex ASO&#8208;MSNAs were evaluated by UV melting profile analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography equipped with a multi angle light scattering detector (SEC&#8208;MALS). The cellular uptake and &#8208; activity were studied by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis, respectively.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Various Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Derivatives in Enzyme Supramolecular Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin derivatives are produced and used to build a protective layer shielding surface&#8208;immobilized enzymes. These macrocycles act as artificial chaperones and support protein stability under thermal stress conditions. Along with providing protection to enzymes exposed to chaotropic stress, the macrocycles support protein refolding and activity recovery.







Abstract
Enzyme stability and activity are pivotal factors for their implementation in different industrial applications. Enzyme supramolecular engineering relies on the fabrication of a tailor&#8208;made enzyme nano&#8208;environment to ensure enzyme stability without impairing activity. Cyclodextrins (CDs), cyclic oligomers of glucose, act as protein chaperones and stabilize, upon interaction with hydrophobic amino acid residues exposed at the protein surface, its three&#8208;dimensional structure. When used to build an organosilica layer shielding an enzyme, they enhance the protective effect of this layer. In the present study, we systematically assessed the protective effects of three organosilane derivatives based on &#593;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CDs. A model lipase enzyme was immobilized at the surface of silica nanoparticles and shielded in an organosilica layer containing these organosilanes. Besides layer thickness optimization, the effect of different stressors (i.&#8201;e., temperature, SDS, urea) was tested. Our results showed that organosilica layers produced with CDs improve enzyme thermal stability. They also support enzyme refolding after denaturation under chaotic conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the protective effect of the smallest CD derivative tested, namely &#593;&#8208;CD, surpassed the other macrocycles studied for conferring the immobilized enzyme with higher resistance to stress conditions. This protection strategy was also applied to a thermostable &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme.

         <title>Auto&#8208;Deactivation of BODIPY&#8208;Derived Type I Photosensitizer Post Photodynamic Therapy under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage photochemical process on BODIPY&#8208;derived photosensitizers is investigated under oxygen&#8208;free conditions to automatically switch off the photoactivity post photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment. The NADH&#8208;driven mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosystem exhibits great potential for safe and efficient PDT beyond reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fighting hypoxia.







Abstract
The long&#8208;lasting activity of photosensitizers during photodynamic therapy (PDT) causes excessive damage and arouses great concerns about biosafety. Herein, we synthesized a pyridinium&#8208;decorated diiodo&#8208;BODIPY compound (PyBDP) and investigated its photosensitizing activity under hypoxic condition in the presence of NADH that is abundant in the mitochondria of hypoxic tumors. The unique property of PyBDP lies in the redox environment&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response. At green light exposure, PyBDP is converted into a colorless inactive form by interacting with NADH in a two&#8208;step one&#8208;electron transfer process. Interestingly, the NADH&#8208;dependent hydrogenation of PyBDP is affected by the presence of cytochrome c (Cyt cox) that is an important component of mitochondrial electron transport chain (Mito&#8208;ETC), unless Cyt cox is exhausted. Active radical species is produced during the photocatalytic reaction, which adds the understanding of PyBDP&#8208;induced photodamage. Therefore, we applied the strategy of auto&#8208;deactivation PDT using a BODIPY photosensitizer by tethering triphenylphosphonium to PyBDP. After PDT effect in a type I pathway, the photosensitizer underwent almost entire auto&#8208;deactivation in hypoxic HeLa cells. This work paves a way for the development of reductive PDT with enhanced safety and efficacy in fighting hypoxic tumors independent on reactive oxygen species (ROS).

&lt;p&gt;A two-stage photochemical process on BODIPY-derived photosensitizers is investigated under oxygen-free conditions to automatically switch off the photoactivity post photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment. The NADH-driven mitochondria-targeting photosystem exhibits great potential for safe and efficient PDT beyond reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fighting hypoxia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-lasting activity of photosensitizers during photodynamic therapy (PDT) causes excessive damage and arouses great concerns about biosafety. Herein, we synthesized a pyridinium-decorated diiodo-BODIPY compound (PyBDP) and investigated its photosensitizing activity under hypoxic condition in the presence of NADH that is abundant in the mitochondria of hypoxic tumors. The unique property of PyBDP lies in the redox environment-dependent photo-response. At green light exposure, PyBDP is converted into a colorless inactive form by interacting with NADH in a two-step one-electron transfer process. Interestingly, the NADH-dependent hydrogenation of PyBDP is affected by the presence of cytochrome c (Cyt &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt;) that is an important component of mitochondrial electron transport chain (Mito-ETC), unless Cyt &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt; is exhausted. Active radical species is produced during the photocatalytic reaction, which adds the understanding of PyBDP-induced photodamage. Therefore, we applied the strategy of auto-deactivation PDT using a BODIPY photosensitizer by tethering triphenylphosphonium to PyBDP. After PDT effect in a type I pathway, the photosensitizer underwent almost entire auto-deactivation in hypoxic HeLa cells.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating prevalence of tissue damage and its associated complications has elicited global apprehension. While nanomaterial&#8208;based wound healing exhibits significant potential in terms of curbing infections and surpassing conventional methods, unresolved concerns regarding nanomaterial controllability and precision remain unresolved, jeopardizing its practical applications. In recent years, a unique strategy for creating gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials for wound repair has been proposed, involving the creation of gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials to facilitate wound repair by generating gas donor moieties. The operational spatiotemporal responsiveness and broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial properties of these gases, combined with their inability to generate bacterial resistance like traditional antibiotics, establish their efficacy in addressing chronic non&#8208;healing wounds, specifically diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). In this review, we delve into the intricacies of wound healing process, emphasizing the chemical design, functionality, bactericidal activity, and potential of gas&#8208;release materials, encompassing NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, for effective wound healing. Furthermore, we explore the advancements in synergistic therapy utilizing these gases, aiming to enhance our overall comprehension of this field. The insights gleaned from this review will undoubtedly aid researchers and developers in the creation of promising gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, thus propelling efficient wound healing in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>A facile label&#8208;free colorimetric assay for DNase I activity based on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of functional nucleic acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNase I plays a crucial role in fundamental biological processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and efficient method to detect DNase I activity. In this work, a colorimetric assay based on functional nucleic acid for sensitive DNase I detection was reported. The functional nucleic acids with G&#8208;rich bases exhibit peroxidase&#8208;like activity under acetic acid conditions, capable of catalyzing the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3',5,5'&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The specific nucleic acid is designed as the substrate for DNase I, which can hydrolyze the strand and reduce the catalytic activity of the reaction system. Based on this, a sensitive, simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective colorimetric detection platform was constructed for the quantitative analysis of DNase I. The detection limit (3&#963;/s) for DNase I was 0.046 U/mL with a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1 U/mL. Moreover, the practicality of this colorimetric detection platform was demonstrated by detecting DNase I in human serum.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Modulated Excited Triplet States and Activities of Ruthenium Complexes for Dual Photodynamic/Sonodynamic Therapy to Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes with distinct intraligand transition nature of the lowest excited triplet states were designed for single&#8208;molecule PDT/SDT synergistic multimodal anticancer toward cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer. They could induce both apoptosis and ferroptosis of tumor cells by light&#8208; and sonication&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
Six polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes were designed for single&#8208;molecule photodynamic and sonodynamic therapy (PDT/SDT) synergistic multimodal anticancer toward cisplatin&#8208;resistant NSCLC. They demonstrated lowest 3ES with distinct intraligand transition nature, which is beneficial for singlet oxygen generation. Remarkable quantum yields of both singlet oxygen and superoxide anion under either 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation or ultrasonic treatment and could induce apoptosis and ferroptosis of A549R cells. Cytotoxicity experiments clearly demonstrated a synergistic effect between PDT and SDT. The relationship between the structures of these complexes and their cellular biological mechanisms has been explored in detail. Using a single&#8208;molecule sensitizer to achieve synergistic PDT/SDT may provide valuable insights for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant tumors that located deeply and in hypoxic microenvironment.

         <title>Tailoring CotA Laccase Substrate Specificity by Rationally Reshaping Pocket Edge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the protein engineering work against CotA laccase, all mutants show impaired activities against small size sinapic acid, in contrast, A227E, G321F and G321P showed around 25&#8201;% increase of activities against big size ditaurobilirubin compared to WT. Unexpectedly, heterologous expression yields of T262F, T262F/G321F and T262F/G321P increased by around 5, 7 and 21 folds compared to WT, respectively.







Abstract
CotA is a bacterial multicopper oxidase, capable of oxidizing lots of substrates. In previous work, small size lignin phenol derivates were found to lie only in the partially covered part of pocket. However, big size substate would occupy the whole pocket to react. In this work, five residues sitting at the edge of the pocket were selected to study their roles in regulating activities against different size substrates. All mutants showed impaired activities against small size sinapic acid, however, A227E, G321F and G321P showed around 25&#8201;% increase of activities against big size ditaurobilirubin compared to wild type (WT). T262F/G321F showed moderate increased activity to alazin red S. kcat/Kms against ditaurobilirubin of A227E, T262F and G321F are around 1.5, 3 and 1.5 folds of WT's. Unexpectedly, heterologous expression yields of T262F, T262F/G321F and T262F/G321P in Escherichia coli greatly increased by around 5, 7 and 21 folds compared to WT, respectively. It is speculated positive mutants would provide a beneficial orientation for big size substrates. Substituting semi&#8208;buried residue T262 by a hydrophobic amino acid might enhance expression yields mainly by increasing van der waals and hydrophobic interaction. This work exemplified rationally regulating specific activities of laccase and is valuable for industrial application.

         <title>Autoinhibition in (Bio)Chemistry: Identification and Mechanistic Classification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autoinhibition is a frequently invoked self&#8208;regulatory mechanism involved in various cellular processes to interpret clearly how these cells may control their complex functioning. This type of temporal behavior generally results in self&#8208;retardation or even in complete shuts down of the undesired reactions to occur meaning that the rate of a certain biochemical reaction is partially or completely retarded. Precise characterization and classification of a complex system where deceleration of the reaction rate is found, however, requires special circumspection to avoid false interpretation. Hereby, it was clearly demonstrated that the retardation effect of an inhibitor is unexpectedly often misidentified as autoinhibition, especially in complex biochemical enzymatic systems. It prompted us to clarify unambiguously the difference between inhibition and autoinhibition. The latter kinetic phenomenon is a special type of inhibition where the inhibitor forms by the result of a chemical or biochemical event exerting the self&#8208;decelerating effect on the rate of its own formation resulting thus in significantly different temporal patterns compared to the ones observed in the case of simple inhibitions. Kinetic activity of autoinhibitor towards the species involved in the given system allowed us to classify direct, indirect and dual autoinhibitions to be supported by real chemical examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Compartmentalized Sesquiterpenoid Biosynthesis and Functionalization in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Plastid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenoids play key roles in cellular metabolism and can have specialized functions. Their heterologous production in microbial hosts offers an alternative to natural extraction. Here, we developed a subcellular engineering approach in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by targeting both sesquiterpenoid synthases and cytochrome P450s (CYPs) to the plastid, exploiting its photosynthetic electron transport chain to drive CYP&#8208;mediated oxidation without reductase partners. Nuclear&#8208;encoded sesquiterpenoid synthases were expressed with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase fusions and targeted to the plastid, while CYPs were modified for soluble localization in the plastid stroma by removing transmembrane domains. The plastid environment supported hydroxylation, epoxidation, and oxidation reactions, with functionalization efficiencies reaching 80% of accumulated products. Carbon source availability influenced product ratios, revealing metabolic flexibility in the engineered pathways. Overall sesquiterpenoid yields ranged between 250&#8208;2500 &#181;g L&#8211;1 under screening conditions, establishing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for using plastid biochemistry in complex terpenoid biosynthesis. Living two&#8208;phase terpenoid extractions with different perfluorinated solvents revealed variable performances based on sesquiterpenoid functionalization and solvent type. This work demonstrates that photosynthetic electron transport can drive CYP&#8208;mediated functionalization in engineered subcellular compartments. However, improvements in photobioreactor cultivation concepts will be required to facilitate the use of algal chassis for scaled production.</dc:description>

         <title>The structural permissiveness of triose phosphate isomerase (TpiA) of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triosephosphate isomerase (TpiA) is widely regarded as an example of an optimally evolved enzyme due to its essential role in biological systems, its structural conservation, and its near&#8208;perfect kinetic parameters. In this study, we investigated the structural robustness of the archetypal TpiA variant from Escherichia coli using an in vitro 5&#8208;amino acid linker scanning method. The resulting library was introduced into a tpiA mutant strain for functional complementation. From this library, 16 TpiA variants that were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild&#8208;type enzyme were selected for further analysis. Although all variants retained enzymatic activities within the wild&#8208;type range, several insertions were found in highly structured protein domains where the linker was expected to cause significant structural perturbations. Despite these potentially disruptive additions, the enzymes maintained their activity even when expressed in a dnaK mutant, suggesting that chaperones did not compensate for structural abnormalities in vivo. Additionally, when these mutant TpiA variants were produced using an in vitro transcription/translation system, they exhibited enzymatic activity comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the non&#8208;mutated enzyme. AlphaFold2 exposed that insertions reconstructed the local architecture of the nearby amino acid sequences. The evolutionary implications of this remarkable structural resilience are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Library Enables Covalent Chemical Capture of Solvent&#8208;Exposed TPR Domain Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the unnatural amino acid, p&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Bpa), we developed a photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) library to covalently capture protein&#8208;protein interactions along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. This library explicitly targets the less&#8208;studied TPR binding surface, over the lumenal substrate&#8208;binding surface, and expands the toolbox for both targeted discovery of new interactors and characterization of OGT's TPR interactome.







Abstract
O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is an essential, stress&#8208;sensing enzyme responsible for adding the O&#8208;GlcNAc monosaccharide to thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins to regulate cellular homeostasis. OGT substrates are found in almost all intracellular processes, and perturbations in protein O&#8208;GlcNAc levels have been implicated in proteostatic diseases, such as cancers, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration. This broad disease activity makes OGT an attractive therapeutic target; however, the substrate diversity makes pan&#8208;inhibition as a therapeutic strategy unfeasible. Rather, a substrate&#8208;specific approach to targeting is more advantageous, but how OGT chooses its substrates remains poorly understood. Substrate specificity is controlled by the interactions between OGT's non&#8208;catalytic tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, rather than its glycosyltransferase domain. OGT's TPR domain forms a 100&#8197;&#197; superhelical structure, containing a lumenal surface, known as the substrate&#8208;binding surface, and a solvent&#8208;exposed surface. To date, there are no tools to site&#8208;selectively target regions of the domain and differentiate between the two binding surfaces. Here, we developed a library of recombinant OGT constructs containing site&#8208;specifically incorporated photoactivatable unnatural amino acids (UAAs) along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the TPR domain to covalently capture and map OGT's interactome.

         <title>Anion and Substituents Effect on Spectral&#8208;Kinetic and Biological Characteristics of Spiropyran Salts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
These spiropyran are characterized by NIR absorption and fluorescence of their merocyanine forms, making them promising fluorescent probes and markers. It was shown that the counterion has minimal effect on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the dyes but dramatically affects the toxicity of the compounds. Using the most appropriate compounds, bioimaging experiments were carried out to visualize planktonic bacteria and bacterial biofilms.







Abstract
Spiropyran salts containing a cationic vinyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indolium moiety are characterized by NIR absorption and fluorescence of their merocyanine forms. This feature makes them promising fluorescent probes and markers for bioimaging. The article focuses on the synthesis and study of the spectral, kinetic and toxic characteristics of such compounds with respect to various substituents in different moieties and the type of anion. A detailed analysis of the acquired data made it possible to draw some important conclusions regarding the influence of structural factors, which will be very useful for the further rational design of such derivatives. In particular, it was shown that the counterion has minimal effect on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the dyes but dramatically affects the toxicity of the compounds. Following selection of the most appropriate compounds, bioimaging experiments were carried out to visualize planktonic bacteria and bacterial biofilms of E. coli and A. calcoaceticus. The ability to visualize biofilms is critical for the diagnosis of chronic diseases. By the results of molecular docking a theoretical interaction pattern between spiropyran molecules and DNA was proposed.

         <title>Exploring Fluorinase Substrate Tolerance at C&#8208;2 of SAM</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate tolerance of the fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) is explored by introducing untested substituents at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring. The most active analogues were N&#8208;alkylated amines and as a class these were much better than O&#8208; or S&#8208; ethers. The outcomes are supported by in silico analysis. This tolerance broadens the utility of the fluorinase as a tool for introducing the fluorine&#8208;18 isotope into ligands for positron emission tomography applications.







Abstract
The fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) utilises fluoride ion and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) as substrates for conversion to 5&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;adenosine (5&#8242;&#8208;FDA) and L&#8208;methionine (L&#8208;Met). The enzyme has a very strict substrate specificity, however it has been shown to tolerate acetylenes and NH2 replacements for H at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring of SAM. This substrate tolerance is explored further here with &#8722;NHR, &#8722;N3, &#8722;OR and &#8722;SR substituents attached to C&#8208;2. New activities are demonstrated, for example with NH&#8208;methyl, NH&#8208;propyl,NH&#8208;butyl and O&#8208;butyl substrates at C&#8208;2, however azide and thioethers were not tolerated. Outcomes are supported by in silico analysis, revealing favourable H&#8208;bonding interactions involving NH and O substituents at the adenine C&#8208;2 position with N278 and the backbone amide of A279 at the active site respectively.

     alt="Exploring Fluorinase Substrate Tolerance at C-2 of SAM"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substrate tolerance of the fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) is explored by introducing untested substituents at C-2 of the adenine ring. The most active analogues were N-alkylated amines and as a class these were much better than O- or S- ethers. The outcomes are supported by &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis. This tolerance broadens the utility of the fluorinase as a tool for introducing the fluorine-18 isotope into ligands for positron emission tomography applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) utilises fluoride ion and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as substrates for conversion to 5&#8242;-fluoro-5&#8242;-deoxy-adenosine (5&#8242;-FDA) and L-methionine (L-Met). The enzyme has a very strict substrate specificity, however it has been shown to tolerate acetylenes and NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; replacements for H at C-2 of the adenine ring of SAM. This substrate tolerance is explored further here with &#8722;NHR, &#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &#8722;OR and &#8722;SR substituents attached to C-2. New activities are demonstrated, for example with NH-methyl, NH-propyl,NH-butyl and O-butyl substrates at C-2, however azide and thioethers were not tolerated. Outcomes are supported by &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis, revealing favourable H-bonding interactions involving NH and O substituents at the adenine C-2 position with N278 and the backbone amide of A279 at the active site respectively. The study informs on the selectivity of the fluorinase as a tool for radiolabelling candidate ligands with fluorine-18 for positron emission tomography programmes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Insights into the Reaction Mechanisms of Non&#8208;Heme Diiron Enzymes Containing Oxoiron(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;valent oxoiron(IV): This review outlines the structures, formation mechanisms, and functions of high&#8208;valent oxoiron(IV) intermediates in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The discussion emphasizes the structural and mechanistic diversity across different enzyme subfamilies.







Abstract
Oxoiron(IV) complexes are key intermediates in the catalytic reactions of some non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. These enzymes, across various subfamilies, activate dioxygen to generate high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo species, which, in turn, drive the activation of substrates and mediate a variety of challenging oxidative transformations. In this review, we summarize the structures, formation mechanisms, and functions of high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo intermediates in eight representative diiron enzymes (sMMO, RNR, ToMO, MIOX, PhnZ, SCD1, AlkB, and SznF) spanning five subfamilies. We also categorize and analyze the structural and mechanistic differences among these enzymes.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Oxygen&#8208;Independent DNA Photodegradation by Pheophorbide a: Implications for Future Photodynamic Therapy Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the unique properties of Pheophorbide&#160;a&#160;(Phed&#160;a) in the photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA under anoxic conditions, emphasizing its potential for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in hypoxic tumor environments. We used electron spin resonance (ESR), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to assess the radical generation and DNA interaction capabilities of Phed&#160;a&#160;compared to Pyropheophorbide&#160;a&#160;(Pyro&#160;a) under both oxygenated and anoxic conditions. Our results reveal that Phed&#160;a&#160;effectively degrades G&#8208;quadruplex DNA in the absence of oxygen, whereas Pyro&#160;a&#160;does not. Under anoxic conditions, Phed&#160;a&#160;generates unique carbon&#8208;centered radicals, as indicated by distinctive ESR signals, which are not observed in aerobic environments or with Pyro&#160;a. These radicals facilitate DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phed&#160;a&#8217;s ability to degrade DNA independently of oxygen underscores its potential as a versatile and effective PDT agent, especially for hypoxic tumors where traditional photosensitizers are ineffective. This study paves the way for the development of new PDT agents that can operate under different oxygen levels. Phed&#160;a&#8217;s radical generation and oxygen&#8208;independent DNA degradation mechanisms make it a promising candidate for future PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving retinoic acid efficacy: lipase&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of derivatives with antiviral activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient enzymatic approach was applied to the synthesis of new derivatives of retinoic acid. Nine derivatives, four of them new compounds, were obtained through lipase&#8208;catalysis with excellent yield. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, the influence of various parameters such as enzyme source, nucleophile:substrate ratio, enzyme:substrate ratio, solvent and temperature was studied. The excellent results obtained by lipase catalysis made the procedure very efficient considering their advantages such as mild reaction conditions and low environmental impact. In addition, several synthesized compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the retinoic acid in Vero cells and a remarkably higher antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV&#8208;1) and Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Discovery of Substrate Peptide Sequences for E3 Ubiquitin Ligases Using a cDNA Display Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a screening system for E3 substrate sequences based on a cDNA display method. A randomized library of potential E3 substrates was displayed in the form of covalent conjugates between the peptide sequences and their corresponding DNA sequences. The displayed library was subjected to in&#8197;vitro ubiquitylation, the ubiquitylated sequences were pulled down by the anti&#8208;ubiquitin antibody, and the corresponding peptide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing.







Abstract
Cells utilize ubiquitin as a posttranslational protein modifier to convey various signals such as proteasomal degradation. The dysfunction of ubiquitylation or following proteasomal degradation can give rise to the accumulation and aggregation of improperly ubiquitylated proteins, which is known to be a general causation of many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the characterization of substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases is crucial in biological and pharmaceutical sciences. In this study, we developed a novel high&#8208;throughput screening system for substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases using a cDNA display method, which enables covalent conjugation between peptide sequences and their corresponding cDNA sequences. First, we focused on the MDM2 E3 ligase and its known peptide substrate as a model to establish the screening method, and confirmed that cDNA display method was compatible with in&#8197;vitro ubiquitylation. Then, we demonstrated identification of MDM2 substrate sequences from random libraries to identify a novel motif (VKFTGGQLA). Bioinformatics analysis of the hit sequences was performed to gain insight about endogenous substrate proteins.

         <title>Antigen Presentation in an Artificial and Cell Membrane.

Blood Group A Glycan Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are functionally important components of the cell membrane and recognition of their glycan "head" by the immune system is a key part of normal and pathological processes. Recognition of glycolipid antigens on a living cell, their structure, "context" (microenvironment and clustering), presentation including orientation and distance from the plasma membrane, as well as molecular dynamics are important. GSL antigens are targets for the development of anticancer vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, therefore, control of the presentation of their glycans by synthetic methods opens up new possibilities in medicine. In this work, we synthesized 13 GSL analogues as function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipids (FSLs) with the same head (blood group A tetrasaccharide, ABO system) but each either differing in the structure of the lipid tail, or the length of the region between the head and the tail, or cluster organization of the head (from 2 to 4 tetrasaccharides in a cluster). The insertion of these FSLs into an artificial and erythrocyte membranes was compared, and their interaction with antibodies was studied, including erythrocyte agglutination. The results give further insight into knowledge of the membrane presentation of GSLs (some results can be extrapolated to glycoproteins) and factors involved in their interaction with antibodies.</dc:description>

         <title>Close Proximity of Cholesterol Anchors in Membrane Induces the Dissociation of Amphiphilic DNA Strand from Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular base paring in the terminal base pair of amphiphilic DNA strand labelled with cholesterol anchors was modulated by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction. The close proximity of cholesterol anchors within the membrane could result in the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA strand from the membrane surface.







Abstract
Dynamic DNA nanotechnology is appealing for membrane surface engineering due to their versatility and programmability. To modulate the dynamic interactions between the DNA functional units immobilized on membrane surface, membrane&#8208;anchored DNA functional units often come into close proximity each other due to DNA base pairing, which also leads to the close contact of the hydrophobic anchors in membrane. However, whether the close contact of hydrophobic anchors induces the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA structures from membrane surface is not concerned. Herein, we utilized cholesterol&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a simplified amphiphilic DNA structure to investigate the stability of membrane anchored DNA strands upon the closely contact of cholesterol anchors. The close contact of cholesterol&#8208;labelled ssDNA molecules driven by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction leads to approximately 41&#8201;% membrane anchored ssDNA dissociation from membrane surface, indicating the proximal cholesterol anchors in membrane could reduce the anchoring stability of cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands. This work enhances our understanding of the interactions between amphiphilic DNA and membranes, and provides valuable insights for the design of future DNA constructs intended for applications involving dynamic DNA reactions on membrane surface.

         <title>Mitochondrial Viscosity Probes: Iridium(III) Complexes Induce Apoptosis in HeLa Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new Ir(III) complexes containing 5&#8208;fluorouracil derivatives as ligands were synthesized. Among these, Ir1 selectively induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of Ir1 demonstrated high sensitivity to intracellular viscosity changes, enabling real&#8208;time fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of cellular micro&#8208;viscosity during apoptosis.







Abstract
Mitochondrial viscosity has emerged as a promising biomarker for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, yet accurately measuring viscosity at the subcellular level remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized and characterized three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8208;Ir3) containing 5&#8208;fluorouracil derivatives as ligands. Among these, Ir1 selectively induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered a cascade of events leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of Ir1 demonstrated high sensitivity to intracellular viscosity changes, enabling real&#8208;time fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of cellular micro&#8208;viscosity during apoptosis. These findings underscore the potential of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications at the subcellular level.

         <title>A Rapid and Sensitive MicroPlate Assay (MPSA) Using an Alkyne&#8208;Modified CMP&#8208;Sialic Acid Donor to Evaluate Human Sialyltransferase Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a sensitive microplate assay to explore the enzymatic activities of human sialyltransferases using an alkyne&#8208;modified CMP&#8208;sialic acid donor. This method allows for comprehensive kinetic analysis, revealing the substrate tolerance and enzyme specific activities of 13 human sialyltransferases.







Abstract
Human sialyltransferases primarily utilize CMP&#8208;Sias, especially transferring Neu5Ac from CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac to various acceptors. Advances in chemical biology have led to the synthesis of novel CMP&#8208;Sia donors suitable for bioorthogonal reactions in cell&#8208;based assays. However, the compatibility of these donors with all human enzymes remains uncertain. We synthesized a non&#8208;natural CMP&#8208;Sia donor with an alkyne modification on the N&#8208;acyl group of Neu5Ac, which was effectively used by human ST6Gal&#8197;I and ST3Gal&#8197;I. A sensitive MicroPlate Sialyltransferase Assay (MPSA) was developed and expanded to a panel of 13 human STs acting on glycoproteins. All assayed enzymes tolerated CMP&#8208;SiaNAl, allowing for the determination of kinetic parameters and turnover numbers. This study enhances the biochemical characterization of human sialyltransferases and opens new avenues for developing sialyltransferase inhibitors.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular conductive hydrogels attract significant interest for their fibrous architecture and high water content, which mimic the extracellular matrix and integrate the benefits of electrical components, making them suitable for electrogenic tissue engineering. This review highlights recent advances in supramolecular conductive hydrogels, emphasizing their applications in cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering while outlining future development opportunities in this innovative field.







Abstract
Owing to their unique attributes, including reversibility, specificity, directionality, and tunability, supramolecular biomaterials have evolved as an excellent alternative to conventional biomaterials like polymers, ceramics, and metals. Supramolecular hydrogels, in particular, have garnered significant interest because their fibrous architecture, high water content, and interconnected 3D network resemble the extracellular matrix to some extent. Consequently, supramolecular hydrogels have been used to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. Supramolecular conductive hydrogels combine the advantages of supramolecular soft materials with the electrical properties of metals, making them highly relevant for electrogenic tissue engineering. Given the versatile applications of these hydrogels, it is essential to periodically review high&#8208;quality research in this area. In this review, we focus on recent advances in supramolecular conductive hydrogels, particularly their applications in tissue engineering. We discuss the conductive components of these hydrogels and highlight notable reports on their use in cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering. Additionally, we outline potential future developments in this field.

         <title>Distinct Effects of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein Segments on Structural Stability, Amyloidogenic Potential, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigated the structural properties and amyloidogenic implications of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein segment SK9, demonstrating that its intrinsically disordered nature facilitates rapid amyloid formation and acceleration of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation, while rationally engineered variants with stable secondary structures abolished these pathogenic effects, which suggest the importance of preserving structural disorder in viral&#8208;derived peptides for developing potential therapeutic interventions targeting protein&#8208;protein interactions and aggregation against viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
Amyloidosis is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins, called amyloid fibrils, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. Recent studies on the amyloidogenesis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protein segments have raised concerns on their potential link to post&#8208;infection neurodegeneration, however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the structure, stability, and amyloidogenic propensity of a nine&#8208;residue segment (SK9) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein and their impact on neuronal protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) aggregation. Specifically, the amino acid sequence of the SK9 wildtype has been modified from a basic and positively charged peptide (SFYVYSRVK), to a nearly neutral and more hydrophobic peptide (SAAVASAVK, labelled as SK9 var1), and to an acidic and negatively charged peptide (SDAVANAVK, labelled as SK9 var2). Our findings reveal that the SK9 wildtype exhibited a pronounced amyloidogenic propensity due to its disordered and unstable nature, while the SK9 variants possessed more ordered and stable structures preventing the amyloid formation. Significantly, the SK9 wildtype demonstrated distinct effect on &#945;Syn aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology to facilitate the formation of &#945;Syn aggregates with enhanced resistance against enzymatic degradation. This study highlights the potential of modifying short peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune their properties, providing insights into understanding and regulating viral&#8208;induced amyloid aggregations.

Discover the potential of d&#8208;Galacturonic acid and l&#8208;Arabinose in different industries. These monosaccharides are rich in sugar beet pulp biomass and can be used to prepare bioactive compounds, personal care products, building blocks and more.







Abstract
This review provides a perspective on the industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp (SBP) derived monosaccharides. The broad application of these monosaccharides could contribute to bio&#8208;based alternatives and sustainable practices, essential for the transition towards a more circular economy. This review focuses on the utilization and application of two SBP monosaccharides, d&#8208;galacturonic acid (d&#8208;GalA) and l&#8208;arabinose (l&#8208;Ara), derived from pectin and hemicellulose. These polysaccharides are major components of sugar beet pulp, an important side stream of sucrose production. d&#8208;GalA and l&#8208;Ara are therefore abundant in biomass and offer unique molecular structures amenable to selective chemical or enzymatic modifications. We review their application in various industrial applications such as the development and production of bioactive compounds, home and personal care products, and other industries.

         <title>Reprogramming of Glucose Metabolism for Revisiting Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resistance to Transcatheter Hepatic Arterial Chemoembolization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic&#8208;based drug delivery systems and innovative treatment strategies hold significant promise in overcoming the challenges associated with transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. By targeting the unique metabolic pathways of cancer cells, these approaches can enhance therapeutic efficacy, improve drug distribution, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes in TACE resistance.







Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is recognized globally as one of the most lethal tumors, presenting a significant menace to patients&#8217; lives owing to its exceptional aggressiveness and tendency to recur. Transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy, as a first&#8208;line treatment option for patients with advanced HCC, has been proven effective. However, it is disheartening that nearly 40&#8201;% of patients exhibit resistance to this therapy. Consequently, this review delves into the metabolic aspects of glucose metabolism to explore the underlying mechanisms behind TACE treatment resistance and to propose potentially fruitful therapeutic strategies. The ultimate objective is to present novel insights for the development of personalized treatment methods targeting HCC.

         <title>Mechanistic Perspective on Oxygen Activation Chemistry by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze crucial chemical reactions. Oxygen activation typically occurs at two sites on flavin: the C4a site, generating flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H), which is responsible for hydroxylation, halogenation, dehalogenation, and Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, and the N5 site, forming flavin&#8208;N5OOH, which functions as a nucleophile or base, facilitating nonoxidative C&#8722;X (X=N, S, Cl) bond cleavage and oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze a panoply of chemical transformations essential for living organisms. Through oxygen activation, flavoenzymes could generate diverse flavin&#8208;oxygen species that mediate numerous redox and non&#8208;redox transformations. In this review, we highlight the extensive oxygen activation chemistry at two sites of the flavin cofactor: C4a and N5 sites. Oxygen activation at the C4a site generates flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H) species for various monooxygenation reactions, while activation at the N5 site produces negatively charged flavin&#8208;N5OOH species, which act as highly reactive nucleophiles or bases. The selective oxygen activation at either the C4a or N5 site depends on the nature of substrates and is controlled by the active site architecture. These insights have expanded our understanding of oxygen activation chemistry in flavoenzymes and will serve as a foundation for future efforts in enzyme engineering and redesign.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling of Mo&#8208; and V&#8208;Nitrogenases Permits Protein&#8208;Mediated Protection from Oxygen Deactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeSII (or &#8220;Shethna&#8221;) protein from Azotobacter vinelandii can protect the Mo&#8208;dependent nitrogenase system from O2 damage. Here, we confirm that V&#8208;dependent nitrogenase does not benefit from this mechanism (shown in&#8197;vitro). Interestingly, cross&#8208;coupling V&#8208; and Mo&#8208;nitrogenase proteins enables FeSII&#8208;mediated protection.







Abstract
Nitrogenases catalyze dinitrogen (N2) fixation to ammonia (NH3). While these enzymes are highly sensitive to deactivation by molecular oxygen (O2) they can be produced by obligate aerobes for diazotrophy, necessitating a mechanism by which nitrogenase can be protected from deactivation. In the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, one mode of such protection involves an O2&#8208;responsive ferredoxin&#8208;type protein (&#8220;Shethna protein II&#8221;, or &#8220;FeSII&#8221;) which is thought to bind with Mo&#8208;dependent nitrogenase's two component proteins (NifH and NifDK) to form a catalytically stalled yet O2&#8208;tolerant tripartite protein complex. This protection mechanism has been reported for Mo&#8208;nitrogenase, however, in&#8197;vitro assays with V&#8208;nitrogenase suggest that this mechanism is not universal to the three known nitrogenase isoforms. Here we report that the reductase of the V&#8208;nitrogenase (VnfH) can engage in this FeSII&#8208;mediated protection mechanism when cross&#8208;coupled with Mo&#8208;nitrogenase NifDK. Interestingly, the cross&#8208;coupling of the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase reductase NifH with the V&#8208;nitrogenase VnfDGK protein does not yield such protection.

         <title>Geranylation of Cyclic Dipeptides and Naphthols by the Fungal Prenyltransferase CdpC3PT_F253G</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The F253G mutation of CdpC3PT exhibited enhanced catalytic efficiency in geranylation of cyclic dipeptides and naphthols. The mutant's reaction specificity is towards C7&#8208;geranylation of cyclic dipeptides, while 1&#8208;naphthol and its derivatives were converted into C4&#8208;geranylated products. Furthermore, five geranylated products (2G1 and 4G1&#8211;7G1) displayed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values ranging from 4 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/mL, surpassing their non&#8208;geranylated precursors. This research broadens the range of geranyl&#8208;modifying biocatalysts and highlights the potential for developing efficient or functionally modified biocatalysts.







Abstract
Prenyl modification often improves the biological activities of compounds. Prenyltransferases have attracted attention as environmentally friendly biocatalysts for catalyzing prenyl modification of compounds. Compared to dimethylallyl modifications, research on geranyl modifications is relatively limited. To enrich biocatalytic toolboxes for generating potentially bioactive geranylated derivatives, this study developed methodologies to synthesize two types of geranylated compounds, i.&#8201;e., geranylated tryptophan&#8208;containing cyclic dipeptides and geranylated naphthols, employing the F253G mutant of CdpC3PT, a cyclic dipeptide prenyltransferase from Neosartorya fischeri. The cyclic dipeptides (1&#8211;3) were transformed into C7&#8208;geranylated products (1G1&#8211;3G1), whereas 1&#8208;naphthol (4) and derivatives (5&#8211;6) yielded C4&#8208;geranylated products (4G1&#8211;6G1) and 2,7&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (7) generated a C3&#8208;geranylated product (7G1). All seven substrates and their geranylated products underwent antibacterial efficacy testing against Bacillus subtilis. Among them, five geranylated compounds (2G1 and 4G1&#8211;7G1) demonstrated antibacterial efficacies against Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values ranging from 4 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/mL, surpassing their non&#8208;geranylated precursors. This research broadens the tools of geranyl&#8208;modifying biocatalysts, illustrates a case for developing highly efficient or function&#8208;altered biocatalysts and showcases the potential of prenyltransferases in the biosynthesis of bioactive small molecules.

         <title>Marker&#8208;Dependent Cleavage of RNA by Binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz) and Binary DNA Machines (BiDM)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA&#8208;based constructions called binary DNAzyme machines are activated by binding cancer marker strand following by binding targeted RNA by Arms 1, 2, 3 and 4 and cleaving it. Binary DNAzyme machines can cleave certain RNA targets with higher affinity and selectivity than optimized DNAzyme constructions that use only Arms 1 and 2.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) can be used to suppress specific RNA in cells and thus has been explored for gene therapy. Despite extensive effort, there is no clinically significant OGT for treating cancer. Low efficiency of OGT is one of the problems. Earlier, we proposed to address this problem by suppressing the most vital genes in cancer cells e.&#8201;g. housekeeping genes. To achieve specific activation of the OGT agents in cancer but not in normal cells, we designed a binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz) activated by cancer&#8208;related nucleic acid sequences. This work is devoted to BiDz optimization for efficient cleavage of structured RNA targets upon activation with a cancer marker&#8208;related sequence. To achieve efficient binding of folded RNA, the BiDz was equipped with RNA binding/unwinding arms to produce &#8216;Binary DNA&#8208;nanomachines&#8217; (BiDM). It was demonstrated that BiDM can improve both the rate and selectivity of RNA cleavage in comparison with BiDz. For the best selectivity, single&#8208;nucleotide variations should be recognized by the strand detached from the common DNA scaffold of BiDM. Further development of DNA nanotechnology&#8208;inspired agents can advance OGT in treating cancer, viral infections, and genetic disorders.

         <title>ER Oxidoreductin 1&#8208;Like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Drives Protein Disulfide Isomerase in an Electron Relay System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) &#8211; a typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;resident oxidoreductase &#8211; donates electrons to O2 via ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), turning its own catalytic cycle to promote oxidative folding. This study showed that cyclic diselenides imitate Ero1 activity, enhancing PDI function and hence promoting PDI&#8208;catalyzed folding of drug&#8208;related proteins, including insulin.







Abstract
Disulfide formation generally involves a two&#8208;electron oxidation reaction between cysteine residues. Additionally, disulfide formation is an essential post&#8208;translational modification for the structural maturation of proteins. This oxidative folding is precisely controlled by an electron relay network constructed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), with a CGHC sequence as the redox&#8208;active site, and its family enzymes. Creating reagents that mimic the functions of these enzymes facilitates folding during chemical protein synthesis. In this study, we aimed to imitate a biological electron relay system using cyclic diselenide compounds as surrogates for endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), which is responsible for the re&#8208;oxidation of PDI. Oxidized PDI (PDIox) introduces disulfide bonds into substrate proteins, resulting in its conversion to reduced PDI (PDIred). The PDIred is then re&#8208;oxidized to PDIox by a coexisting cyclic diselenide compound, thereby restoring the function of PDI as a disulfide&#8208;forming agent. The produced diselenol state is readily oxidized to the original diselenide state with molecular oxygen, continuously sustaining the PDI catalytic cycle. This artificial electron relay system regulating enzymatic PDI function effectively promotes the oxidative folding of disulfide&#8208;containing proteins, such as insulin &#8211; a hypoglycemic formulation &#8211; by enhancing both yield and reaction velocity.

         <title>Versatile and Efficient Protein Association Through Chemically Modified Sphingomyelin Nanosystems (SNs) for Enhanced Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphic representation of the work carried out in this research, the main objective of which was the development of a nanoplatform for the efficient delivery of proteins (Protein Sphingomyelin Nanosystems; P&#8208;SNs), regardless of their molecular weight (MW), net charge, or isoelectric point (pI). Additionally, its efficient internalization in different cell lines and its cytotoxic profile were evaluated for subsequent use in cancer, gene therapy, and protein replacement therapies, among other biomedical applications (DSPE&#8208;PEG2k&#8208;X; X=DBCO, maleimide, NHS, TFP, COOH).







Abstract
Proteins are biological macromolecules well known to regulate many cellular signaling mechanisms. For instance, they are very appealing for their application as therapeutic agents, presenting high specificity and activity. Nonetheless, they suffer from unfolding, instability and low bioavailability making their administration through systemic and other routes very tough. To overcome these drawbacks, drug delivery systems and nanotechnology have arisen to deliver biomolecules in a sustained manner while, at the same time, increasing dose availability, protecting the cargo without compromising proteins&#8217; bioactivity, and enhancing intracellular delivery. In this work, we proposed the optimization of sphingomyelin nanosystems (SNs) for the delivery of a wide collection of proteins (ranging from 10&#8211;500&#8197;kDa and pI) using diverse chemical association strategies. We have further characterized SNs by varied analytical methodologies. We have also carried out in&#8197;vitro experiments to validate the potential of the developed formulations. As the final goal, we aim to obtain evidence of the potential use of SNs for the development of protein therapeutics.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective and site&#8208;specific chemical labeling of proteins has emerged as a pivotal research area in chemical biology and cell biology. An effective protein labeling typically meets several criteria, including high specificity, rapid and robust conjugation under physiological conditions, operation at low concentrations with biocompatibility, and minimal perturbation of the protein function and activity. The integration of nucleic acids with proteins has garnered significant attention recently due to the rapid advancements in nucleic acid probe technologies, leveraging the programmable nature of nucleic acids alongside the multifaceted functionalities of proteins. It helps to convert protein&#8208;specific information into nucleic acid signals, facilitating upstream versatile recognition and downstream signal amplification for the target protein. This review critically evaluates the recent progress in nucleic acid&#8208;based protein labeling methodologies, with a specific focus on covalent labeling using aptamer tags, protein fusion tags or the technique of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering. The tags establish covalent linkages with target proteins through various modalities such as small molecules or metabolic glycan engineering. The insights presented in the review highlight promising avenues for the development of highly specific and versatile protein labeling techniques, which is essential for the improvement of protein&#8208;targeted detection and imaging across diverse biological contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>A photo&#8208;caged cross&#8208;linker for identifying protein&#8208;protein interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) has seen significant improvements which have enhanced its utility for studying protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs), primarily due to the emergence of novel crosslinkers and the development of streamlined analysis workflows. Nevertheless, poor membrane permeability and side reactions with water limit the extent of productive intracellular crosslinking events that can be achieved with current crosslinkers. To address these problems, we have synthesized a novel crosslinker with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photoresponsive groups. These o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester (o&#8208;NBE) groups enhance the stability and hydrophobic properties of the crosslinker and add the potential for temporal resolution, i.e. the ability to control the initiation of the crosslinking reaction. Upon exposure to UV light the resulting aldehyde product reacts with adjacent amino groups and subsequent reductive amination of the formed Schiff&#8208;bases yields stable secondary amine linkages. This controlled activation mechanism enables precise UV&#8208;triggered protein crosslinking. We demonstrate proof&#8208;of principle of our o&#8208;NBE cross&#8208;linker to reliably detect PPIs by XL&#8208;MS using a recombinant model protein.

Nevertheless, poor membrane permeability and side reactions with water limit the extent of productive intracellular crosslinking events that can be achieved with current crosslinkers. To address these problems, we have synthesized a novel crosslinker with o-nitrobenzyl-based photoresponsive groups. These o-nitrobenzyl ester (o-NBE) groups enhance the stability and hydrophobic properties of the crosslinker and add the potential for temporal resolution, i.e. the ability to control the initiation of the crosslinking reaction. Upon exposure to UV light the resulting aldehyde product reacts with adjacent amino groups and subsequent reductive amination of the formed Schiff-bases yields stable secondary amine linkages. This controlled activation mechanism enables precise UV-triggered protein crosslinking. We demonstrate proof-of principle of our o-NBE cross-linker to reliably detect PPIs by XL-MS using a recombinant model protein. We also demonstrate its ability to enter intact Hela cells, thereby indicating its future potential as a useful tool to study PPIs within the cellular environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photodynamic Inactivation of Bacteria Using Nickel(II) Complexes with Catecholate and Phenanthroline Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes activated by light can combat infections by triggering the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. Herein, we report six mixed&#8208;ligand nickel(II) complexes with the formulation [Ni(NN)2(L)] (1&#8211;6), where NN represents an N,N&#8208;donor phenanthroline ligand, specifically 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen in 1, 2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq in 3, 4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz in 5, 6), while L is an O,O donor bidentate ligand derived from catechol (cat2&#8211;, in 1, 3, 5) or esculetin (esc2&#8211;, in 2, 4, 6). The paramagnetic d8 octahedral complexes demonstrated good dark and photostability in the solution phase and exhibited significant light absorption in the visible (400&#8211;700 nm) region. When exposed to low&#8208;energy visible light, these complexes demonstrated significant photodynamic inactivation activity against both gram&#8208;(+) S. aureus and gram&#8208;(&#8211;) E. coli bacteria. This resulted in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 &#956;g/mL. The activity was caused by the cell&#8208;damaging singlet oxygen species produced by the complexes under light exposure. Notably, the complexes showed no bacterial inhibition activity under dark conditions. This study marks the first examples of Ni(II) complexes designed for light&#8208;triggered antibacterial activity, illuminating the path for Ni(II)&#8208;based non&#8208;macrocyclic complexes for antibacterial PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;based Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, as favorable molecular tools, offer novel insights into immune checkpoint research. Here, we aim to provide a review for the potential of aptamers in developing immune therapeutic strategies and investigating molecular mechanisms.







Abstract
Cancer has long been a significant threat to human life and health. The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, which possess the same specificity and affinity as antibodies, are advantageous due to their synthetic accessibility and ease of modification, providing novel insights for immune checkpoint research. In this review, we outline the key aptamers currently developed for immune checkpoints such as CTLA&#8208;4, PD&#8208;1, PD&#8722;L1 and Siglec&#8208;15. We explore their potential in therapeutic strategies, including functionalizing or engineering aptamers for covalent binding, valency control, and nanostructure assembly, as well as investigating molecular mechanisms such as glycosylated protein functions and cell&#8208;cell interactions. Finally, the future applications of aptamers in immunotherapy are discussed.

         <title>Improving CsOAC Activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Directed Production of Olivetolic Acid through Rational Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. If the substrate is not catalyzed by the olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC), the by&#8208;product olivetol (OL) is formed. Following an in silico rational design, protein variants were evaluated regarding for OA and OL production in&#8197;vivo using S. cerevisiae. The G82&#8197;A/L92Y variant showed a successful shift towards OA.







Abstract
Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. It is produced through a unique interaction between the two proteins, olivetol synthase (CsOLS) and olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC). When the OA biosynthesis is transferred to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, olivetol (OL) is produced as a side product, even with a high enhancement of copy number of CsOAC. In order to increase the OA titer while decreasing the OL titer in S. cerevisiae, rational design was applied to CsOAC using in silico approaches such as protein&#8208;ligand docking to find potential protein variants. In vivo screening and also testing different approaches for both proteins was applied to identify the best performing variants of CsOAC. Four variants were identified that gave the desired properties. The best CsOAC variant, G82&#8197;A/L92Y, resulted in a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in OA production and a shift in the ratio between the two products towards OA.

         <title>Nanozymes as Antibacterial Agents: New Concerns in Design and Enhancement Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work enumerates new research concerns in designing antibacterial nanozymes with additional functionality or enhanced biosafety, presents non&#8208;redox nanozymes independent of highly toxic ROS and the nanozymes that combat non&#8208;common pathogenic bacteria, and reviews new enhancement strategies of using external physical (light, ultrasound) stimulation, extrinsic small molecule introduction, and various H2O2 self&#8208;supply strategies to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes.







Abstract
Nanozymes exhibiting natural enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities as antibacterial agents present several advantages, including high stability, low cost, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity, ease of preparation and storage, and minimal bacterial resistance. Consequently, they have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the rapid expansion of antimicrobial nanozyme research has resulted in pioneering reviews that do not comprehensively address emerging concerns and enhancement strategies within this field. This paper first summarizes the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of nanozymes; subsequently, we outline new research considerations for designing antibacterial nanozymes with enhanced functionality and biosafety features such as degradable, imageable, targeted, and bacterial&#8208;binding nanozymes as well as those capable of selectively targeting pathogenic bacteria while sparing normal cells and probiotics. Furthermore, we review novel enhancement strategies involving external physical stimuli (light or ultrasound), the introduction of extrinsic small molecules, and self&#8208;supplying H2O2 to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes under physiological conditions characterized by low concentrations of H2O2 and O2. Additionally, we present non&#8208;redox nanozymes that operate independently of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) alongside those designed to combat less common pathogenic bacteria. Finally, we discuss current issues, challenges faced in the field, and future prospects for antibacterial nanozymes.

         <title>Computational Studies and Functional Validation of Eugenol and Ferulic Acid as Inhibitors of Against Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the binding of natural compounds to EfSrtA by computational and experimental methods. Computational studies reveal that the ligands interacted with the protein significantly. Further to confirm the results, an enzymatic assay and functional validation on bacterial growth are also reported. The study indicates that the ligands bind to EfSrtA with significant interactions and show promising results.







Abstract
Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is commonly occurring pathogen associated with nosocomial infections. Infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) nature and their tendency to form biofilms. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches to treatment. In this regard, targeting an important protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface&#8208;exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it's a promising drug target for the development of anti&#8208;microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development. To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have expressed and purified E. faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA&#916;N59). Structural studies using homology modelling along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were also done. The results were confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti&#8208;biofilm assays and inhibition assays of selected ligands were also done against E. faecalis individually and in synergistic combinations. Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to EfSrtA&#916;N59 with significant interactions and show promising results.

Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches to treatment. In this regard, targeting an important protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface-exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram-positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it's a promising drug target for the development of anti-microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development. To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have expressed and purified &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; Sortase A (&lt;i&gt;Ef&lt;/i&gt;SrtA&lt;sub&gt;&#916;N59&lt;/sub&gt;). Structural studies using homology modelling along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were also done. The results were confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti-biofilm assays and inhibition assays of selected ligands were also done against &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; individually and in synergistic combinations. Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to &lt;i&gt;Ef&lt;/i&gt;SrtA&lt;sub&gt;&#916;N59&lt;/sub&gt; with significant interactions and show promising results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multidrug Resistance Reversed by Maleimide Interactions. A Biological and Synthetic Overview for an Emerging Field</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidrug resistance is the new big menace of the century and must be tackled, but in order to do so, we must understand how it works and what has been done about it. Herein we explore the main molecular mechanism focusing on cancer, and in the big future prospect for its treatment, maleimide, the chemical building block that could.







Abstract
Multidrug Resistance (MDR) can be considered one of the most frightening adaptation types in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and eukaryotic cells. It allows the organisms to survive the attack of many drugs used in the daily basis. This forces the development of new and more complex, highly specific drugs to fight diseases. Given the high usage of medicaments, poor variation in active chemical cores, and self&#8208;medication, the appearance of MDR is more frequent each time, and has been established as a serious medical and social problem. Over the years it has been possible the identification of several genes and proteins responsible for MDR and with that the development of blockers of them to reach MDR reversion and try to avoid a global problem. These mechanisms also have been observed in cancer cells, and several calcium channel blockers have been successful in MDR reversion, and the maleimide can be found included in them. In this review, we explore particularly the tree main proteins involved in cancer chemoresistance, MRP1 (encoded by ABCC1), BCRP (encoded by ABCG2) and P&#8208;gp (encoded by ABCB1). The participation of P&#8208;gp is remarkably important, and several aspects of its regulations are discussed. Additionally, we address the history, mechanisms, reversion efforts, and we specifically focused on the maleimide synthesis as MDR&#8208;reversers in co&#8208;administration, as well as on how their biological applications are imperative to expand the available information and explore a very plausible MDR reversion source.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cyclization by Vanadium Chloroperoxidase for Synthesis of 4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;Ones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curvularia inaequalis vanadium chloroperoxidase (CiVCPO) catalyzed the chemoenzymatic cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids with different electron&#8208;donating groups to produce good yields of 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones by adding KBr and H2O2 in citrate buffer (pH&#8197;5) containing 30&#8201;% DMSO.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones belong to the class of the secondary metabolite 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins. They exhibit a wide range of biological activities. These compounds can be synthesized through halocyclization using hypervalent iodine species or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, followed by hydrolysis. Nonetheless, the reactions required specific conditions and generated toxic byproducts. In this study, Curvularia inaequalis vanadium chloroperoxidase (CiVCPO) catalyzed the chemoenzymatic cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids with different electron&#8208;donating groups (1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;e) to produce good yields of 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones (3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;e) by adding KBr and H2O2 in citrate buffer (pH&#8197;5). The reaction mixture contained 30&#8201;% DMSO to improve substrate solubility without enzyme activity loss. The condition is more environmentally friendly than chemical methods. Therefore, it offers an alternative approach for synthesizing 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones.

         <title>Senolytic Prodrugs: A Promising Approach to Enhancing Senescence&#8208;Targeting Intervention</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elimination of senescent cells is an emerging therapeutic strategy for improving lifespan and treating age&#8208;related diseases. This Concept highlights the recent developments of senolytic prodrugs to enhance senescent cell targeting intervention. This Concept highlights the recent developments of senolytic prodrugs to improve senescent cell targeting intervention. Two strategies 1) galactose&#8208;modified senolytic prodrugs, in which sensing unit galactose is either directly conjugated to the drug or via a self&#8208;immolative linker and 2) bioorthogonal activation of senolytic prodrugs by incorporation of galactose into dihydrotetrazine to sense SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal for click activation, are discussed.







Abstract
Cellular senescence has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for aging and a wide range of age&#8208;related disorders. Despite the encouraging therapeutic impact of senolytic agents on improving lifespan and the outcomes of pharmacological intervention, the senolytic induced side effects pose barriers to clinical application. There is a pressing need for selective ablation of senescent cells (SnCs). The design of senolytic prodrugs has been demonstrated as a promising approach to addressing these issues. These prodrugs are generally designed via modification of senolytics with a cleavable galactose moiety to respond to the senescent biomarker &#8208; senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal) to restore their therapeutic effects. In this Concept, we summarize the developments by categorizing these prodrugs into two classes: 1) galactose&#8208;modified senolytic prodrugs, in which sensing unit galactose is either directly conjugated to the drug or via a self&#8208;immolative linker and 2) bioorthogonal activation of senolytic prodrugs. In the bioorthogonal prodrug design, galactose is incorporated into dihydrotetrazine to sense SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal for click activation. Notably, in addition to repurposed chemotherapeutics and small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs and photodynamic therapy have been introduced as new senolytics in the prodrug design. It is expected that the senolytic prodrugs would facilitate translating small&#8208;molecule senolytics into clinical use.

         <title>Deciphering the Effect of a Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone Complex on Intracellular Cell Signalling Pathways in a Human Osteosarcoma 2D and 3D Models</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work studies the antitumor effects, molecular targets and cellular pathways of Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone on human osteosarcoma in 2D and 3D systems. CuHL decreases cell viability, inhibits proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Its mechanism involves DNA interaction, genotoxicity, ROS generation, and proteasome inhibition. Proteomic analysis reveals differentially expressed proteins with notable effects on stress response, ATP synthesis, DNA replication, and redox homeostasis.







Abstract
New therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma (OS) have demonstrated the potential efficacy of copper compounds as anticancer drugs and as a substitute for the often used platinum compounds. OS is a type of bone cancer, primarily affecting young adults and children.The main objective of this work is to discover the molecular targets and cellular pathways related to the antitumor properties of a Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone toward human OS 2D and 3D systems. Cell viability study using MG&#8208;63 cells was evaluated in OS monolayer and spheroids. CuHL significantly reduced cell viability in OS models (IC50 2D: 2.6&#177;0.3&#8197;&#956;M; IC50 3D: 9.9&#177;1.4&#8197;&#956;M) (p&lt;0.001). Also, CuHL inhibits cell proliferation and it induces cells to apoptosis. The main mechanism of action found for CuHL are the interaction with DNA, genotoxicity, the ROS generation and the proteasome activity inhibition. Besides, 67 differentially expressed proteins were found using proteomic approaches. Of those 67 proteins, 40 were found overexpressed and 27 underexpressed. The response to stress and to unfolded protein, as well as ATP synthesis were the most affected biological process among upregulated proteins, whilst proteins related to DNA replication and redox homeostasis were downregulated.

         <title>Implications of the Lipidic Ecosystem for the Membrane Binding of ApoE Signal Peptide: Importance of Sphingomyelin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipidic ecosystem plays an important role in the binding of signal peptides to the membrane vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the translocation of nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. We have demonstrated how different lipids such as sphingomyelin, cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine modulate the membrane binding of ApoE signal peptide.







Abstract
The unidirectional movement of nascent secretory proteins in the cell is primarily assisted by the signal recognition particles (SRP). However, this does not completely justify the importance of the signal peptide (SP) which gets eliminated after the protein translocation. We have earlier demonstrated that a negatively charged lipid such as POPG plays an important role in the higher binding affinity and cholesterol&#8208;discriminating ability of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) SP. In this present work, we aimed to understand the role of sphingomyelin, an important constituent of ER, on the membrane binding of ApoE SP. Our results demonstrate that sphingomyelin promotes membrane binding but cannot discriminate cholesterol. However, sphingomyelin shows a synergistic effect with POPG toward the membrane binding of the ApoE SP. We have further shown that the membrane domains do not have any impact on the binding of ApoE SP. Based on our results we propose that the lipid composition of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where ApoE translocates, enhances the binding of the ApoE signal peptide to the ER membrane.

         <title>Untangling the Complexity and Impact of Tau Protein Ubiquitination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tau is a neuronal protein that aggregates under pathological conditions. This concept article highlights recent advances in understanding how ubiquitination of tau plays a role in both physiological and pathological conditions. We focus on enzymatic and semi&#8208;synthetic conjugation, aggregation, conformational transitions, and clearance mechanisms.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered protein highly expressed in neuronal axons. In healthy neurons, tau regulates microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth. However, pathological conditions can trigger aberrant tau aggregation into insoluble filaments, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau undergoes diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs), suggesting complex regulation and potentially varied functions. Among PTMs, the role and mechanisms of ubiquitination in physiology and disease have remained enigmatic. The past three decades have witnessed the emergence of key studies on tau protein ubiquitination. In this concept, we discuss how these investigations have begun to shed light on the ubiquitination patterns of physiological and pathological tau, the responsible enzymatic machinery, and the influence of ubiquitination on tau aggregation. We also provide an overview of the semi&#8208;synthetic methods that have enabled in&#8197;vitro investigations of conformational transitions of tau induced by ubiquitin modification. Finally, we discuss future perspectives in the field necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tau ubiquitination and clearance.

         <title>How Clavulanic Acid Inhibits Serine &#946;&#8208;Lactamases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inhibition of serine &#946;&#8208;lactamases by clavulanic acid occurs via a bifurcating mechanism. The formation of an acyl&#8208;enzyme complex may be followed by hydrolysis, or oxazolidine ring opening and subsequent decarboxylation to give more stable species. Further fragmentation is slow and is less likely to be biologically relevant in inhibition.







Abstract
Clavulanic acid is a medicinally important inhibitor of serine &#946;&#8208;lactamases (SBLs). We report studies on the mechanisms by which clavulanic acid inhibits representative Ambler class A (TEM&#8208;116), C (Escherichia coli AmpC), and D (OXA&#8208;10) SBLs using denaturing and non&#8208;denaturing mass spectrometry (MS). Similarly to observations with penam sulfones, most of the results support a mechanism involving acyl enzyme complex formation, followed by oxazolidine ring opening without efficient subsequent scaffold fragmentation (at pH&#8197;7.5). This observation contrasts with previous MS studies, which identified clavulanic acid scaffold fragmented species as the predominant SBL bound products. In all the SBLs studied here, fragmentation was promoted by acidic conditions, which are commonly used in LC&#8211;MS analyses. Slow fragmentation was, however, observed under neutral conditions with TEM&#8208;116 on prolonged reaction with clavulanic acid. Although our results imply clavulanic acid scaffold fragmentation is likely not crucial for SBL inhibition in&#8197;vivo, development of inhibitors that fragment to give stable covalent complexes is of interest.

         <title>pH Sensitivity of YFPs is Reduced Upon AlphaRep Binding: Proof of Concept in Vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Citrine is a fluorescent protein (FP) whose fluorescence is pH&#8208;sensitive. The artificial repeat protein, &#945;Rep, binds to Citrine at all pHs, enhancing its thermal stability and reducing its pH sensitivity by lowering its pKa. The same effect is observed in living cells or with other yellow FPs in&#8197;vitro, suggesting &#945;Reps&#8217; potential to improve YFP utility in acidic environments.







Abstract
Yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) are commonly used in biology to track cellular processes, particularly as acceptors in experiments using the F&#246;rster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) phenomenon. However, their fluorescence intensity is strongly pH&#8208;dependent, limiting their utility in acidic environments. Here, we explore the pH sensitivity of YFPs upon binding with an artificial repeat protein (&#945;Rep) both in&#8197;vitro and in living cells. We show that &#945;Rep binds to Citrine, with high affinity in the nanomolar range at physiological and acidic pHs, leading to increased thermal stability of the complex. Moreover, &#945;Rep binding reduces Citrine's pKa by 0.75&#8197;pH units, leading to a decreased sensitivity to pH fluctuations. This effect can be generalized to other YFPs as Venus and EYFP in&#8197;vitro. An efficient binding of &#945;Rep to Citrine has also been observed in living cells both at pH&#8197;7.4 and pH&#8197;6. This interaction leads to reduced variations of Citrine fluorescence intensity in response to pH variations in cells. Overall, the study highlights the potential of &#945;Reps as a tool to modulate the pH sensitivity of YFPs, paving the way for future exploration of biological events in acidic environments by FRET in combination with a pH&#8208;insensitive cyan donor.

         <title>Previously Published Phosphatase Probes have Limited Utility Due to their Unspecific Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study evaluates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) probes targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases, including three direct electrophiles and three quinone methide&#8208;based traps. Despite previously reported success in purified enzyme assays, all probes show unspecific labelling or non&#8208;activity&#8208;based behaviour. Quinone methide&#8208;based traps also cause &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, limiting their potential for ABPP and inhibitor development in phosphatase research.







Abstract
This study explores the use of activity&#8208;based protein profiling to study protein tyrosine phosphatases. With the discovery of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors, this enzyme family has resurfaced as interesting drug targets. Therefore, we envisioned that previously described direct electrophiles and quinone methide&#8208;based traps targeting phosphatases could be applied in competitive activity&#8208;based protein profiling assays. This study evaluates three direct electrophiles, specifically, a vinyl sulfonate, a vinyl sulfone, and an &#945;&#8208;bromobenzylphosphonate as well as three quinone methide&#8208;based traps as activity&#8208;based probes. For all these moieties it was previously shown that they could selectively engage in assays with purified or overexpressed phosphatases in bacterial lysates. However, this study demonstrates that probes based on these moieties all suffer from unspecific labelling. Direct electrophiles were either unspecific or not activity&#8208;based, while quinone methide&#8208;based traps showed dependence on phosphatase activity but also resulted in unspecific labelling due to diffusion after activation. This phenomenon, termed &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, occurred even with catalytically inactive SHP2 mutants. We concluded that alternative strategies or chemistries are needed to apply activity&#8208;based protein profiling in phosphatase research.

     alt="Previously Published Phosphatase Probes have Limited Utility Due to their Unspecific Reactivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study evaluates activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) probes targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases, including three direct electrophiles and three quinone methide-based traps. Despite previously reported success in purified enzyme assays, all probes show unspecific labelling or non-activity-based behaviour. Quinone methide-based traps also cause &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, limiting their potential for ABPP and inhibitor development in phosphatase research.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explores the use of activity-based protein profiling to study protein tyrosine phosphatases. With the discovery of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors, this enzyme family has resurfaced as interesting drug targets. Therefore, we envisioned that previously described direct electrophiles and quinone methide-based traps targeting phosphatases could be applied in competitive activity-based protein profiling assays. This study evaluates three direct electrophiles, specifically, a vinyl sulfonate, a vinyl sulfone, and an &#945;-bromobenzylphosphonate as well as three quinone methide-based traps as activity-based probes. For all these moieties it was previously shown that they could selectively engage in assays with purified or overexpressed phosphatases in bacterial lysates. However, this study demonstrates that probes based on these moieties all suffer from unspecific labelling. Direct electrophiles were either unspecific or not activity-based, while quinone methide-based traps showed dependence on phosphatase activity but also resulted in unspecific labelling due to diffusion after activation. This phenomenon, termed &#8242;bystander&#8217; labelling, occurred even with catalytically inactive SHP2 mutants. We concluded that alternative strategies or chemistries are needed to apply activity-based protein profiling in phosphatase research. Moreover, this study shows that quinone methide-based designs have limited potential in probe and inhibitor development strategies due to their intrinsic reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Small Molecule Induces Time&#8208;Dependent Inhibition of Stat3 Dimerization and DNA&#8208;Binding Activity and Regresses Human Breast Tumor Xenografts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The picture shows the impact of JKB887 against the DNA&#8208;binding activity of the Stat3:Stat3 dimer. The binding of JKB887 with Stat3 first interferes with the Stat3 phospho&#8208;tyrosine peptide interaction with the SH2 domain, which in turn inhibits Stat3:Stat3 dimerization. The disruption of Stat3:Stat3 dimerization ultimately leads to a decrease in the Stat3 DNA&#8208;binding activity. JKB887 could also directly inhibit Stat3 DNA&#8208;binding activity.







Abstract
Aberrantly&#8208;active signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3 has a causal role in many human cancers and represents a validated anticancer drug target, though it has posed significant challenge to drug development. A new small molecule, JKB887, was identified through library screening and is predicted to interact with Lys591, Arg609 and Pro63 in the phospho&#8208;tyrosine (pTyr)&#8208;binding pocket of the Stat3 SH2 domain. JKB887 inhibited Stat3 DNA&#8208;binding activity in&#8197;vitro in a time&#8208;dependent manner, with IC50 of 2.2&#8211;4.5&#8197;&#956;M at 30&#8211;60&#8208;min incubation. It directly disrupted both the Stat3 binding to the cognate, high&#8208;affinity pTyr (pY) peptide, GpYLPQTV&#8208;NH2 in fluorescent polarization assay with IC50 of 3.5&#8211;5.5&#8197;&#956;M at 60&#8211;90&#8208;min incubation, and to the IL&#8208;6 receptor/gp130 or Src in treated malignant cells. Treatment with JKB887 selectively blocked constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, and Stat3&#8208;regulated gene expression, and decreased viable cell numbers, cell growth, colony formation, migration, and survival in human or mouse tumor cells. By contrast, JKB887 had minimal effects on Stat1, pErk1/2MAPK, pShc, pJAK2, or pSrc induction, or on cells that do not harbor aberrantly&#8208;active Stat3. Additionally, JKB887 inhibited growth of human breast cancer xenografts in mice. JKB887 is a Stat3&#8208;selective inhibitor with demonstrable antitumor effects against Stat3&#8208;dependent human cancers.

         <title>Mapping Endocytic Vesicular Acidification with a pH&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating a pH&#8208;sensitive i&#8208;motif into a tetrahedral DNA framework, we develop a pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine to track endocytic vesicle acidification during the endosomal maturation process.







Abstract
Mapping the endocytic vesicular acidification process is of prior importance to better understand the health and pathological processes of cells. Herein, by integrating a pH&#8208;sensitive i&#8208;motif and a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF), we develop a pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine, allowing for efficient sensing of pH from 7.0 to 5.5 via the pH&#8208;triggered spatial proximity modulation of FRET. The inheriting endo&#8208;lysosome&#8208;targeting ability of TDF enables spatiotemporal tracking of endocytic vesicle acidification during the endosomal maturation process. Analysis of pH&#8208;dependent FRET response at single fluorescent spot level reveals the significant difference of endocytic vesicular acidification between normal and cancer cells. The performance of pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine underlines its potential for studies on vesicle acidification&#8208;related pathologies as a universal platform.

         <dc:description>
This study screened the P450BM3 enzyme library to identify the best mutant, BM3&#8208;139&#8208;3, capable of oxidizing the substrate (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene. Structural analysis of compound 1, obtained through separation and purification, revealed it to be a novel compound named (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane. By semi&#8208;rational design, a mutant BM3&#8208;139&#8208;3&#8208;M2 with higher selectivity and turnover numbers (increasing from 587 to 964) for (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane was obtained.







Abstract
(+)&#8208;Bicyclogermacrene is a sesquiterpene compound found in various plant essential oils and serves as a crucial precursor for multiple biologically active compounds. Many derivatives of (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene have been shown to exhibit valuable bioactivities. Cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium can catalyze a variety of substrates and different types of oxidation reactions, making it become a powerful tool for oxidizing terpenes. In this study, we employed P450 BM3&#8208;139&#8208;3 variant for in&#8197;vitro enzymatic oxidation of (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene, identifying a novel oxidized derivative of (+)&#8208;bicyclogermacrene, named (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane, and an unknown sesquiterpenoid in a ratio of 70&#8201;:&#8201;30 (by GC peak area). (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;Epoxymaaliane showed demonstrated antibacterial activities toward Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. To obtain a better variant of the monooxygenase with a high selectivity to form (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane, we combined alanine scanning with the &#8220;Focused Rational Iterative Site&#8208;Specific Mutagenesis&#8221; (FRISM) strategy to modify the closest residues within 5&#8197;&#197; radius surrounding the substrate to create a small&#8208;but&#8208;smart library of mutants. Consequently, it gave an optimal variant with 1.6&#8208;fold improvement, in a turnover number (TON) of up to 964 toward (+)&#8208;3,6&#8208;epoxymaaliane production with a higher product selectivity.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Consequences of NEDD8 Acetylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides the notion that under oxidative stress conditions NEDD8 acetylation affects PARP1 activity, only little is known about the functional consequences of NEDD8 acetylation. Therefore, we used genetic code expansion to generate mono&#8208;acetylated (AcK) NEDD8 variants, enabling their detailed characterization on a biochemical and structural level. Moreover, we identified p300 as a NEDD8 acetyl&#8208;transferase.







Abstract
Similar to ubiquitin, the ubiquitin&#8208;like protein NEDD8 is not only conjugated to other proteins but is itself subject to posttranslational modifications including lysine acetylation. Yet, compared to ubiquitin, only little is known about the biochemical and structural consequences of site&#8208;specific NEDD8 acetylation. Here, we generated site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;acetylated NEDD8 variants for each known acetylation site by genetic code expansion. We show that, in particular, acetylation of K11 has a negative impact on the usage of NEDD8 by the NEDD8&#8208;conjugating enzymes UBE2M and UBE2F and that this is likely due to electrostatic and steric effects resulting in conformational changes of NEDD8. Finally, we provide evidence that p300 acts as a position&#8208;specific NEDD8 acetyltransferase.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to ubiquitin, the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 is not only conjugated to other proteins but is itself subject to posttranslational modifications including lysine acetylation. Yet, compared to ubiquitin, only little is known about the biochemical and structural consequences of site-specific NEDD8 acetylation. Here, we generated site-specifically mono-acetylated NEDD8 variants for each known acetylation site by genetic code expansion. We show that, in particular, acetylation of K11 has a negative impact on the usage of NEDD8 by the NEDD8-conjugating enzymes UBE2M and UBE2F and that this is likely due to electrostatic and steric effects resulting in conformational changes of NEDD8. Finally, we provide evidence that p300 acts as a position-specific NEDD8 acetyltransferase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Modification of Daptomycin: Aromatic Group Installation on Trp1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic prenyltransferase CdpNPT can modify Trp1 of daptomycin using various alkyl&#8208;pyrophosphate analogs. This study evaluated CdpNPT's ability to generate daptomycin analogs with 21 different benzylic and heterocyclic alkyl&#8208;PP analogs. All six structurally characterized Trp1&#8208;substituted daptomycin analogs demonstrated potent activity against DapS and DapR Gram&#8208;positive bacterial strains.







Abstract
Daptomycin is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin&#8208;resistant enterococci (VRE). The emergence of daptomycin&#8208;resistant bacterial strains has renewed interest in generating daptomycin analogs. Previous studies have shown that replacing the tryptophan of daptomycin with aromatic groups can generate analogs with enhanced potency. Additionally, we have demonstrated that aromatic prenyltransferases can attach diverse groups to the tryptophan of daptomycin. Here, we report the use of the prenyltransferase CdpNPT to derivatize the tryptophan of daptomycin with a library of benzylic and heterocyclic pyrophosphates. An analytical&#8208;scale study revealed that CdpNPT can transfer various aromatic groups onto daptomycin. Subsequent scaled&#8208;up and purified reactions indicated that the enzyme can attach aromatic groups to N1, C2, C5 and C6 positions of Trp1 of daptomycin. In vitro antibacterial activity assays using six of these purified compounds identified aromatic substituted daptomycin analogs show potency against both daptomycin&#8208;susceptible and resistant strains of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. These findings suggest that installing aromatic groups on the Trp1 of daptomycin can lead to the generation of potent daptomycin analogs.

         <title>(S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 Activates Autophagy via TRPML1&#8208;TFEB Pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed liquid chromatography (LC) and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) to resolve for the first time, the enantiomers of ML&#8208;SA1 an agonist of the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1. Compound (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 was nearly 10&#8208;fold more potent than the racemate in the calcium assay, which lead to a strong transcription factor EB (TFEB) translocation to the nucleus, followed by gene transcription and increase in the autophagy markers.







Abstract
Autophagic flux plays a crucial role in various diseases. Recently, the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 has emerged as a promising target in lysosomal storage diseases, such as mucolipidosis. The discovery of mucolipin synthetic agonist&#8208;1 (ML&#8208;SA1) has expanded our understanding of TRPML1&#8242;s function and its potential therapeutic uses. However, ML&#8208;SA1 is a racemate with limited cellular potency and poor water solubility. In this study, we synthetized rac&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1, separated the enantiomers by chiral liquid chromatography and determined their absolute configuration by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). In addition, we focused on investigating the impact of each enantiomer of ML&#8208;SA1 on the TRPML1&#8208;TFEB axis. Our findings revealed that (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 acts as an agonist for TRPML1 at the lysosomal membrane. This activation prompts transcription factor EB (TFEB) to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus in a dose&#8208;dependent manner within live cells. Consequently, this signaling pathway enhances the expression of coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) genes and activates autophagic flux. Our study presents evidence for the potential use of (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 in the development of new therapies for lysosomal storage diseases that target TRPML1.

A 2,6&#8208;dihydroxybenzoyl&#8208;hydrazone fluorophore with benzene sulfonamide moiety for Golgi homing is designed and synthesized and the photophysical properties are explained by theoretical studies. This novel probe illuminates the Golgi apparatus in colon cancer cells selectively.







Abstract
Herein, we have designed and synthesised a 2,6&#8208;dihydroxybenzoyl&#8208;hydrazone (compound 3) fluorophore through a concise strategy. Molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical simulations revealed that long range charge transfer (CT) to be the underlying mechanism for the emissive property of compound 3. Confocal microscopy and cell viability assays confirmed that within 3&#8197;h, compound 3 homed into the Golgi&#8208;apparatus of colon cancer cells (HCT&#8208;116) selectively compared to the breast (MCF7), lung (A549), cervical (HeLa) cancer cells and non&#8208;cancerous retinal epithelial pigment cells (RPE&#8208;1) with negligible toxicity. This novel fluorophore has potential to image Golgi&#8208;apparatus in a cancer cell specific manner for diagnosis.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Functionalization of Bovine Milk Exosomes with an EGFR Nanobody for Target&#8208;specific Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bovine milk exosomes (BmExo) were functionalized with an EGFR&#8208;specific nanobody 7D12 by combining facile chemical modifications of amphiphile molecules and SrtA&#8208;mediated site&#8208;specific ligations. The 7D12&#8208;modified BmExo exhibited specific delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) to EGFR&#8208;positive cancer cells, while reducing non&#8208;specific toxicity to EGFR&#8208;negative cells. The method is versatile and efficient for the generation of protein&#8208;ligand modified BmExo.







Abstract
Bovine milk exosomes (BmExo) have been identified as versatile nanovesicles for anti&#8208;cancer drugs delivery due to their natural availability and biocompatibility. However, tumor&#8208;specific delivery based on BmExo often requires post&#8208;isolation modifications of the membrane surface with active&#8208;targeting ligands. In this study, we report an alternative approach to functionalize BmExo with nanobody combining facile chemical modification and Sortase A&#8208;mediated site&#8208;specific ligation, as demonstrated by the development of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeted drug delivery system. The BmExo membrane was first coated with a diglycine&#8208;containing amphiphile molecule, NH2&#8208;GG&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE, by hydrophobic insertion. The diglycine as nucleophiles displayed on the membrane enabled the subsequent ligation of the EGFR nanobody (7D12) by Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated site&#8208;specific transpeptidation. The successful construction of BmExo&#8208;7D12 was confirmed by Western blotting analysis, electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). As a demonstration model, BmExo&#8208;7D12 loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox) was shown to be able to deliver Dox to cancer cells in response to the expression of EGFR as manifested by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. Finally, the cytotoxicity assay showed that BmExo&#8208;7D12&#8208;Dox was more effective in killing tumor cells with high EGFR expression while significantly reduced the non&#8208;specific toxicity to EGFR negative cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that 7D12&#8208;functionalized BmExo can serve as a target&#8208;specific delivery system for Dox to selectively kill EGFR&#8208;expressing tumor cells. This approach should prove to be versatile and efficient for the generation of protein&#8208;ligands modified BmExo.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Insulin Using Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modification of proteins is important for many new biopharmaceuticals. Continuous&#8208;flow chemistry, where reactants are continuously pumped into a flow reactor, is widely used for small molecules. Here, continuous flow chemistry in a glass microreactor is used to selectively modify a small protein, insulin.







Abstract
Chemical modification of proteins is of growing importance to generate new molecular probes for chemical biology and for the development of new biopharmaceuticals. For example, two approved, long&#8208;acting insulin variants are lipidated at the LysB29 side&#8208;chain. Acylations of proteins have so far been performed in batch&#8208;mode. Here we describe the use of flow chemistry for site&#8208;selective acylation of a small protein, insulin. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on flow chemistry for chemical modification of insulin. The first step was to develop reaction conditions for acylation of Lys B29 that gave a soluble mixture and thus was compatible with flow chemistry in a microreactor; this included selection of a soluble base. Secondly, the conditions, such as reagent ratios and flow rate were optimized. Third, the use of these conditions for the acylation with a wide range of acids was demonstrated. Finally, Boc&#8208;protected insulins were synthesized. Insulin remained stable towards these flow chemistry conditions. This use of flow chemistry for the chemical modification of insulin opens the prospect of producing chemically modified biopharmaceuticals by flow chemistry with fewer byproducts.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in a Coumarin&#8208;Caged Peptide Leads to a Surprising Enzyme Hyperactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the photo&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of coumarin&#8208;based caging groups using photoreleasable peptides in the context of protein phosphatase&#8208;1 (PP1) activity. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of linker design in controlling uncaging efficiency, offering insights for the design of such fluorescently labelled peptides for biological applications.







Abstract
Protein phosphatase&#8208;1 (PP1) is a ubiquitous enzyme that counteracts hundreds of kinases in cells. PP1 interacts with regulatory proteins via an RVxF peptide motif that binds to a hydrophobic groove on the enzyme. PP1&#8208;disrupting peptides (PDPs) compete with these regulatory proteins, leading to the release of the active PP1 subunit and promoting substrate dephosphorylation. Building on previous strategies employing the ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl (o&#8208;Nb) group as a photocage to control PDP activity, we introduced coumarin derivatives into a PDP via an ether bond to explore their effects on PP1 activity. Surprisingly, our study revealed that the coumarin&#8208;caged peptides (PDP&#8208;DEACM and PDP&#8208;CM) underwent a photo&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, resulting in an unexpected hyperactivation of PP1. Our findings underscore the importance of linker design in controlling uncaging efficiency of photocages and highlight the need for comprehensive in&#8197;vitro analysis before cellular experiments.

         <title>Phosphorylation of the HMGN1 Nucleosome Binding Domain Decreases Helicity and Interactions with the Acidic Patch</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleosome&#8208;binding protein HMGN1 populates an ensemble of conformational states that could be shifted by phosphorylation within the nucleosome binding domain. Herein, we employ predictive modelling and experimental structural biology tools to explore how serine phosphorylation within this key motif decreases helicity and disrupts interaction with the nucleosome acidic patch.







Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins are abundant in the nucleus and are prime sites for posttranslational modifications that modulate transcriptional regulation. Lacking a defined three&#8208;dimensional structure, intrinsically disordered proteins populate an ensemble of several conformational states, which are dynamic and often altered by posttranslational modifications, or by binding to interaction partners. Although there is growing appreciation for the role that intrinsically disordered regions have in regulating protein&#8208;protein interactions, we still have a poor understanding of how to determine conformational population shifts, their causes under various conditions, and how to represent and model conformational ensembles. Here, we study the effects of serine phosphorylation in the nucleosome&#8208;binding domain of an intrinsically disordered protein &#8211; HMGN1 &#8211; using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism and modelling of protein complexes. We show that phosphorylation induces local conformational changes in the peptide backbone and decreases the helical propensity of the nucleosome binding domain. Modelling studies using AlphaFold3 suggest that phosphorylation disrupts the interface between HMGN1 and the nucleosome acidic patch, but that the models over&#8208;predict helicity in comparison to experimental data. These studies help us to build a picture of how posttranslational modifications might shift the conformational populations of disordered regions, alter access to histones, and regulate chromatin compaction.

In article 10.1002/cbic.202400506, Micael R. Cunha, Rafael M. Cou&#241;ago, Katlin B Massirer, and co&#8208;workers have demonstrated that (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 is the eutomer with agonist activity over the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1. Its mirror image (R)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 does not activate the ion channel but competes for binding to the allosteric site. The cover figure illustrates (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 facing a mirror with its counterpart (R)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1. Behind the compounds are representative images of TRPML1 in the active (transporting calcium ions) and inactive states, respectively.

         <dc:description>
Clavulanic acid is a densely functionalized low mass (C8H9NO5) drug, which is used to protect penicillins and other &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by serine &#946;&#8208;lactamases. As shown by detailed mass spectrometric analyses, clavulanic acid reacts covalently with serine &#946;&#8208;lactamase to form an initial acyl&#8208;enzyme complex which, like the analogous complex formed with &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics, can undergo hydrolysis. In the case of clavulanic acid, however, the acyl&#8208;enzyme complex also undergoes competing fragmentation to give inhibitory complexes stable to hydrolysis. More details can be found in article 10.1002/cbic.202400280 by Christopher J. Schofield and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Understanding Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Substrate Inhibition and Prospects for Elimination Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate inhibition, a form of atypical Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics, results in reduced enzyme activity due to excessive substrate binding to CYP450, adversely affecting product formation. This occurs because CYP450 possesses multiple active sites. Further details will be explored in the main text. Overcoming this requires methods like enzyme immobilization, batch feeding, biphasic systems, and protein engineering.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, which are widely distributed and pivotal in various biochemical reactions, catalyze diverse processes such as hydroxylation, epoxidation, dehydrogenation, dealkylation, nitrification, and bond formation. These enzymes have been applied in drug metabolism, antibiotic production, bioremediation, and fine chemical synthesis. Recent research revealed that CYP450 catalytic kinetics deviated from the classic Michaelis&#8211;Menten model. A notable substrate inhibition phenomenon that affects the catalytic efficiency of CYP450 at high substrate concentrations was identified. However, the substrate inhibition of various reactions catalyzed by CYP450 enzymes have not been comprehensively reviewed. This review describes CYP450 substrate inhibition examples and atypical Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetic models, and provides insight into mechanisms of these enzymes. We also reviewed 3D structure and dynamics of CYP450 with substrate binding. Outline methods for alleviating substrate inhibition in CYP450 and other enzymes, including traditional fermentation approaches and protein engineering modifications. The comprehensive analysis presented in this study lays the foundation for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of CYP450 by deregulating substrate inhibition.

         <title>New Frontiers in Nonheme Enzymatic Oxyferryl Species</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 22, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we summarize the reactivities demonstrated by S=2 oxyferryl intermediates found in non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron enzymes and the recently discovered S=1 ferryl intermediate in the same enzyme family. The mechanistic implication and the reactivity difference of the ferryl intermediates with different spin states are further discussed.







Abstract
Non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron dependent (NHM&#8722;Fe) enzymes exhibit exceedingly diverse catalytic reactivities. Despite their catalytic versatilities, the mononuclear iron centers in these enzymes show a relatively simple architecture, in which an iron atom is ligated with 2&#8211;4 amino acid residues, including histidine, aspartic or glutamic acid. In the past two decades, a common high&#8208;valent reactive iron intermediate, the S=2 oxyferryl (Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo or Fe(IV)=O) species, has been repeatedly discovered in NHM&#8722;Fe enzymes containing a 2&#8208;His&#8208;Fe or 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;Fe center. However, for 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes, no common reactive intermediate has been identified. Recently, we have spectroscopically characterized the first S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate in a 3&#8208;His&#8208;Fe containing enzyme, OvoA, which catalyzes a novel oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation. In this review, we summarize the broad reactivities demonstrated by S=2 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates, the discovery of the first S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate in OvoA and the mechanistic implication of such a discovery, and the intrinsic reactivity differences of the S=2 and the S=1 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo species. Finally, we postulate the possible reasons to utilize an S=1 Fe(IV) species in OvoA and their implications to other 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes.

         <title>Designer Helical Fibers and Tubes: Self&#8208;Assembling Hybrid Peptides via Leu/Ile&#8208;Phe Zipper</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present a family of simple peptides that show diverse self&#8208;assembling behaviors. We used aliphatic (Leu/Ile) and aromatic (Phe) amino acids to delineate our design. The design consists of phenylene urea at the N&#8208;terminus of the peptide. The urea peptides with sequence Phe&#8208;LeuOMe (1) or Phe&#8208;IleOMe (2) associate to form polygonal peptide tubes via zipper arrangements, supported by microscopic and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The peptide with Phe placed away from the phenylene urea (3 and 4), showed fibrous assembly. All the peptides showed autofluorescence and red edge excitation behavior upon self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis and Prediction of Chymotrypsin Substrate Preferences through Large Data Acquisition with Target&#8208;Free mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oral delivery of peptide therapeutics is limited by degradation by gut proteases like chymotrypsin. Existing databases of peptidases are limited in size and do not enable systematic analyses of protease substrate preferences, especially for non&#8208;natural amino acids. Thus, stability optimization of hit compounds is time and resource intensive. To accelerate the stability optimization of peptide ligands, we generated large datasets of chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant peptides via mRNA display to create a predictive model for chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant sequences. Through analysis of enriched motifs, we recapitulate known chymotrypsin cleavage sites, reveal positionally dependent effects of monomers on peptide cleavage, and report previously unidentified protective and destabilizing residues. We then developed a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based model&#160;predicting peptide resistance to chymotrypsin cleavage and validated both model performance and the NGS experimental data by measuring chymotrypsin half&#8208;lives for a subset of peptides. Finally, we simulated stability predictions on non&#8208;natural amino acids through a leucine hold&#8208;out model and observed robust performance. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of mRNA display as a tool for big data generation and show that pairing mRNA display with machine learning yields valuable predictions for chymotrypsin cleavage. Expansion of this workflow to additional proteases could provide complementary predictive models that focus future peptide drug discovery efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the P&#8208;cluster of Vanadium Nitrogenase: an EPR and XAS study of the holo vs. apo forms of the enzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic moiety of nitrogenases contains two complex metalloclusters: the M&#8208;cluster (also called cofactor), where the catalytic reduction of substrates takes place, and the [Fe8S7] P&#8208;cluster responsible for electron transfer. Due to discrepancies between crystallography and EPR spectroscopy, the exact structure of the P&#8208;cluster in the VFe protein remains a topic of debate. Herein, we use an apo&#8208;form of VFe (which retains the P&#8208;cluster but lacks the FeVco) to study the VFe P&#8208;cluster. SDS&#8208;PAGE and NativePAGE showed a heterogeneous composition of the VFe and the apo&#8208;VFe samples with presence of &#945;1&#946;2&#948;2 and &#945;1&#946;2 complexes. The parallel mode EPR measurements of IDS oxidized MoFe, apo&#8208;MoFe, and VFe samples reveal a signal at g = 12 associated with the two&#8208;electron oxidized state of the P&#8208;cluster (P2+) for all three samples, albeit with different intensities. In contrast, no P2+ was observed for IDS oxidized apo&#8208;VFe. Additionally, comparisons between apo&#8208;MoFe, apo&#8208;VFe and the model complex (NBu4)2[Fe4S4(SPh)4] via XAS and EXAFS measurements showed that apo&#8208;VFe does not contain a fully formed [Fe8S7] P&#8208;cluster, but rather is comprised of fragmented iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Our results point to a possible variation on the structure of the P&#8208;cluster in the different forms of the nitrogenase.</dc:description>

         <title>Multipartite Fluorogenic Sensors for Monitoring Tyrosine Phosphatase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fluorescence&#8208;Activating and absorption&#8208;Shifting Tag (FAST) protein provides a highly sensitive readout of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of either the small molecule fluorogen required for FAST fluorescence or the C&#8208;terminal peptide fragment of splitFAST, abrogates fluorescence of the protein. Phosphatase&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of these substrates results in significant increases in fluorescence, proportional to phosphatase activity.







Abstract
Fluorogenic substrates are essential tools for studying the activity of many enzymes including the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Here, we have taken the first step toward the development of genetically encodable sensors for PTP activity using fluorescent and fluorogen&#8208;activating proteins. The Fluorescence&#8208;Activating and absorption Shifting Tag (FAST) is a small protein that becomes fluorescent upon binding to a small molecule dye. We demonstrate that FAST protein can be used as a sensor for PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of phosphorylated dye molecules. Phosphorylated 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (pHBR) is not able to bind to the FAST protein and induce fluorescence, but provides a sensitive assay for PTP activity, readily detecting 100&#8197;pM concentrations of PTP1B in the presence of FAST with a kcat value of 19&#177;1&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a KM value of 93&#177;3&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, while phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of split GFP does not result in appreciable change in fluorescence of the reconstituted protein, phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of the split FAST protein abrogates fluorescence. Upon PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide, the ability of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal components to form a fluorescent complex with the small molecule dye is restored, leading to fluorescence.

&lt;p&gt;The Fluorescence-Activating and absorption-Shifting Tag (FAST) protein provides a highly sensitive readout of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of either the small molecule fluorogen required for FAST fluorescence or the C-terminal peptide fragment of splitFAST, abrogates fluorescence of the protein. Phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of these substrates results in significant increases in fluorescence, proportional to phosphatase activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorogenic substrates are essential tools for studying the activity of many enzymes including the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Here, we have taken the first step toward the development of genetically encodable sensors for PTP activity using fluorescent and fluorogen-activating proteins. The Fluorescence-Activating and absorption Shifting Tag (FAST) is a small protein that becomes fluorescent upon binding to a small molecule dye. We demonstrate that FAST protein can be used as a sensor for PTP-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphorylated dye molecules. Phosphorylated 4-hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (pHBR) is not able to bind to the FAST protein and induce fluorescence, but provides a sensitive assay for PTP activity, readily detecting 100&#8197;pM concentrations of PTP1B in the presence of FAST with a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19&#177;1&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value of 93&#177;3&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, while phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide of split GFP does not result in appreciable change in fluorescence of the reconstituted protein, phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide of the split FAST protein abrogates fluorescence. Upon PTP-mediated dephosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide, the ability of the N- and C-terminal components to form a fluorescent complex with the small molecule dye is restored, leading to fluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Support for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Peptidyl&#8208;tRNA Mimics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of 21 solid supports, only one is needed to synthesize hydrolysis&#8208;resistant 3&#8217;&#8208;peptidyl&#8208;tRNA mimics without sequence limitations. This is made possible by a novel photocleavable support that provides a free ribose 3&#8217;&#8208;amino group instead of the established supports that already contain the C&#8208;terminal amino acid, making synthetic access to this class of RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates more efficient than previous routes.







Abstract
Hydrolysis&#8208;resistant RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates that mimic peptidyl&#8208;tRNAs are often required for structural and functional studies of protein synthesis at the ribosome. These conjugates can be synthesized by solid&#8208;phase chemical synthesis, which allows maximum flexibility in both the peptide and RNA sequence. The commonly used strategy is based on (3&#8217;&#8208;N&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine solid supports, which already contain the first C&#8208;terminal amino acid of the target peptidyl chain. This is a limitation in the sense that different individual supports must be synthesized for different C&#8208;terminal amino acids. In this study, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by introducing a novel universal support. The key is a free ribose 3&#8217;&#8208;NH2 group that can be coupled to any amino acid. This is made possible by a photocleavable ether moiety that links the ribose 2&#8217;&#8208;O to the support, thus avoiding the typical O&#8208;to&#8208;N migration that occurs when using 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;acyl linked solid supports. Once assembled, the conjugate is readily cleaved by UV irradiation. The structural integrity of the obtained peptidyl&#8208;RNA conjugates was verified by mass spectrometry analysis. In conclusion, the new photocleavable solid support makes the synthesis of 3&#8217;&#8208;peptidyl tRNA mimics of different peptidyl chains significantly more efficient compared to the commonly used approaches.

         <title>Binding Mode of Cyclic Chemerin&#8208;9 Peptide and ChemerinS157 Protein at CMKLR1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigated the binding and activation of chemerin&#8208;9, a stabilized cyclic chemerin&#8208;9, and the ChemS157 protein to CMKLR1 variants due to previously observed differences in G protein activation. ChemS157 tolerates most mutations within the orthosteric binding site. Therefore, we used computational modeling to generate a binding model that support the existence of a second binding site.







Abstract
The chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is activated by the adipokine and chemoattractant protein chemerin. Cryo&#8208;EM structures of chemerin&#8208;9&#8208;CMKLR1&#8208;Gi have been published, where chemerin&#8208;9 is the nonapeptide of the C terminus of chemerinS157. Chemerin&#8208;9 is as active as the full&#8208;length protein in Ca2+&#8208;release but shows differences in equilibrium read&#8208;outs. An equally potent cyclic chemerin&#8208;9 variant (cC9) was reported previously. Now, we have built a computational model of CMKLR1 to investigate the binding mode of cC9 and chemerinS157 in comparison to chemerin&#8208;9. Differences were investigated using CMKLR1 variants. Double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis identified CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 as the relevant position for Phe8&#8208;binding of cC9. Energy contribution revealed slight differences in Phe8&#8208;binding to CMKLR1&#8208;F2.53 and space for larger residues. This was confirmed as the chemerin&#8208;9 variant with 1&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;L&#8208;alanine at position 8 showed a 4&#8208;fold increased potency of 2&#8197;nM (pEC50=8.6&#177;0.15). While chemerin&#8208;9 and cC9 share their interactions at the CMKLR1, chemerinS157 tolerates most mutations of CMKLR1 in the deep binding site. The computational model of chemerinS157 suggests a &#946;&#8208;sheet interaction between the N&#8208;terminal CMKLR1&#8208;segment I25VVL28 and the &#946;&#8208;sheet D108KVLGRLVH116 of ChemS157, which was confirmed experimentally. Our data add to the knowledge by identifying the binding mode of chemerinS157 and cC9 at CMKLR1, facilitating the future structure&#8208;based drug design.

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Peptide Inhibitors Targeting the Dimerization of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study designs and synthesizes a series of peptides targeting the dimerization of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. Several peptides display potential inhibitory activities. Specifically, N8&#8208;A24 shows most efficient suppression of the Mpro activity via inhibiting its dimerization.







Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) seriously impacted public health. The evolutionarily conserved viral chymotrypsin&#8208;like main protease (Mpro) is an important target for anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 drug development. Previous studies have shown that the eight N&#8208;terminal amino acids (N8) of SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro are essential for its dimerization, and are used to design inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV Mpro dimerization. Here, we established a simple readout assay using SDS&#8208;PAGE and Coomassie blue staining to measure inhibitory activity of N8 peptide derived from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. To optimize its inhibitory effect, we then modified the side&#8208;chain length, charge, and hydrophilicity of the N8 peptide, and introduced a mutated Mpro recognition sequence. As a result, we obtained a series of potent peptide inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro, with N8&#8208;A24 being the most efficient with an IC50 value of 1.44&#8197;mM. We observed that N8&#8208;A24 reduced Mpro dimerization with an IC50 value of 0.86&#8197;mM. Molecular docking revealed that N8&#8208;A24 formed hydrogen bond interactions with critical dimeric interface residues, thus inhibiting its dimerization and activity. In conclusion, our study not only discovers a series of peptide inhibitors targeting the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro dimerization, but also provides a promising strategy for the rational design of new inhibitors against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>A Novel Concept for Cleavable Linkers Applicable to Conjugation Chemistry &#8211; Design, Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiol selective reactivity of aryl sulfonamide and physiological thiol gradient between extra&#8208; and intracellular milieus set the foundation for developing novel non&#8208;disulfide based cleavable linkers, however the success of these linker designs was highly dependent on the electronic nature of the arylsulfonamide substituents.







Abstract
Linkers with disulfide bonds are the only cleavable linkers that utilize physiological thiol gradients as a trigger to initiate the intracellular drug release cascade. Herein, we present a novel concept exploiting the thiol gradient phenomena to design a new class of cleavable linker with no disulfide bond. To support the concept, an electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamide&#8208;based cleavable linker amenable to conjugation of drug molecules with targeting agents, was developed. Modulating the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl sulfonamide was critical to the balance between the stability and drug release. Favorable stability and payload release in human serum under physiologically relevant thiol concentrations was demonstrated with two potent cytotoxics. Intracellular payload release was further validated in cell&#8208;based assay in context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugate generated from monoclonal antibody and sulfonamide containing linker. To support the proposed release mechanism, possible downstream by&#8208;products formed from the drug&#8208;linker adduct were characterized.

&lt;p&gt;The thiol selective reactivity of aryl sulfonamide and physiological thiol gradient between extra- and intracellular milieus set the foundation for developing novel non-disulfide based cleavable linkers, however the success of these linker designs was highly dependent on the electronic nature of the arylsulfonamide substituents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkers with disulfide bonds are the only cleavable linkers that utilize physiological thiol gradients as a trigger to initiate the intracellular drug release cascade. Herein, we present a novel concept exploiting the thiol gradient phenomena to design a new class of cleavable linker with no disulfide bond. To support the concept, an electron-deficient sulfonamide-based cleavable linker amenable to conjugation of drug molecules with targeting agents, was developed. Modulating the electron-withdrawing nature of the aryl sulfonamide was critical to the balance between the stability and drug release. Favorable stability and payload release in human serum under physiologically relevant thiol concentrations was demonstrated with two potent cytotoxics. Intracellular payload release was further validated in cell-based assay in context of antibody-drug conjugate generated from monoclonal antibody and sulfonamide containing linker. To support the proposed release mechanism, possible downstream by-products formed from the drug-linker adduct were characterized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Compounds: Extended Ring Systems for Improved Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocenyl based molecules with extended ring systems are shown to have improved cytotoxicity towards breast cancers, following the trend anthracenyl&gt;naphthyl&gt;phenyl&gt;methyl. Whilst they don't induce significant morphological cell changes, varying degrees of reactive oxygen species are observed. The decomposition of the anthracenyl moiety to produce a cytotoxic fluorescent pro&#8208;drug has been visualized within breast cancer cells.







Abstract
A library of ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate compounds with varying degrees of aromatic functionality have been synthesized and fully characterized. This includes cyclic voltammetry and the analysis of four new structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The compounds cytotoxic potential has been determined by MTT screening against pancreatic carcinoma (MIA PaCa&#8208;2), ovarian adenocarcinoma (A2780), breast adenocarcinomas (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7) and normal epithelial retinal (ARPE&#8208;19). The compounds show a general trend, where increasing the number of aromatic rings in the molecule yields an increase in cytotoxicity and follows the trend anthracenyl&gt;naphthyl&gt;phenyl&gt;methyl. The compounds are particularly sensitive to the triple negative cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, and the potential modes of action have been studied by production of reactive oxygen species using fluorescence microscopy and cell morphology using Scanning Electron Microscopy. All assays highlight the ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate with an anthracenyl substituent to be the lead compound in this library. The decomposition of this compound was also observed within cells, yielding a cytotoxic fluorescent molecule, which has been visualized by confocal microscopy.

         <title>Aqueous Compatible Post&#8208;Synthetic On&#8208;Column Conjugation of Nucleic Acids Using Amino&#8208;Modifiers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous compatible conjugation methodology for nucleic acids that feature amino&#8208;modifiers, enabling the synthesis of phosphoramidate&#8208; or amide&#8208;containing oligonucleotide conjugates. Various ligand handles, including those containing azides and metal chelators, are suitable for the conjugation strategy. Our approach offers a streamlined, efficient and robust strategy for ligand conjugation to nucleic acid strands in mild aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Nucleic acid conjugation methodologies involve linking the nucleic acid sequence to other (bio)molecules covalently. This typically allows for nucleic acid property enhancement whether it be for therapeutic purposes, biosensing, etc. Here, we report a streamlined, aqueous compatible, on&#8208;column conjugation methodology using nucleic acids containing a site&#8208;specific amino&#8208;modifier. Both monophosphates and carboxylates were amenable to the conjugation strategy, allowing for the introduction of a variety of useful handles including azide, aryl, and hydrophobic groups in DNA. We find that an on&#8208;column approach is superior to post&#8208;synthetic template&#8208;directed synthesis, mainly with respect to product purification and recovery.

         <title>Manganese Complex&#8208;Gold Nanoparticle Hybrid for Biofilm Inhibition and Eradication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese complex modified gold nanoparticle for effective biofilm formation inhibition and eradication. Biofilms resistant to standard treatments pose challenges in medical and industrial settings. Manganese complex&#8208;gold nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;DPA&#8208;AuNPs) offer a new biofilm inhibition strategy. These nanoparticles enhance reactive oxygen species generation and significantly reduce bacterial regrowth, particularly in P. aeruginosa. This approach highlights the potential of integrating manganese complexes with gold nanoparticles as advanced antimicrobial agents.







Abstract
Biofilms, which are resistant to conventional antimicrobial treatments, pose significant challenges in medical and industrial environments. This study introduces manganese complex&#8208;gold nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;DPA&#8208;AuNPs) as a hybrid strategy for biofilm inhibition and eradication. Upon exposure to green light, these nanoparticles significantly enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. This activity substantially reduces the regrowth potential of the surviving bacteria within the biofilm, with marked efficacy noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. This study highlights the potential of integrating manganese complexes with gold nanoparticles to develop advanced antimicrobial agents against resistant biofilms, offering a promising approach to enhance microbial control in diverse settings.

         <title>Precursor&#8208;Directed Biosynthesis of Panepoxydone Derivatives with Nitric Oxide Production Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourteen new panepoxydone derivatives were obtained via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses, including HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR. Biological evaluation indicated panepoxydone and some of its derivatives displayed significant suppressive effects on LPS&#8208;induced NO production with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 to 30.1&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
Panepoxydone is a natural NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibitor isolated from basidiomycetes belonging to the genus Panus and Lentinus. It is biosynthesized from prenylhydroquinone through successive hydroxylation, epoxidation, and reduction reactions. In this study, we establish an efficient precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis strategy for the structural expansion of panepoxydone based on its biosynthetic pathway. Supplementation of the panepoxydone&#8208;producing strain, Panus rudis, with various prenylhydroquinone analogues enabled the production of fourteen previously undescribed panepoxydone derivatives, panepoxyquinoid A&#8722;N (2&#8211;14). The obtained panepoxydone derivatives together with their parental molecules were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on LPS&#8208;induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds 1, 5&#8211;6, 10&#8211;11, and 14&#8211;15 displayed significant suppressive effects on LPS&#8208;induced NO production with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 to 30.1&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Evaluation of Potency and Specificity of Cryptophycin&#8208;Loaded Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptophycin&#8208;uD[Dap(Me)], a derivative of the microtubule inhibitor cryptophycin, was equipped with an Mc&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PAB linker to enable conjugation of the toxin to either hinge&#8208;region cysteines or engineered cysteines in THIOMAB variants of trastuzumab. ADCs with DARs of 1.5, 3 and 6 were obtained. Especially the DAR 3 variant in THIOMAB format showed desirable biophysical properties and high potency in cellular assays.







Abstract
An enhanced variant of the antimitotic toxin cryptophycin was conjugated to the anti&#8208;Her2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) Trastuzumab upon Michael addition. Either antibodies with freed hinge&#8208;region cysteines or THIOMAB formats with engineered cysteines in the mAbs light chain were added to a maleimide derivative of cryptophycin. These Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs) showed retained binding to Her2 positive tumor cells and highly efficient cell killing in double&#8208;digit pM range on high Her2&#8208;expressing SK&#8208;BR&#8208;3 cells. Two ADCs (DAR 6, DAR 3) showed superior cell killing of the cell lines JIMT&#8208;1 and RT112 with medium receptor expression level in comparison with a DAR 6 MMAE ADC serving as reference. The observed cell cytotoxicity is target&#8208;dependent since no impact on cell viability was observed for low Her2&#8208;expressing MDA&#8208;MB468 cells. Particularly the DAR 3 ADC in THIOMAB format exhibiting desirable biophysical properties and high potency emerged as a promising candidate for further in&#8197;vivo investigations.

         <title>Visual and Quantitative Analysis of Dietary Fiber&#8208;Microbiota Interactions via Metabolic Labeling In Vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dietary fiber (DF)&#8208;based interventions are crucial in establishing a health&#8208;promoting gut microbiota. However, directly investigating DFs&#8217; in vivo interactions with intestinal bacteria remains challenging due to the lack of suitable tools. Here, we develop an in vivo metabolic labeling&#8208;based strategy, which enables not only imaging and identifying the bacteria that bind with specific DF in the intestines, but also quantifying DF&#8217;s impact on their metabolic status. Four DFs, including galactan, rhamnogalacturonan and two inulins, are fluorescently derivatized and used for in vivo labeling to visually record DFs&#8217; interactions with gut bacteria. The subsequent cell&#8208;sorting, 16S rDNA sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization identify the taxa that bind each DF. We then select a DF&#8208;binding species newly identified herein and verify its DF&#8208;catabolizing capability in vitro. Furthermore, we find that the indigenous metabolic status of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whether inulin&#8208;binders or not, is significantly enhanced by the inulin supplement. This trend isn&#8217;t observed in Gram&#8208;negative microbiota, even for the inulin&#8208;binders, demonstrating the ability of our methods in differentiating the primary, secondary DF&#8208;degraders from cross&#8208;feeders, a question that is difficult to answer by using other methods. Our strategy provides a novel chemical biology tool for deciphering the complex DF&#8208;bacteria interactions in the gut.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Phenyldiazene Derivatives Using the Biosynthetic Pathway of an Aromatic Diazo Group&#8208;Containing Natural Product from an Actinomycete</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Diazoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;DAA) is potentially produced by several actinomycete species. Here, we constructed a production system for phenyldiazene derivatives by adding several active methylene compounds to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing recombinant actinomycete. Also, we established a one&#8208;pot in&#8197;vitro enzymatic production system for the same phenyldiazene derivatives using a diazotase, CmaA6.







Abstract
The diazo group is an important functional group in organic synthesis because it confers high reactivity to the compounds and has been applied in various chemical reactions, such as the Sandmeyer reaction, Wolff rearrangement, cyclopropanation, and C&#8722;N bond formation with active methylene compounds. Previously, we revealed that 3&#8208;diazoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;DAA), which is potentially produced by several actinomycete species and contains an aromatic diazo group, is a biosynthetic intermediate of avenalumic acid. In this study, we aimed to construct a production system for phenyldiazene derivatives by adding several active methylene compounds to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing recombinant actinomycete. First, acetoacetanilide and its derivatives, which have an active methylene and are raw materials for arylide yellow dyes, were individually added to the culture of a 3&#8208;DAA&#8208;producing actinomycete. When their metabolites were analyzed, each expected compound with a phenyldiazenyl moiety was detected in the culture extract. Moreover, we established a one&#8208;pot in&#8197;vitro enzymatic production system for the same phenyldiazene derivatives using a highly reactive diazotase, CmaA6. These results showed that the diazo group of natural products is an attractive tool for expanding the structural diversity of natural products both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a Versatile Immunoproteasome Activity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ONX&#8208;0914&#8208;alkyne probe described here allows for the conjugation to a variety of fluorophores through click chemistry. It can then be used to visualize immunoproteasome activity in gel&#8208;based, microscopy, and flow cytometry experiments.







Abstract
The immunoproteasome (iCP) has gained significant interest in recent years as it has been discovered to be significantly expressed under inflammatory conditions, as well as playing significant roles in several diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, viral infection, and cancer. Selective inhibitors have been generated as a method to overcome the off&#8208;target effects of current proteasome inhibitor therapeutics. However, selective probes that allow for monitoring this protein complex remain limited, hindering our understanding of the iCP. Current probes are non&#8208;selective, not commercially available, or require difficult synthesis. Here, we describe the modular synthesis and application of an iCP&#8208;selective probe. The modular nature of the synthetic strategy can enable the incorporation of different fluorophores and covalent warheads, demonstrating the versatility of this probe.

         <title>Enhanced Molecular Imaging through a Versatile Peptide Nanofiber for Self&#8208;assembly and Precise Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing molecules for multivalent targeting of specific disease markers can enhance binding stability which is critical in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. Through rational molecular design, the nanostructures formed by self&#8208;assembly of targeting peptides are expected to achieve multivalent targeting by increasing the density of recognition ligands. However, the balance between targeting peptide self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition remains elusive. In this study, we designed a targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;based imaging probe system TAP which consist of the signal unit, the recognition motif, the assembly motif and a Pro&#8208;leverage. It is verified that TAP could specifically binds to PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive tumor cells in a multivalent manner to produce biological effects, and could also be combined with imaging probes through unique self&#8208;assembly strategies. By the balance between the peptide self&#8208;assembly and targeting recognition, the specificity and stability can be improved while the accumulation capacity of the probes at the tumor site can be greatly enhanced compared with the conventional strategy, thus reducing side effects, providing an effective tool for diagnostic and therapeutic integration of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncanonical Functions of Ketosynthase Domains in Type I Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ketosynthase (KS) domain plays a central role in the biosynthesis of polyketide natural products. This work reviews the diverse functions of type I PKS KS domains in natural product biosynthesis, including canonical Claisen condensation and noncanonical reactions, such as decarboxylation, acyl transfer, Dickmann condensation, Micheal addition, C&#8722;N bond formation, aldol&#8208;lactonization bicyclization and decarbonylation.







Abstract
Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are remarkable molecular machines that can synthesize structurally complex polyketide natural products with a wide range of biological activities.

&lt;p&gt;The ketosynthase (KS) domain plays a central role in the biosynthesis of polyketide natural products. This work reviews the diverse functions of type I PKS KS domains in natural product biosynthesis, including canonical Claisen condensation and noncanonical reactions, such as decarboxylation, acyl transfer, Dickmann condensation, Micheal addition, C&#8722;N bond formation, aldol-lactonization bicyclization and decarbonylation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are remarkable molecular machines that can synthesize structurally complex polyketide natural products with a wide range of biological activities.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Multiplexed Assessment of Aromatic Prenyltransferase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate promiscuity of a panel of diverse aromatic prenyltransferases is assessed through a rapid substrate&#8208;multiplexed screen. PriB is identified as a remarkably promiscuous enzyme relative to other well&#8208;studied prenyltransferases. We further identify a new thermostable prenyltransferase with high activity that is suitable for future biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
An increasingly effective strategy to identify synthetically useful enzymes is to sample the diversity already present in Nature. Here, we construct and assay a panel of phylogenetically diverse aromatic prenyltransferases (PTs). These enzymes catalyze a variety of C&#8722;C bond forming reactions in natural product biosynthesis and are emerging as tools for synthetic chemistry and biology. Homolog screening was further empowered through substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening, which provides direct information on enzyme specificity. We perform a head&#8208;to&#8208;head assessment of the model members of the PT family and further identify homologs with divergent sequences that rival these superb enzymes. This effort revealed the first bacterial O&#8722;Tyr PT and, together, provide valuable benchmarking for future synthetic applications of PTs.

         <title>Mono&#8208;Palmitoyl&#8208;N&#8208;Alkylurea Ligands as Specific Activators of Human Toll&#8208;Like Receptor 2/6 Heterodimer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The derivatives of the synthetic hTLR2 agonist mini&#8208;UPam were synthesized and biologically evaluated to explore its TLR heterodimer specificity. Mini&#8208;Upam is similar to the well&#8208;known immunostimulatory lipopeptide Pam2CysSK4, which is a potential adjuvant for synthetic vaccines. Our research shows that mini&#8208;UPam and its more lipophilic alkylurea derivatives require the heterodimer hTLR2/hTLR6, rather than hTLR2/hTLR1, to exert their immunostimulatory activity.







Abstract
Ligands for Toll&#8208;like&#8208;receptor 2 (TLR2) have demonstrated significant potential as immune&#8208;stimulating components in synthetic vaccines. Activation of TLR2 relies on the formation of dimeric complexes with either TLR1 or TLR6 and the nature of these dimers can impact therapeutic outcomes. The lipopeptide&#8208;based TLR2 ligands Pam3CysSK4 and Pam2CysSK4 have been extensively studied, and their recognition by different TLR&#8208;receptor heterodimers, TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6, respectively, has been established. However, the high lipophilicity of these ligands, containing multiple palmitoyl residues, can result in solubility issues when used as vaccine adjuvants. To address this, we previously synthesized a less lipophilic ligand containing a single palmitoyl chain called mini&#8208;UPam, which effectively stimulates human moDC maturation. We here probe the receptor&#8208;dimer specificity of several mini&#8208;Upam derivatives and reveal that these mini&#8208;UPam are hTLR2/TLR6 selective ligands and that the introduction of longer urea alkyl chains does not shift the binding specificity to hTLR2/TLR1 heterodimers, in contrast to their Pam2CysSK4 and Pam3CysSK4 counterparts, pointing to a different binding mode of the UPam ligands.

         <title>Sequence Context in DNA i&#8208;Motifs Can Nurture Very Stable and Persistent Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA i&#8208;motifs adjacent to duplex form kinetically trapped partially folded species. The species are well resolved on thermal melting curves. In this work, we study dynamics of partial folds and ways to control fully folded population.







Abstract
I&#8208;motifs are non&#8208;canonical DNA structures with recognized biological significance and a proven utility in material engineering. Consequently, understanding and control of i&#8208;motif properties is essential to sustain progress across both disciplines. In this work, we systematically investigate how proximity to the most common form of DNA, a double&#8208;stranded duplex, influences the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of adjacent i&#8208;motifs. We demonstrate that double&#8208;stranded stems in i&#8208;motif loops promote kinetic trapping of very stable and persistent partially folded conformations. Further, we investigate pathways toward rational control over a folding topology makeup.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Protein Degradation by Smart PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart PROTACs can be activated at the site of diseased tissue in response to specific stimuli, such as GSH, ROS, hypoxia, light, and X&#8208;ray radiation. This enables controllable PROTAC function for precision therapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic modality in drug discovery. PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that effectively bridge proteins of interest (POIs) with E3 ubiquitin ligases, such that, the target proteins are tagged with ubiquitin and subsequently degraded via the proteasome. Despite significant progress in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), the application of conventional PROTAC degraders still faces significant challenges, including systemic toxicity induced by non&#8208;tissue&#8208;specific targeting. To address this issue, a variety of smart PROTACs that can be activated by specific stimuli, have been developed for achieving conditional and spatiotemporal modulation of protein levels. Here, on the basis of our contributions, we overview recent advances of smart PROTACs, including tumor microenvironment&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and X&#8208;ray radiation&#8208;responsive PROTACs, that enable controllable TPD. The design strategy, case studies, potential applications and challenges will be focused on.

         <title>In vivo and in vitro Reconstitution of Biosynthesis of N&#8208;Prenylated Phenazines Revealing Diverse Phenazine&#8208;Modifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for natural phenazines. The class II terpene cyclase Pzm1 catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form monocyclic FPP. The prenyltransferases PzmP and LavP function as the N&#8208;prenyltransferases of the phenazine&#8208;backbone, followed by the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the flavin monooxygenases PzmS and LavS to yield phenazinomycin and lavanducyanin, respectively.







Abstract
Phenazine natural products play various roles such as signal molecules, antibiotics, or electron carriers in their producer strains. Among these products, phenazinomycin and lavanducyanin, which are produced by Streptomyces species, are characterized by an N&#8208;alkyl modification. Herein, we established the biosynthetic pathways for these two phenazine natural products. Gene&#8208;disruption experiments and in&#8197;vitro reconstitution of the phenazine&#8208;tailoring pathway revealed the late steps of the biosynthetic pathway of the phenazines. The class II terpene cyclase homolog Pzm1 catalyzes the cyclization reaction of farnesyl diphosphate to form monocyclic farnesyl diphosphate. Additionally, the prenyltransferase homolog PzmP functions as the N&#8208;prenyltransferase of 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid. The flavin monooxygenase homolog PzmS catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of prenylated 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid to yield phenazinomycin. This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for phenazine natural products.

Additionally, the prenyltransferase homolog PzmP functions as the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-prenyltransferase of 5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid. The flavin monooxygenase homolog PzmS catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of prenylated 5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid to yield phenazinomycin. This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for phenazine natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine learning guided rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;based lysine dioxygenase improves its total turnover number</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective C&#8208;H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure&#8208;based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure&#8208;based machine&#8208;learning algorithm with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before&#8208;hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2&#8208;fold higher yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN = 160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low&#8208;barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre&#8208;existing protein engineering strategies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Highly selective C-H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure-based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure-based machine-learning algorithm with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non-heme iron-dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before-hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2-fold higher yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN = 160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low-barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre-existing protein engineering strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
