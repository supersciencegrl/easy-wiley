         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Transfer of Charge, Atoms and Energy within Isolated Biomolecular Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In biological tissues, ionizing radiation interacts with a variety of molecules and the consequences include cell killing and the modification of mechanical properties. Applications of biological radiation action are for instance radiotherapy, sterilization or the tailoring of biomaterial properties. During the first femtoseconds to milliseconds after the initial radiation action, biomolecular systems typically respond by transfer of charge, atoms or energy. In the condensed phase, it is usually very difficult to distinguish direct effects from indirect effects. A straightforward solution for this problem is the use of gas&#8208;phase techniques, for instance from the field of mass spectrometry. In this review, we survey mainly experimental but also theoretical work, focusing on radiation&#8208;induced intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular transfer of charge, atoms and energy within biomolecular systems in the gas phase. Building blocks of DNA, proteins and saccharides, but also antibiotics are considered. The emergence of general processes as well as their timescales and mechanisms are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Ligands into Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances of a novel and efficient ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction platform functioned through a kinetic control upon the ligand binding are summarized and discussed in this Concept. This new strategy may provide great flexibility to integrate all kind of ligands into the sophisticated nucleic acid nanomachines for biosensors, nucleic acid computation and gene regulations.







Abstract
Signal transduction from non&#8208;nucleic acid ligands (small molecules and proteins) to structural changes of nucleic acids plays a crucial role in both biomedical analysis and cellular regulations. However, how to bridge between these two types of molecules without compromising the expandable complexity and programmability of the nucleic acid nanomachines is a critical challenge. Compared with the previously most widely applied transduction strategies, we review the latest advances of a kinetically controlled approach for ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction in this Concept article. This new design works through an intrinsic conformational alteration of the nucleic acid aptamer upon the ligand binding as a governing factor for nucleic acid strand displacement reactions. The functionalities and applications of this transduction system as a ligand converter on biosensing and DNA computation are described and discussed. Furthermore, we propose some potential scenarios for utilization of this ligand transduction design to regulate gene expression through synthetic RNA switches in the cellular contexts. Finally, future perspectives regarding this ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction platform are also discussed.

         <title>Development of On&#8208;DNA Cyclic Imide Synthesis for DNA Encoded Library Construction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;DNA synthesis of cyclic imides was developed. The transformation was achieved under mild conditions with high conversions and a broad functional group tolerance, suitable for DEL synthesis. The mechanism study of off&#8208;DNA and on&#8208;DNA chemical transformations revealed unique insights.







Abstract
Here, we describe a novel method for the on&#8208;DNA synthesis of cyclic imides, an important class of molecules that includes several well&#8208;known medications. Significantly, the new method enabled on&#8208;DNA synthesis under mild conditions with high conversions and a broad functional group tolerance, utilizing ubiquitous bifunctional amines and bis&#8208;carboxylic acid, or alkyl halides, and therefore served as the linchpin for DNA encoded library (DEL) synthesis. The mechanism study of off&#8208;DNA and on&#8208;DNA chemical transformations revealed unique insights in contrast to conventional chemical transformation.

         <title>Characterization of an Unusual &#945;&#8208;Oxoamine Synthase Off&#8208;Loading Domain from a Cyanobacterial Type I Fatty Acid Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) usually releases its products by hydrolysis or transesterification. Here, an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase off&#8208;loading domain is identified in a cyanobacterial type I FAS. This domain releases the fatty acyl chain by condensing it with L&#8208;serine, thereby representing a novel route to &#945;&#8208;amino ketones.







Abstract
Type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) are known from higher eukaryotes and fungi. We report the discovery of FasT, a rare type I FAS from the cyanobacterium Chlorogloea sp. CCALA695. FasT possesses an unusual off&#8208;loading domain, which was heterologously expressed in E. coli and found to act as an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase (AOS) in&#8197;vitro. Similar to serine palmitoyltransferases from sphingolipid biosynthesis, the AOS off&#8208;loading domain catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen condensation between l&#8208;serine and a fatty acyl thioester. While the AOS domain was strictly specific for l&#8208;serine, thioesters with saturated fatty acyl chains of six carbon atoms and longer were tolerated, with the highest activity observed for stearoyl&#8722;coenzyme A (C18). Our findings suggest a novel route to &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the direct condensation of iteratively produced long&#8208;chain fatty acids with l&#8208;serine by a FAS with a cis&#8208;acting AOS off&#8208;loading domain.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of New Urushiol Derivatives as Potent Class I Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of 11 urushiol&#8208;based hydroxamic acid histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 showed potent HDAC1/2/3/8 inhibitory activity. Western blot analysis validated the privileged structure of these compounds was appropriate for targeting class I HDACs. Further antiproliferation assays revealed that synthesized compounds exerted greater in&#8197;vitro antiproliferative activity than SAHA against four human cancer cell lines.







Abstract
In the present study, a novel series of 11 urushiol&#8208;based hydroxamic acid histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Compounds 1&#8211;11 exhibited good to excellent inhibitory activities against HDAC1/2/3 (IC50: 42.09&#8211;240.17&#8197;nM) and HDAC8 (IC50: 16.11&#8211;41.15&#8197;nM) in&#8197;vitro, with negligible activity against HDAC6 (&gt;1409.59&#8197;nM). Considering HDAC8, docking experiments revealed some important features contributing to inhibitory activity. According to Western blot analysis, select compounds could notably enhance the acetylation of histone H3 and SMC3 but not&#8208;tubulin, indicating their privileged structure is appropriate for targeting class I HDACs. Furthermore, antiproliferation assays revealed that six compounds exerted greater in&#8197;vitro antiproliferative activity against four human cancer cell lines (A2780, HT&#8208;29, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, and HepG2, with IC50 values ranging from 2.31&#8211;5.13&#8197;&#956;M) than suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; administration of these compounds induced marked apoptosis in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Collectively, specific synthesized compounds could be further optimized and biologically explored as antitumor agents.

According to Western blot analysis, select compounds could notably enhance the acetylation of histone H3 and SMC3 but not-tubulin, indicating their privileged structure is appropriate for targeting class I HDACs. Furthermore, antiproliferation assays revealed that six compounds exerted greater in&#8197;vitro antiproliferative activity against four human cancer cell lines (A2780, HT-29, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 2.31&#8211;5.13&#8197;&#956;M) than suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; administration of these compounds induced marked apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Collectively, specific synthesized compounds could be further optimized and biologically explored as antitumor agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Application of a Synthetic Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired [4Fe4S]&#8208;Peptide Maquette as the Redox Partner for an [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
[4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquettes have been explored as effective models of FeS proteins, but they also hold untapped potential as tools for synthetic biology. Here we demonstrate the application of these maquettes beyond the modelling of electron transfer in biology by substituting the physiological redox partner of a Clostridium acetobutylicum [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase with a synthetic ferredoxin mimic to direct this enzyme&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;oxidation process.







Abstract
&#8216;Bacterial&#8208;type&#8217; ferredoxins host a cubane [4Fe4S]2+/+ cluster that enables these proteins to mediate electron transfer and facilitate a broad range of biological processes. Peptide maquettes based on the conserved cluster&#8208;forming motif have previously been reported and used to model the ferredoxins. Herein we explore the integration of a [4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquette into a H2&#8208;powered electron transport chain. While routinely formed under anaerobic conditions, we illustrate by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis that these maquettes can be reconstituted under aerobic conditions by using photoactivated NADH to reduce the cluster at 240&#8197;K. Attempts to tune the redox properties of the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster by introducing an Fe&#8208;coordinating selenocysteine residue were also explored. To demonstrate the integration of these artificial metalloproteins into a semi&#8208;synthetic electron transport chain, we utilize a ferredoxin&#8208;inspired [4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquette as the redox partner in the hydrogenase&#8208;mediated oxidation of H2.

         <title>Peptide Amphiphilic Supramolecular Nanogels: Competent Host for Notably Efficient Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Water&#8208;Insoluble Substrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembled nanogels in water have been developed from peptide amphiphile hydrogelators. The micro&#8208;heterogenous surface of the nanogels was judiciously utilized to catalyze the hydrolysis of water&#8208;insoluble substrates like p&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;n&#8208;alkanoates with remarkable efficiency by CV lipase immobilized at the interface of the gel nanoparticles. The rate enhancement of CV lipase in the presence of nanogels was significantly high in comparison to aqueous buffer and other self&#8208;aggregating systems.







Abstract
The present work depicts the development of stable nanogels in an aqueous medium that were exploited for efficient surface&#8208;active lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of water&#8208;insoluble substrates. Surfactant&#8208;coated gel nanoparticles (neutral NG1, anionic NG2, and cationic NG3) were prepared from peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator (G1, G2, and G3, respectively) at different hydrophilic and lipophilic balance (HLB). Chromobacterium viscosum (CV) lipase activity towards hydrolysis of water&#8208;insoluble substrates (p&#8208;nitrophyenyl&#8208;n&#8208;alkanoates (C4&#8211;C10)) in the presence of nanogels got remarkably improved by ~1.7&#8211;8.0 fold in comparison to that in aqueous buffer and other self&#8208;aggregates. An increase in hydrophobicity of the substrate led to a notable improvement in lipase activity in the hydrophilic domain (HLB&gt;8.0) of nanogels. The micro&#8208;heterogeneous interface of small&#8208;sized (10&#8211;65&#8197;nm) nanogel was found to be an appropriate scaffold for immobilizing surface&#8208;active lipase to exhibit superior catalytic efficiency. Concurrently, the flexible conformation of lipase immobilized in nanogels was reflected in its secondary structure having the highest &#945;&#8208;helix content from the circular dichroism spectra.

         <title>Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (NDGA) Inhibits CsgA Polymerization, Bacterial Amyloid Biogenesis, and Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural product nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) found in the creosote bush is a curlicide. NDGA inhibits in&#8197;vitro polymerization of the bacterial amyloid protein CsgA and inhibits cellular amyloid biogenesis in E. coli. NDGA's curlicide activity is effective in inhibiting biofilm formation by pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium.







Abstract
Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae thrive in robust biofilm communities through the coproduction of curli amyloid fibers and phosphoethanolamine cellulose. Curli promote adhesion to abiotic surfaces and plant and human host tissues and are associated with pathogenesis in urinary tract infection and food&#8208;borne illness. The production of curli in the host has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. We report that the natural product nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is effective as a curlicide in E. coli. NDGA prevents CsgA polymerization in&#8197;vitro in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. NDGA selectively inhibits cell&#8208;associated curli assembly and inhibits uropathogenic E. coli biofilm formation. More broadly, this work emphasizes the ability to evaluate and identify bioactive amyloid assembly inhibitors by using the powerful gene&#8208;directed amyloid biogenesis machinery in E. coli.

         <title>Stable Binding of Full&#8208;Length Chemerin Is Driven by Negative Charges in the CMKLR1 N Terminus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemerin system is a key player in inflammatory diseases. The N terminus of the receptor CMKLR1 is crucial for high affinity ligand binding. A two&#8208;step binding mode is suggested. First, the C terminus binds deep in the transmembrane domain of the G protein&#8208;coupled receptor CMKLR1. In a second step, ionic interactions stabilize the binding of the protein chemerin.







Abstract
The adipokine chemerin is the endogenous ligand of the chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), a member of the family of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). This protein ligand plays an important role in obesity and inflammatory processes. Stable receptor&#8211;ligand interactions are highly relevant for its different physiological effects such as the migration of immune cells towards sites of inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that negative charges in the CMKLR1 N terminus are involved in the formation of strong contacts with a specific positively charged patch at the surface of full&#8208;length chemerin, which is absent in the short nonapeptide agonist chemerin&#8208;9, thus explaining its reduced affinity. Using receptor chimera of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and CMKLR1, we were able to identify the residues of this interaction and its relevance for stable full&#8208;length chemerin binding. This could help to develop more potent ligands for the treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Substance P&#8208;Derived Extracellular&#8208;Matrix&#8208;Mimicking Peptide Hydrogel as a Cytocompatible Biomaterial Platform</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the highly conserved C terminus of substance P neuropeptide, we designed and synthesized a novel peptide sequence Fmoc&#8722;FFGLMRGD comprising the C&#8208;terminal fragment &#8220;FFGLM&#8221; from substance P with an integrin&#8208;interacting RGD motif. This designed octapeptide undergoes quick self&#8208;assembly at biological pH to give an ECM mimicking soft hydrogel matrix with superior biocompatibility.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled short peptide&#8208;based hydrogel platforms have become widely applicable biomedical therapeutic maneuvers for their soft, tunable architecture, which can influence cellular behavior and morphology to an inordinate extent. In this work, a short supramolecular hydrogelator peptide, substance P, has been designed and synthesized from the C terminus conserved &#8220;FFGLM&#8221; section of a biologically abundant neuropeptide by using a fusion approach. In addition, to incorporate a good hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic balance, the truncated pentapeptide segment was further C&#8208;terminally modified by the incorporation of an integrin&#8208;binding &#8220;RGD&#8221; motif. Thanks to its N&#8208;terminal Fmoc group, this octapeptide ensemble &#8220;FFGLMRGD&#8221; undergoes rapid self&#8208;assembly to give rise to an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive, hydrogel&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting platform that exhibited good cytocompatibility with the cultured mammalian cells under both 2D and 3D culture conditions without exerting any potent cytotoxic effect in a Live/Dead experiment. A rheological experiment demonstrated its hydrogel&#8208;like mechanical properties, including thixotropicity. The atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy images of the fabricated hydrogel show a tangled fibrous surface topography owing to the presence of the N&#8208;terminal Fmoc&#8722;FF residue. Furthermore, an in&#8208;vitro scratch assay performed on fibroblast cell lines confirmed the wound&#8208;ameliorating potency of this designed hydrogel; this substantiates its future therapeutic prospects.

         <title>Serum&#8208;Based Detection of Liver Pathology Using a Fluorogenic Alkaline Phosphatase Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an ALP&#8208;activatable NIR fluorescent probe DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP with optimal pKa for the accurate detection of human serum ALP, especially in distinguishing ALP patients from healthy volunteers, as well as assessing the progress of liver disease, thus providing a potential toolbox for the accurate detection of ALP and warning the stage of hepatopathy.







Abstract
Development of &#8220;ultrahigh contrast&#8221; fluorogenic probes for trapping alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in human serum is highly desirable for clinical auxiliary diagnosis for hepatobiliary diseases. However, the intrinsic dilemma of incomplete ionization of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)&#8208;based ALP fluorophores and autofluorescence interference of serum result in low sensitivity and accuracy. Given that unique halogen effects could lead to a drastic decrease in the pKa value and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield, herein we report an enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared probe based on a difluoro&#8208;substituted dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenep for achieving fluorescent quantification of human serum ALP. Rational design strategy is demonstrated by altering the substituted halogen groups to well regulate the pKa for meeting the physiological precondition. Owing to the complete ionization at pH&#8197;7.4 with tremendous fluorescence enhancement, the difluoro&#8208;substituted DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP manifests a linear relationship between the emission intensity and ALP concentration in both solution and serum samples. Along with measuring 77 human serum samples, the DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP based fluorescence method not only exhibits significant correlations with clinical colorimetry, but also distinguishes ALP patients from healthy volunteers, as well as assessing the progress of liver disease, thus providing a potential toolbox for quantitatively detecting ALP and warning the stage of hepatopathy.

         <title>A Fluorescence&#8208;Based Assay for N5&#8208;Carboxyaminoimidazole Ribonucleotide Mutase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, fluorescence&#8208;based assay has been developed that relies on the reaction between the novel istain&#8208;fluorecein conjugate and the enzymatically generated compound, AIR. These compounds react non&#8208;enzymatically resulting in a highly fluorescent product. This unique reaction provides a new assay for monitoring the activity of the enzyme N5&#8208;CAIR mutase.







Abstract
The enzyme N5&#8208;carboxylaminoinidazole ribonucleotide (N5&#8208;CAIR) mutase is found in microbial de novo purine biosynthesis but is absent in humans making it an attractive antimicrobial target. N5&#8208;CAIR mutase catalyzes the synthesis of carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR) from N5&#8208;CAIR which is itself prepared from aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) by the enzyme N5&#8208;CAIR synthetase. During our research on identifying inhibitors of N5&#8208;CAIR mutase, we developed an innovative, fluorescence&#8208;based assay to measure the activity of this enzyme. This assay relies upon our recent serendipitous observation that AIR reversibly reacts with the compound isatin. Reaction of a fluorescently&#8208;tagged isatin with AIR resulted in a large increase in fluorescence intensity allowing a measurement of the concentration of AIR in solution. From this observation, we developed a reproducible, non&#8208;continuous assay that can replicate the known kinetic parameters of the enzyme and can readily detect a recognized inhibitor of the enzyme. This assay should find utility in screening for inhibitors targeting N5&#8208;CAIR mutase.

         <title>Trifunctional Dibromomaleimide Reagents Built Around A Lysine Scaffold Deliver Site&#8208;selective Dual&#8208;modality Antibody Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a rapid reduction&#8208;bridging&#8208;double click sequence to yield dual&#8208;modality antibody conjugates using aryl selenols as novel disulfide reducing reagents and trifunctional dibromomaleimides (DBMs) as bridging reagents. This work will provide more possibilities for the development of multi&#8208;functionalised antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and application of a selection of trifunctional reagents for the dual&#8208;modality modification of native, solvent accessible disulfide bonds in trastuzumab. The reagents were developed from the dibromomaleimide (DBM) platform with two orthogonal clickable functional groups built around a lysine core. We also describe the development of an aryl diselenide additive which enables antibody disulfide reduction in 4 minutes and a rapid overall reduction&#8208;bridging&#8208;double click sequence.

         <title>Selective and Sustainable Production of Sub&#8208;terminal Hydroxy Fatty Acids by a Self&#8208;Sufficient CYP102 Enzyme from Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BAMF0695, a self&#8208;sufficient CYP102 enzyme, hydroxylates sub&#8208;terminal positions of fatty acids with broad temperature optimum and high thermostability. Mutants of BAMF0695 exhibit very high regioselectivity, generating a single hydroxy fatty acid regioisomer (&#969;&#8208;1 or &#969;&#8208;2) with up to 91&#8201;% selectivity. BAMF0695 can also utilize renewable microalgae fatty acids as a substrate feedstock.







Abstract
Enzymatic hydroxylation of fatty acids by Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) offers an eco&#8208;friendly route to hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), high&#8208;value oleochemicals with various applications in materials industry and with potential as bioactive compounds. However, instability and poor regioselectivity of CYPs are their main drawbacks. A newly discovered self&#8208;sufficient CYP102 enzyme, BAMF0695 from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 7, exhibits preference for hydroxylation of sub&#8208;terminal positions (&#969;&#8208;1, &#969;&#8208;2, and &#969;&#8208;3) of fatty acids. Our studies show that BAMF0695 has a broad temperature optimum (over 70&#8201;% of maximal enzymatic activity retained between 20 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) and is highly thermostable (T50 &gt;50&#8201;&#176;C), affording excellent adaptive compatibility for bioprocesses. We further demonstrate that BAMF0695 can utilize renewable microalgae lipid as a substrate feedstock for HFA production. Moreover, through extensive site&#8208;directed and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis, we isolated variants with high regioselectivity, a rare property for CYPs that usually generate complex regioisomer mixtures. BAMF0695 mutants were able to generate a single HFA regiosiomer (&#969;&#8208;1 or &#969;&#8208;2) with selectivities from 75&#8201;% up to 91&#8201;%, using C12 to C18 fatty acids.

     alt="Selective and Sustainable Production of Sub-terminal Hydroxy Fatty Acids by a Self-Sufficient CYP102 Enzyme from Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAMF0695, a self-sufficient CYP102 enzyme, hydroxylates sub-terminal positions of fatty acids with broad temperature optimum and high thermostability. Mutants of BAMF0695 exhibit very high regioselectivity, generating a single hydroxy fatty acid regioisomer (&#969;-1 or &#969;-2) with up to 91&#8201;% selectivity. BAMF0695 can also utilize renewable microalgae fatty acids as a substrate feedstock.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic hydroxylation of fatty acids by Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) offers an eco-friendly route to hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), high-value oleochemicals with various applications in materials industry and with potential as bioactive compounds. However, instability and poor regioselectivity of CYPs are their main drawbacks. A newly discovered self-sufficient CYP102 enzyme, BAMF0695 from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus amyloliquefaciens&lt;/i&gt; DSM 7, exhibits preference for hydroxylation of sub-terminal positions (&#969;-1, &#969;-2, and &#969;-3) of fatty acids. Our studies show that BAMF0695 has a broad temperature optimum (over 70&#8201;% of maximal enzymatic activity retained between 20 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) and is highly thermostable (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;50&#8201;&#176;C), affording excellent adaptive compatibility for bioprocesses. We further demonstrate that BAMF0695 can utilize renewable microalgae lipid as a substrate feedstock for HFA production. Moreover, through extensive site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis, we isolated variants with high regioselectivity, a rare property for CYPs that usually generate complex regioisomer mixtures. BAMF0695 mutants were able to generate a single HFA regiosiomer (&#969;-1 or &#969;-2) with selectivities from 75&#8201;% up to 91&#8201;%, using C12 to C18 fatty acids. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of a recent CYP and its variants for sustainable and green production of high-value HFAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lipase&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Protecting Group Silyl Ethers: An Unspecific Side Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silyl ethers are important protecting groups in organic synthesis and a selective cleavage or formation is highly desirable. The ability of lipases to catalyze the reactions has long been suspected. This study gives experimental and structural evidence that both cleavage and formation of trimethyl ethers are promoted by lipases, but not at the active site.







Abstract
Silyl ether protecting groups are important tools in organic synthesis, ensuring selective reactions of hydroxyl functional groups. Enantiospecific formation or cleavage could simultaneously enable the resolution of racemic mixtures and thus significantly increase the efficiency of complex synthetic pathways. Based on reports that lipases, which today are already particularly important tools in chemical synthesis, can catalyze the enantiospecific turnover of trimethylsilanol (TMS)&#8208;protected alcohols, the goal of this study was to determine the conditions under which such a catalysis occurs. Through detailed experimental and mechanistic investigation, we demonstrated that although lipases mediate the turnover of TMS&#8208;protected alcohols, this occurs independently of the known catalytic triad, as this is unable to stabilize a tetrahedral intermediate. The reaction is essentially non&#8208;specific and therefore most likely completely independent of the active site. This rules out lipases as catalysts for the resolution of racemic mixtures of alcohols through protection or deprotection with silyl groups.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Homodimeric Protein Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bivalent ligands can engage homodimeric protein targets with high affinity due to avidity effects. This study shows that compounds conjugated to a masked formyl acetamide can be coupled efficiently and conveniently through trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)&#8208;catalyzed pyridone formation. In most cases, the product is produced in nearly quantitative yield and in excellent purity. The reaction is tolerant of a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
Many proteins exist as oligomers (homodimers, homotrimers, etc.). A proven strategy for the development of high affinity ligands for such targets is to link together two modest affinity ligands that allows the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 (or higher&#8208;order) protein&#8208;ligand complex. We report here the discovery of a convenient, &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; reaction for the homodimerization of protein ligands that is efficient, operationally simple to carry out, and tolerant of many functional groups. This chemistry reduces the synthetic burden inherent in the creation of homodimeric ligands since only a single precursor is required. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of homodimeric inhibitors, including PROTACs.

         <title>RNA&#8208;TAG Mediated Protein&#8208;RNA Conjugation</title>

Here we present an enzymatic, covalent, protein&#8208;nucleic acid conjugation method. This method precisely links two classes of biological macromolecules using SNAP&#8208;tag and RNA&#8208;TAG labeling technologies and a bifunctional small molecule probe. We demonstrate the utility of this method by recruiting an endonuclease to an RNA of interest for targeted degradation.







Abstract
Combinations of biological macromolecules can provide researchers with precise control and unique methods for regulating, studying, and manipulating cellular processes. For instance, combining the unmatched encodability afforded by nucleic acids with the diverse functionality of proteins has transformed our approach to solving several problems in chemical biology. Despite these benefits, there remains a need for new methods to site&#8208;specifically generate conjugates between different classes of biomolecules. Here we present a fully enzymatic strategy for combining nucleic acids and proteins using SNAP&#8208;tag and RNA&#8208;TAG (transglycosylation at guanosine) technologies via a bifunctional preQ1&#8208;benzylguanine small molecule probe. We demonstrate the robust ability of this technology to assemble site&#8208;specific SNAP&#8208;tag &#8211; RNA conjugates with RNAs of varying length and use our conjugation strategy to recruit an endonuclease to an RNA of interest for targeted degradation. We foresee that combining SNAP&#8208;tag and RNA&#8208;TAG will facilitate researchers to predictably engineer novel macromolecular complexes.

A new fatty acid synthase off&#8208;loading domain. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) usually releases its products by hydrolysis or transesterification. Here, an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase off&#8208;loading domain is identified in a cyanobacterial type I FAS. This domain releases the fatty acyl chain through a condensation with L&#8208;serine, offering a novel pathway to &#945;&#8208;amino&#160;ketones that share similarities with sphingolipid precursors.

         <title>The Evolutionary Pattern of Cocaine and Hyoscyamine Biosynthesis Provides Strategies To Produce Tropane Alkaloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to increase the availability of tropane alkaloids through metabolic engineering. This article highlights the latest advances in the biosynthetic pathway of cocaine, a tropane alkaloid produced by the Erythroxylaceae family and summarizes the conserved and specialized, characterized molecular mechanisms in tropane alkaloids synthesis that could guide, in a structured and efficient way, the production of these anticholinergic molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. Picture created with BioRender.







Abstract
Cocaine and hyoscyamine are two tropane alkaloids (TA) from Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae, respectively. These famous compounds possess anticholinergic properties that can be used to treat neuromuscular disorders. While the hyoscyamine biosynthetic pathway has been fully elucidated allowing its de novo synthesis in yeast, the cocaine pathway remained only partially elucidated. Recently, the Huang research group has completed the cocaine biosynthetic route by characterizing its two missing enzymes. This allowed the whole pathway to be transferring into Nicotiana benthamiana to achieve cocaine production. Here, besides highlighting the impact of this discovery, we discuss how TA biosynthesis evolved via the recruitment of two distinct and convergent pathways in Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae. Finally, while enriching our knowledge on TA biosynthesis, this diversification of the molecular actors involved in cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis opens perspectives in metabolic engineering by exploring enzyme biochemical plasticity that can ease and shorten TA pathway reconstitution in heterologous organisms.

This article highlights the latest advances in the biosynthetic pathway of cocaine, a tropane alkaloid produced by the Erythroxylaceae family and summarizes the conserved and specialized, characterized molecular mechanisms in tropane alkaloids synthesis that could guide, in a structured and efficient way, the production of these anticholinergic molecules for the pharmaceutical industry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine and hyoscyamine are two tropane alkaloids (TA) from Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae, respectively. These famous compounds possess anticholinergic properties that can be used to treat neuromuscular disorders. While the hyoscyamine biosynthetic pathway has been fully elucidated allowing its de novo synthesis in yeast, the cocaine pathway remained only partially elucidated. Recently, the Huang research group has completed the cocaine biosynthetic route by characterizing its two missing enzymes. This allowed the whole pathway to be transferring into &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; to achieve cocaine production. Here, besides highlighting the impact of this discovery, we discuss how TA biosynthesis evolved via the recruitment of two distinct and convergent pathways in Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae. Finally, while enriching our knowledge on TA biosynthesis, this diversification of the molecular actors involved in cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis opens perspectives in metabolic engineering by exploring enzyme biochemical plasticity that can ease and shorten TA pathway reconstitution in heterologous organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Prodrug Chemistries for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of Stimuli&#8208;responsive prodrugs for controlled release of the drugs to tumour tissues and cells while reducing the exposure of drugs in the blood and healthy cells is a highly challenging task. In this review, the design strategies and recent advances of stimuli&#8208;responsive anticancer prodrugs for tumor&#8208;specific drug delivery have been discussed.







Abstract
Prodrugs are pharmacologically inactive, chemically modified derivatives of active drugs, which, following in&#8197;vivo administration, are converted to the parent drugs through chemical or enzymatic cleavage. The prodrug approach holds tremendous potential to create the enhanced version of an existing pharmacological agent and leverage those improvements to augment the drug molecules&#8242; bioavailability, targeting ability, therapeutic efficacy, safety, and marketability. Especially in cancer therapy, prodrug application has received substantial attention. A prodrug can effectively broaden the therapeutic window of its parent drug by enhancing its release at targeted tumor sites while reducing its access to healthy cells. The spatiotemporally controlled release can be achieved by manipulating the chemical, physical, or biological stimuli present at the targeted tumor site. The critical strategy comprises drug&#8208;carrier linkages that respond to physiological or biochemical stimuli in the tumor milieu to yield the active drug form. This review will focus on the recent advancements in the development of various fluorophore&#8208;drug conjugates that are widely used for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery. The use of different stimuli&#8208;cleavable linkers and the mechanisms of linker cleavage will be discussed. Finally, the review will conclude with a critical discussion of the prospects and challenges that might impede the future development of such prodrugs.

         <title>Increasing the Selectivity of Light&#8208;Active Antimicrobial Agents &#8211; Or How To Get a Photosensitizer to the Desired Target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 18, September 15, 2023. </description>

Selective targeting of light&#8208;active molecules to pathogens is a very attractive approach in modern drug discovery efforts. In this review, we summarize the current developments and highlights of recent literature dealing with the modification of photosensitizers to increase their target specificity.







Abstract
Photosensitizers combine the inherent reactivity of reactive oxygen species with the sophisticated reaction control of light. Through selective targeting, these light&#8208;active molecules have the potential to overcome certain limitations in drug discovery. Ongoing advances in the synthesis and evaluation of photosensitizer conjugates with biomolecules such as antibodies, peptides, or small&#8208;molecule drugs are leading to increasingly powerful agents for the eradication of a growing number of microbial species. This review article, therefore, summarizes challenges and opportunities in the development of selective photosensitizers and their conjugates described in recent literature. This provides adequate insight for newcomers and those interested in this field.

         <title>Chemical Probes for Profiling of MALT1 Protease Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MALT1 is a cysteine protease and the only human paracaspase. It is implicated in various human diseases. Here, an overview of the currently available molecular tools is given. Furthermore, their application and future possibilities are discussed. We expect that future research with these and improved tools will provide novel insights into MALT1&#8217;s pathobiological roles and enable use as diagnostic tools.







Abstract
The paracaspase MALT1 is a key regulator of the human immune response. It is implicated in a variety of human diseases. For example, deregulated protease activity drives the survival of malignant lymphomas and is involved in the pathophysiology of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. Thus, MALT1 has attracted attention as promising drug target. Although many MALT1 inhibitors have been identified, molecular tools to study MALT1 activity, target engagement and inhibition in complex biological samples, such as living cells and patient material, are still scarce. Such tools are valuable to validate MALT1 as a drug target in&#8197;vivo and to assess yet unknown biological roles of MALT1. In this review, we discuss the recent literature on the development and biological application of molecular tools to study MALT1 activity and inhibition.

         <title>Current State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Toward Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Polyketide Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyketides represent an area of significant interest for drug discovery efforts. Leveraging a combination of chemical synthesis and enzymology, researchers have routinely demonstrated that the best of both strategies are conferred and result in improved outcomes. This review highlights the success of such an approach and provides an outlook for polyketide synthetic biology.







Abstract
Polyketide natural products have significant promise as pharmaceutical targets for human health and as molecular tools to probe disease and complex biological systems. While the biosynthetic logic of polyketide synthases (PKS) is well&#8208;understood, biosynthesis of designer polyketides remains challenging due to several bottlenecks, including substrate specificity constraints, disrupted protein&#8208;protein interactions, and protein solubility and folding issues. Focusing on substrate specificity, PKSs are typically interrogated using synthetic thioesters. PKS assembly lines and their products offer a wealth of information when studied in a chemoenzymatic fashion. This review provides an overview of the past two decades of polyketide chemoenzymatic synthesis and their contributions to the field of chemical biology. These synthetic strategies have successfully yielded natural product derivatives while providing critical insights into enzymatic promiscuity and mechanistic activity.

         <title>Hypoxia Modulates Cellular Endocytic Pathways and Organelles with Enhanced Cell Migration and 3D Cell Invasion
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia in tumors alters cellular processes, affecting cancer cell behavior. Cobalt chloride&#8208;induced hypoxia reduced proliferation but increased migration and invasion in cancer cells. Short hypoxia increased galectin3 endocytosis, but prolonged hypoxia decreased it. Organelle changes indicated adaptation to hypoxic stress. Hypoxia modulates endocytic pathways, reducing proliferation and enhancing cell migration and invasion.







Abstract
Hypoxia, a decrease in cellular or tissue level oxygen content, is characteristic of most tumors and has been shown to drive cancer progression by altering multiple subcellular processes. We hypothesized that the cancer cells in a hypoxic environment might have slower proliferation rates and increased invasion and migration rates with altered endocytosis compared to the cancer cells in the periphery of the tumor mass that experience normoxic conditions. We induced cellular hypoxia by exposing cells to cobalt chloride, a chemical hypoxic mimicking agent. This study measured the effect of hypoxia on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin, galectin3, and dextran that undergo endocytosis through major endocytic pathways (Clathrin&#8208;mediated pathway (CME), Clathrin&#8208;independent pathway (CIE), Fluid phase endocytosis (FPE)) were analyzed during hypoxia. Also, the organelle changes associated with hypoxia were studied with organelle trackers. We found that the proliferation rate decreased, and the migration and invasion rate increased in cancer cells in hypoxic conditions compared to normoxic cancer cells. A short hypoxic exposure increased galectin3 uptake in hypoxic cancer cells, but a prolonged hypoxic exposure decreased clathrin&#8208;independent endocytic uptake of galectin 3. Subcellular organelles, such as mitochondria, increased to withstand the hypoxic stress, while other organelles, such as Endoplasmic reticulum (ER), were significantly decreased. These data suggest that hypoxia modulates cellular endocytic pathways with reduced proliferation and enhanced cell migration and invasion.

         <title>4&#8208;Oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactams as Novel Inhibitors for Rhomboid Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhomboid proteases are serine proteases that reside inside the lipid bilayer of a membrane. They are implicated in several diseases. We here report 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam as a new scaffold for covalent rhomboid inhibitors and activity&#8208;based probes.







Abstract
Intramembrane serine proteases (rhomboid proteases) are involved in a variety of biological processes and are implicated in several diseases. Here, we report 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as a novel scaffold for inhibition of rhomboids. We show that they covalently react with the active site and that the covalent bond is sufficiently stable for detection of the covalent rhomboid&#8208;lactam complex. 4&#8208;Oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams may therefore find future use as both inhibitors and activity&#8208;based probes for rhomboid proteases.

         <title>Extended Biocatalytic Halogenation Cascades Involving a Single&#8208;Polypeptide Regeneration System for Diffusible FADH2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a bifunctional fusion protein for FADH2 regeneration and successfully coexpressed it with different flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases, as well as a dioxygenase that converts 6&#8208;chlorotryptophan to 4&#8208;Cl&#8208;Kynurenine. The figure is a still life of a laboratory bench, with a single oversized E. coli bacterium hovering over an Erlenmeyer flask. Cell disruption is depicted in visual analogy to cracking an egg with the lysate appearing like egg yolk. The lysate in the flask contains all necessary enzymes for the biocatalytic cascade described in the paper rendered as ribbon structures with coloring consistent with the paper. Shown as permanent marker notes on the bench surface are a key reaction scheme as well as a &#8220;ToDo&#8208;list&#8221; that checks off some important goals of the research work. More information can be found in the Research article by N. Montua, N. Sewald.

         <title>Nucleic Acid Detection through RNA&#8208;Guided Protease Activity in Type III&#8208;E CRISPR&#8208;Cas Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA&#8208;guided protease activity was recently discovered in the type III&#8208;E CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems (Craspase), providing a novel platform for engineering a protein probe instead of the commonly used nucleic acid probe in the nucleic acid detection assays. Here, by adapting a fluorescence readout technique using the affinity&#8208; and fluorescent protein dual&#8208;tagged Csx30 protein substrate, we established an assay monitoring Csx30 cleavage by target ssRNA&#8208;activated Craspase. Four Craspase&#8208;based nucleic acid detection systems for genes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), norovirus, and the influenza virus (IFV) were reconstituted with demonstrated specificity. The assay could reliably detect target ssRNAs with concentrations down to 25 pM, which could be further improved by approximately 15,000&#8208;fold (~ 2 fM) through incorporating the recombinase polymerase isothermal preamplification step. Importantly, the species&#8208;specific substrate cleavage specificity of Craspase enabled multiplexed diagnosis, as demonstrated by the reconstituted composite systems for simultaneous detection of two genes from the same virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, spike and nsp12) or two types of viruses (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and IFV). The assay could be further expanded by diversifying the fluorescent tags in the substrate and including Craspase systems of various species, potentially providing an easily adaptable platform for clinical diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispidine as a versatile scaffold: From topological hosts to transmembrane transporters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of designer topological structures is synthetically challenging endeavor. We herein present bispidine as a platform for the design of molecules with various topologies and functions. Bispidine&#8208;based acyclic molecule, showing intriguing S&#8208;shape topology was discussed. Single crystal X&#8208;ray revealed that this molecule exists in solid state as two conformational enantiomers. In addition to that, bispidine&#8208;based designer macrocycles were synthesized and investigated for ionophoric properties. Patch clamp experiments revealed that these macrocycles transport non&#8208;specifically both anions and cations with at least 10&#8208;fold higher chloride conductance over the cations under the given experimental conditions. The results indicated that the self&#8208;assembling macrocycle form tubular assembly as evident from ultramicroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. Our design highlights the utilization of non&#8208;conventional dihydrogen interactions in nanotube fabrication.</dc:description>

         <title>Computation&#8208;Based Design of Salt Bridges in PETase for Enhanced Thermostability and Performance for PET Degradation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid residues with opposite charges were introduced into the flexible region of IsPETase using a computation&#8208;based salt bridge design strategy. The mutation sites formed a salt bridge or salt bridge network to improve the thermal stability of IsPETase, and the degradation efficiency of amorphous PET film was enhanced.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely used plastics, and the accumulation of PET poses a great threat to the environment. IsPETase can degrade PET rapidly at moderate temperatures, but its application is greatly limited by the low stability. Herein, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with a sequence alignment strategy were adopted to introduce salt bridges into the flexible region of IsPETase to improve its thermal stability. In the designed variants, the Tm values of IsPETaseI168R/S188D and IsPETaseI168R/S188E were 7.4 and 8.7&#8201;&#176;C higher than that of the wild type, respectively. The release of products degraded by IsPETaseI168R/S188E was 4.3&#8197;times that of the wild type. Tertiary structure characterization demonstrated that the structure of the variants IsPETaseI168R/S188D and IsPETaseI168R/S188E became more compact. Extensive MD simulations verified that a stable salt bridge was formed between the residue R168 and D186 in IsPETaseI168R/S188D, while in IsPETaseI168R/S188E an R168&#8208;D186&#8208;E188 salt bridge network was observed. These results confirmed that the proposed computation&#8208;based salt bridge design strategy could efficiently generate variants with enhanced thermal stability for the long&#8208;term degradation of PET, which would be helpful for the design of enzymes with improved stability.

         <title>Terpene Synthases in the Biosynthesis of Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpenes across Diverse Organisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are bioactive natural products found in various organisms. We review the discovery of DTS synthases and the tailoring enzymes generating the chemical diversity. The catalytic motifs, domain functions and underlying mechanisms of the DTS synthases in constructing drimane scaffold are summarized. These discoveries present valuable opportunities for exploring DTSs biosynthesis through genome mining.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are significant terpenoid natural products characterized by their unique C15 bicyclic skeleton. They are produced by various organisms including plants, fungi, bacteria and marine organisms, and exhibit a diverse array of bioactivities. These bioactivities encompass antifeedant, anti&#8208;insecticidal, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;fungal, anti&#8208;viral and anti&#8208;proliferative properties. Some DTSs contribute to the pungent flavor found in herb plants like water pepper, while others serve as active components responsible for the anti&#8208;cancer activities observed in medicinal mushrooms such as (&#8722;)&#8208;antrocin from Antrodia cinnamomea. Recently, DTS synthases have been identified in various organisms, biosynthesizing drimenol, drim&#8208;8&#8208;ene&#8208;11&#8208;ol and (+)&#8208;albicanol, which all possess the characteristic drimane skeleton. Interestingly, despite these enzymes producing chemical molecules with a drimane scaffold, they exhibit minimal amino acid sequence identity across different organisms. This Concept article focuses on the discovery of DTS synthases and the tailoring enzymes generating the chemical diversity of drimane natural products.

     alt="Terpene Synthases in the Biosynthesis of Drimane-Type Sesquiterpenes across Diverse Organisms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drimane-type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are bioactive natural products found in various organisms. We review the discovery of DTS synthases and the tailoring enzymes generating the chemical diversity. The catalytic motifs, domain functions and underlying mechanisms of the DTS synthases in constructing drimane scaffold are summarized. These discoveries present valuable opportunities for exploring DTSs biosynthesis through genome mining.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drimane-type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are significant terpenoid natural products characterized by their unique C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; bicyclic skeleton. They are produced by various organisms including plants, fungi, bacteria and marine organisms, and exhibit a diverse array of bioactivities. These bioactivities encompass antifeedant, anti-insecticidal, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and anti-proliferative properties. Some DTSs contribute to the pungent flavor found in herb plants like water pepper, while others serve as active components responsible for the anti-cancer activities observed in medicinal mushrooms such as (&#8722;)-antrocin from &lt;i&gt;Antrodia cinnamomea&lt;/i&gt;. Recently, DTS synthases have been identified in various organisms, biosynthesizing drimenol, drim-8-ene-11-ol and (+)-albicanol, which all possess the characteristic drimane skeleton. Interestingly, despite these enzymes producing chemical molecules with a drimane scaffold, they exhibit minimal amino acid sequence identity across different organisms. This Concept article focuses on the discovery of DTS synthases and the tailoring enzymes generating the chemical diversity of drimane natural products. We summarize and discuss their key features, including the chemical mechanisms, catalytic motifs and functional domains employed by these terpene synthases to generate DTS scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cell&#8208;Free Multi&#8208;enzyme Cascade Reaction for the Synthesis of CDP&#8208;Glycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for the cell&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot synthesis of CDP&#8208;glycerol has been developed. Through a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiments approach, the yield of the cascade was increased from 10 to 89&#8201;% with respect to cytidine as a substrate. The final product titer after a batch time of 24&#8197;h was 31.2&#8197;mM CDP&#8208;glycerol.







Abstract
CDP&#8208;glycerol is a nucleotide&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;activated version of glycerol. In nature, it is required for the biosynthesis of teichoic acid in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, which is an appealing target epitope for the development of new vaccines. Here, a cell&#8208;free multi&#8208;enzyme cascade was developed to synthetize nucleotide&#8208;activated glycerol from the inexpensive and readily available substrates cytidine and glycerol. The cascade comprises five recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli that were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. As part of the cascade, ATP is regenerated in&#8197;situ from polyphosphate to reduce synthesis costs. The enzymatic cascade was characterized at the laboratory scale, and the products were analyzed by high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange chromatography (HPAEC)&#8208;UV and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS). After the successful synthesis had been confirmed, a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiments approach was used to screen for optimal operation conditions (temperature, pH value and MgCl2 concentration). Overall, a substrate conversion of 89&#8201;% was achieved with respect to the substrate cytidine.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Cereblon&#8208;Recruiting HaloPROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional HaloPROTAC ligand was developed to recruit the CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade target proteins fused with a HaloTag in the cell. The CRBN&#8208;recruiting HaloPROTAC can expand the use of the HaloPROTAC system for screening the degradation targets for therapeutic discovery.







Abstract
Target validation is key to the development of protein degrading molecules such as proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to identify cellular proteins amenable for induced degradation by the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS). Previously the HaloPROTAC system was developed to screen targets of PROTACs by linking the chlorohexyl group with the ligands of E3 ubiquitin ligases VHL and cIAP1 to recruit target proteins fused to the HaloTag for E3&#8208;catalyzed ubiquitination. Reported here are HaloPROTACs that engage the cereblon (CRBN) E3 to ubiquitinate and degrade HaloTagged proteins. A focused library of CRBN&#8208;pairing HaloPROTACs was synthesized and screened to identify efficient degraders of EGFP&#8208;HaloTag fusion with higher activities than VHL&#8208;engaging HaloPROTACs at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations of the compound. The CRBN&#8208;engaging HaloPROTACs broadens the scope of the E3 ubiquitin ligases that can be utilized to screen suitable targets for induced protein degradation in the cell.

         <title>Effects of Replacing a Central Glycine Residue in GLP&#8208;1 on Receptor Affinity and Signaling Profile</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The receptor activated by GLP&#8208;1 is a target for drugs that treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. Since glycine has a low &#945;&#8208;helix propensity, and Gly22 of GLP&#8208;1 does not contact the receptor, we replaced Gly22 with residues that have a higher or lower helix propensity. Most substitutions had little effect on receptor affinity or activation and raised the possibility that the receptor&#8208;bound state of agonist peptides encompasses a broader conformational envelope.







Abstract
Agonists of the glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R) are used to treat diabetes and obesity. Cryo&#8208;EM structures indicate that GLP&#8208;1 is completely &#945;&#8208;helical when bound to the GLP&#8208;1R. The mature form of this hormone, GLP&#8208;1(7&#8208;36), contains a glycine residue near the center (Gly22). Since glycine has the second&#8208;lowest &#945;&#8208;helix propensity among the proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acid residues, and Gly22 does not appear to make direct contact with the receptor, we were motivated to explore the impact on agonist activity of altering the &#945;&#8208;helix propensity at this position. We examined GLP&#8208;1 analogues in which Gly22 was replaced with L&#8208;Ala, D&#8208;Ala, or &#946;&#8208;amino acid residues with varying helix propensities. The results suggest that the receptor is reasonably tolerant of variations in helix propensity, and that the functional receptor&#8208;agonist complex may comprise a conformational spectrum rather than a single fixed structure.

         <title>Molecular Highway Patrol for Ribosome Collisions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Car crashes on highways require responses like rescuing victims, deviating traffic, towing away damaged vehicles, and sometimes even blocking a road. Similarly, during translation, ribosomes can collide into each other with potentially dangerous outcomes for the cell. In response to ribosome collisions, cells mount a multi&#8208;pronged response, activating several molecular &#8242;squads&#8242;, symbolized by the Highway Police badge. These include degradation pathways for faulty mRNAs, peptide products and sometimes ribosomal constituents, regulation of translation, and stress as well as immune responses. More information can be found in the Review by M.&#8208;L. Winz et al.

         <title>Synthesis of Short Peptides with Perfluoroalkyl Side Chains and Evaluation of Their Cellular Uptake Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing amino acids (RF&#8208;AA) and demonstrated that tripeptides composed of the RF&#8208;AA have high cellular uptake efficiency. Furthermore, the absolute configuration of RF&#8208;AA affected the uptake efficiency due to the change in its ability to form nanoparticles. We anticipate that these findings provide the foundation for the development of efficient cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP). The cover picture shows tripeptides with perfluoroalkyl groups labeled with hydrophilic dyes that form particles in water and are efficiently taken up into cells. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Aikawa et al.

         <title>A &#8222;Magic Mushroom&#8220; Multi&#8208;Product Sesquiterpene Synthase</title>

Shrooms going terpenoid: The sesquiterpene synthase CubA of the &#8220;magic mushroom&#8221; Psilocybe cubensis was identified as a multi&#8208;functional enzyme producing cubebol, &#946;&#8208;copaene, and various other mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tricyclic sesquiterpenes or &#8208;terpenoids. As related enzymes are encoded in numerous Psilocybe species, our results provide further insight into the true metabolic diversity of this genus.







Abstract
Psilocybe &#8220;magic mushrooms&#8221; are chemically well understood for their psychotropic tryptamines. However, the diversity of their other specialized metabolites, in particular terpenoids, has largely remained an open question. Yet, knowledge on the natural product background is critical to understand if other compounds modulate the psychotropic pharmacological effects. CubA, the single clade II sesquiterpene synthase of P. cubensis, was heterologously produced in Escherichia coli and characterized in&#8197;vitro, complemented by in&#8197;vivo product formation assays in Aspergillus niger as a heterologous host. Extensive GC&#8208;MS analyses proved a function as multi&#8208;product synthase and, depending on the reaction conditions, cubebol, &#946;&#8208;copaene, &#948;&#8208;cadinene, and germacrene D were detected as the major products of CubA. In addition, mature P. cubensis carpophores were analysed chromatographically which led to the detection of &#946;&#8208;copaene and &#948;&#8208;cadinene. Enzymes closely related to CubA are encoded in the genomes of various Psilocybe species. Therefore, our results provide insight into the metabolic capacity of the entire genus.

         <title>Rapid On&#8208;Resin N&#8208;Formylation of Peptides as One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;formylation is a common pre&#8208; and post&#8208;translational modification of the N&#8208;terminus or the lysine side chain of peptides and proteins that plays a role in the initiation of immune responses, gene expression or epigenetics. Despite its high biological relevance, protocols for the chemical N&#8208;formylation of synthetic peptides are scarce. The few available methods are elaborate in their execution and the yields are highly sequence&#8208;dependent. We present a rapid, easy&#8208;to&#8208;use one&#8208;pot procedure that runs at room temperature and can be used to formylate protected peptides at both the N&#8208;terminus and the lysine side chain on the resin in near&#8208;quantitative yields. Only insensitive, storage&#8208;stable standard chemicals &#8211; formic acid, acetic anhydride, pyridine and DMF &#8208; are used. Formylation works for both short and long peptides of up to 34 amino acids and over the spectrum of canonical amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of cannabigerolic acid derivatives and their precursors using the promiscuity of the aromatic prenyltransferase NphB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NphB is an aromatic prenyltransferase with high promiscuity for phenolics including flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and plant polyketides. It has been demonstrated that cannabigerolic acid is successfully formed by the catalytic reaction by NphB using geranyl diphosphate and olivetolic acid as substrates. In this study, the substrate specificity of NphB was further determined using olivetolic acid derivatives as potential substrates for the formation of new synthetic cannabinoids. The derivatives differ in the hydrocarbon chain attached to the C6 of the core structure. We performed in silico experiments, including docking of olivetolic acid derivatives, to identify differences in their binding modes. Substrate acceptance were predicted. Based on these results, a library of olivetolic acid derivatives was constructed and synthesized using different organic synthetic routes. &#160;Conversion was monitored using in vitro assay with purified NphB versions. For the substrates leading to a high conversion olivetolic acid&#8208;C8, olivetolic acid&#8208;C2 and 2&#8209;benzyl&#8209;4,6&#8209;dihydroxybenzoic acid the products were further elucidated and identified as cannbigerolic acid derivatives. Therefore, these substrates show potential to be adapted in cannabinoid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Independent Activation of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor and Attenuation of Glutamine Levels by Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural deep eutectic solvent, CAGE, derived from choline and geranic acid, perturb the metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome of human cell line. Specifically, CAGE upregulated 4&#8208;hydroxyphenyllactic acid and indole&#8208;3&#8208;lactic acid to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, leading to the expression of IL1A, IL1B, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ALDH31, NQO1. CAGE also attenuate the intracellular levels of glutamine.







Abstract
Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are emerging sustainable alternatives to conventional organic solvents. Beyond their role as laboratory solvents, NADESs are increasingly explored in drug delivery and as therapeutics. Their increasing applications notwithstanding, our understanding of how they interact with biomolecules at multiple levels &#8208; metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome &#8208; within human cell remain poor. Here, we deploy integrated metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics to probe how NADESs perturb the molecular landscape of human cells. In a human cell line model, we found that an archetypal NADES derived from choline and geranic acid (CAGE) significantly altered the metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome. CAGE upregulated indole&#8208;3&#8208;lactic acid and 4&#8208;hydroxyphenyllactic acid levels, resulting in ligand&#8208;independent activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor to signal the transcription of genes with implications for inflammation, immunomodulation, cell development, and chemical detoxification. Further, treating the cell line with CAGE downregulated glutamine biosynthesis, a nutrient rapidly proliferating cancer cells require. CAGE's ability to attenuate glutamine levels is potentially relevant for cancer treatment. These findings suggest that NADESs, even when derived from natural components like choline, can indirectly modulate cell biology at multiple levels, expanding their applications beyond chemistry to biomedicine and biotechnology.

         <title>[4.3.1]Bicyclic FKBP Ligands Inhibit Legionella Pneumophila Infection by LpMip&#8208;Dependent and LpMip&#8208;Independent Mechanisms
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a screening of over 1000 FKBP&#8208;inhibitors [4.3.1]&#8208;bicyclic sulfonamides turned out to be the preferred binding scaffold for LpMip, a virulence factor of Legionella pneumophila. Although selected [4.3.1]&#8208;bicyclic sulfonamides showed anti&#8208;infective properties, LpMip was ruled out as sole target, with the results suggesting another FKBP is responsible for the observed effects.







Abstract
Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires&#8217; disease, a serious form of pneumonia. Its macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip), a member of a highly conserved family of FK506&#8208;binding proteins (FKBPs), plays a major role in the proliferation of the gram&#8208;negative bacterium in host organisms. In this work, we test our library of &gt;1000 FKBP&#8208;focused ligands for inhibition of LpMip. The [4.3.1]&#8208;bicyclic sulfonamide turned out as a highly preferred scaffold and provided the most potent LpMip inhibitors known so far. Selected compounds were non&#8208;toxic to human cells, displayed antibacterial activity and block bacterial proliferation in cellular infection&#8208;assays as well as infectivity in human lung tissue explants. The results confirm [4.3.1]&#8208;bicyclic sulfonamides as anti&#8208;legionellal agents, although their anti&#8208;infective properties cannot be explained by inhibition of LpMip alone.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Drug&#8208;Delivery System Based on PEG&#8208;Functionalized Pillararenes Containing Disulfide and Amido Bonds for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel drug&#8208;delivery system with a dual response to GSH and enzymes is based on the newly designed PEG&#8208;functionalized pillararene for efficient and rapid drug release, and cancer therapy.







Abstract
The construction of a smart drug&#8208;delivery system based on amphiphilic pillararenes with multiple responsiveness properties has become an important way to improve the efficacy of tumor chemotherapy. Here, a new PEG&#8208;functionalized pillararene (EtP5&#8208;SS&#8208;PEG) containing disulfide and amido bonds was designed and synthesized, which has been used to construct a novel supramolecular nanocarrier through a host&#8208;guest interaction with a perylene diimide derivative (PDI&#8208;2NH4) and their supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. This nanocarrier showed good drug loading capability, and dual stimulus responsiveness to enzyme and GSH (glutathione). After loading of doxorubicin (DOX), the prepared nanodrugs displayed efficient DOX release and outstanding cancer theranostics ability.

         <title>Sterically Enhanced Control of Enzyme&#8208;Assisted DNA Assembly</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods for the assembly of functionalised DNA structures, involving enzyme restriction and modification, present difficulties when working with small DNA fragments (&lt;100bp), in part due to a lack of control over enzymatic action during the DNA modification process. This limits the design flexibility and range of accessible DNA structures. Here, we show that these limitations can be overcome by introducing chemical modifications into the DNA, which spatially restrict enzymatic activity. This approach, Sterically Controlled Nuclease Enhanced (SCoNE) DNA assembly, thereby circumvents the size limitations of conventional Gibson assembly (GA) and allows for the preparation of welldefined, functionalised DNA structures with multiple probes for specific analytes, such as IL&#8208;6, procalcitonin (PCT), and a biotin reporter group. Notably, using the same starting materials conventional GA under typical conditions fails. We demonstrate successful analyte capture based on standard and modified sandwich ELISA and also show how the inclusion of biotin probes provides additional functionality for product isolation.</dc:description>

         <title>Garcinolic Acid Distinguishes Between GACKIX Domains and Modulates Interaction Networks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Garcinolic acid is a topologically complex natural product derived from Garcinia hanburyi. It engages the KIX domain in the master coactivator CBP/p300 selectively over other closely related motifs and in doing so disrupts CBP/p300 KIX protein&#8208;protein interactions. In the cellular context this enables downregulation of transcriptional circuits essential for cMyb&#8208;dependent leukemias.







Abstract
Natural products are often uniquely suited to modulate protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) due to their architectural and functional group complexity relative to synthetic molecules. Here we demonstrate that the natural product garcinolic acid allosterically blocks the CBP/p300 KIX PPI network and displays excellent selectivity over related GACKIX motifs. It does so via a strong interaction (KD 1&#8197;&#956;M) with a non&#8208;canonical binding site containing a structurally dynamic loop in CBP/p300 KIX. Garcinolic acid engages full&#8208;length CBP in the context of the proteome and in doing so effectively inhibits KIX&#8208;dependent transcription in a leukemia model. As the most potent small&#8208;molecule KIX inhibitor yet reported, garcinolic acid represents an important step forward in the therapeutic targeting of CBP/p300.

         <title>Caulobacter segnis Dioxygenase CsO2: A Practical Biocatalyst for Stilbenoid Ozonolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Caulobacter segnis dioxygenase has been employed for the enzymatic alkene cleavage of several stilbenoids, thus generating the corresponding aldehydes. CsO2&#8208;mediated ozonolysis represents a greener, safer, and more selective process with respect to conventional chemistry. To further assess the CsO2 usability as a preparative biocatalyst, a 50&#8211;mL scale biotransformation of resveratrol has been carried out obtaining the corresponding aldehydes with excellent yields (98&#8201;%), rapid reaction times (1.5&#8197;h) and unprecedented substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst ratio (5 103).







Abstract
Ozonolysis is a useful as well as dangerous reaction for performing alkene cleavage. On the other hand, enzymes are considered a more sustainable and safer alternative. Among them, Caulobacter segnis dioxygenase (CsO2) known so far for its ability to catalyze the coenzyme&#8208;free oxidation of vinylguaiacol into vanillin, was selected and its substrate scope evaluated towards diverse natural and synthetic stilbenoids. Under optimized conditions, CsO2 catalyzed the oxidative cleavage of the C=C double bonds of various trans&#8208;stilbenes, providing that a hydroxyl moiety was necessary in para&#8208;position of the phenyl group (e.&#8201;g., resveratrol and its derivatives) for the reaction to take place, which was confirmed by modelling studies. The reactions occurred rapidly (0.5&#8211;3&#8197;h) with high conversions (95&#8211;99&#8201;%) and without formation of by&#8208;products. The resveratrol biotransformation was carried out on 50&#8211;mL scale thus confirming the feasibility of the biocatalytic system as a preparative method.

         <title>Structural Description of Chiral E&#8208;Tiling DNA Nanotubes with the Chiral Indices (n,m) and Handedness Defined by Microscopic Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral index theory, widely used in carbon nanotubes, has been introduced to describe the chiral structures of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes precisely. In particular, we define a general equation of tube curvature with a clear physical picture by modifying its mathematical definition. Furthermore, we summarize the recent progress on defining the left&#8208; or right&#8208;handedness of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes through differentiating their inside and outside surfaces by fluorescence or electron or atomic force microscopic imaging.







Abstract
In structural DNA nanotechnology, E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes are evidenced to be homogeneous in diameter and thus have great potential in biomedical applications such as cellular transport and communication, transmembrane ion/molecule channeling, and drug delivery. However, a precise structural description of chiral DNA nanotubes with chiral parameters was lacking, thus greatly hindering their application breadth and depth, until we recently raised and partly solved this problem. In this perspective, we summarize recent progress in defining the chiral indices and handedness of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes by microscopic imaging, especially atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Such a detailed understanding of the chiral structures of E&#8208;tiling DNA nanotubes will be very helpful in the future, on the one hand for engineering DNA nanostructures precisely, and, on the other, for realizing specific physicochemical properties and biological functions successfully.

         <title>Modulating the RAGE&#8208;Induced Inflammatory Response: Peptoids as RAGE Antagonists</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the primary pathology of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is defined by brain deposition of amyloid&#8209;&#946;&#160;(A&#946;) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, chronic inflammation has emerged as an important factor in AD etiology.&#160; Upregulated cell surface expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end&#8208;products (RAGE), a key receptor of innate immune response, is reported in AD.&#160; In parallel, RAGE ligands, including A&#946;&#160;aggregates, HMGB1, and S100B, are elevated in AD brain.&#160; Activation of RAGE by these ligands triggers release of inflammatory cytokines and upregulates cell surface RAGE. Despite such observation, there are currently no therapeutics that target RAGE for treatment of AD&#8208;associated neuroinflammation. Peptoids, a novel class of potential AD therapeutics, display low toxicity, facile blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability, and resistance to proteolytic degradation. &#160;In the current study, peptoids were designed to mimic A&#946;, a ligand that binds the V&#8208;domain of RAGE, and curtail RAGE inflammatory activation. &#160;We reveal the nanomolar binding capability of peptoids JPT1 and JPT1a to RAGE and demonstrate their ability to attenuate lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine production as well as upregulation of RAGE cell surface expression.&#160; These results support RAGE antagonist peptoid&#8208;based mimics as a prospective therapeutic strategy to counter neuroinflammation in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the primary pathology of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is defined by brain deposition of amyloid&#8209;&#946;&#160;(A&#946;) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, chronic inflammation has emerged as an important factor in AD etiology.&#160; Upregulated cell surface expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a key receptor of innate immune response, is reported in AD.&#160; In parallel, RAGE ligands, including A&#946;&#160;aggregates, HMGB1, and S100B, are elevated in AD brain.&#160; Activation of RAGE by these ligands triggers release of inflammatory cytokines and upregulates cell surface RAGE. Despite such observation, there are currently no therapeutics that target RAGE for treatment of AD-associated neuroinflammation. Peptoids, a novel class of potential AD therapeutics, display low toxicity, facile blood-brain barrier permeability, and resistance to proteolytic degradation. &#160;In the current study, peptoids were designed to mimic A&#946;, a ligand that binds the V-domain of RAGE, and curtail RAGE inflammatory activation. &#160;We reveal the nanomolar binding capability of peptoids JPT1 and JPT1a to RAGE and demonstrate their ability to attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production as well as upregulation of RAGE cell surface expression.&#160; These results support RAGE antagonist peptoid-based mimics as a prospective therapeutic strategy to counter neuroinflammation in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase catalyzes the heterolytic cleavage of H2 and reversible hydride transfer to methenyl&#8208;tetrahydromethanopterin. The iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor is the prosthetic group of this enzyme, in which mononuclear Fe(II) is ligated with a pyridinol and two CO ligands. The pyridinol ligand fixes the iron by an acyl carbon and a pyridinol nitrogen. Biosynthetic proteins for this cofactor are encoded in the hmd co&#8208;occurring (hcg) genes. The function of HcgB, HcgC, HcgD, HcgE, and HcgF was studied by using structure to function analysis, which is based on the crystal structure of the proteins and subsequent enzyme assays. Recently, we reported the catalytic properties of HcgA and HcgG, novel radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes, by using an in vitro biosynthesis assay. Here, we review the properties of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase and the FeGP cofactor, and the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor. Finally, we discuss the expected engineering of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase and the FeGP cofactor.</dc:description>

         <title>The Antimicrobial Properties of PdII&#8722; and RuII&#8722;pyta Complexes

New metalloantibiotics: With the rise and spread of multidrug&#8208;resistant fungal pathogens, new drugs are urgently needed. In this work, new ruthenium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based compounds with promising antifungal properties are reported.







Abstract
Infections associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are poised to become the leading cause of death in the next few decades, a scenario that can be ascribed to two phenomena: antibiotic over&#8208;prescription and a lack of antibiotic drug development. The crowd&#8208;sourced initiative Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO&#8208;ADD) has been testing research compounds contributed by researchers around the world to find new antimicrobials to combat AMR, and during this campaign has found that metallodrugs might be a promising, yet untapped source. To this end, we submitted 18 PdII&#8722; and RuII&#8722;pyridyl&#8722;1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl complexes that were developed as catalysts to assess their antimicrobial properties. It was found that the Pd complexes, especially Pd1, possessed potent antifungal activity with MICs between 0.06 and 0.125&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 against Candida glabrata. The in&#8208;vitro studies were extended to in&#8208;vivo studies in Galleria mellonella larvae, where it was established that the compounds were nontoxic. Here, we effectively demonstrate the potential of PdII&#8722;pyta complexes as antifungal agents.

         <title>The Role of Trp79 in &#946;&#8208;Actin on Histidine Methyltransferase SETD3 Catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Second site: A distant Trp79 binding site modulates the histidine methyltransferase SETD3&#8208;catalysed methylation of His73 in &#946;&#8208;actin. Our findings have implications for the identification of new substrates and chemical probes of biomedically important SETD3.







Abstract
N&#964;&#8208;methylation of His73 in actin by histidine methyltransferase SETD3 plays an important role in stabilising actin filaments in eukaryotes. Mutations in actin and overexpression of SETD3 have been related to human diseases, including cancer. Here, we investigated the importance of Trp79 in &#946;&#8208;actin on productive human SETD3 catalysis. Substitution of Trp79 in &#946;&#8208;actin peptides by its chemically diverse analogues reveals that the hydrophobic Trp79 binding pocket modulates the catalytic activity of SETD3, and that retaining a bulky and hydrophobic amino acid at position 79 is important for efficient His73 methylation by SETD3. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Trp79 binding pocket of SETD3 is ideally shaped to accommodate large and hydrophobic Trp79, contributing to the favourable release of water molecules upon binding. Our results demonstrate that the distant Trp79 binding site plays an important role in efficient SETD3 catalysis, contributing to the identification of new SETD3 substrates and the development of chemical probes targeting the biomedically important SETD3.

         <title>The Scent of Change: Sustainable Fragrances Through Industrial Biotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the role of biotechnology and computational methods in sustainable fragrance production, focusing on fermentation, biocatalysis, and genetic engineering.







Abstract
Current environmental and safety considerations urge innovation to address the need for sustainable high&#8208;value chemicals that are embraced by consumers. This review discusses the concept of sustainable fragrances, as high&#8208;value, everyday and everywhere chemicals. Current and emerging technologies represent an opportunity to produce fragrances in an environmentally and socially responsible way. Biotechnology, including fermentation, biocatalysis, and genetic engineering, has the potential to reduce the environmental footprint of fragrance production while maintaining quality and consistency. Computational and in silico methods, including machine learning (ML), are also likely to augment the capabilities of sustainable fragrance production. Continued innovation and collaboration will be crucial to the future of sustainable fragrances, with a focus on developing novel sustainable ingredients, as well as ethical sourcing practices.

         <title>Exploring Photoswitchable Binding Interactions with Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208; and Peptide&#8208;Based Inhibitors of Trypsin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different for different states: Small&#8208;molecule&#8208; and peptide&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of trypsin were investigated to better understand their binding interactions and hence optimise the difference in biological activity between isomeric states. The best peptidic inhibitor displayed a more than fivefold difference in inhibitory activity between isomeric states compared to the best small&#8208;molecule inhibitor (3.4&#8208;fold), due to a more significant 3D structural change upon switching.







Abstract
The ability to photochemically activate a drug, both when and where needed, requires optimisation of the difference in biological activity between each isomeric state. As a step to this goal, we report small&#8208;molecule&#8208; and peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of the same protease&#8212;trypsin&#8212;to better understand how photoswitchable drugs interact with their biological target. The best peptidic inhibitor displayed a more than fivefold difference in inhibitory activity between isomeric states, whereas the best small&#8208;molecule inhibitor only showed a 3.4&#8208;fold difference. Docking and molecular modelling suggest this result is due to a large change in 3D structure in the key binding residues of the peptidic inhibitor upon isomerisation; this is not observed for the small&#8208;molecule inhibitor. Hence, we demonstrate that significant structural changes in critical binding motifs upon irradiation are essential for maximising the difference in biological activity between isomeric states. This is an important consideration in the design of future photoswitchable drugs for clinical applications.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Fluorescence Labeling Of Genomic DNA For Simultaneous Detection Of Global 5&#8208;Methylcytosine And 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylcytosine
</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;color global labelling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine and umCpG by multi&#8208;color fluorescent labelling. We apply an engineered methyltransferase enzyme specific for unmodified CpG to incorporate a modified cofactor that binds to a fluorophore by click chemistry. In combination with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine labelling via enzymatic glycosylation, we incorporate spectrally distinct colour for each epigenetic mark, enabling simultaneous quantification in different cancer types.







Abstract
5&#8208;Methylcytosine and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine are epigenetic modifications involved in gene regulation and cancer. We present a new, simple, and high&#8208;throughput platform for multi&#8208;color epigenetic analysis. The novelty of our approach is the ability to multiplex methylation and de&#8208;methylation signals in the same assay. We utilize an engineered methyltransferase enzyme that recognizes and labels all unmodified CpG sites with a fluorescent cofactor. In combination with the already established labeling of the de&#8208;methylation mark 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine via enzymatic glycosylation, we obtained a robust platform for simultaneous epigenetic analysis of these marks. We assessed the global epigenetic levels in multiple samples of colorectal cancer and observed a 3.5&#8208;fold reduction in 5hmC levels but no change in DNA methylation levels between sick and healthy individuals. We also measured epigenetic modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and observed a decrease in both modification levels (5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine: whole blood 30&#8201;%; peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 40&#8201;%. 5&#8208;methylcytosine: whole blood 53&#8201;%; PBMCs 48&#8201;%). Our findings propose using a simple blood test as a viable method for analysis, simplifying sample handling in diagnostics. Importantly, our results highlight the assay&#8216;s potential for epigenetic evaluation of clinical samples, benefiting research and patient management.

         <title>Access to High&#8208;Purity 7mG&#8208;cap RNA in Substantial Quantities by a Convenient All&#8208;Chemical Solid&#8208;Phase Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the importance of mRNA with 5&#8217;&#8208;cap, easy access to RNA substrates with different 7mG caps, of high quality and in large quantities is essential to elucidate the roles of RNA and the regulation of underlying processes. In addition to existing synthetic routes to 5&#8217;&#8208;cap RNA based on enzymatic, chemical or chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods, we present here an all&#8208;chemical method for synthetic RNA capping. The novelty of this study lies in the fact that the capping reaction is performed on solid&#8208;support after automated RNA assembly using commercial 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;propionyloxymethyl ribonucleoside phosphoramidites, which enable final RNA deprotection under mild conditions while preserving both 7mG&#8208;cap and RNA integrity. The capping reaction is efficiently carried out between a 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphoroimidazolide RNA anchored on the support and 7mGDP in DMF in the presence of zinc chloride. Substantial amounts of 7mG&#8208;cap RNA (from 1 to 28 nucleotides in length and of any sequence with or without internal methylations) containing various cap structures (7mGpppA, 7mGpppAm, 7mGpppm6A, 7mGpppm6Am, 7mGpppG, 7mGpppGm) were obtained with high purity after IEX&#8208;HPLC purification. This capping method using solid&#8208;phase chemistry is convenient to perform and provides access to valuable RNA substrates as useful research tools to unravel specific issues regarding cap&#8208;related processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Variation of Clasper Scent Gland Composition of Heliconius Butterflies from a Biodiversity Hotspot</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Male Heliconius butterflies possess two pheromone emitting structures, wing androconia and abdominal clasper scent glands. The composition of the clasper scent gland of males of 17 Heliconius and Eueides species from an overlapping area in Ecuador, comprising three mimicry groups, was investigated by GC/MS. The chemical signal serves as an anti&#8208;aphrodisiac signal that is transferred from males to females during mating, indicating the mating status of the female to prevent them from harassment by other males. In addition, the odour may also serve in predator defence. There is potential for convergence driven by mimicry, although, such convergence might be detrimental for species recognition of the butterflies within the mimicry ring, making mating more difficult. More than 500 compounds were detected, consisting of volatile, semi&#8208;volatile or non&#8208;volatile compounds, including terpenes, fatty acid esters or aromatic compounds. Several novel esters were identified by GC/MS and GC/IR data, microderivatisation and synthesis, including butyl (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;dodecenoate and other (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;alkenoates, 3&#8208;oxohexyl citronellate and 5&#8208;methylhexa&#8208;3,5&#8208;dienyl (E)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrofarnesoate. The secretions were found to be species specific, potentially allowing for species differentiation. Statistical analysis of the more than 500 compounds showed differentiation by phylogenetic clade and species, but not by mimicry group.</dc:description>

         <title>Terpenoids as Human Neutrophil Elastase (HNE) Inhibitors: a comprehensive review of Natural Anti&#8208;inflammatory Isoprenoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is an enzyme that plays key role in the body's inflammatory response. It has been linked to a number of diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. As potential treatments for these diseases, HNE inhibitors are of great interest. Metabolites derived from plants, particularly terpenoids such as &#946;&#8208;caryophyllene found in black pepper and other plants, and geraniol present in several essential oils, are recognized as significant sources of inhibitors for HNE. Because of their ability to inhibit HNE, terpenoids are considered promising candidates for developing novel therapies to treat inflammatory conditions such as COPD and emphysema. Furthermore, nature can serve as an excellent designer, and it may offer a safer drug candidate for inhibiting HNE production and activity in the future. This review focuses on the isolation, chemical diversity, and inhibition of Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) of various terpenoids reported from natural sources up to 2022. Further it also provides a summary of HNE inhibitors and includes a through discussion was made on structure activity relationship.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogels with Reversible Crosslinks for Improved Localised Stem Cell Retention: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue repair by administering stem cells retained in adaptable hydrogels. Various promising stem cells for tissue repair are discussed, together with the hydrogels that enclose them and interact well with the tissue. Hydrogel&#8211;cell fixation is accomplished by the hydrogel's chemical design, and the injectability by shear&#8208;thinning. Due to the dynamic bonds, the hydrogel will become injectable by applying force, but form a gel after injection.







Abstract
Successful stem cell applications could have a significant impact on the medical field, where many lives are at stake. However, the translation of stem cells to the clinic could be improved by overcoming challenges in stem cell transplantation and in&#8197;vivo retention at the site of tissue damage. This review aims to showcase the most recent insights into developing hydrogels that can deliver, retain, and accommodate stem cells for tissue repair. Hydrogels can be used for tissue engineering, as their flexibility and water content makes them excellent substitutes for the native extracellular matrix. Moreover, the mechanical properties of hydrogels are highly tuneable, and recognition moieties to control cell behaviour and fate can quickly be introduced. This review covers the parameters necessary for the physicochemical design of adaptable hydrogels, the variety of (bio)materials that can be used in such hydrogels, their application in stem cell delivery and some recently developed chemistries for reversible crosslinking. Implementing physical and dynamic covalent chemistry has resulted in adaptable hydrogels that can mimic the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tissue repair&lt;/b&gt; by administering stem cells retained in adaptable hydrogels. Various promising stem cells for tissue repair are discussed, together with the hydrogels that enclose them and interact well with the tissue. Hydrogel&#8211;cell fixation is accomplished by the hydrogel's chemical design, and the injectability by shear-thinning. Due to the dynamic bonds, the hydrogel will become injectable by applying force, but form a gel after injection.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling in Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Reveals the Broad Reactivity of a Carmofur&#8208;Derived Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme targets of activity&#8208;based probes built on the anti&#8208;neoplastic drug and antimicrobial agent carmofur in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been identified. Chemoproteomic profiling revealed a broad reactivity of the probe against both cysteine and serine hydrolases, and identified uncharacterized bacterial enzymes; this has implications for putative human or microbial (off)targets engaged by therapeutic use of carmofur in the clinic.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based protein profiling is a powerful chemoproteomic technique to detect active enzymes and identify targets and off&#8208;targets of drugs. Here, we report the use of carmofur&#8208; and activity&#8208;based probes to identify biologically relevant enzymes in the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Carmofur is an anti&#8208;neoplastic prodrug of 5&#8208;fluorouracil and also has antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity. Carmofur probes were originally designed to target human acid ceramidase, a member of the NTN hydrolase family with an active&#8208;site cysteine nucleophile. Here, we first profiled the targets of a fluorescent carmofur probe in live S. aureus under biofilm&#8208;promoting conditions and in liquid culture, before proceeding to target identification by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Treatment with a carmofur&#8208;biotin probe led to enrichment of 20 enzymes from diverse families awaiting further characterization, including the NTN hydrolase&#8208;related IMP cyclohydrolase PurH. However, the probe preferentially labeled serine hydrolases, thus displaying a reactivity profile similar to that of carbamates. Our results suggest that the electrophilic N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;5&#8208;fluorouracil scaffold could potentially be optimized to achieve selectivity towards diverse enzyme families. The observed promiscuous reactivity profile suggests that the clinical use of carmofur presumably leads to inactivation of a number human and microbial enzymes, which could lead to side effects and/or contribute to therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>CuII Pyrazolyl&#8208;Benzimidazole Dinuclear Complexes with Remarkable Antioxidant Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dinuclear CuII complex [Cu(NO3)(&#956;&#8208;NO3)(L&#8217;)]2 , containing an oxidized ligand, shows remarkable antioxidant properties compared to the original ligand and reference compounds. A mechanism is provided.







Abstract
Three dinuclear coordination complexes generated from 1&#8208;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;((5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole (L), have been synthesized and characterized spectroscopically and structurally by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Reaction with iron(II) chloride and then copper(II) nitrate led to a co&#8208;crystal containing 78&#8201;% of [Cu(NO3)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(L&#8217;)]2 (C1) and 22&#8201;% of [Cu(NO3)(&#956;&#8208;NO3)(L&#8217;)]2 (C2), where L was oxidized to a new ligand L&#8217;. A mechanism is provided. Reaction with copper chloride led to the dinuclear complex [Cu(Cl)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(L)]2 (C3). The presence of N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure of C1 and C2, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl hydrogen bonding in the crystal structure of C3 led to supramolecular structures that were confirmed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. The ligands and their complexes were tested for free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power. The complex C1/C2 shows remarkable antioxidant activities as compared to the ligand L and reference compounds.

         <title>Extended Biocatalytic Halogenation Cascades Involving a Single&#8208;Polypeptide Regeneration System for Diffusible FADH2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional fusion enzyme with phosphite dehydrogenase and flavin reductase activities has been constructed and characterised. Co&#8208;expression of this single polypeptide regeneration system with tryptophan halogenases and carrier&#8208;free immobilisation in combiCLEAs facilitates preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of halotryptophan from a single cultivation. Extension of the catalytic cascade with a specific dioxygenase enables single cultivation one&#8208;pot synthesis of l&#8208;4&#8208;Cl&#8208;kynurenine on a preparative scale.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases have attracted increasing interest for aryl halogenation at unactivated C&#8722;H positions because they are characterised by high regioselectivity, while requiring only FADH2, halide salts, and O2. Their use in combined crosslinked enzyme aggregates (combiCLEAs) together with an NADH&#8208;dependent flavin reductase and an NADH&#8208;regeneration system for the preparative halogenation of tryptophan and indole derivatives has been previously described. However, multiple cultivations and protein purification steps are necessary for their production. We present a bifunctional regeneration enzyme for two&#8208;step catalytic flavin regeneration using phosphite as an inexpensive sacrificial substrate. This fusion protein proved amenable to co&#8208;expression with various flavin&#8208;dependent Trp&#8208;halogenases and enables carrier&#8208;free immobilisation as combiCLEAs from a single cultivation for protein production and the preparative synthesis of halotryptophan. The scalability of this system was demonstrated by fed&#8208;batch fermentation in bench&#8208;top bioreactors on a 2.5&#8197;L scale. Furthermore, the inclusion of a 6&#8208;halotryptophan&#8208;specific dioxygenase into the co&#8208;expression strain further converts the halogenation product to the kynurenine derivative. This reaction cascade enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of l&#8208;4&#8208;Cl&#8208;kynurenine and its brominated analogue on a preparative scale.

         <title>Bacterial J&#8208;Domains with C&#8208;Terminal Tags Contact the Substrate Binding Domain of DnaK and Sequester Chaperone Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208;proteins are cofactors that assist molecular chaperones in cellular protein folding. We have found that short C&#8208;terminal tags added to the N&#8208;terminal domains of J&#8208;proteins (J&#8208;domains) can promote interactions with multiple domains of DnaK, including the substrate binding domain. These modified J&#8208;domains are capable of disrupting DnaK chaperone activity in&#8197;vitro, and recovery following proteotoxic stress in cells. This work highlights the importance of C&#8208;terminal sequences in J&#8208;protein function.







Abstract
Functional interactions between the molecular chaperone DnaK and cofactor J&#8208;proteins (DnaJs), as well as their homologs, are crucial to the maintenance of proteostasis across cell types. In the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, DnaK&#8211;DnaJ interactions are essential for cell growth and represent potential targets for antibiotic or adjuvant development. While the N&#8208;terminal J&#8208;domains of J&#8208;proteins are known to form important contacts with DnaK, C&#8208;terminal domains have varied roles. Here, we have studied the effect of adding C&#8208;terminal tags to N&#8208;terminal J&#8208;domain truncations of mycobacterial DnaJ1 and DnaJ2 to promote additional interactions with DnaK. We found that His6 tags uniquely promote binding to additional sites in the substrate binding domain at the C&#8208;terminus of DnaK. Other C&#8208;terminal tags attached to J&#8208;domains, even peptides known to interact with DnaK, do not produce the same effects. Expression of C&#8208;terminally modified DnaJ1 or DnaJ2 J&#8208;domains in mycobacterial cells suppresses chaperone activity following proteotoxic stress, which is exaggerated in the presence of a small&#8208;molecule DnaK inhibitor.

     alt="Bacterial J-Domains with C-Terminal Tags Contact the Substrate Binding Domain of DnaK and Sequester Chaperone Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J-proteins are cofactors&lt;/b&gt; that assist molecular chaperones in cellular protein folding. We have found that short C-terminal tags added to the N-terminal domains of J-proteins (J-domains) can promote interactions with multiple domains of DnaK, including the substrate binding domain. These modified J-domains are capable of disrupting DnaK chaperone activity in&#8197;vitro, and recovery following proteotoxic stress in cells. This work highlights the importance of C-terminal sequences in J-protein function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional interactions between the molecular chaperone DnaK and cofactor J-proteins (DnaJs), as well as their homologs, are crucial to the maintenance of proteostasis across cell types. In the bacterial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, DnaK&#8211;DnaJ interactions are essential for cell growth and represent potential targets for antibiotic or adjuvant development. While the N-terminal J-domains of J-proteins are known to form important contacts with DnaK, C-terminal domains have varied roles. Here, we have studied the effect of adding C-terminal tags to N-terminal J-domain truncations of mycobacterial DnaJ1 and DnaJ2 to promote additional interactions with DnaK. We found that His&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; tags uniquely promote binding to additional sites in the substrate binding domain at the C-terminus of DnaK. Other C-terminal tags attached to J-domains, even peptides known to interact with DnaK, do not produce the same effects. Expression of C-terminally modified DnaJ1 or DnaJ2 J-domains in mycobacterial cells suppresses chaperone activity following proteotoxic stress, which is exaggerated in the presence of a small-molecule DnaK inhibitor. Hence, this work uncovers genetically encodable J-protein variants that may be used to study chaperone&#8211;cofactor interactions in other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Cytotoxicity and Induced Apoptosis in HeLa Cells by Co&#8208;loading Vitamin E Succinate and Curcumin in Nano&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2</title>

Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 has been co&#8208;loaded with &#945;&#8208;tocopheryl succinate (TOS) and curcumin (CCM). The incorporation of TOS into the structure of Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 improves cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction in the HeLa cell line.







Abstract
One of the strategies for improved therapeutic effects in cancer therapy is combination chemotherapy. In this study, a flexible nano&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2) was synthesized in a sonochemical process, then co&#8208;loaded with &#945;&#8208;tocopheryl succinate (TOS) and curcumin (CCM). The anticancer activity of co&#8208;loaded Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 (Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2/TOS@CCM) against the HeLa cells was compared with that of the single&#8208;loaded counterpart (Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2@CCM). MTT analysis indicates improved cytotoxicity of Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2/TOS@CCM. The data from the cell apoptosis assay indicated more apoptosis in the case of the co&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;MOF. This study indicates the positive effect of the presence of TOS on enhancing the anticancer effect of Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2@CCM to prepare a more efficient drug delivery nanosystem.

         <title>Engineering a Formate Dehydrogenase for NADPH Regeneration
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrated the generative process of a molecularly evolved formate dehydrogenase from Candida dubliniensis (CdFDH). By structure&#8208;based semi&#8208;rational design, a combinatorial mutant M4 showed dramatically enhanced reactivity toward NADP+. Then CdFDH&#8208;M4 was successfully applied to several representative NADPH&#8208;needed bio&#8208;transformations, with perfect total turnover numbers (ranging from 135 to 986) of cofactor with respect to NADP+ reduction.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) constitute major hydrogen donors for oxidative/reductive bio&#8208;transformations. NAD(P)H regeneration systems coupled with formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) represent a dreamful method. However, most of the native FDHs are NAD+&#8208;dependent and suffer from insufficient reactivity compared to other enzymatic tools, such as glucose dehydrogenase. An efficient and competitive NADP+&#8208;utilizing FDH necessitates the availability and robustness of NADPH regeneration systems. Herein, we report the engineering of a new FDH from Candida dubliniensis (CdFDH), which showed no strict NAD+ preference by a structure&#8208;guided rational/semi&#8208;rational design. A combinatorial mutant CdFDH&#8208;M4 (D197Q/Y198R/Q199N/A372S/K371T/&#9653;Q375/K167R/H16L/K159R) exhibited 75&#8208;fold intensification of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Moreover, CdFDH&#8208;M4 has been successfully employed in diverse asymmetric oxidative/reductive processes with cofactor total turnover numbers (TTNs) ranging from 135 to 986, making it potentially useful for NADPH&#8208;required biocatalytic transformations.

         <title>Quantitative Analysis of The High&#8208;Yield Hydrolysis of Kelp by Laminarinase and Alginate Lyase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laminarin and alginate in kelp are efficiently hydrolyzed by a binary combination of glycoside hydrolase family 55 (SactELam55A, Protein Data Bank 4pf0) and polysaccharide lyase family 18 (CaPL18&#8197;A, AlphaFold W7QSR3&#8208;F1). 1H&#8208;13C NMR spectroscopy shows the time course and end products of the hydrolysis reaction. The Laminaria digitata background image is from geograph.org.uk/photo/501243.







Abstract
Kelp is an abundant, farmable biomass&#8208;containing laminarin and alginate as major polysaccharides, providing an excellent model substrate to study their deconstruction by simple enzyme mixtures. Our previous study showed strong reactivity of the glycoside hydrolase family 55 during hydrolysis of purified laminarin, raising the question of its reactivity with intact kelp. In this study, we determined that a combination of a single glycoside hydrolase family 55 &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;exoglucanase with a broad&#8208;specificity alginate lyase from the polysaccharide lyase family 18 gives efficient hydrolysis of untreated kelp to a mixture of simple sugars, that is, glucose, gentiobiose, mannitol&#8208;end glucose, and mannuronic and guluronic acids and their soluble oligomers. Quantitative assignments from nanostructure initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) and 2D HSQC NMR spectroscopy and analysis of the reaction time&#8208;course are provided. The data suggest that binary combinations of enzymes targeted to the unique polysaccharide composition of marine biomass are sufficient to deconstruct kelp into soluble sugars for microbial fermentation.

         <title>On the Role of Temperature in the Depolymerization of PET by FAST&#8208;PETase: An Atomistic Point of View on Possible Active Site Pre&#8208;Organization and Substrate&#8208;Destabilization Effects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The source of improved catalytic efficiency of FAST&#8208;PETase, which differs from the wtPETase for five mutations, has been proposed based on molecular dynamics simulations in terms of active site pre&#8208;organization and ability to promote substrate destabilization at 50&#8201;&#176;C. Mutated residues and binding/active site amino acids can efficiently interact with PET substrate, thus promoting the catalysis.







Abstract
Enzyme FAST&#8208;PETase, recently obtained by a machine learning approach, can depolymerize poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a synthetic resin employed in plastics and in clothing fibers. Therefore it represents a promising solution for the recycling of PET&#8208;based materials. In this study, a model of PET was adopted to describe the substrate, and all&#8208;atoms classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on apo&#8208; and substrate&#8208;bound FAST&#8208;PETase were carried out at 30 and 50&#8201;&#176;C to provide atomistic details on the binding step of the catalytic cycle. Comparative analysis shed light on the interactions occurring between the FAST&#8208;PETase and 4PET at 50&#8201;&#176;C, the optimal working conditions of the enzyme. Pre&#8208;organization of the enzyme active and binding sites has been highlighted, while MD simulations of FAST&#8208;PETase:4PET pointed out the occurrence of solvent&#8208;inaccessible conformations of the substrate promoted by the enzyme. Indeed, neither of these conformations was observed during MD simulations of the substrate alone in solution performed at 30, 50 and 150&#8201;&#176;C. The analysis led us to propose that, at 50&#8201;&#176;C, the FAST&#8208;PETase is pre&#8208;organized to bind the PET and that the interactions occurring in the binding site can promote a more reactive conformation of PET substrate, thus enhancing the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

         <title>A Modular Chemistry Platform for the Development of a Cereblon E3 Ligase&#8208;Based Partial PROTAC Library</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular platform for the synthesis of ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;connected lenalidomide&#8208;derived CRBN E3 ligase ligands and a partial PROTAC library under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions is described. This method allows to systematically introduce linkers with subtle differences in length and orientation to examine their effect for the activity of PROTACs against any potential targets.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising therapeutic strategy to selectively promote the degradation of protein targets by exploiting the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. Among the limited number of E3 ligase ligands discovered for the PROTAC technology, ligands of cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase, such as pomalidomide, thalidomide, or lenalidomide, are the most frequently used for the development of PROTACs. Our group previously reported that a phenyl group could be tolerated on the C4&#8208;position of lenalidomide as the ligand of CRBN to develop PROTACs. Herein, we report a modular chemistry platform for the efficient attachment of various ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;substituted phenyls to the C4&#8208;position of the lenalidomide via Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which allows the systematic investigation of the linker effect for the development of PROTACs against any target. We examined the substrate scope by preparing twelve lenalidomide&#8208;derived CRBN E3 ligase ligands with different linkers.

         <title>Design of Cationic Lipids with Acetal Linkers: Conformational Preferences, Hydrolytic Stability, and High Drug&#8208;Loading Abilities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design, synthesis, and biophysical characterizations of a library of cationic lipid analogous containing an acetal residue in the linker region (CALs) are presented. These CALs could be conveniently prepared through a trans&#8208;acetalization protocol from commercially available precursors.







Abstract
Lipids are key constituents of numerous biomedical drug delivery technologies. Here, we present the design, synthesis and biophysical characterizations of a library of cationic lipids containing an acetal residue in their linker region. These cationic acetal lipids (CALs) were conveniently prepared through a trans&#8208;acetalization protocol from commercially available precursors. NMR studies highlighted the conformational rigidity at the acetal residue and the high hydrolytic stability of these CALs. Fluorescence anisotropy studies revealed that the CAL with a pyridinium headgroup (CAL1) formed highly cohesive vesicular aggregates in water. These structural and self&#8208;assembly features of the CAL1 allowed up to 196&#8201;% w/w loading of curcumin (Cur) as a representative hydrophobic drug. A reconstitutable formulation of Cur was obtained as a result, which could deliver the drug inside mammalian cells with very high efficiency. The hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility of CAL1 was significantly enhanced by creating a coating of polydopamine (PDA) onto its vesicular assemblies to produce hybrid lipid&#8208;polymer nanocapsules. This work demonstrates rapid access to the useful synthetic lipid formulations with high potential in drug and gene delivery applications.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Carboline Alkaloids Resist the Aggregation and Cytotoxicity of Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;carboline alkaloids harmine and harmol effectively impede the fibril formation and cytotoxicity of human islet amyloid polypeptide. Both of them change the morphology of peptide aggregates and upregulate the cell viability by reducing peptide oligomerization.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Carboline alkaloids have a variety of pharmacological activities, such as antitumor, antibiosis and antidiabetes. Harmine and harmol are two structurally similar &#946;&#8208;carbolines that occur in many medicinal plants. In this work, we chose harmine and harmol to impede the amyloid fibril formation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) associated with type&#8197;2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), by a series of physicochemical and biochemical methods. The results indicate that harmine and harmol effectively prevent peptide fibril formation and alleviate toxic oligomer species. In addition, both small molecules exhibit strong binding affinities with hIAPP mainly through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, thus reducing the cytotoxicity induced by hIAPP. Their distinct binding pattern with hIAPP is closely linked to the molecular configuration of the two small molecules, affecting their ability to impede peptide aggregation. The study is of great significance for the application and development of &#946;&#8208;carboline alkaloids against T2DM.

         <title>Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Smart Polymer Vectors for Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymerization enables translating nucleic acid templates into synthetic precision polymers displaying sensitivity to pH and redox changes. In return, the templated polymers may serve as smart gene delivery vehicles. The overall process amounts to therapeutic nucleic acids fabricating their own delivery vector, thus mimicking the dynamic templated self&#8208;assembly of viral capsids and opening new avenues in gene therapies.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are information&#8208;rich and readily available biomolecules, which can be used to template the polymerization of synthetic macromolecules. Here, we highlight the control over the size, composition, and sequence one can nowadays obtain by using this methodology. We also highlight how templated processes exploiting dynamic covalent polymerization can, in return, result in therapeutic nucleic acids fabricating their own dynamic delivery vector &#8211; a biomimicking concept that can provide original solutions for gene therapies.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Site Mutation Tunes Fluorescence and Chromophorylation of an Orange Fluorescent Cyanobacteriochrome
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phycoerythrobilin (PEB)&#8208;binding cyanobacteriochromes are a group of small and bright orange fluorescent proteins that offer new opportunities as biological reporters. Here, protein sequence truncation and single site mutations were used to tune fluorescence emission over 30&#8197;nm while improving non&#8208;native PEB binding to Slr1393g3 expressed in E. coli cells.







Abstract
Cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) cGMP&#8208;specific phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase, and FhlA (GAF) domains bind bilin cofactors to confer sensory wavelengths important for various cyanobacterial photosensory processes. Many isolated GAF domains autocatalytically bind bilins, including the third GAF domain of CBCR Slr1393 from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which binds phycoerythrobilin (PEB) to yield a bright orange fluorescent protein. Compared to green fluorescent proteins, the smaller size and lack of an oxygen requirement for fluorescence make Slr1393g3 a promising platform for new genetically encoded fluorescent tools. Slr1393g3, however, shows low PEB binding efficiency (chromophorylation) at ~3&#8201;% compared to total Slr1393g3 expressed in E. coli. Here we used site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and plasmid redesign methods to improve Slr1393g3&#8208;PEB binding and demonstrate its utility as a fluorescent marker in live cells. Mutation at a single site, Trp496, tuned the emission over ~30&#8197;nm, likely by shifting autoisomerization of PEB to phycourobilin (PUB). Plasmid modifications for tuning relative expression of Slr1393g3 and PEB synthesis enzymes also improved chromophorylation and moving from a dual to single plasmid system facilitated exploration of a range of mutants via site saturation mutagenesis and sequence truncation. Collectively, the PEB/PUB chromophorylation was raised up to a total of 23&#8201;% with combined sequence truncation and W496H mutation.

         <title>Heterologous Expression and Partial Characterization of a Putative Opine Dehydrogenase from a Metagenomic Sequence of Desulfohalobium retbaense</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gene for putative opine dehydrogenase was identified in Desulfohalobium retbaense and was successfully produced in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified and structurally and kinetically characterized. It showed high stability and activity in harsh conditions capable of forming secondary amines.







Abstract
The aim of this research was to prove the function of the putative opine dehydrogenase from Desulfohalobium retbaense and to characterize the enzyme in terms of functional and kinetic parameters. A putative opine dehydrogenase was identified from a metagenomic library by a sequence&#8208;based technique search of the metagenomic library, and afterward was successfully heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. In order to examine its potential for applications in the synthesis of secondary amines, first the substrate specificity of the enzyme towards different amino donors and amino acceptors was determined. The highest affinity was observed towards small amino acids, preferentially L&#8208;alanine, and when it comes to &#945;&#8208;keto acids, pyruvate proved to be a preferential amino acceptor. The highest activity was observed at pH&#8197;6.5 in the absence of salts. The enzyme showed remarkable stability in a wide range of experimental conditions, such as broad pH stability (from 6.0&#8211;11.0 after 30&#8197;min incubation in buffers at a certain pH), stability in the presence of NaCl up to 3.0&#8197;M for 24&#8197;h, it retained 80&#8201;% of the initial activity after 1&#8197;h incubation at 45&#8201;&#176;C, and 65&#8201;% of the initial activity after 24&#8197;h incubation in 30&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide.

         <title>Integrating Pillar[5]arene and BODIPY for a Supramolecular Nanoplatform To Achieve Synergistic Photodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative capability: A novel drug delivery system with synergistic photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy capability was built by integrating pillar[5]arene WP5 and BODIPY BDP&#8208;CN to construct nanocarrier to load hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug TPZ. The experimental results revealed that the excellent synergistic therapeutic effects can be attributed to the cooperation of BDP&#8208;CN and TPZ.







Abstract
BODIPY photosensitizers have been integrated with a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug to achieve synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. A novel BODIPY derivative BDP&#8208;CN was designed and synthesized. It had two cyano groups to make it complex well with a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene. Their association constant was calculated to be (6.8&#177;0.9)&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. After self&#8208;assembly in water, regular spherical nanocarriers can be formed; these were used to encapsulate the hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ). BDP&#8208;CN displayed excellent photodynamic activity to complete PDT. In this process, O2 can be continuously consumed to activate TPZ to allow it to be converted to a benzotriazinyl (BTZ) radical with high cytotoxicity to complete chemotherapy. As a result, the formed nanoparticles showed excellent synergistic photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy efficacy. The synergistic therapy mechanism is discussed in detail.

         <title>Noncovalent Association Thermodynamics of Turn&#8208;On Fluorescent Probes with Human Serum Albumin: Dual&#8208;Concentration Ratio Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;concentration ratio method is developed for quantifying the binding affinity of turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes (L) and a given protein (P). Only two samples at different [L]0/[protein]0 are required. It is an easy way to greatly reduce the amounts of fluorescent probes and proteins, as well as the acquisition time.







Abstract
Efficient quantification of the affinity of a drug and the targeted protein is critical for strategic drug design. Among the various molecules, turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes are the most promising signal transducers to reveal the binding strength and site&#8208;specificity of designed drugs. However, the conventional method of measuring the binding ability of turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes by using the fractional occupancy under the law of mass action is time&#8208;consuming and a massive sample is required. Here, we report a new method, called dual&#8208;concentration ratio method, for quantifying the binding affinity of fluorescent probes and human serum albumin (HSA). Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity ratios of a one&#8208;to&#8208;one complex (L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HSA) for a turn&#8208;on fluorescent probe (L), e.&#8201;g., ThT (thioflavin T) or DG (dansylglycine), with HSA at two different values of [L]0/[HSA]0 under the constraint [HSA]0&gt;[L]0 were collected. The van't Hoff analysis on these association constants further resulted in the thermodynamic properties. Since only two samples at different [L]0/[HSA]0 are required without the need of [L]0/[HSA]0 at a wide range, the dual&#8208;concentration ratio method is an easy way to greatly reduce the amounts of fluorescent probes and proteins, as well as the acquisition time.

         <title>Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl Group&#8208;Derived Capmatinib: Synthesis, Biological Evaluation and Its Application in 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine atoms were introduced on Capmatinib to obtain a targeted 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, 9F&#8208;CAP, its imaging concentration limit was found to be 25&#8197;mM (FLASH sequence). Molecular docking simulation, SPR (KD=40.7&#8197;&#956;M), half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (IC50, 168&#8197;nM), Annexin V, and cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that the 9F&#8208;CAP targeted cMET protein.







Abstract
Capmatinib is an FDA&#8208;approved drug to treat metastatic non&#8208;small cell lung cancer with MET&#8208;exon 14 skipping. Herein, the perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group, which possesses nine chemically identical fluorine atoms, was introduced on Capmatinib to afford a targeted 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group&#8208;derived Capmatinib (9F&#8208;CAP). The 19F MRI concentration limit was found to be 25&#8197;mM in FLASH sequence. Molecular docking simulation, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (with a Kd of 40.7&#8197;&#956;M), half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (with a IC50 of 168&#8197;nM), Annexin V, and cytotoxicity assays jointly demonstrated that the 9F&#8208;CAP targeted cMET protein specifically. Therefore, the targeted imaging capability of 9F&#8208;CAP is of great significance for the preoperative diagnosis of specific cancers.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins Bearing Base&#8208;Labile Post&#8208;Translational Modifications: Evolution of the Methods in Four Decades</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;palmitoylation on Cys residue and O&#8208;acetylation on Ser/Thr residues are base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications. Their lability to bases and nucleophiles makes them challenging synthetic targets. In this review, we summarized the efforts toward their preparation during the past 40&#8197;years, with the focus on the evolution of synthetic methods.







Abstract
The S&#8208;palmitoylation on Cys residue and O&#8208;acetylation on Ser/Thr residues are two types of base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in cells. The lability of these PTMs to bases and nucleophiles makes the peptides/proteins bearing S&#8208;palmitoyl or O&#8208;acetyl groups challenging synthetic targets, which cannot be prepared via the standard Fmoc&#8208;SPPS and native chemical ligation. In this review, we summarized the efforts towards their preparation in the past 40&#8197;years, with the focus on the evolution of synthetic methods.

The lability of these PTMs to bases and nucleophiles makes the peptides/proteins bearing &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-palmitoyl or &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl groups challenging synthetic targets, which cannot be prepared via the standard Fmoc-SPPS and native chemical ligation. In this review, we summarized the efforts towards their preparation in the past 40&#8197;years, with the focus on the evolution of synthetic methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;On&#8208;Off&#8221; Switching of Functional Guest Molecules via Exchange of Natural Product Solubilizing Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional guest molecules can be dissolved in water using natural products as host solubilizing agents and transferred between host solubilizing agents. Owing to the different functions of these host&#8208;guest complexes, the transfer of guest molecules is accompanied by the &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching of functions such as fluorescence emission, singlet oxygen generation ability, and photodynamic activity.







Abstract
For the development of delivery systems, the solubilization of hydrophobic guest molecules in water is an important yet challenging task. This can be achieved by preparing stable aqueous solutions with a high concentration of guest molecules using a natural product as a solubilizing agent and a mechanochemical high&#8208;speed vibration milling apparatus as a solubilizing method. Various solubilizing agent&#8208;guest molecule complexes can be obtained via the exchange between solubilizing agents, which enables the &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching of the properties of functional guest molecules, such as fluorescence intensity, and photodynamic activity. In the exchange method, guest molecules can transfer into cell membranes such as lysosomes and exosomes. Therefore, the exchange method of the solubilizing agents not only creates novel solubilizing agent&#8208;guest molecule complexes but also is applied to drug delivery systems.

         <title>Titin UN2A Acts as a Stable, Non&#8208;Polymorphic Scaffold in its Binding to CARP</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;distance restraints obtained by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed that the &#8220;unique N2A&#8221; (UN2A) domain of the sarcomeric protein titin shows a defined and structured three&#8208;helix bundle and preserves this conformation upon binding of the muscle stress response factor CARP (cardiac ankyrin repeat protein).







Abstract
The N2A segment of titin functions as a pivotal hub for signal transduction and interacts with various proteins involved in structural support, chaperone activities, and transcriptional regulation. Notably, the &#8220;unique N2A&#8221; (UN2A) subdomain has been shown to interact with the stress&#8208;regulated cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), which contributes to the regulation of sarcomeric stiffness. Previously, the UN2A domain's three&#8208;dimensional structure was modelled based on its secondary structure content identified by NMR spectroscopy, considering the domain in isolation. In this study, we report experimental long&#8208;range distance distributions by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy between the three helixes within the UN2A domain linked to the immunoglobulin domain I81 in the presence and absence of CARP. The data confirm the central three&#8208;helix bundle fold of UN2A and show that this adopts a compact and stable conformation in absence of CARP. After binding to CARP, no significant conformational change was observed, suggesting that the UN2A domain retains its structure upon binding to CARP thereby, mediating the interaction approximately as a rigid&#8208;body.

         <title>Platinum and Palladium Organometallic Compounds: Disrupting the Ergosterol Pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo compounds specifically target the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi. These compounds effectively inhibit two key enzymes involved in the pathway, namely lanosterol 14&#8208;&#945; demethylase (CYP51) and phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK). As a result of this inhibition, treated parasites exhibit a reduced level of ergosterol, which is essential for the structure and function of their membranes.







Abstract
Current treatment for Chagas&#8217; disease is based on two drugs, Nifurtimox and Benznidazol, which have limitations that reduce the effectiveness and continuity of treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new, safe and effective drugs. In previous work, two new metal&#8208;based compounds with trypanocidal activity, Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo, were fully characterized. To unravel the mechanism of action of these two analogous metal&#8208;based drugs, high&#8208;throughput omics studies were performed. A multimodal mechanism of action was postulated with several candidates as molecular targets. In this work, we validated the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway as a target for these compounds through the determination of sterol levels by HPLC in treated parasites. To understand the molecular level at which these compounds participate, two enzymes that met eligibility criteria at different levels were selected for further studies: phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) and lanosterol 14&#8208;&#945; demethylase (CYP51). Molecular docking processes were carried out to search for potential sites of interaction for both enzymes. To validate these candidates, a gain&#8208;of&#8208;function strategy was used through the generation of overexpressing PMK and CYP51 parasites. Results here presented confirm that the mechanism of action of Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo compounds involves the inhibition of both enzymes.

         <title>Small Molecule AIEgens for Illuminating Sub&#8208;Cellular Endoplasmic Reticulum, Mitochondria, and Lysosomes
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly substituted small molecule modular oxazoles having dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, aggregated in water to instigate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties through restriction in motion leading to illuminate sub&#8208;cellular ER, mitochondria and lysosomes.







Abstract
Organelles are the working hubs of the cells. Hence, visualizing these organelles inside the cells is highly important for understanding their roles in pathological states and development of therapeutic strategies. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly substituted oxazoles with modular scaffolds (AIE&#8208;ER, AIE&#8208;Mito, and AIE&#8208;Lyso), which can home into endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and lysosomes inside the cells. These oxazoles showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water and in the solid state due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, which was confirmed by pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence studies followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Confocal laser scanning microscopy studies revealed that AIE&#8208;ER, AIE&#8208;Mito, and AIE&#8208;Lyso efficiently homed into ER, mitochondria and lysosomes, respectively, in the HeLa cervical cancer cells and non&#8208;cancerous human retinal pigment epithelial RPE&#8208;1 cells within 3&#8197;h without showing any toxicity to the cells with high sub&#8208;cellular photostability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of highly substituted oxazole&#8208;based small molecule AIEgens for organelle imaging. We anticipate these novel AIEgens have promise to image sub&#8208;cellular organelles in different diseased states as well as understanding the inter&#8208;organelle interactions towards the development of novel therapeutics.

         <title>Towards Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Rhenium(I) Binuclear Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of a bimetallic complex, which combines the known photophysical properties of a rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex and a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex and that could act as a PS for PDT, is described.







Abstract
The search for new metal&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) for anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a fast&#8208;developing field of research. Knowing that polymetallic complexes bear a high potential as PDT PSs, in this study, we aimed at combining the known photophysical properties of a rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex and a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex to prepare a ruthenium&#8208;rhenium binuclear complex that could act as a PS for anticancer PDT. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of such a system and discuss its stability in aqueous solution. In addition, one of our complexes prepared, which localized in mitochondria, was found to have some degree of selectivity towards two types of cancerous cells: human lung carcinoma A549 and human colon colorectal adenocarcinoma HT29, with interesting photo&#8208;index (PI) values of 135.1 and 256.4, respectively, compared to noncancerous retinal pigment epithelium RPE1 cells (22.4).

         <title>Prevention of Swelling Phenomenon of Alginate Beads To Improve the Stability and Recyclability of Encapsulated Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new strategy to avoid alginate bead breakage by inhibiting the loss of calcium ions from the biocatalyst. Several techniques were employed to investigate how the addition of Ca2+ ions to buffer solutions affected their structure. Optimized biocatalyst exhibits significant improvements in terms of recycling, storage, and thermal stability.







Abstract
Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase (HLADH) has been immobilized on calcium&#8208;alginate beads and used for both oxidation and reduction reactions. To avoid swelling of the beads and their subsequent breakage, calcium ions were added to both reaction and storage solutions, allowing the beads to maintain the initial structural features. The techniques used for this purpose revealed that 2&#8197;mM Ca2+ is the optimal concentration, which does not significantly change the weight of the beads, the amount of water in them, and their external and internal structure. The optimized experimental procedure has been used to verify the properties of the enzyme in terms of reusability, storage, and thermal stability. The addition of calcium ions allows the enzyme to retain more than 80&#8201;% of its initial activity for fourteen cycles and approximately 50&#8201;% at the twentieth cycle. Moreover, when the biocatalyst has been stored in a buffer solution containing 2&#8197;mM Ca2+, the retention of enzyme activity after 30&#8197;days was 100&#8201;%, compared to that measured before incubation. The encapsulated enzyme exhibits greater thermal stability than free HLADH up to at least 60&#8201;&#176;C, preventing dimer dissociation into the two subunits.

         <title>Co&#8208;Immobilization of a Multi&#8208;Enzyme Cascade: (S)&#8208;Selective Amine Transaminases, l&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase and Catalase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;immobilization of hcLAAO4, hCAT and the (S)&#8208;selective ATA from Vibrio fluvialis (ATA&#8208;Vfl) resulted in faster reactions and allowed further reduction of the co&#8208;substrate amount to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% compared to the soluble enzyme cascade. An engineered ATA&#8208;Vfl&#8208;8M was used in the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade to produce an apremilast&#8208;intermediate.







Abstract
An enzyme cascade was established previously consisting of a recycling system with an l&#8208;amino acid oxidase (hcLAAO4) and a catalase (hCAT) for different &#945;&#8208;keto acid co&#8208;substrates of (S)&#8208;selective amine transaminases (ATAs) in kinetic resolutions of racemic amines. Only 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the co&#8208;substrate was required and l&#8208;amino acids instead of &#945;&#8208;keto acids could be applied. However, soluble enzymes cannot be reused easily. Immobilization of hcLAAO4, hCAT and the (S)&#8208;selective ATA from Vibrio fluvialis (ATA&#8208;Vfl) was addressed here. Immobilization of the enzymes together rather than on separate beads showed higher reaction rates most likely due to fast co&#8208;substrate channeling between ATA&#8208;Vfl and hcLAAO4 due to their close proximity. Co&#8208;immobilization allowed further reduction of the co&#8208;substrate amount to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% most likely due to a more efficient H2O2&#8208;removal caused by the stabilized hCAT and its proximity to hcLAAO4. Finally, the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade was reused in 3 cycles of preparative kinetic resolutions to produce (R)&#8208;1&#8208;PEA with high enantiomeric purity (97.3&#8201;%ee). Further recycling was inefficient due to the instability of ATA&#8208;Vfl, while hcLAAO4 and hCAT revealed high stability. An engineered ATA&#8208;Vfl&#8208;8M was used in the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade to produce (R)&#8208;1&#8208;(3&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)ethanamine, an apremilast&#8208;intermediate, with a 1,000 fold lower input of the co&#8208;substrate.

         <title>Molecular Highway Patrol for Ribosome Collisions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ribosome collisions as the recognition platform of translation problems caused by various factors represents a cornerstone in the field of translation surveillance. We summarize our current knowledge about the pathways that target collided ribosomes. These pathways do so directly &#8208; by removing or recycling ribosomes, peptides, and mRNA &#8208; or indirectly &#8208; by modulating translation and cellular fate.







Abstract
During translation, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are decoded by ribosomes which can stall for various reasons. These include chemical damage, codon composition, starvation, or translation inhibition. Trailing ribosomes can collide with stalled ribosomes, potentially leading to dysfunctional or toxic proteins. Such aberrant proteins can form aggregates and favor diseases, especially neurodegeneration. To prevent this, both eukaryotes and bacteria have evolved different pathways to remove faulty nascent peptides, mRNAs and defective ribosomes from the collided complex. In eukaryotes, ubiquitin ligases play central roles in triggering downstream responses and several complexes have been characterized that split affected ribosomes and facilitate degradation of the various components. As collided ribosomes signal translation stress to affected cells, in eukaryotes additional stress response pathways are triggered when collisions are sensed. These pathways inhibit translation and modulate cell survival and immune responses. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge about rescue and stress response pathways triggered by ribosome collisions.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific and Multiple Fluorogenic Metabolic Glycan Labeling and Glycoproteomic Profiling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a multi&#8208;fluorescent MGL strategy combining ZIC&#8208;cHILIC StageTip enrichment and subsequent LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis for live cell glycan labeling and glycoprotein profiling in a single experiment. This approach enables the simultaneous site&#8208;specific labeling of cell&#8208;surface and intracellular sialylated glycoconjugates, global profiling, and identification of sialylated glycoproteins and glycans.







Abstract
Multicolor labeling for monitoring the intracellular localization of the same target type in the native environment using chemical fluorescent dyes is a challenging task. This approach requires both bioorthogonal and biocompatible ligations with an excellent fluorescence signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Here, we present a metabolic glycan labeling technique that uses homemade fluorogenic dyes to investigate glycosylation patterns in live cells. These dyes allowed us to demonstrate rapid and efficient simultaneous multilabeling of glycoconjugates with minimum fluorescence noise. Our results demonstrate that this approach is capable of not only probing sialylation and GlcNAcylation in cells but also specifically labeling the cell&#8208;surface and intracellular sialylated glycoconjugates in live cells. In particular, we performed site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;channel fluorescence imaging of extra and intracellular sialylated glycans in HeLa and PC9 cancer cells as well as identified fluorescently labeled sialylated glycoproteins and glycans by a direct enrichment approach combined with an MS&#8208;based proteomic analysis in the same experiment. In conclusion, this study provides multilabeling tools in cellular systems for simultaneous site&#8208;specific glycan imaging and glycoproteomic analysis to study potential cancer&#8208; and disease&#8208;associated glycoconjugates.

         <title>Tuning the Solution Self&#8208;Assembly of a Peptide&#8208;PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) Conjugate with &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on the aqueous solution self&#8208;assembly of peptide&#8208;polymer conjugate YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3K is examined. Cryo&#8208;TEM and SAXS show that the conjugate self&#8208;assembles into &#946;&#8208;sheet fibrils in aqueous solution, but complexation with &#945;CD leads to free&#8208;floating nanosheets in aqueous solution (with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure). The transition from fibrils to nanosheets is driven by an increase in the number of &#945;CD molecules threaded on the PEG chains, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cyclodextrins are saccharide ring&#8201;molecules which act as host cavities that can encapsulate small guest molecules or thread polymer chains. We investigate the influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on the aqueous solution self&#8208;assembly of a peptide&#8208;polymer conjugate YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3K previously studied by our group [Castelletto et&#8197;al., Polym. Chem., 2010, 1, 453&#8211;459]. This conjugate comprises a designed amyloid&#8208;forming peptide YYKLVFF that contains the KLVFF sequence from Amyloid &#946; peptide, A&#946;16&#8208;20, along with two aromatic tyrosine residues to enhance hydrophobicity, as well as polyethylene glycol PEG with molar mass 3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The conjugate self&#8208;assembles into &#946;&#8208;sheet fibrils in aqueous solution. Here we show that complexation with &#945;CD instead generates free&#8208;floating nanosheets in aqueous solution (with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure). The nanosheets comprise a bilayer with a hydrophobic peptide core and highly swollen PEG outer layers. The transition from fibrils to nanosheets is driven by an increase in the number of &#945;CD molecules threaded on the PEG chains, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These findings point to the use of cyclodextrin additives as a powerful means to tune the solution self&#8208;assembly in peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates and potentially other polymer/biomolecular hybrids.

         <title>DNA Nanobarrel&#8208;Based Drug Delivery for Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubixin (DOX) delivery system was prepared, including Tn&#8208;PTX with different length of ssDNA tail (polythymine, Tn) and the DNA origami&#8208;based PTX\DOX\MUC&#8208;1 aptamer nanobarrel. In addition, the drug release, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake behaviors of Tn&#8208;PTX and nanobarrel in&#8197;vitro were evaluated.







Abstract
Co&#8208;delivery of anticancer drugs and target agents by endogenous materials is an inevitable approach towards targeted and synergistic therapy. Employing DNA base pair complementarities, DNA nanotechnology exploits a unique nanostructuring method and has demonstrated its capacity for nanoscale positioning and templated assembly. Moreover, the water solubility, biocompatibility, and modifiability render DNA structure suitable candidate for drug delivery applications. We here report single&#8208;stranded DNA tail conjugated antitumor drug paclitaxel (PTX), and the co&#8208;delivery of PTX, doxorubicin and targeting agent mucin 1 (MUC&#8208;1) aptamer on a DNA nanobarrel carrier. We investigated the effect of tail lengths on drug release efficiencies and dual drug codelivery&#8208;enabled cytotoxicity. Owing to the rapidly developing field of structural DNA nanotechnology, functional DNA&#8208;based drug delivery is promising to achieve clinical therapeutic applications.

         <title>Failure, Success, and Future Direction of Alzheimer Drugs Targeting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Cascade: Pros and Cons of Chemical and Biological Modalities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper examines immunotherapeutic and chemical drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and suggests a drug discovery strategy to overcome the obstacles in chemical&#8208;driven drug discovery. We evaluate the prospects of an alternative approach in chemical&#8208;based drug development that will help bypass the difficulties of chemical&#8208;driven drug development, capable of amyloid clearance just as immunotherapy candidates.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and has become a health concern worldwide urging for an effective therapeutic. The amyloid hypothesis, currently the most pursued basis of AD drug discovery, points the cause of AD to abnormal production and ineffective removal of pathogenic aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;). AD therapeutic research has been focused on targeting different species of A&#946; in the amyloidogenic process to control A&#946; content and recover cognitive decline. Among the different processes targeted, the clearance mechanism has been found to be the most effective, supported by the recent clinical approval of an A&#946;&#8208;targeting immunotherapeutic drug which significantly slowed cognitive decline. Although the current AD drug discovery field is extensively researching immunotherapeutic drugs, there are numerous properties of immunotherapy in need of improvements that could be overcome by an equally performing chemical drug. Here, we review chemical and immunotherapy drug candidates, based on their mechanism of modulating the amyloid cascade, selected from the AlzForum database. Through this review, we aim to summarize and evaluate the prospect of A&#946;&#8208;targeting chemical drugs.

         <title>Development and Characterization of Selective FAK Inhibitors and PROTACs with In Vivo Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PROteolysis&#8208;TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are a class of molecules that eliminate proteins through the cell's degradation machinery. Here, to degrade an attractive cancer drug target known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the Nabet and Jiang labs developed a novel FAK PROTAC (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146). They show that BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 triggers rapid and specific FAK degradation in cancer cells and in mouse models, and induces improved biological responses compared to small molecule inhibitors. The cover picture depicts a firefly (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146) luring a moth (FAK) to the carnivorous plant (proteasome) and was designed by DrawImpacts. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Jiang, B. Nabet et al.

         <title>Protein Modification via Nitrile Oxide&#8722;Dehydroalanine Cycloaddition: Formation of Isoxazoline Ring on the Protein Backbone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile Oxide&#8722;Dehydroalanine Cycloaddition is a bioconjugation strategy between dehydroalanine&#8208;containing proteins and nitrile oxides, remarkably, in fully aqueous&#8208;buffered systems without an additional catalyst. This novel method of chemical protein modification forms an isoxazoline ring enhancing the diversity of protein function and structure. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction adds a fluorescent label to the protein for applications like live&#8208;cell imaging and apoptosis detection. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Phanumartwiwath et al.

         <title>3&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;Methoxypyrazines: Overview of Their Occurrence, Biosynthesis and Distribution in Edible Plants</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazines are ubiquitous in nature and biosynthesized by microorganisms, insects, and plants. Especially 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs) play a key role as important aroma compounds in foods. Recently, in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable isotope labeled compounds revealed l&#8208;leucine and l&#8208;serine as important precursors for IBMP. This discovery gave evidence for a metabolic interface between the MP&#8208;biosynthesis and photorespiration.







Abstract
Pyrazines are ubiquitous in nature &#8211; biosynthesized by microorganisms, insects, and plants. Due to their great structural diversity, they own manifold biological functions. Alkyl&#8208; and alkoxypyrazines for instance play a key role as semiochemicals, but also as important aroma compounds in foods. Especially 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs) have been of great research interest. MPs are associated with green and earthy attributes. They are responsible for the distinctive aroma properties of numerous vegetables. Moreover, they have a strong influence on the aroma of wines, in which they are primarily grape&#8208;derived. Over the years various methods have been developed and implemented to analyse the distribution of MPs in plants. In addition, the biosynthetic pathway of MPs has always been of particular interest. Different pathways and precursors have been proposed and controversially discussed in the literature. While the identification of genes encoding O&#8208;methyltransferases gave important insights into the last step of MP&#8208;biosynthesis, earlier biosynthetic steps and precursors remained unknown. It was not until 2022 that in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable isotope labeled compounds revealed l&#8208;leucine and l&#8208;serine as important precursors for IBMP. This discovery gave evidence for a metabolic interface between the MP&#8208;biosynthesis and photorespiration.

         <title>Delivering on Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Degradation Using Chemically Tailored PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pro&#8208;PROTAC, with precise and selective modulation within specific cell populations, would greatly enhance the target protein degradation process in a controllable manner. The development of such innovative chemistry holds significant promise for advancing the field of targeted protein degradation.







Abstract
PROTACs (Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras) have emerged as a groundbreaking class of chemical tools that facilitate the degradation of target proteins by leveraging the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS). However, the effective utilization of PROTACs in chemical biology studies and therapeutics encounters significant challenges when it comes to achieving cell&#8208;selective protein degradation and in&#8197;vivo applications. This review article aims to shed light on recent advancements in the development of Pro&#8208;PROTACs, which exhibit controlled protein degradation capabilities in response to external stimuli or disease&#8208;related endogenous biochemical signals. The article delves into the specific chemical strategies employed to regulate the interaction between PROTACs and E3 ubiquitin ligases or target proteins. These strategies enable spatial and temporal control over the protein degradation potential of Pro&#8208;PROTACs. Furthermore, the review summarizes recent investigations regarding the delivery of PROTACs using biodegradable nanoparticles for in&#8197;vivo applications and targeted protein degradation. Such delivery systems hold great promise for enabling efficient and selective protein degradation in&#8197;vivo. Lastly, the article provides a perspective on the future design of multifunctional PROTACs and their intracellular delivery mechanisms, with a particular focus on achieving cell&#8208;selective protein degradation.

         <title>Nucleoside&#8208;driven specificity of DNA Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied adenosine binding specificities of two bacterial&#160;DNA methyltransferases&#160;Taq methyltransferase (M.TaqI), and HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI). While these DNA methyltransferases have similar cofactor binding pocket interactions, experimental data showed different specificity for novel cofactors&#160;((SNM) (S&#8208;guanosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SGM), S&#8208;cytidyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SCM), S&#8208;uridyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SUM)).Protein dynamics corroborate the experimental data on the cofactor specificities. For M.TaqI the specificity for S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) is governed by the tight binding on the nucleoside part of the cofactor, while for M.HhaI the degree of freedom of the nucleoside chain allows the acceptance of other bases. The experimental data proves a catalytically productive methylation by M.HhaI binding pocket for all the&#160;SNM (S&#8208;nucleobase&#8208;L&#8208;methionine).&#160;Our results suggest a new route for successful design of unnatural SNM analogues for methyltransferases as a tool for cofactor engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Short Peptides with Perfluoroalkyl Side Chains and Evaluation of Their Cellular Uptake Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptides bearing RF&#8208;AAs were synthesized and the hydrophilic dye Alexa Fluor 647 (AF) was employed as a hydrophilic model cargo. AF&#8208;RF&#8208;tripeptides formed nanoparticles in aqueous media and were taken up by cells. Both the length of the RF group and the absolute configuration of the RF&#8208;AAs significantly affected the size of the nanoparticles, which is an important factor for efficient cellular uptake by endocytosis.







Abstract
With an increasing demand for macromolecular biotherapeutics, the issue of their poor cell&#8208;penetrating abilities requires viable and relevant solutions. Herein, we report tripeptides bearing an amino acid with a perfluoroalkyl (RF) group adjacent to the &#945;&#8208;carbon. RF&#8208;containing tripeptides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to transport a conjugated hydrophilic dye (Alexa Fluor 647) into the cells. RF&#8208;containing tripeptides with the fluorophore showed high cellular uptake efficiency and none of them were cytotoxic. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the absolute configuration of perfluoroalkylated amino acids (RF&#8208;AAs) affects not only nanoparticle formation but also the cell permeability of the tripeptides. These novel RF&#8208;containing tripeptides are potentially useful as short and noncationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs).

         <title>A degron blocking strategy towards improved CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTAC selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules inducing protein degradation are important pharmacological tools to interrogate complex biology and are rapidly translating into clinical agents. However, to fully realise the potential of these molecules, selectivity remains a limiting challenge. Herein, we addressed the issue of selectivity in the design of CRL4CRBN recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). Thalidomide derivatives used to generate CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTACs have well described intrinsic monovalent degradation profiles by inducing the recruitment of neo&#8208;substrates such as GSPT1, Ikaros and Aiolos. We leveraged structural insights from known CRL4CRBN neo&#8208;substrates to attenuate and indeed remove this monovalent degradation function in well&#8208;known CRL4CRBN molecular glues degraders, namely CC&#8208;885 and Pomalidomide. We then applied these design principles on a previously published BRD9 PROTAC (dBRD9&#8208;A) and generated an analogue with improved selectivity profile. Finally, we implemented a computational modelling pipeline to show that our degron blocking design does not impact PROTAC induced ternary complex formation. We believe that the tools and principles presented in this work will be valuable to support the development of targeted protein degradation.</dc:description>
