         <title>Illuminating the Path to Enhanced Bioimaging by Phosphole&#8208;based Fluorophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new class of phosphole&#8208;based fluorophores for advanced biological research. These fluorophores outperform existing options, are easily synthesized, and can be coupled to peptides with high selectivity. Labeled peptides maintain stability and low toxicity while exhibiting receptor activation, making them ideal for biolabeling. In fluorescence microscopy, these fluorophores remain visible at low concentrations without bleaching.







Abstract
As the research of biological systems becomes increasingly complex, there is a growing demand for fluorophores with a diverse range of wavelengths. In this study, we introduce phosphole&#8208;based fluorophores that surpass existing options like dansyl chloride. The reactive S&#8722;Cl bond in chlorosulfonylimino&#8208;5&#8208;phenylphosphole derivatives allows rapid and direct coupling to peptides making the fluorophores easily introducible to peptides. This coupling process occurs under mild conditions, demonstrated for [F7,P34]&#8208;NPY and its shorter analogues. Peptides linked with our fluorophores exhibit similar receptor activation to the control peptide, while maintaining high stability and low toxicity, making them ideal biolabeling reagents. In fluorescence microscopy experiments, they can be easily visualized even at low concentrations, without suffering from the typical issue of bleaching. These phosphole&#8208;based fluorophores represent a significant leap forward in the field. Their versatility, ease of modification, superior performance, and applicability in biological labeling make them a promising choice for researchers seeking advanced tools to unravel the details of complex biological systems.

         <title>Amylose Dimerization in Solution Can Be Studied Using a Model System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amylose forms left&#8208;handed double helices in the solid state, but dimerization in solution has never been directly detected. We show that sufficiently long &#945;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucans with an aromatic label at the reducing&#8208;end form dimers in aqueous solution that are observable using NMR spectroscopy. Using these model compounds, we could investigate the thermodynamics of dimerization and quantify the &#8216;per glucose&#8217; interactions between amylose chains in water.







Abstract
Amylose, the linear polymer of &#945;&#8208;1,4&#8208;linked glucopyranose units, is known to crystallize as a parallel double helix, but evidence of this duplex forming in solution has remained elusive for decades. We show how the dimerization of short amylose chains can be detected in solution using NMR spectroscopy when the glucans are labeled at the reducing&#8208;end with an aromatic moiety that overcomes chemical shift degeneracy leading to distinct signals for the single&#8208;stranded and duplex amylose. A set of &#945;&#8208;1,4 glucans with varying lengths of 6, 12, 18, and 22 glucose units and a 4&#8208;aminobenzamide label were synthesized, enabling the first systematic thermodynamic study of the association of amylose in solution. The dimerization is enthalpically driven, entropically unfavorable and beyond a minimum length of 12, each additional pair of glucose residues stabilizes the duplex by 0.85&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This fundamental knowledge provides a basis for a quantitative understanding of starch structure, gelation and enzymatic digestion, and lays the foundations for the strategic use of &#945;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucans in the development of self&#8208;assembled materials.

         <title>The Biological Activities of Polyether Ionophore Antibiotic Routiennocin is Independent of Absolute Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic polyether ionophores (CPIs) are among the most prevalent agricultural antibiotics (notably in the US) and these compounds have been in use for decades. The potential to reposition CPIs beyond veterinary use, e.g. through chemical modifications to enhance their selectivity window, is an exciting challenge and opportunity, considering their general resilience towards resistance development. Given the very large societal impact of these somewhat controversial compounds, it is surprising that many aspects of their mechanisms and activities in cells remain unclear. Here, we report comparative biological activities of the CPI routiennocin and two stereoisomers, including its enantiomer. We used an efficient convergent synthesis strategy to access the compounds and conducted a broad survey of antibacterial activities against planktonic cells and biofilms as well as the compounds&#8217; effects on mammalian cells, the latter assessed both via standard cell viability assays and broad morphological profiling. Interestingly, similar bioactivity of the enantiomeric pair was observed across all assays, strongly suggesting that chiral interactions do not play a decisive role in the mode of action. Overall, our findings are consistent with a mechanistic model involving highly dynamic behaviour of CPIs in biological membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling HDAC Selectivity for Erasing Acetyl Mark on Lys&#8208;5&#8201;of Histone H2B</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mark and Erase: Acetyl marks on specific Lysine residues of histones in nucleosomes are installed by HATs and erased by HDACs. We have assembled designer nucleosomes embedded with semisynthetic H2B carrying a defined acetyl mark to delineate its specific eraser human HDACs. Our studies have led to the identification of preferred erasers of acetyl mark at Lys&#8208;5 in H2B.







Abstract
The reversible acetylation of specific Lysine residues of histones plays crucial role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin activity. Importantly, perturbations of acetylation&#8208;deacetylation dynamics have important implications for cancer and neurological disorders. There are 18 human HDACs including sirtuins. The site&#8208;selective acetyl eraser specificity of HDACs is poorly defined. Deciphering the site specificity preference of HDACs from a gamut of lysine in histones may be critical for targeted inhibitor development and delineation of regulatory mechanisms associated with chromatin. Here, we have interrogated the propensity of HDACs to erase acetyl mark at Lys&#8208;5 of H2B namely, H2BK5Ac engineered by a peptide ligation reaction catalyzed by transpeptidase sortase. HDACs and Sirtuins were individually over&#8208;expressed in HEK293 cells and the deacetylation propensity of respective cell lysates was evaluated against H2BK5Ac for initial screening of potential acetyl erasers. This screen indicated HDAC1 as the prime eraser of acetyl mark in H2BK5Ac. The propensity of HDAC1 to erase acetyl mark of H2BK5Ac was further probed using semisynthetic designer nucleosomes with whole cell lysates, recombinant enzyme, and specific inhibitors. Consistent with the above data, siRNA knockdown of HDAC1 and closely related HDAC3 in HEK293 cells prevented the loss of H2BK5 acetylation.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of the MIO&#8208;forming Residues of Aromatic Ammonia Lyases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic ammonia lyases (AALs) and tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia mutases (TAM/PAM) are 3,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5&#8208;methylidene&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;one&#8208; (MIO) dependent enzymes. Usually, the MIO moiety is autocatalytically formed from the tripeptide Ala&#8208;Ser&#8208;Gly (ASG) and acts as an electrophile during the enzymatic reaction. However, the MIO&#8208;forming residues (ASG) have some diversity in this enzyme class. In this work, a systematic investigation on the variety of MIO&#8208;forming residues was carried out using in&#8208;depth sequence analyses. Several protein clusters of AAL&#8208;like enzymes with unusual MIO&#8208;forming residues such as ACG, TSG, SSG, and CSG were identified, including two novel histidine ammonia lyases and one PAM with CSG and TSG residues, respectively, as well as three novel ergothioneine trimethylammonia lyases without MIO motif. The mutagenesis of common MIO&#8208;groups confirmed the function of these MIO variants, which provides good starting points for future functional prediction and mutagenesis research of AALs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Efficiency by High&#8208;Throughput Mass&#8208;Spectrometric Quantification and In&#8197;Vitro/In&#8197;Vivo Catalytic Performance Correlation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To rationalize how the enzymatic performance in&#8197;vivo is correlated with the enzyme catalytic parameters measured in&#8197;vitro, we have applied a mass&#8208;spectrometry based high&#8208;throughput quantitative method as well as synthetic biology tools to systematically improve the performance of 2&#8208;pyrone synthase for triacetic acid lactone biosynthesis in E. coli.







Abstract
Engineering efficient biocatalysts is essential for metabolic engineering to produce valuable bioproducts from renewable resources. However, due to the complexity of cellular metabolic networks, it is challenging to translate success in&#8197;vitro into high performance in cells. To meet such a challenge, an accurate and efficient quantification method is necessary to screen a large set of mutants from complex cell culture and a careful correlation between the catalysis parameters in&#8197;vitro and performance in cells is required. In this study, we employed a mass&#8208;spectrometry based high&#8208;throughput quantitative method to screen new mutants of 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS) for triacetic acid lactone (TAL) biosynthesis through directed evolution in E. coli. From the process, we discovered two mutants with the highest improvement (46&#8197;fold) in titer and the fastest kcat (44&#8197;fold) over the wild type 2PS, respectively, among those reported in the literature. A careful examination of the correlation between intracellular substrate concentration, Michaelis&#8208;Menten parameters and TAL titer for these two mutants reveals that a fast reaction rate under limiting intracellular substrate concentrations is important for in&#8208;cell biocatalysis. Such properties can be tuned by protein engineering and synthetic biology to adopt these engineered proteins for the maximum activities in different intracellular environments.

         <title>Identification of Ligands for Ion Channels: TRPM2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collision&#8208;induced affinity selection mass spectrometry (CIAS&#8208;MS) can be utilized to directly identify ligands binding to the ion channel TRPM2. CIAS&#8208;MS circumvents the need for high mass detection typically associated with mass spectrometry of large membrane proteins. Instead, it focuses on the detection of small molecules dissociated from the ligand&#8208;protein&#8208;detergent complexes, with all affinity selection steps conducted inside the mass spectrometer.







Abstract
Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a calcium&#8208;permeable, nonselective cation channel with a widespread distribution throughout the body. It is involved in many pathological and physiological processes, making it a potential therapeutic target for various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancers. New analytical techniques are beneficial for gaining a deeper understanding of its involvement in disease pathogenesis and for advancing the drug discovery for TRPM2&#8208;related diseases. In this work, we present the application of collision&#8208;induced affinity selection mass spectrometry (CIAS&#8208;MS) for the direct identification of ligands binding to TRPM2. CIAS&#8208;MS circumvents the need for high mass detection typically associated with mass spectrometry of large membrane proteins. Instead, it focuses on the detection of small molecules dissociated from the ligand&#8208;protein&#8208;detergent complexes. This affinity selection approach consolidates all affinity selection steps within the mass spectrometer, resulting in a streamlined process. We showed the direct identification of a known TRPM2 ligand dissociated from the protein&#8208;ligand complex. We demonstrated that CIAS&#8208;MS can identify binding ligands from complex mixtures of compounds and screened a compound library against TRPM2. We investigated the impact of voltage increments and ligand concentrations on the dissociation behavior of the binding ligand, revealing a dose&#8208;dependent relationship.

         <title>Endogenous Production and Vibrational Analysis of Heavy&#8208;Isotope&#8208;Labeled Peptides from Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable isotope labeling is an extremely useful tool for characterizing the structure, tracing the metabolism, and imaging the distribution of natural products in living organisms using mass&#8208;sensitive measurement techniques. In this study, a cyanobacterium was cultured in 15N/13C&#8208;enriched media to endogenously produce labeled, bioactive oligopeptides. The extent of heavy isotope incorporation in these peptides was determined with LC&#8208;MS, while the overall extent of heavy isotope incorporation in whole cells was studied with nanoSIMS and AFM&#8208;IR. Up to 98% heavy isotope incorporation was observed in labeled cells. Three of the most abundant peptides, microcystin&#8208;LR (MCLR), cyanopeptolin&#8208;A (CYPA), and aerucyclamide&#8208;A (ACAA), were isolated and further studied with Raman and FTIR spectroscopies and DFT calculations. This revealed several IR and Raman active vibrations associated with functional groups not common in ribosomal peptides, like diene, ester, thiazole, thiazoline, and oxazoline groups, which could be suitable for future vibrational imaging studies. More broadly, this study outlines a simple and relatively inexpensive method for producing heavy&#8208;labeled natural products. Manipulating the bacterial culture conditions by the addition of specific types and amounts of heavy&#8208;labeled nutrients provides an efficient means of producing heavy&#8208;labeled natural products for mass&#8208;sensitive imaging studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Coq6p, a FAD Monooxygenase Involved in Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis, by Adrenodoxin Reductase/Ferredoxin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adrenodoxin reductase (AdxR) is a crucial protein for mitochondrial electron transfer. Kinetic studies on human AdxR reveal efficient utilization of NADPH. Low NADPH concentrations hinder flavin reduction, but MgCl2 alleviates this and simplifies kinetics. In yeast, in vitro experiments demonstrate a NADPH&#8208;AdxR&#8208;Yah1p&#8208;Coq6p electron transfer chain, elucidating the roles of Yah1p and AdxR homolog, Arh1p, in coenzyme Q biosynthesis.







Abstract
Adrenodoxin reductase (AdxR) plays a pivotal role in electron transfer, shuttling electrons between NADPH and iron/sulfur adrenodoxin proteins in mitochondria. This electron transport system is essential for P450 enzymes involved in various endogenous biomolecules biosynthesis. Here, we present an in&#8208;depth examination of the kinetics governing the reduction of human AdxR by NADH or NADPH. Our results highlight the efficiency of human AdxR when utilizing NADPH as a flavin reducing agent. Nevertheless, akin to related flavoenzymes such as cytochrome P450 reductase, we observe that low NADPH concentrations hinder flavin reduction due to intricate equilibrium reactions between the enzyme and its substrate/product. Remarkably, the presence of MgCl2 suppresses this complex kinetic behavior by decreasing NADPH binding to oxidized AdxR, effectively transforming AdxR into a classical Michaelis&#8208;Menten enzyme. We propose that the addition of MgCl2 may be adapted for studying the reductive half&#8208;reactions of other flavoenzymes with NADPH. Furthermore, in&#8197;vitro experiments provide evidence that the reduction of the yeast flavin monooxygenase Coq6p relies on an electron transfer chain comprising NADPH&#8208;AdxR&#8208;Yah1p&#8208;Coq6p, where Yah1p shuttles electrons between AdxR and Coq6p. This discovery explains the previous in&#8197;vivo observation that Yah1p and the AdxR homolog, Arh1p, are required for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q in yeast.

         <title>Influence of Seed structure on Volume distribution of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Oligomer at Early Stages of Aggregation using nanopipette</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the influence of seeds on the volume of &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers during the early stages of aggregation. Our study revealed a significant impact, demonstrating that seeds induced the formation of larger oligomers compared to the control without seeds. Moreover, our findings indicate that fibrillar aggregates exhibit superior seed competency over fiber aggregates containing 4&#8208;hydroxynonenal (HNE) and oligomers. Notably, this study underscores the effectiveness of nanopore technology for elucidating the diverse species present during the initial phases of aggregation.







Abstract
Understanding &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation is crucial in the context of Parkinson's disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of aggregation induced by preformed seeding on the volume of oligomers during the early stages, using a label&#8208;free, single&#8208;molecule characterization approach. By utilizing nanopipettes of varying sizes, the volume of the oligomers can be calculated from the amplitude of the current blockade and pipette geometry. Further investigation of the aggregates formed over time in the presence of added seeds revealed an acceleration in the formation of large aggregates and the existence of multiple distinct populations of oligomers. Additionally, we observed that spontaneously formed seeds inhibited the formation of smaller oligomers, in contrast to the effect of HNE seeds. These results suggest that the seeds play a crucial role in the formation of oligomers and their sizes during the early stages of aggregation, whereas the classical thioflavin T assay remains negative.

         <title>Se&#8208;Glargine: Chemical Synthesis of a Basal Insulin Analogue Stabilized by an Internal Diselenide Bridge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulin glargine (clinical formulations Lantus&#174; and Toujeo&#174;; Sanofi) is one of the most prescribed basal insulin for diabetes. Here we describe the chemical synthesis of glargine analogue stabilized by substitution of an internal cystine (A6&#8211;A11) by a diselenide bridge. The synthesis provided Se&#8208;glargine in good yield and enhance thermodynamic stability compared to regular glargine.







Abstract
Insulin has long provided a model for studies of protein folding and stability, enabling enhanced treatment of diabetes mellitus via analogue design. We describe the chemical synthesis of a basal insulin analogue stabilized by substitution of an internal cystine (A6&#8211;A11) by a diselenide bridge. The studies focused on insulin glargine (formulated as Lantus&#174; and Toujeo&#174;; Sanofi). Prepared at pH&#8197;4 in the presence of zinc ions, glargine exhibits a shifted isoelectric point due to a basic B chain extension (ArgB31&#8722;ArgB32). Subcutaneous injection leads to pH&#8208;dependent precipitation of a long&#8208;lived depot. Pairwise substitution of CysA6 and CysA11 by selenocysteine was effected by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis; the modified A chain also contained substitution of AsnA21 by Gly, circumventing acid&#8208;catalyzed deamidation. Although chain combination of native glargine yielded negligible product, in accordance with previous synthetic studies, the pairwise selenocysteine substitution partially rescued this reaction: substantial product was obtained through repeated combination, yielding a stabilized insulin analogue. This strategy thus exploited both (a) the unique redox properties of selenocysteine in protein folding and (b) favorable packing of an internal diselenide bridge in the native state, once achieved. Such rational optimization of protein folding and stability may be generalizable to diverse disulfide&#8208;stabilized proteins of therapeutic interest.

         <title>Carbohydrate Co&#8208;Solutes Stabilize Collagen Triple Helices</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six common carbohydrate co&#8208;solutes stabilize the collagen triple helix. A 4&#8197;M solution of glucose increased the melting temperature (Tm) by as much as 17&#8201;&#176;C. Unlike for other proteins, trehalose is not a special bioprotectant for collagen. All tested saccharides stabilize the collagen triple helix to a similar extent.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are common co&#8208;solutes for the stabilization of proteins. The effect of carbohydrate solutions on the stability of collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, is, however, underexplored. In this work, we studied the thermal stability of collagen triple helices derived from a molecularly defined collagen model peptide (CMP), Ac&#8208;(Pro&#8208;Hyp&#8208;Gly)7&#8208;NH2, in solutions of six common mono&#8208; and disaccharides. We show that the carbohydrates stabilize the collagen triple helix in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, with an increase of the melting temperature of up to 17&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, we show that the stabilizing effect is similar for all studied sugars, including trehalose, which is otherwise considered a privileged bioprotectant. The results provided insight into the effects of sugar co&#8208;solutes on collagen triple helices and can aid the selection of storage environments for collagen&#8208;based materials and probes.

         <title>A Mutagen Acts as a Potent Reducing Agent of Glycated Hemoglobin: a Combined Ultrafast Electron Transfer and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin (GHb): Ethidium bromide (EtBr) in its excited state behaves as a potential reducing agent for hemoglobin (Hb). EtBr transfers its excited state electron to the iron (Fe(III)) residing inside the heme&#8208;group of Hb and reduces it to its lower ionic state. Due to structural modification and electrostatic interaction between GHb and EtBr, this ultrafast reduction increases.







Abstract
Glycated hemoglobin (GHb) found in mammals undergoes irreversible damage when exposed to external redox agents, which is much more vulnerable than its normal counterpart hemoglobin (Hb). Besides the oxygen regulation throughout the body, Hb plays a vital role in balancing immunological health and the redox cycle. Photoinduced ultra&#8208;fast electron transfer phenomena actively participate in regulation of various kind of homeostasis involved in such biomacromolecules. In the present study we have shown that a well&#8208;known mutagen Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) reduces GHb in femtosecond time scale (efficiently) upon photoexcitation after efficient recognition in the biomolecule. We have performed similar experiment by colocalizing EtBr and Iron (Fe(III)) on the micellar surface as Hb mimic in order to study the excited state EtBr dynamics to rationalize the time scale obtained from EtBr in GHb and Hb. While other experimental techniques including Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta potential, absorbance and emission spectroscopy have been employed for the confirmation of structural perturbation of GHb compared to Hb, a detailed computational studies involving molecular docking and density functional theory (DFT) have been employed for the explanation of the experimental observations.

         <title>Fus&#8208;SMO: Kinetics, Biochemical Characterisation and In Silico Modelling of a Chimeric Styrene Monooxygenase Demonstrating Quantitative Coupling Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The styrene monooxygenase, a two&#8208;component enzymatic system for styrene epoxidation, was characterised through the study of Fus&#8208;SMO&#8212;a chimera resulting from the fusion of StyA and StyB using a flexible linker. Notably, it remains debated whether the transfer of FADH2 from StyB to StyA occurs through diffusion, channeling, or a combination of both.
Fus&#8208;SMO was identified as a trimer with one bound FAD molecule. In silico modelling revealed a well&#8208;distanced arrangement (45&#8211;50 &#197;) facilitated by the flexible linker's loopy structure. Pre&#8208;steady&#8208;state kinetics elucidated the FADox reduction intricacies (kred=110 s&#8208;1 for bound FADox), identifying free FADox binding as the rate&#8208;determining step. The aerobic oxidation of FADH2 (kox= 90 s&#8208;1) and subsequent decomposition to FADox and H2O2 demonstrated StyA's protective effect on the bound hydroperoxoflavin (kdec= 0.2 s&#8208;1) compared to free cofactor (kdec= 1.8 s&#8208;1). At varied styrene concentrations, kox for FADH2 ranged from 80 to 120 s&#8208;1. Studies on NADH consumption vs. styrene epoxidation revealed Fus&#8208;SMO's ability to achieve quantitative coupling efficiency in solution, surpassing natural two&#8208;component SMOs. The results suggest that Fus&#8208;SMO exhibits enhanced FADH2 channelling between subunits.
This work contributes to comprehending FADH2 transfer mechanisms in SMO and illustrates how protein fusion can elevate catalytic efficiency for biocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Protein Engineering for Improving Catalytic Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning approaches allow the creation of protein adaptive landscapes and the identification of catalytic modes using limited experimental data to establish relationships between enzyme, substrate and catalytic performance, and have been used for data&#8208;driven protein engineering to improve their catalytic activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Protein engineering is essential for altering the substrate scope, catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes for applications in biocatalysis. However, traditional approaches, such as directed evolution and rational design, encounter the challenge in dealing with the experimental screening process of a large protein mutation space. Machine learning methods allow the approximation of protein fitness landscapes and the identification of catalytic patterns using limited experimental data, thus providing a new avenue to guide protein engineering campaigns. In this concept article, we review machine learning models that have been developed to assess enzyme&#8208;substrate&#8208;catalysis performance relationships aiming to improve enzymes through data&#8208;driven protein engineering. Furthermore, we prospect the future development of this field to provide additional strategies and tools for achieving desired activities and selectivities.

         <title>Preferential Binding of a Red Emissive Julolidine Derivative to a Promoter G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we show that a julolidine based compound displays emission in the red region of the spectrum and interacts preferentially with G&#8208;quadruplexes of certain topology having a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 binding stoichiometry and ability to thermally stabilize the G&#8208;quadruplex (Pu22).







Abstract
The therapeutic potential of G&#8208;quadruplexes has increased significantly with the growing understanding of their functional roles in pathogens apart from human diseases such as cancer. Here, we report the synthesis of three julolidine&#8208;based molecules and their binding to nucleic acids. Among the synthesized molecules, compound 1 exhibited red emissive fluorescence with a distinct preference for Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex. The binding of compound 1 to Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex, initially identified through a fluorescence&#8208;based screening, was further confirmed by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism&#8208;based experiments. Thermal denaturation of compound 1 in the presence of Pu22 G&#8208;quadruplex revealed a concentration&#8208;dependent stabilization (~10.0&#8201;&#176;C at 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 stoichiometry). Fluorescence&#8208;based experiments revealed 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry of the interaction and an association constant (Ka) of 5.67&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. CD experiments displayed that the parallel conformation of the G&#8208;quadruplex was retained on compound 1&#8217;s binding and signs of higher order binding/complex formation were observed at high compound 1 to DNA ratio. Molecular docking studies revealed the dominance of stacking and van der Waals interactions in the molecular recognition which was aided by some close&#8208;distance interactions involving the quinolinium nitrogen atom.

         <title>A Lateral Flow Assay Based on Streptavidin&#8208;biotin Amplification System with Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Rapid and Quantitative Detection of Salmonella enteritidis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptavidin&#8208;biotin amplification system alone can be used as a reporter protein probe for rapid quantitative identification of salmonella. Quantitative results are captured via a smartphone and transmitted to computer software to precisely calculate the target amount. This diagnostic method accommodates both lower limits of detection and quantitative specifications and permits testing of additional pathogens merely through the inclusion of primer design steps.







Abstract
Salmonella constitutes a prevalent alimentary pathogen, instigating zoonotic afflictions. Consequently, the prompt discernment of Salmonella in sustenance is of cardinal significance. Lateral flow assays utilizing colorimetric methodologies adequately fulfill the prerequisites of point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics, however, their detection threshold remains elevated, generally permitting only qualitative discernment, an impediment to the preliminary screening of nascent pathogens. In response to this conundrum, we propose a lateral flow diagnostic predicated upon a streptavidin&#8208;biotin amplification system with recombinase polymerase amplification engineered for the expeditious and quantitative discernment of Salmonella enteritidis. Trace nucleic acids within a sample undergo exponential amplification via recombinase polymerase amplification to a level discernable, constituting the initial signal amplification. Subsequently, along the test line (T&#8208;line) of the lateral flow strip, the chromatic signal undergoes augmentation by securing a greater quantity of AuNPs through the magnification capacity of the streptavidin&#8208;biotin mechanism, affecting the second signal amplification. Quantitative results are procured via smartphone capture and transferred to computer software for precise calculation of the targeted quantity. The lateral flow strip exhibits a LOD at 19.41&#8197;CFU/mL for cultured S. enteritidis. The RSD of three varying concentrations were respectively 3.74&#8201;%, 5.96&#8201;%, and 4.25&#8201;%.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Immobilization of TCEP on Silica Beads for Efficient Disulfide Reduction and Thiol Alkylation in Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
TCEP immobilized on agarose is widely used for efficient reduction of cysteines in peptides and proteins, but the reducing capacity is rather low. Herein, we have compared different solid supports for TCEP immobilization and found that silica&#8208;TCEP has an 8&#8208;fold higher reduction capacity, allowing thiol reduction of peptides at millimolar concentrations.







Abstract
Tris&#8208;(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) linked to agarose beads is widely used for reducing disulfide bridges in proteins and peptides. The immobilization of TCEP on beads allows efficient removal after reduction to prevent its reaction with alkylating reagents and thus interference with conjugation reactions. However, a limitation of agarose TCEP is its relatively low reduction capacity per milliliter of wet beads (about 15&#8197;&#956;mol/ml), making it unsuitable for the reduction of disulfides from molecules at millimolar concentrations. In this work, we tested the immobilization of TCEP to a range of different solid supports and found that conjugation to silica gel offers TCEP beads with about 8&#8208;fold higher reduction capacity (129&#177;16&#8197;&#956;mol/ml wet beads). We show that it allows reducing disulfide&#8208;cyclized peptides at millimolar concentrations for subsequent cyclization by bis&#8208;electrophile linker reagents. Given the substantially higher reduction capacity, the robust performance in different solvents, the low cost of the silica gel, and the ease of functionalization with TCEP, the silica gel&#8208;TCEP is suited for reducing disulfide bridges in essentially any peptide and is particularly useful for reducing peptides at higher concentrations.

         <title>Quantitative Analysis of 2D EXSY NMR Spectra of Strongly Coupled Spin Systems in Transmembrane Exchange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative interpretation of cross&#8208;peaks in 2D EXSY spectra of compounds with strongly coupled spins undergoing transmembrane exchange required brute&#8208;force numerical fitting to extract rate constants.







Abstract
Solute translocation by membrane transport proteins is a vital biological process that can be tracked, on the sub&#8208;second timescale, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Fluorinated substrate analogues facilitate such studies because of high sensitivity of 19F&#8197;NMR and absence of background signals. Accurate extraction of translocation rate constants requires precise quantification of NMR signal intensities. This becomes complicated in the presence of J&#8208;couplings, cross&#8208;correlations, and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) that alter signal integrals through mechanisms unrelated to translocation. Geminal difluorinated motifs introduce strong and hard&#8208;to&#8208;quantify contributions from non&#8208;exchange effects, the nuanced nature of which makes them hard to integrate into data analysis methodologies. With analytical expressions not being available, numerical least squares fitting of theoretical models to 2D spectra emerges as the preferred quantification approach. For large spin systems with simultaneous coherent evolution, cross&#8208;relaxation, cross&#8208;correlation, conformational exchange, and membrane translocation between compartments with different viscosities, the only available simulation framework is Spinach. In this study, we demonstrate GLUT&#8208;1 dependent membrane transport of two model sugars featuring CF2 and CF2CF2 fluorination motifs, with precise determination of translocation rate constants enabled by numerical fitting of 2D EXSY spectra. For spin systems and kinetic networks of this complexity, this was not previously tractable.

         <title>Promiscuity of Omphalotin A Biosynthetic Enzymes Allows de novo Production of Non&#8208;Natural Multiply Backbone N&#8208;Methylated Peptide Macrocycles in Yeast</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway for the peptide natural product omphalotin A of the agaricomycete Omphalotus olearius can be exploited for the production of non&#8208;natural, multiply backbone N&#8208;methylated peptide macrocycles in the yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii).







Abstract
Multiple backbone N&#8208;methylation and macrocyclization improve the proteolytic stability and oral availability of therapeutic peptides.

&lt;p&gt;The biosynthetic pathway for the peptide natural product omphalotin A of the agaricomycete &lt;i&gt;Omphalotus olearius&lt;/i&gt; can be exploited for the production of non-natural, multiply backbone N-methylated peptide macrocycles in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Komagataella phaffii&lt;/i&gt;).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple backbone N-methylation and macrocyclization improve the proteolytic stability and oral availability of therapeutic peptides. Chemical synthesis of such peptides is challenging, in particular for the generation of peptide libraries for screening purposes. Enzymatic backbone N-methylation and macrocyclization occur as part of both non-ribosomal and ribosomal peptide biosynthesis, exemplified by the fungal natural products cyclosporin A and omphalotin A, respectively. Omphalotin A, a 9fold backbone N-methylated dodecamer isolated from the agaricomycete &lt;i&gt;Omphalotus olearius&lt;/i&gt;, can be produced in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; by coexpression of the &lt;i&gt;ophMA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ophP&lt;/i&gt; genes coding for the peptide precursor protein harbouring an autocatalytic peptide &#945;-N-methyltransferase domain, and a peptide macrocyclase, respectively. Since both OphMA and OphP were previously shown to be relatively promiscuous in terms of peptide substrates, we expressed mutant versions of &lt;i&gt;ophMA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding OphMA variants with altered core peptide sequences, along with wildtype &lt;i&gt;ophP&lt;/i&gt; and assessed the production of the respective peptide macrocycles by the platform by high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC&#8211;MS/MS).

         <title>Hoechst&#8208;Modification on Oligodeoxynucleotides for Efficient Transport to the Cell Nucleus and Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have been developed for regulating gene expression, however, few ODNs are actively transported into the cell nucleus, even though antisense function in the cell nucleus. Herein, we successfully designed and characterized ODNs modified with Hoechst molecule for accumulation and transport into the cell nucleus.







Abstract
Various artificial oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that contribute to gene regulation have been developed and their diversity and multifunctionality have been demonstrated. However, few artificial ODNs are actively transported to the cell nucleus, despite the fact that gene regulation also takes place in both the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. In this study, to prepare ODNs with the ability to accumulate in the cell nucleus, we introduced Hoechst molecules into ODNs that act as carriers of functional molecules to the cell nucleus (Hoe&#8208;ODNs). We synthesized Hoe&#8208;ODNs and confirmed that they bound strongly to DNA duplexes. When single&#8208;stranded Hoe&#8208;ODNs or double&#8208;stranded ODNs consisting of Hoe&#8208;ODNs and its complementary strand were administered into living cells, both ODNs were efficiently accumulated in the cell nucleus. In addition, antisense ODNs, which were tethered with Hoechst unit, were delivered into the cell nucleus and efficiently suppressed the expression of their target RNA. Thus, we constructed a delivery system that enables the transport of ODNs into cell nucleus.

         <title>Dimer Stabilization by SpyTag/SpyCatcher Coupling of the Reductase Domains of a Chimeric P450 BM3 Monooxygenase from Bacillus spp. Improves its Stability, Activity, and Purification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction prevents dissociation of the dimeric, self&#8208;sufficient P450 BM3 monooxygenase CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. The covalent isopeptide bond was incorporated at the C&#8208;terminus of a representative P450 BM3 chimera bearing a homologous reductase domain of the CYP102A3 from Bacillus subtilis. As a consequence, enzyme stability and catalysis have been affected positively.







Abstract
The vast majority of known enzymes exist as oligomers, which often gives them high catalytic performance but at the same time imposes constraints on structural conformations and environmental conditions. An example of an enzyme with a complex architecture is the P450 BM3 monooxygenase CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. Only active as a dimer, it is highly sensitive to dilution or common immobilization techniques. In this study, we engineered a thermostable P450BM3 chimera consisting of the heme domain of a CYP102A1 variant and the reductase domain of the homologous CYP102A3. The dimerization of the hybrid was even weaker compared to the corresponding CYP102A1 variant. To create a stable dimer, we covalently coupled the C&#8208;termini of two monomers of the chimera via SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003 interaction. As a result, purification, thermostability, pH stability, and catalytic activity were improved. Via a bioorthogonal two&#8208;step affinity purification, we obtained high purity (94&#8201;%) of the dimer&#8208;stabilized variant being robust against heme depletion. Long&#8208;term stability was increased with a half&#8208;life of over 2&#8197;months at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8211;90&#8201;% residual activity after 2&#8197;months at 5&#8201;&#176;C. Most catalytic features were retained with even an enhancement of the overall activity by ~2&#8208;fold compared to the P450BM3 chimera without SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003.

         <title>Revolutionary Pyrazole&#8208;based Aza&#8208;BODIPY: Harnessing Photothermal Power Against Cancer Cells and Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPY decorated with pyrazole (PY&#8208;AZB) has been developed for photothermal treatment. Its photophysical characteristics and anticancer and antibacterial applications are outlined. PY&#8208;AZB is a dual&#8208;purpose agent for imaging and treating cancer and bacterial infections through photothermal therapy (PTT). With photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 33&#8201;%, PY&#8208;AZB effectively eliminates cancer cells by up to 70&#8201;%. Additionally, upon laser irradiation, PY&#8208;AZB displays significant bactericidal effects, achieving a killing efficiency of up to 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
In the realm of cancer therapy and treatment of bacterial infection, photothermal therapy (PTT) stands out as a potential strategy. The challenge, however, is to create photothermal agents that can perform both imaging and PTT, a so&#8208;called theranostic agent. Photothermal agents that absorb and emit in the near&#8208;infrared region (750&#8211;900&#8197;nm) have recently received a lot of attention due to the extensive penetration of NIR light in biological tissues. In this study, we combined pyrazole with aza&#8208;BODIPY (PY&#8208;AZB) to develop a novel photothermal agent. PY&#8208;AZB demonstrated great photostability with a photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 33&#8201;%. Additionally, PY&#8208;AZB can permeate cancer cells at a fast accumulation rate in less than 6&#8197;hours, according to the confocal images. Furthermore, in&#8197;vitro photothermal therapy results showed that PY&#8208;AZB effectively eliminated cancer cells by up to 70&#8201;%. Interestingly, PY&#8208;AZB exhibited antibacterial activities against both gram&#8208;negative bacteria, Escherichia coli 780, and gram&#8208;positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus 1466. The results exhibit a satisfactory bactericidal effect against bacteria, with a killing efficiency of up to 100&#8201;% upon laser irradiation. As a result, PY&#8208;AZB may provide a viable option for photothermal treatment.

         <title>Targeted Preparation and NMR Spectroscopic Characterization of Lys11&#8208;Linked Ubiquitin Trimers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homotypic K11&#8208;linked Ub trimers were prepared by a targeted click&#8208;chemistry approach using a specific isotopic labeling scheme. The trimers were structurally and dynamically characterized by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and compared to corresponding monomers and dimers. This analysis revealed a robust overall conformation of Ub moieties used for assembly as well as conserved structural and dynamical properties of the assembled chains that vary in length.







Abstract
Ubiquitylation refers to the attachment of mono&#8208; or poly&#8208;ubiquitin molecules to a substrate protein. To shield ubiquitin chains against potential hydrolysis, a facile, click&#8208;chemistry based approach was recently established for the generation of site&#8208;specifically conjugated ubiquitin dimers relying on triazole&#8208;linkage. Here, the preparation of such ubiquitin chains was advanced by the generation of homotypic Lys11&#8208;linked ubiquitin trimers considering an isotopic labeling scheme in a moiety&#8208;wise manner. The structural and dynamical impact on the ubiquitin unit at proximal, central, or distal position that is potentially invoked by the respective other two moieties was systematically probed by heteronuclear high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopic approaches. As a result, conjugating a third ubiquitin moiety to the proximal or distal site of a ubiquitin dimer does not alter structural and dynamical characteristics as it has been seen for ubiquitin dimers. This observation suggests that recognition of a homotypically assembled ubiquitin chain by a potential substrate is primarily done by screening the length of a ubiquitin chain rather than relying on subtle changes in structure or dynamic properties of single ubiquitin moieties composing the chain.

&lt;p&gt;Homotypic K11-linked Ub trimers were prepared by a targeted click-chemistry approach using a specific isotopic labeling scheme. The trimers were structurally and dynamically characterized by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and compared to corresponding monomers and dimers. This analysis revealed a robust overall conformation of Ub moieties used for assembly as well as conserved structural and dynamical properties of the assembled chains that vary in length.

         <title>Discovery and Development of Cyclic Peptide Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>

Cyclic peptide proteasome stimulators: Cyclic peptides inspired by natural products activate ubiquitin independent degradation of disordered proteins. Development and utilization of a flow&#8208;based proteasome assay enabled confirmation of the activity of cyclic peptides in cells, making them valuable chemical tools for studying proteasome activation.







Abstract
The proteasome degrades proteins, which is essential for cellular homeostasis. Ubiquitin independent proteolysis degrades highly disordered and misfolded proteins. A decline of proteasomal activity has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. In this work, cyclic peptide proteasome stimulators (CyPPSs) that enhance the clearance of misfolded proteins were discovered. In the initial screen of predicted natural products (pNPs), several cyclic peptides were found to stimulate the 20S core particle (20S CP). Development of a robust structural activity relationship led to the identification of potent, cell permeable CyPPSs. In vitro assays revealed that CyPPSs stimulate degradation of highly disordered and misfolded proteins without affecting ordered proteins. Furthermore, using a novel flow&#8208;based assay for proteasome activity, several CyPPSs were found to stimulate the 20S CP in cellulo. Overall, this work describes the development of CyPPSs as chemical tools capable of stimulating the proteasome and provides strong support for proteasome stimulation as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Regulating the Heme Active Site by Covalent Modifications: Two Case Studies of Myoglobin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent modification: A facial approach was developed to regulate the heme active site of heme protein by cavity generation, followed by covalent modifications, as shown by the two case studies using myoglobin as a model protein.







Abstract
Using myoglobin (Mb) as a model protein, we herein developed a facial approach to modifying the heme active site. A cavity was first generated in the heme distal site by F46&#8197;C mutation, and the thiol group of Cys46 was then used for covalently linked to exogenous ligands, 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiol and 1&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione. The engineered proteins, termed F46C&#8208;triazole Mb and F46C&#8208;phenol Mb, respectively, were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopic and stopped&#8208;flow kinetic studies. The results showed that both the heme coordination state and the protein function such as H2O2 activation and peroxidase activity could be efficiently regulated, which suggests that this approach might be generally applied to the design of functional heme proteins.

         <title>Synthesis of azide&#8208;modified glycerophospholipid precursor analogs for detection of enzymatic reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;modified glycerophospholipid precursor analogs were successfully synthesized. One of the analogs, azide&#8208;modified cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol, functioned as the substrate for the well&#8208;known enzyme CDP&#8208;diacylglycerol&#8208;inositol 3&#8208;phosphatidyltransferase (CDIPT) and the reaction product was easily detected using the fluorescent labeling technique via strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) are major cell membrane components. Although various phosphorylated molecules are attached to lipid moieties as their headgroups, GPLs are biosynthesized from phosphatidic acid (PA) via its derivatives, diacylglycerol (DAG) or cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP&#8208;DAG). A variety of molecular probes capable of introducing detection tags have been developed to investigate biological events involved in GPLs. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel analytical tools suitable to monitor the activity of GPL biosynthetic enzymes in&#8197;vitro. Our synthetic targets, namely, azide&#8208;modified PA, azide&#8208;modified DAG, and azide&#8208;modified CDP&#8208;DAG, were successfully obtained from solketal as their common starting material. Moreover, using CDP&#8208;diacylglycerol&#8208;inositol 3&#8208;phosphatidyltransferase (CDIPT), an enzyme that catalyzed the final reaction step in synthesizing phosphatidylinositol, we demonstrated that azide&#8208;modified CDP&#8208;DAG worked as a substrate for CDIPT.

         <dc:description>
2(E)&#8208;[p&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;benzylideno]&#8208;dipterocarpol 3m synthesized by a Claisen&#8208;Schmidt aldol condensation demonstrated the most potent &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition with IC50 0.204&#8197;&#956;M, that 857&#8208;times more active than acarbose. Compound 3 m attenuated inflammation via NO inhibition pathway and showed a pronounced hypoglycemic activity on stz&#8208;induced T1DM involved lipid peroxidation reduction.







Abstract
Dammarane triterpenoids are affordable and bioactive natural metabolites with great structural potential, which makes them attractive sources for drug development. The aim of the study was to investigate the potency of new dipterocarpol derivatives for the treatment of diabetes. Two dammaranes (dipterocarpol and its 20(24)&#8208;diene derivative) were modified by a Claisen&#8208;Schmidt aldol condensation to afford C2(E)&#8208;arylidenes in good yields. The majority of the synthesized compounds exhibited an excellent&#8208;to&#8208;moderate inhibitory effect toward &#945;&#8208;glucosidase (from S. saccharomyces), among them eight compounds showed IC50 values less than 10&#8197;&#956;M. 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;dammarane&#8208;2(E)&#8208;benzylidenes (holding p&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; 3&#8201;l and p&#8208;carbonyl&#8208; 3&#8201;m substituents) demonstrated the most potent &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition with IC50 0.753 and 0.204&#8197;&#956;M, being 232&#8208; and 857&#8208;times more active than acarbose (IC50 174.90&#8197;&#956;M), and a high level of NO inhibition in Raw 264.7 cells with IC50 of 1.75 and 4.57&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. An in&#8197;vivo testing of compound 3&#8201;m (in a dose of 20&#8197;mg/kg) on a model of streptozotocin&#8208;induced T1DM in rats showed a pronounced hypoglycemic activity, the ability to reduce effectively the processes of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue and decrease the excretion of glucose and pyruvic acid in the urine. Compound 3&#8201;m reduced the death of diabetic rats and preserved their motor activity.

An &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; testing of compound &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;m&lt;/b&gt; (in a dose of 20&#8197;mg/kg) on a model of streptozotocin-induced T1DM in rats showed a pronounced hypoglycemic activity, the ability to reduce effectively the processes of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue and decrease the excretion of glucose and pyruvic acid in the urine. Compound &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;m&lt;/b&gt; reduced the death of diabetic rats and preserved their motor activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De novo Semi&#8208;Synthetic Platform for Monitoring Protein degradation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed platform based on SpyCatcher/SpyTag system to promote the degradation of exogenous proteins in live cells. We used Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein tagged with SpyCatcher was conjugated to a SpyTag peptide bearing a Von Hippel&#8208;Lindau E3 ligand, and the semi&#8208;synthetic construct was delivered to live cells to promote its degradation.







Abstract
We designed a platform for monitoring the degradation of exogenous proteins in live cells. We engineered a semi&#8208;synthetic platform, which consists of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein tagged with SpyCatcher to enable its conjugation to a SpyTag peptide bearing a Von Hippel&#8211;Lindau E3 ligand, which was delivered to live cells to promote its degradation. This platform lays the ground for studying the degradation of endogenous proteins equipped with SpyTag and for tracking the degradation of post&#8208;translationally modified proteins in live cells.

         <title>Bacterial Isothiocyanate Biosynthesis by Rhodanese&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfur Transfer onto Isonitriles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biosynthetic pathway towards isothiocyanate natural products is identified. In vivo and in&#8197;vitro biotransformation show that rhodanese&#8208;like proteins (Rhd), known for the detoxification of cyanide, have been recruited and neofunctionalized to catalyze sulfur incorporation into isonitriles in bacteria. This so far unknown function of rhodanese&#8208;like proteins is highly specific and plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the antifungal sinapigladioside from Burkholderia gladioli.







Abstract
Natural products bearing isothiocyanate (ITC) groups are an important group of specialized metabolites that play various roles in health, nutrition, and ecology. Whereas ITC biosynthesis via glucosinolates in plants has been studied in detail, there is a gap in understanding the bacterial route to specialized metabolites with such reactive heterocumulene groups, as in the antifungal sinapigladioside from Burkholderia gladioli. Here we propose an alternative ITC pathway by enzymatic sulfur transfer onto isonitriles catalyzed by rhodanese&#8208;like enzymes (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferases). Mining the B. gladioli genome revealed six candidate genes (rhdA&#8211;F), which were individually expressed in E. coli. By means of a synthetic probe, the gene products were evaluated for their ability to produce the key ITC intermediate in the sinapigladioside pathway. In vitro biotransformation assays identified RhdE, a prototype single&#8208;domain rhodanese, as the most potent ITC synthase. Interestingly, while RhdE also efficiently transforms cyanide into thiocyanate, it shows high specificity for the natural pathway intermediate, indicating that the sinapigladioside pathway has recruited a ubiquitous detoxification enzyme for the formation of a bioactive specialized metabolite. These findings not only elucidate an elusive step in bacterial ITC biosynthesis but also reveal a new function of rhodanese&#8208;like enzymes in specialized metabolism.

         <title>Effect of Sulfotyrosine and Negatively Charged Amino Acid of Leech&#8208;Derived Peptides on Binding and Inhibitory Activity Against Thrombin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores hirudins, natural thrombin inhibitors, focusing on the anionic C&#8208;terminal region. Twelve dodecapeptides, derived from various leech species, were synthesized with varying negatively charge amino acid residues and sulfotyrosines. Evaluation of peptide anticoagulant properties provides insights into their post&#8208;translational modifications and the role of anionic C&#8208;terminal region.







Abstract
Hirudins, natural sulfo(glyco)proteins, are clinical anticoagulants that directly inhibit thrombin, a key coagulation factor. Their potent thrombin inhibition primarily results from antagonistic interactions with both the catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic sites of thrombin. Hirudins often feature sulfate moieties on Tyr residues in their anionic C&#8208;terminus region, enabling strong interactions with thrombin exosite&#8208;I and effectively blocking its engagement with fibrinogen. Although sulfotyrosines have been identified in various hirudin variants, the precise relationship between sulfotyrosine and the number of negatively charged amino acids within the anionic&#8208;rich C&#8208;terminus peptide domain for the binding of thrombin has remained elusive. By using Fmoc&#8208;SPPS, hirudin dodecapeptides homologous to the C&#8208;terminus of hirudin variants from various leech species were successfully synthesized, and the effect of sulfotyrosine and the number of negatively charged amino acids on hirudin&#8208;thrombin interactions was investigated. Our findings did not reveal any synergistic effect between an increasing number of sulfotyrosines or negatively charged amino acids and their inhibitory activity on thrombin or fibrinolysis in the assays, despite a higher binding level toward thrombin in the sulfated dodecapeptide Hnip_Hirudin was observed in SPR analysis.

         <title>Tuning Chemoenzymatic Pd/Laccase Conformation Toward Optimized Heterogeneous Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different spatial organizations of a heterogeneous chemoenzymatic Pd/Laccase system were tested for synergistic veratryl alcohol oxidation. Best catalysts are obtained when the Pd complex is combined with a laccase exhibiting a surface&#8208;located lysine next to the T1 oxidation site with two different orders of immobilization (1, 2). This work sets the ground for controlling the immobilization of a Pd/laccase/silica foam hybrid catalyst.







Abstract
Heterogeneous chemoenzymatic catalysts differing in their spatial organization and relative orientation of their enzymatic laccase and Pd units confined into macrocellular silica foams were tested on veratryl alcohol oxidation. When operating under continuous flow, we show that the catalytic efficiency of hybrids is significantly enhanced when the Pd(II) complex is combined with a laccase exhibiting a surface located lysine next to the T1 oxidation site of the enzyme.

         <title>Integrated Electrochemical and Optical Biosensing in Organs&#8208;on&#8208;Chip</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 3, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated bio&#8208;sensing is expected to address the partly unmet need for accurate microenvironmental monitoring in organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip. This paper briefly reviews available options for integrated electrical, electrochemical, and optical sensing methods, consolidating and expanding organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip capabilities for a widening variety of applications. We spotlight recent advances and future prospects for biocompatible, non&#8208;invasive and continuous sensing techniques, and argue for the significance of highly&#8208;sensitive on&#8208;chip sensors for deepening understanding of human (patho)physiology and reproducibility of OoC technology.







Abstract
Demand for biocompatible, non&#8208;invasive, and continuous real&#8208;time monitoring of organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip has driven the development of a variety of novel sensors. However, highest accuracy and sensitivity can arguably be achieved by integrated biosensing, which enables in&#8197;situ monitoring of the in&#8197;vitro microenvironment and dynamic responses of tissues and miniature organs recapitulated in organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip. This paper reviews integrated electrical, electrochemical, and optical sensing methods within organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices and platforms. By affording precise detection of analytes and biochemical reactions, these methods expand and advance the monitoring capabilities and reproducibility of organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip technology. The integration of these sensing techniques allows a deeper understanding of organ functions, and paves the way for important applications such as drug testing, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. By consolidating recent advancements and highlighting challenges in the field, this review aims to foster further research and innovation in the integration of biosensing in organs&#8208;on&#8208;chip.

         <title>Aminic Organoselenium Compounds as Glutathione Peroxidase Mimics and Inhibitors of Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminic organoselenium compounds such as symmetrical selenides and diselenides are conveniently obtained by the reduction of their corresponding selenocyanates using sodium borohydride. These compounds show very good glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like antioxidant activity. They also exhibit anti&#8208;ferroptotic activity in a TAM&#8208;inducible GPx4 conditional knockout cell lines and prevent the accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) in biological membranes.







Abstract
The synthesis of diarylamine&#8208;based organoselenium compounds via the nucleophilic substitution reactions has been described. Symmetrical monoselenides and diselenides were conveniently synthesized by the reduction of their corresponding selenocyanates using sodium borohydride. Selenocyanates were obtained from 2&#8208;chloro acetamides by the nucleophilic displacement with potassium selenocyanate. Selenides were synthesized by treating the 2&#8208;chloro acetamides with in&#8197;situ generated sodium butyl selenolate as nucleophile. Further, the newly synthesized organoselenium compounds were evaluated for their glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like activity in thiophenol assay. This study revealed that the methoxy&#8208;substituted organoselenium compounds showed significant effect on the GPx&#8208;like activity. The catalytic parameters for the most efficient catalysts were also determined. The anti&#8208;ferroptotic activity for all GPx&#8208;mimics evaluated in a 4&#8722;OH&#8208;tamoxifen (TAM) inducible GPx4 knockout cell line using liproxstatin as standard.

         <title>Effect of DNA Origami Nanostructures on Bacterial Growth</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA origami nanostructures are a powerful tool in biomedicine and can be used to combat drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. However, the effect of unmodified DNA origami nanostructures on bacteria is yet to be elucidated. With the aim to obtain a better understanding of this phenomenon, the effect of three DNA origami shapes, i.e., DNA origami triangles, six&#8208;helix bundles (6HBs), and 24&#8208;helix bundles (24HBs), on the growth of Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis is investigated. These results reveal that while triangles and 24HBs can be used as a source of nutrients by E. coli and thereby promote population growth, their effect is much smaller than that of genomic single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA. However, no effect on E. coli population growth is observed for the 6HBs. On the other hand, B. subtilis does not show any significant changes in population growth when cultured with the different DNA origami shapes or genomic DNA. The detailed effect of DNA origami nanostructures on bacterial growth thus depends on the competence signals and uptake mechanism of each bacterial species, as well as the DNA origami shape. This should be considered in the development of antimicrobial DNA origami nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>A desthiobiotin labelled NAD+ analogue to uncover Poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase 1 protein targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling PARP&#8208;selective protein targets is crucial for a better understanding of ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Here, we report a novel chemically modified NAD+ analog which can be applied in the &#8220;bump&#8208;and&#8208;hole&#8221; strategy for PARP1. The analog bears an ethyl group (&#8220;bump&#8221;) at the nicotinamide moiety that drives selectivity towards a PARP1 mutant. An affinity tag linked to the adenine moiety enables affinity enrichment of PARP1 specific ADP&#8208;ribosylation targets.







Abstract
ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by the enzyme family of polyadenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribose) polymerases (PARPs). This enzymatic process involves the transfer of single or multiple ADP&#8208;ribose molecules onto proteins, utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate. It, thus, plays a pivotal role in regulating various biological processes. Unveiling PARP&#8208;selective protein targets is crucial for a better understanding of their biological functions. Nonetheless, this task proves challenging due to overlapping targets shared among PARP family members. Therefore, we applied the &#8220;bump&#8208;and&#8208;hole&#8221; strategy to modify the nicotinamide binding site of PARP1 by introducing a hydrophobic pocket (&#8220;hole&#8221;). This PARP1&#8208;mutant binds an orthogonal NAD+ (Et&#8208;DTB&#8208;NAD+) containing an ethyl group (&#8220;bump&#8221;) at the nicotinamide moiety. Furthermore, we added a desthiobiotin (DTB) tag directly to the adenosine moiety, enabling affinity enrichment of ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteins. Employing this approach, we successfully identified protein targets modified by PARP1 in cell lysate. This strategy expands the arsenal of chemically modified NAD+ analogs available for studying ADP&#8208;ribosylation, providing a powerful tool to study these critical post&#8208;translational modifications.

         <title>Identification of glycosylated nucleosides in small synthetic glyco&#8208;RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl lactose was conjugated to Y5 RNA, and its product was characterized after nuclease digestion via liquid&#8208;chromatography mass&#8208;spectrometry. The conjugation products were also evaluated for their ability to trigger an interferon response in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts.







Abstract
Recently, the post&#8208;transcriptional modification of RNA with N&#8208;glycans was reported, changing the paradigm that RNAs are not commonly N&#8208;glycosylated. Moreover, glycan modifications of RNA are investigated for therapeutic targeting purposes. But the glyco&#8208;RNA field is in its infancy with many challenges to overcome. One question is how to accurately characterize glycosylated RNA constructs. Thus, we generated glycosylated forms of Y5 RNA mimics, a short non&#8208;coding RNA. The simple glycans lactose and sialyllactose were attached to the RNA backbone using azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions. Using nuclease digestion followed by LC&#8722;MS, we confirmed the presence of the glycosylated nucleosides, and characterized the chemical linkage. Next, we probed if glycosylation would affect the cellular response to Y5 RNA. We treated human foreskin fibroblasts in culture with the generated compounds. Key transcripts in the innate immune response were quantified by RT&#8208;qPCR. We found that under our experimental conditions, exposure of cells to the Y5 RNA did not trigger an interferon response, and glycosylation of this RNA did not have an impact. Thus, we have identified a successful approach to chemically characterize synthetic glyco&#8208;RNAs, which will be critical for further studies to elucidate how the presence of complex glycans on RNA affects the cellular response.

         <title>A facile and general tandem oligonucleotide synthesis methodology for DNA and RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis (TOS) of (chemically modified) DNA and RNA using a commercially available cleavable linker. We show that the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldiethylene linker is effectively incorporated in DNA/RNA sequences, and efficiently cleaved during standard nucleic acid deprotection protocols. Moreover, we utilize our TOS approach to perform ligation experiments to incorporate N3&#8242;&#8594;P5&#8242; phosphoramidate, and pyrophosphate linkages in DNA strands







Abstract
Tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (TOS) is an attractive strategy to increase automated oligonucleotide synthesis efficiency. TOS is accomplished via the introduction of an immolative linker within a single sequence composed of multiple oligonucleotide fragments. Here, we report the use of a commercially available building block, typically utilized for the chemical phosphorylation of DNA/RNA oligomers, to perform TOS. We show that the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldiethylene linker is efficiently self&#8208;immolated during the standard deprotection of DNA and RNA and presents itself as a generalizable methodology for nucleic acid TOS. Furthermore, we show the utility of this methodology by assembling a model siRNA construct, and showcase a template&#8208;directed ligation pathway to incorporate phosphoramidate or pyrophosphate linkages within DNA oligomers.

         <dc:description>Precise information regarding the interaction between proteins and ligands at molecular resolution is crucial for effectively guiding the optimization process from initial hits to lead compounds in early stages of drug development. In this study, we introduce a novel aliphatic side chain isotope&#8208;labeling scheme to directly probe interactions between ligands and aliphatic sidechains using NMR techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, we selected a set of Brd4&#8208;BD1 binders and analyzed 1H chemical shift perturbation resulting from CH&#8208;&#960; interaction of H&#946;&#8208;Val and H&#947;&#8208;Leu as CH donors with corresponding ligand aromatic moieties as &#960; acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;affinity and Metabolic Labeling Probes Based on the Opioid Alkaloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The opioids are powerful analgesics but carry many contingencies that can lead to opioid&#8208;use disorder. Chemical probes derived from the opioid alkaloids can provide deeper insight into the molecular interactions in a cellular context. Here, we designed and developed photo&#8208;click morphine (PCM&#8208;2) as a photo&#8208;affinity probe based on morphine and dialkynyl&#8208;acetyl morphine (DAAM) as a metabolic acetate reporter based on heroin. Application of these probes to SH&#8208;SY5Y, HEK293T, and U2OS cells revealed that PCM&#8208;2 and DAAM primarily localize to the lysosome amongst other locations inside the cell by confocal microscopy and chemical proteomics. Interaction site identification by mass spectrometry revealed the mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein, solute carrier family 25 member 3, SLC25A3, and histone H2B as acylation targets of DAAM. These data illustrate the utility of chemical probes to measure localization and protein interactions in a cellular context and will inform the design of probes based on the opioids in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Amino Acid&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids and Study of the Role of the Cationic Head Group for Enhanced Drug and Nucleic Acid Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leveraging liposomes for drug and nucleic acid delivery, though promising due to reduced toxicity and ease of preparation, faces challenges in stability and efficiency. To address this, we synthesized cationic amphiphiles from amino acids (arginine, lysine, and histidine). Histidine emerged as the superior candidate, leading to the development of three histidine&#8208;rich cationic amphiphiles for liposomes. Using the hydration method, we have prepared the liposomes and determined the optimal N/P ratios for lipoplex formation via gel electrophoresis. In vitro transfection assays compared the efficacy of our lipids to Fugene, while MTT assays gauged biocompatibility across cancer cell lines (MDA&#8208;MB 231 and MCF&#8208;7). The histidine&#8208;based lipid demonstrated marked potential in enhancing drug and nucleic acid delivery. This improvement stemmed from increased zeta potential, enhancing electrostatic interactions with nucleic acids and cellular uptake. Our findings underscore histidine's crucial role over lysine and arginine for effective delivery, revealing a significant correlation between histidine abundance and optimal performance. This study paves the way for histidine&#8208;enriched lipids as promising candidates for efficient drug and nucleic acid delivery, addressing key challenges in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural&#8208;Functional Correlations between Unique N&#8208;terminal Region and C&#8208;terminal Conserved Motif in Short&#8208;chain cis&#8208;Prenyltransferase from Tomato</title>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the unique N&#8208;terminal region and the C&#8208;terminal conserved RXG motif of neryl diphosphate synthase function with cooperative structural transitions in the dimer. X&#8208;ray crystallography employing massive data collections and a hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a heterogeneity of the active site and polymorphs of substrate binding mode.







Abstract
Neryl diphosphate (C10) synthase (NDPS1), a homodimeric soluble cis&#8208;prenyltransferase from tomato, contains four disulfide bonds, including two inter&#8208;subunit S&#8722;S bonds in the N&#8208;terminal region. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the S&#8722;S bond formation affects not only the stability of the dimer but also the catalytic efficiency of NDPS1. Structural polymorphs in the crystal structures of NDPS1 complexed with its substrate and substrate analog were identified by employing massive data collections and hierarchical clustering analysis. Heterogeneity of the C&#8208;terminal region, including the conserved RXG motifs, was observed in addition to the polymorphs of the binding mode of the ligands. One of the RXG motifs covers the active site with an elongated random coil when the ligands are well&#8208;ordered. Conversely, the other RXG motif was located away from the active site with a helical structure. The heterogeneous C&#8208;terminal regions suggest alternating structural transitions of the RXG motifs that result in closed and open states of the active sites. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the conserved glycine residue cannot be replaced. We propose that the putative structural transitions of the order/disorder of N&#8208;terminal regions and the closed/open states of C&#8208;terminal regions may cooperate and be important for the catalytic mechanism of NDPS1.

         <title>The Impact of Activating Agents on Non&#8208;Enzymatic Nucleic Acid Extension Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension is increasingly being studied for the production of RNA and DNA. These reactions benefit from producing RNA or DNA in an aqueous, protecting group free system, without the need for expensive enzymes. However, these primer extension reactions suffer from a lack of fidelity, low reaction rates, low overall yields, and short primer extension lengths. This review outlines a detailed mechanistic pathway for non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension and presents a review of the thermodynamic driving forces involved in entropic templating. Through the lens of entropic templating, the rate and fidelity of a reaction are shown to be intrinsically linked to the reactivity of the activating agent used. Thus, a strategy is discussed for the optimization of non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension, providing a path towards cost&#8208;effective in vitro synthesis of RNA and DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Indole&#8208;Based Imidazopyridine using &#945;&#8208;Amylase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine scaffold has gained significant attention due to its presence as a lead structure in several commercially available pharmaceuticals like zolimidine, zolpidem, olprinone, soraprazan, etc. Further, indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives have been found interesting due to their anticancer and antibacterial activities. However, limited methods have been reported for the synthesis of indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. In this study, we have successfully developed a biocatalytic process for synthesizing indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives using the &#945;&#8208;amylase enzyme catalyzed Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehyde, and isocyanide. The generality and robustness of this protocol were shown by synthesizing differently substituted indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in good isolated yields. Furthermore, to make &#945;&#8208;amylase a reusable catalyst for GBB multicomponent reaction, it was immobilized onto magnetic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials [Fe3O4@MIL&#8208;100(Fe)] and found reusable up to four consecutive catalytic cycles without the significant loss in catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenic Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes with Yellow and Red Fluorescence for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes stain the genomic DNA in the nuclei of living cells after metabolic labelling with 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine. The bright yellow or red fluorescence is the product of the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with the tetrazine as chemical reporter at the dyes. These labellings reactions are fast, work in the biological environment of cells, and the fluorescence is turned on by a factor of up to 250.

         <title>Design of Functional Globular &#946;&#8208;Sheet Miniproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of discrete &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides is far less advanced than e.g. the design of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides. The reputation of &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides as being poorly soluble and aggregation&#8208;prone often hinders active design efforts. Here, we show that this reputation is unfounded. We demonstrate this by looking at the &#946;&#8208;hairpin and WW domain. Their structure and folding have been extensively studied and they have long served as model systems to investigate protein folding and folding kinetics. The resulting fundamental understanding has led to the development of hyperstable &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds that fold at temperatures of 100&#176;C or high concentrations of denaturants. These have been used to design functional miniproteins with protein or nucleic acid binding properties, in some cases with such success that medical applications are conceivable. The &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds are not always completely rigid, but can be specifically designed to respond to changes in pH, redox potential or presence of metal ions. Some engineered &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides also exhibit catalytic properties, although not comparable to those of natural proteins. Previous reviews have focused on the design of stably folded and nonaggregating &#946;&#8208;sheet sequences. In our review, we now also address design strategies to obtain functional miniproteins from &#946;&#8208;sheet folding motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Copper Antagonism In Metalloenzymes And Anti&#8208;Copper Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the key lessons learned on Mo&#8722;Cu interaction in Mo/Cu&#8208;CODH and ORP and how it controls the elevated cellular Cu level involved in WD and cancer through Cu&#8722;TTM therapy.







Abstract
The connection between 3d (Cu) and 4d (Mo) via the &#8220;Mo&#8722;S&#8722;Cu&#8221; unit is called Mo&#8722;Cu antagonism. Biology offers case studies of such interactions in metalloproteins such as Mo/Cu&#8722;CO Dehydrogenases (Mo/Cu&#8722;CODH), and Mo/Cu Orange Protein (Mo/Cu&#8722;ORP). The CODH significantly maintains the CO level in the atmosphere below the toxic level by converting it to non&#8211;toxic CO2 for respiring organisms. Several models were synthesized to understand the structure&#8211;function relationship of these native enzymes. However, this interaction was first observed in ruminants, and they convert molybdate (MoO42&#8722;) into tetrathiomolybdate (MoS42&#8722;; TTM), reacting with cellular Cu to yield biological unavailable Mo/S/Cu cluster, then developing Cu&#8208;deficiency diseases. These findings inspire the use of TTM as a Cu&#8208;sequester drug, especially for treating Cu&#8208;dependent human diseases such as Wilson diseases (WD) and cancer. It is well known that a balanced Cu homeostasis is essential for a wide range of biological processes, but negative consequence leads to cell toxicity. Therefore, this review aims to connect the Mo&#8722;Cu antagonism in metalloproteins and anti&#8208;copper therapy.

         <title>DMSO&#8208;Related Effects on Ligand&#8208;Binding Properties of Lysine Methyltransferases G9a and SETD8</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

DMSO effects on protein&#8211;ligand affinity. Using two lysine methyltransferases (G9a/KMT1&#8197;C and SETD8/KMT5&#8197;A) and different orthogonal biophysical methods, Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF), microscale thermophoresis (MST), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we demonstrated that the effects of DMSO are protein&#8208; and technique&#8208;dependent and cannot be predicted or extrapolated on the basis of previous studies using different proteins and/or different assays.







Abstract
Being the standard solvent for preparing stock solutions of compounds for drug discovery, DMSO is always present in assay buffers in concentrations ranging from 0.1&#8201;% to 5&#8201;% (v/v). Even at the lowest concentrations, DMSO&#8208;containing solutions can have significant effects on individual proteins and possible pitfalls cannot be eliminated. Herein, we used two protein systems, the lysine methyltransferases G9a/KMT1&#8197;C and SETD8/KMT5&#8197;A, to study the effects of DMSO on protein stability and on the binding of the corresponding inhibitors, using different biophysical methods such as nano Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (nanoDSF), Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF), microscale thermophoresis (MST), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), all widely used in drug discovery screening campaigns. We demonstrated that the effects of DMSO are protein&#8208; and technique&#8208;dependent and cannot be predicted or extrapolated on the basis of previous studies using different proteins and/or different assays. Moreover, we showed that the application of orthogonal biophysical methods can lead to different binding affinity data, thus confirming the importance of using at least two different orthogonal assays in screening campaigns. This variability should be taken into account in the selection and characterization of hit compounds, in order to avoid data misinterpretation.

&lt;p&gt;Being the standard solvent for preparing stock solutions of compounds for drug discovery, DMSO is always present in assay buffers in concentrations ranging from 0.1&#8201;% to 5&#8201;% (v/v). Even at the lowest concentrations, DMSO-containing solutions can have significant effects on individual proteins and possible pitfalls cannot be eliminated. Herein, we used two protein systems, the lysine methyltransferases G9a/KMT1&#8197;C and SETD8/KMT5&#8197;A, to study the effects of DMSO on protein stability and on the binding of the corresponding inhibitors, using different biophysical methods such as nano Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (nanoDSF), Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF), microscale thermophoresis (MST), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), all widely used in drug discovery screening campaigns. We demonstrated that the effects of DMSO are protein- and technique-dependent and cannot be predicted or extrapolated on the basis of previous studies using different proteins and/or different assays. Moreover, we showed that the application of orthogonal biophysical methods can lead to different binding affinity data, thus confirming the importance of using at least two different orthogonal assays in screening campaigns. This variability should be taken into account in the selection and characterization of hit compounds, in order to avoid data misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assessing Lanthanide&#8208;Dependent Methanol Dehydrogenase Activity: The Assay Matters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No Lu&#8208;ck with lutetium! We compare a widely used artificial dye&#8208;coupled assay to assess the enzyme activity of lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases with a protein&#8208;coupled assay and show why the assay matters. Furthermore, we explain quickly why the metal content of metalloenzymes should be determined before any experiments and how this can help to obtain accurate and reliable data.







Abstract
Artificial dye&#8208;coupled assays have been widely adopted as a rapid and convenient method to assess the activity of methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Lanthanide(Ln)&#8208;dependent XoxF&#8208;MDHs are able to incorporate different lanthanides (Lns) in their active site. Dye&#8208;coupled assays showed that the earlier Lns exhibit a higher enzyme activity than the late Lns. Despite widespread use, there are limitations: oftentimes a pH of 9 and activators are required for the assay. Moreover, Ln&#8208;MDH variants are not obtained by isolation from the cells grown with the respective Ln, but by incubation of an apo&#8208;MDH with the Ln. Herein, we report the cultivation of Ln&#8208;dependent methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV with nine different Lns, the isolation of the respective MDHs and the assessment of the enzyme activity using the dye&#8208;coupled assay. We compare these results with a protein&#8208;coupled assay using its physiological electron acceptor cytochrome cGJ (cyt cGJ). Depending on the assay, two distinct trends are observed among the Ln series. The specific enzyme activity of La&#8208;, Ce&#8208; and Pr&#8208;MDH, as measured by the protein&#8208;coupled assay, exceeds that measured by the dye&#8208;coupled assay. This suggests that early Lns also have a positive effect on the interaction between XoxF&#8208;MDH and its cyt cGJ thereby increasing functional efficiency.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switching from oil&#8208;based to bio&#8208;based feedstocks to ensure the green transition to a sustainable and circular future is one of the most pressing challenges faced by many industries worldwide. For the cosmetics and personal and house care industries there is a strong drive to accelerate this transition from the customers that starts favoring the purchase of naturally derived and bio&#8208;degradable products over the traditionally available products. In this work we developed a series of fully biobased macromolecules constituted of a glycerol&#8208;based oligoester backbone. Based on the subsequent derivatization with fatty acids or peptides, the resulting products may find application as emulsifiers, wetting agents, and potential vectors for the delivery of bioactive peptides.

         <title>Investigating Protein Binding with the Isothermal Ligand&#8208;induced Resolubilization Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Target engagement assays typically detect and quantify the direct physical interaction of a protein of interest and its ligand through stability changes upon ligand binding. Commonly used target engagement methods detect ligand&#8208;induced stability by subjecting samples to thermal or proteolytic stress. Here we describe a new variation to these approaches called Isothermal Ligand&#8208;induced Resolubilization Assay (ILIRA), which utilizes lyotropic solubility stress to measure ligand binding through changes in target protein solubility. We identified distinct buffer systems and salt concentrations that compromised protein solubility for four diverse proteins: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), nucleoside diphosphate&#8208;linked moiety X motif 5 (NUDT5), poly [ADP&#8208;ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1), and protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Ligand&#8208;induced solubility rescue was demonstrated for these proteins, suggesting that ILIRA can be used as an additional target engagement technique. Differences in ligand&#8208;induced protein solubility were assessed by Coomassie blue staining for SDS&#8208;PAGE and dot blot, as well as by NanoOrange, Thioflavin T, and Proteostat fluorescence, thus offering flexibility for readout and assay throughput.</dc:description>

         <title>A tale of dual functions of SERF family proteins in regulating amyloid formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we briefly summarize four neuro&#8208;degenerative diseases related amyloidogenic proteins, focusing on the dual functions of the SERF family proteins in regulating the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory functions of SERF proteins, highlighting the critical role of electrostatic interactions in both the acceleration and the inhibition of amyloid fibril formation by SERF family proteins.







Abstract
The abnormal aggregation of proteins is a significant pathological hallmark of diseases, such as the amyloid formation associated with fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Understanding which cellular components and how these components regulate the process of abnormal protein aggregation in living organisms is crucial for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. MOAG&#8208;4/SERF is a conserved family of proteins with rich positive charged residues, which was initially identified as an enhancer for the formation of amyloids in C.&#8197;elegans. Knocking out SERF impedes the amyloid formation of various proteins, including &#945;&#8208;synuclein and &#946;&#8208;amyloid, which are linked to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, respectively. However, recent studies revealed SERF exhibited dual functions, as it could both promote and inhibit the fibril formation of the neurodegenerative disease&#8208;related amyloidogenic proteins. The connection between functions and structure basis of SERF in regulating the amyloid formation is still unclear. This review will outline the hallmark proteins in neurodegenerative diseases, summarize the contradictory role of the SERF protein family in promoting and inhibiting the aggregation of neurodegenerative proteins, and finally explore the potential structural basis and functional selectivity of the SERF protein.

         <title>Rational Design of Hydroxylated Thiazole Orange Photocages for Green Light&#8208;Triggered DNA Recombination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational modification of Hydroxylated thiazole orange (HTO) photocages with electron&#8208;donating groups, such as dimethoxy groups, resulted in high photolytic efficiency (up to &#1013;&#934;=320). This enabled the optical control of gene recombination in a ligand&#8208;dependent Cre&#8208;ERT2/loxP system in the living cells through the efficient uncaging of estrogen receptor ligands.







Abstract
The precise control of DNA recombination enables the cell&#8208; or time&#8208;dependent regulation of gene expression in studies of gene function. Caged estrogen receptor ligands combined with a Cre&#8208;ERT2/loxP system are useful tools for light&#8208;triggered DNA recombination. However, the photolysis of most caged compounds requires ultraviolet or blue light, which is toxic and displays low tissue penetration. Although a cyanine&#8208;based photo&#8208;responsive protecting group (PPG) can release estrogen receptor ligands with longer&#8208;wavelength light, its low photolytic efficiency requires long illumination times. We developed a caged estrogen receptor ligand with improved green light&#8208;responsive PPGs. The rational modification of Hydroxylated Thiazole Orange (HTO) photocages using electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), such as dimethoxy (DiMeO)&#8208;substituted HTO, resulted in high photolytic efficiency (up to &#1013;&#934; &#8776;320&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the enhanced photolytic efficiencies were derived from the increased intramolecular charge transfer by EDGs upon excitation. The efficient uncaging of estrogen receptor ligands enabled the control of gene recombination in a ligand&#8208;dependent Cre&#8208;ERT2/loxP system in live cells.

         <title>Histone globular domain epigenetic modifications: The regulators of chromatin dynamics in malaria parasite</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human malaria parasites contain unusual epigenetic marks at the histone globular domain. The chromatin structure organization is tightly regulated through histone globular domain epigenetic modifications to dictate differential gene activity in the malaria parasite during its development in RBCs and mosquitos.







Abstract
Plasmodium species adapt a complex lifecycle with multiple phenotypes to survive inside various cell types of humans and mosquitoes. Stage&#8208;specific gene expression in the developmental stages of parasites is tightly controlled in Plasmodium species; however, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be explored. Genome organization and gene expression for each stage of the malaria parasite need to be better characterized. Recent studies indicated that epigenetic modifications of histone proteins play a vital role in chromatin plasticity. Like other eukaryotes, Plasmodium species N&#8208;terminal tail modifications form a distinct &#8220;histone code,&#8221; which creates the docking sites for histone reader proteins, including gene activator/repressor complexes, to regulate gene expression. The emerging research findings shed light on various unconventional epigenetic changes in histone proteins&#8242; core/globular domain regions, which might contribute to the chromatin organization in different developmental stages of the malaria parasite. The malaria parasite lost many transcription factors during evolution, and it is proposed that the nature of local chromatin structure essentially regulates the stage&#8208;specific gene expression. This review highlights recent discoveries of unconventional histone globular domain epigenetic modifications and their functions in regulating chromatin structure dynamics in various developmental stages of malaria parasites.

         <title>Biocatalytic regioselective O&#8208;acylation of sesquiterpene lactones from chicory: a pathway to novel ester derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We report the first biocatalytic modification of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) found in the chicory plants, specifically lactucin (Lc), 11&#946;,13&#8208;dihydrolactucin (DHLc), lactucopicrin (Lp), and 11&#946;,13&#8208;dihydrolactucopicrin (DHLp). The selective O&#8208;acylation of their primary alcohol group was carried out by the lipase B from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8208;B) using various aliphatic vinyl esters as acyl donors. Perillyl alcohol, a simpler monoterpenoid, served as a model to set up the desired O&#8208;acetylation reaction by comparing the use of acetic acid and vinyl acetate as acyl donors. Similar conditions were then applied to DHLc, where five novel ester chains were selectively introduced onto the primary alcohol group, with conversions going from &gt;99 % (acetate and propionate) to 69 % (octanoate). The synthesis of the corresponding O&#8208;acetyl esters of Lc, Lp, and DHLp was also successfully achieved with near&#8208;quantitative conversion. Molecular docking simulations were then performed to elucidate the preferred enzyme&#8208;substrate binding modes in the acylation reactions with STLs, as well as to understand their interactions with crucial amino acid residues at the active site. Our methodology enables the selective O&#8208;acylation of the primary alcohol group in four different STLs, offering possibilities for synthesizing novel derivatives with significant potential applications in pharmaceuticals or as biocontrol agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Functionalization of Polysaccharide&#8208;Based Xylan Phenyl Carbonate Nanoparticles with Tumor Cell Specific Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use approach is presented for obtaining biocompatible polysaccharide&#8208;based nanoparticles (NP) that can act as tumor&#8208;specific drug delivery agents. Two antibodies are directly immobilized onto reactive xylan phenyl carbonate (XPC) NP; namely Cetuximab (CTX) that binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Atezolizumab (ATZ) that binds to programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). High coupling efficiency (up to 100%) are achieved without any pre&#8208;activation and no aggregation occurs during antibody immobilization. By quartz crystal microbalance experiments with dissipation monitoring (QCM&#8208;D), flow cytometry assays, and confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging it is demonstrated that the functionalized XPC&#8208;NP specifically bind to cells carrying the corresponding antigens. Moreover, the NP retain the antibody specific bioactivities (growth inhibition for CTX and induction of T&#8208;cell cytotoxicity for ATZ).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Peptides Containing a Combination of Free and 2&#8208;trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Carbamate Protected Lysine Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
trans&#8208;Cyclooctene (TCO) carbamates are a powerful protective group to mediate bioorthogonal chemical control over the activation of biomolecules. In this paper, a new synthetic approach for the synthesis of TCO protected peptides is disclosed, realizing the synthesis of bioorthogonally protected peptides of unprecedented complexity.







Abstract
The allylic trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) functionality facilitates powerful control over the spatiotemporal activity of bio&#8208;active molecules, enabling precision targeting of druglike and imaging modalities. However, the introduction of this function onto molecules remains chemically challenging, particularly for peptides. Modification with TCOs of this important class of biomolecules remains a challenge, primarily due to the sensitivity of the TCO group to the strong acids typically used in global deprotection during solid phase peptide synthesis. Here, we present a novel synthetic approach to site&#8208;selectively introduce TCO&#8208;groups in peptides. Our approach utilizes azide groups to mask amine functions, enabling selective introduction of the TCO on a single lysine residue. Staudinger reduction of the azides back to the corresponding amines proceeds without disturbing the sensitive TCO. We show that using our method, we can produce TCO&#8208;inactivated antigenic peptides of previously unseen complexity.

         <title>The Stereochemical Course of DmdC, an Enzyme Involved in the Degradation of Dimethylsulfoniopropionate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemical course of the dehydrogenase DmdC involved in the degradation of the marine sulfur compound dimethyl sulfoniopropionate (DMSP) along the demethylation pathway has been investigated using stereoselectively deuterated substrate surrogates. The results revealed an anti elimination with removal of the 2&#8208;pro&#8208;R and the 3&#8208;pro&#8208;S hydrogen atoms.







Abstract
The acyl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase DmdC is involved in the degradation of the marine sulfur metabolite dimethylsulfonio propionate (DMSP) through the demethylation pathway. The stereochemical course of this reaction was investigated through the synthesis of four stereoselectively deuterated substrate surrogates carrying stereoselective deuterations at the &#945;&#8208; or the &#946;&#8208;carbon. Analysis of the products revealed a specific abstraction of the 2&#8208;pro&#8208;R proton and of the 3&#8208;pro&#8208;S hydride, establishing an anti elimination for the DmdC reaction.

         <title>Heterochiral modifications enhance robustness and function of DNA in living human cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotide therapeutics are becoming increasingly important as more are approved by the FDA, both for treatment and vaccination. Similarly, dynamic DNA nanotechnology is a promising technique that can be used to sense exogenous input molecules or endogenous biomarkers and integrate the results of multiple sensing reactions in situ via a programmed cascade of reactions. The combination of these two technologies could be highly impactful in biomedicine by enabling smart oligonucleotide therapeutics that can autonomously sense and respond to a disease state. A particular challenge, however, is the limited lifetime of standard nucleic acid components in living cells and organisms due to degradation by endogenous nucleases. In this work, we address this challenge by incorporating mirror&#8208;image, L&#8208;DNA nucleotides to produce heterochiral &#8220;gapmers&#8221;. We use dynamic DNA nanotechnology to show that these modifications keep the oligonucleotide intact in living human cells for longer than an unmodified strand. To this end, we used a sequential transfection protocol for delivering multiple nucleic acids into living human cells while providing enhanced confidence that subsequent interactions are actually occurring within the cells. Taken together, this work advances the state of the art of l&#8208;nucleic acid protection of oligonucleotides and DNA circuitry for applications in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of Azabenzimidazole&#8208;Based PET Radioligands for &#947;&#8208;8 Dependent Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Protein Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play a pivotal role in excitatory neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus where the TARP &#947;&#8208;8 subunit is enriched and serves as a target for emerging anti&#8208;epileptic drugs. To enable in vivo visualization of TARP &#947;&#8208;8 distribution and expression by positron emission tomography (PET), this study focuses on the development of novel 18F&#8208;labeled TARP &#947;&#8208;8 inhibitors and their corresponding precursors, stemming from the azabenzimidazole scaffold. The resulting radioligands [18F]TARP&#8208;2204 and [18F]TARP&#8208;2205 were successfully synthesized with acceptable radiochemical yield, high molar activity, and excellent radiochemical purity. In vitro autoradiography demonstrates high level of specific binding of [18F]TARP&#8208;2205 to TARP &#947;&#8208;8 in both rat and nonhuman primate brain tissues. However, unexpected radiodefluorination in PET imaging studies of rodents emphasizes the need for further structural refinement. This work serves as an excellent starting point for the development of future 18F&#8208;labeled TARP &#947;&#8208;8 PET tracers, offering valuable insights into medicinal chemistry design, radiosynthesis and subsequent PET evaluation.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Anchoring a Luminescent Tag in a Protein with Non&#8208;Emissive Iridium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general method of site&#8208;specific anchoring a luminescent Ir(III) moiety via coordination of protein sidechains. A number of Ir(III) complexes were tested for attachment on a protein by coordinating to H/X (HisMet, HisHis, and HisCys) that are separated by i and i+4 in &#945;&#8208;helix. Replacement of the two labile water ligands in the iridium(III) complex by protein H/H residues increases the luminescent intensity up to over one hundred folds. This labeling approach has been demonstrated in a highly specific and efficient manner in a number of proteins, and it is also feasible for labeling target proteins in complex systems.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of proteins with synthetic fluorescent tag effectively improves the resolution of imaging, and such a labeling method with negligible three&#8208;dimensional structural perturbations and minimal impact on the biological functions of proteins is of high interest to dissect the high&#8208;resolution activities of biomolecules in complex systems. To this end, several non&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes [Ir(C&#8722;N)2(H2O)2]+OTF&#8722; (C&#8722;N denotes various cyclometalated ligands) were designed and synthesized. These complexes were tested for attaching a protein by coordinating to H/X (HisMet, HisHis, and HisCys) that are separated by i and i+4 in &#945;&#8208;helix. Replacement of the two labile water ligands in the iridium(III) complex by a protein HisHis pair increases the luminescent intensity up to over 100 folds. This labeling approach has been demonstrated in a highly specific and efficient manner in a number of proteins, and it is also feasible for labeling target proteins in cell lysates.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free synthesis of hydrophobic and amphiphilic esters using a chemically modified lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus: a comparative study with native and immobilized forms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the potential of a chemically modified lipase was demonstrated for esterification reactions using hydrophobic and amphiphilic substrates. The enzyme displayed outstanding catalytic performance under solvent&#8208;free conditions for all tested substrates, compared to their native and immobilized counterparts.







Abstract
Using lipases to catalyze the synthesis of the most differentiated type of compounds remains one of the major challenges among scientists. Seeking more economic and advantageous catalysts is a current goal of green chemistry. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of a chemically modified form of lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (cmLTL) for the synthesis of both hydrophobic (heptyl heptanoate, heptyl octanoate, heptyl decanoate, decyl heptanoate, decyl octanoate and decyl decanoate) and amphiphilic (2&#8208;(2&#8208;ethoxyethoxy)ethyl oleate and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;ethoxyethoxy)ethyl linoleate) esters, in bulk. The results were compared with its native (LTL) and immobilized (imLTL) forms. The data revealed that LTL showed poor activity for all reactions performed with n&#8208;heptane (&#951;&lt;20&#8201;%). ImLTL was able to synthesize all hydrophobic esters (&#951;&gt;60&#8201;%), with exception of the short ester, heptyl heptanoate. cmLTL was the only form of LTL capable of producing hydrophobic and amphiphilic esters, without compromising the yield when the reactions were performed under solvent&#8208;free conditions (&gt;50&#8201;%). Molecular modeling showed that the active pocket of cmLTL is able to deeply internalize transcutol, with stronger interactions, justifying the outstanding results obtained. Furthermore, owing to the possibility of cmLTL filtration, the reusability of the catalyst is ensured for at least 6 cycles, without compromising the reaction yields.

         <title>Development of Phenyl&#8208;substituted Isoindolinone&#8208; and Benzimidazole&#8208;type Cereblon Ligands for Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small library of compounds based on isoindolinone or 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole were constructed as potential cereblon binders. Their activity was explored using cell&#8208;based and biochemical binding assays. Several potent, selective, and cell&#8208;permeable CRBN ligands were identified. A potent BRD4 degrader was successfully developed from the 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole&#8208;derived ligand, suggesting the potential for these ligands to develop PROTAC degraders against many other therapeutic targets.







Abstract
Thalidomide, pomalidomide and lenalidomide, collectively referred to as immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), are frequently employed in proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase&#8208;recruiting ligands. However, their molecular glue properties that co&#8208;opt the CRL4CRBN to degrade its non&#8208;natural substrates may lead to undesired off&#8208;target effects for the IMiD&#8208;based PROTAC degraders. Herein, we reported a small library of potent and cell&#8208;permeable CRBN ligands, which exert high selectivity over the well&#8208;known CRBN neo&#8208;substrates of IMiDs by structure&#8208;based design. They were further utilized to construct bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) degraders, which successfully depleted BRD4 in the tested cells.

     alt="Development of Phenyl-substituted Isoindolinone- and Benzimidazole-type Cereblon Ligands for Targeted Protein Degradation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small library of compounds based on isoindolinone or 2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazole were constructed as potential cereblon binders. Their activity was explored using cell-based and biochemical binding assays. Several potent, selective, and cell-permeable CRBN ligands were identified. A potent BRD4 degrader was successfully developed from the 2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazole-derived ligand, suggesting the potential for these ligands to develop PROTAC degraders against many other therapeutic targets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thalidomide, pomalidomide and lenalidomide, collectively referred to as immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), are frequently employed in proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase-recruiting ligands. However, their molecular glue properties that co-opt the CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; to degrade its non-natural substrates may lead to undesired off-target effects for the IMiD-based PROTAC degraders. Herein, we reported a small library of potent and cell-permeable CRBN ligands, which exert high selectivity over the well-known CRBN neo-substrates of IMiDs by structure-based design. They were further utilized to construct bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) degraders, which successfully depleted BRD4 in the tested cells. Overall, we reported a series of functionalized CRBN recruiters that circumvent the promiscuity from traditional IMiDs, and this study is informative to the development of selective CRBN-recruiting PROTACs for many other therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling PET Hydrolase Surface Dynamics through Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PET hydrolases are an emerging class of enzymes that are being heavily researched for their use in bioprocessing polyethylene terephthalate (PET). While work has been done in studying the binding of PET oligomers to the active site of these enzymes, the dynamics of PET hydrolases binding to a bulk PET surface is an unexplored area. Here, methods were developed for total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy to study the adsorption and desorption dynamics of these proteins onto a PET surface. TIRF microscopy was employed to measure both on and off rates of two of the most commonly studied PET hydrolases, PHL7 and LCC, on a PET surface. It was found that these proteins have a much slower off rates on the order of 10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1, comparable to non&#8208;productive binding in enzymes such as cellulose. In combination with FRAP microscopy, a dynamic model is proposed in which adsorption and desorption dominates over lateral diffusion over the surface. The results of this study could have implications for the future engineering of PET hydrolases, either to target them to a PET surface or to modulate interaction with their substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>TAC&#8208;tics for Leveraging Proximity Biology in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically induced proximity refers to co&#8208;opting naturally occurring biological pathways using synthetic molecules. These proximity&#8208;inducing modalities are rapidly evolving to offer tremendous opportunities for drug development. This review summarizes the recent advances in the field, focusing on degraders and non&#8208;degrader modalities.







Abstract
Chemically induced proximity (CIP) refers to co&#8208;opting naturally occurring biological pathways using synthetic molecules to recruit neosubstrates that are not normally encountered or to enhance the affinity of naturally occurring interactions. Leveraging proximity biology through CIPs has become a rapidly evolving field and has garnered considerable interest in basic research and drug discovery. PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) is a well&#8208;established CIP modality that induces the proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, causing target protein degradation via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. Inspired by PROTACs, several other induced proximity modalities have emerged to modulate both proteins and RNA over recent years. In this review, we summarize the critical advances and opportunities in the field, focusing on protein degraders, RNA degraders and non&#8208;degrader modalities such as post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) modulators. We envision that these emerging proximity&#8208;based drug modalities will be valuable resources for both biological research and therapeutic discovery in the future.

         <title>Tripartite split&#8208;GFP for high throughput screening of small molecules: a powerful strategy for targeting transient/labile interactors like E2&#8208;E3 ubiquitination enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the in cellulo tripartite split&#8208;GFP assay for High Throughput Screening (HTS) of small molecules inhibiting an E2&#8208;E3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction (PPI). E3 and E2 are fused to GFP10 and GFP11 tags. When an E3 and an E2 interact, GFP10 and GFP11 come close together and reconstitute functional GFP. Molecules preventing the E2&#8208;E3 interaction prevent the reconstitution of a functional GFP







Abstract
The search for inhibitors of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an expanding area, due to the crucial role of UPS enzymes in several diseases. The complexity of the UPS and the multiple protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) involved, either between UPS proteins themselves or between UPS components and theirs targets, offer an incredibly wide field for the development of chemical compounds for specifically modulating or inhibiting metabolic pathways. However, numerous UPS PPIs are transient/labile, due the processivity of the system (Ubiquitin [Ub] chain elongation, Ub transfer, etc.). Among the different strategies that can be used either for deciphering UPS PPI or for identifying/characterizing small compounds inhibitors, the split&#8208;GFP approach offers several advantages notably for high throughput screening of drugs. Split&#8208;GFP is based on the principle of protein&#8208;fragment complementation assay (PCA). PCA allows addressing PPIs by coupling each protein of interest (POI) to fragments of a reporter protein whose reconstitution is linked to the interaction of the POI. Here, we review the evolution of the split&#8208;GFP approach from bipartite to tripartite Split&#8208;GFP and its recent applicability for screening chemical compounds targeting the UPS.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Regulators for Gene Switches to Program Mammalian Cell Behaviour</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules have been widely utilized within the synthetic biology community as trigger input for regulating implemented genetic circuit in engineered mammalian cells. Here, we described the most commonly used small molecules and their associated genetic switches, employed to program cell behaviors, particularly within a cell and gene therapy context.







Abstract
Synthetic or natural small molecules have been extensively employed as trigger signals or inducers to regulate engineered gene circuits introduced into living cells in order to obtain desired outputs in a controlled and predictable manner. Here, we provide an overview of small molecules used to drive synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;based gene circuits in mammalian cells, together with examples of applications at different levels of control, including regulation of DNA manipulation, RNA synthesis and editing, and protein synthesis, maturation, and trafficking. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of these small&#8208;molecule&#8208;responsive gene circuits, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of using small molecules as triggers, the mechanisms involved, and the requirements for selecting suitable molecules, including efficiency, specificity, orthogonality, and safety. Finally, we explore potential future directions for translation of these devices to clinical medicine.

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenic Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes with Yellow and Red Fluorescence for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High Turn&#8208;on and fast kinetics! The inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the synthesized yellow and red tetrazine&#8208;modified dyes with spirohexene&#8208;modified nucleosides and DNA provide large Stokes&#8208;shifts with high quantum yields. With no washing steps, cell imaging could be performed. We introduce two completely new dyes and spirohexene modfied compounds which extend the toolbox of already existing clickable modifications.







Abstract
An orange&#8208; and a red&#8208;emitting tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. Both dyes use the concept of the &#8220;two&#8208;factor&#8221; fluorogenicity for nucleic acids: (i) The dyes are nucleic&#8208;acid sensitive by their non&#8208;covalent binding to DNA, and (ii) their covalently attached tetrazine moiety quench the fluorescence. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208; and spirohexene&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to k2=280,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 305. Both dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with spirohexene&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The fluorescence is enhanced in living cells to such an extent that washing procedures before cell imaging are not required. Their large Stokes shifts (up to 0.77&#8197;eV) also makes them well suited for imaging because the wavelength ranges for excitation and emission can be best possible separated. Furthermore, the spirohexene&#8208;modified nucleosides and DNA extend and improve the toolbox of already existing &#8220;clickable&#8221; dyes for live cell imaging.

Furthermore, the spirohexene-modified nucleosides and DNA extend and improve the toolbox of already existing &#8220;clickable&#8221; dyes for live cell imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Evaluation of PROTACs Targeting Acyl Protein Thioesterase 1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PROTAC linker design remains mostly an empirical task. The PRosettaC software successfully generated ternary complex models for empirically designed sulfonyl&#8208;fluoride&#8208;based PROTACs targeting Acyl Protein Thioesterase 1 (APT1). Western blotting analysis and activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) revealed efficient degradation of APT1 with selected alkyl linker&#8208;based PROTACs showing remarkable selectivity for APT1 within serine hydrolases.







Abstract
PROTAC linker design remains mostly an empirical task. We employed the PRosettaC computational software in the design of sulfonyl&#8208;fluoride&#8208;based PROTACs targeting acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1). The software efficiently generated ternary complex models from empirically&#8208;designed PROTACs and suggested alkyl linkers to be the preferred type of linker to target APT1. Western blotting analysis revealed efficient degradation of APT1 and activity&#8208;based protein profiling showed remarkable selectivity of an alkyl linker&#8208;based PROTAC amongst serine hydrolases. Collectively, our data suggests that combining PRosettaC and chemoproteomics can effectively assist in triaging PROTACs for synthesis and providing early data on their potency and selectivity.

         <title>Development and Validation of a Fluorogenic Probe for Lysosomal Zinc Release</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the application of an indole&#8208;based probe for selective zinc sensing via suppression of PET and ESIPT processes. The probe is non&#8208;toxic and can detect lysosomal zinc in various cell lines without external zinc supplementation. It is also capable of staining the early and late stages of apoptosis in PAN&#8208;2 cells by tracking the zinc release.







Abstract
Zinc homeostasis, which allows optimal zinc utilization in diverse life processes, is responsible for the general well&#8208;being of human beings. This paper describes developing and validating an easily accessible indole&#8208;containing zinc&#8208;specific probe in the cellular milieu. The probe was synthesized from readily available starting materials and was subjected to steady&#8208;state fluorescence studies. It showed selective sensing behavior towards Zn2+ with reversible binding. The suppression of PET (Photoinduced Electron Transfer) and ESIPT (Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer) elicited selectivity, and the detection limit was 0.63&#8197;&#956;M (LOQ 6.8&#8197;&#956;M). The zinc sensing capability of the probe was also screened in the presence of low molecular weight ligands [LMWLs] and showed interference only with GSH and ATP. It is non&#8208;toxic and can detect zinc in different cell lines under various stress conditions such as inflammation, hyperglycemia, and apoptosis. The probe could stain the early and late stages of apoptosis in PAN&#8208;2 cells by monitoring the zinc release. Most experiments were conducted without external zinc supplementation, showing its innate ability to detect zinc.

         <title>In&#8208;Bridge Stereochemistry: A Determinant of Stapled Peptide Conformation and Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significance of in&#8208;bridge stereochemistry has been underscored as a decisive factor influencing stapled peptides&#8217; &#945;&#8208;helicity, protease resistance, protein&#8208;binding affinity, and various other properties. This aspect introduces fresh opportunities for the innovative design and development of novel peptide tools and therapeutics.







Abstract
Peptide side chain stapling has been proven to be an effective strategy for fine&#8208;tuning peptide properties. This innovative approach leads to the creation of stapled peptides characterized by stabilized &#945;&#8208;helical conformations, enhanced protein&#8208;binding affinity, improved cell permeability, superior enzymatic stability, and numerous other advantages. Extensive research has explored the impact of various stapling bridges on the properties of these peptides, with limited investigation into the influence of bridge chirality, until very recently. In this concise review, we provide a brief overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the stereochemistry within the bridges of stapled peptides, offering insights into the potential applications of chiral bridges in the design and development of stapled peptides.

         <title>The Guidelines for the Design and Synthesis of Transition Metal Atom Doped Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept elucidates the formation mechanism of transition metal atoms&#8208;doped carbon dots (TMAs&#8208;doped CDs) and offers design principles for TMAs&#8208;doped CDs, including ligand selection and specific TMAs choices. It also describes the challenges encountered by TMA&#8208;doped CDs and offers insights into their future prospects.







Abstract
Atoms doping is a practical approach to modulate the physicochemical properties of carbon dots (CDs) and thus has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Compared to non&#8208;metal atoms, transition metal atoms (TMAs) possess more unoccupied orbitals and larger atomic radii. TMAs doping can significantly alter the electronic structure of CDs and bestow them with new intrinsic characteristics. TMAs&#8208;doped CDs have exhibited widespread application potential as a new class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;based nanomaterials. However, challenges remain for the successful preparation and precise design of TMAs&#8208;doped CDs. The key to successfully preparing TMA&#8208;doped CDs lies in anchoring TMAs to the carbon precursors before the reaction. Herein, taking the formation mechanism of TMAs&#8208;doped CDs as a starting point, we systematically summarized the ligands employed for synthesizing TMAs&#8208;doped CDs and proposed the synthetic strategy involving multiple ligands. Additionally, we summarize the functional properties imparted to CDs by different TMA dopants to guide the design of TMA&#8208;doped CDs with different functional characteristics. Finally, we describe the bottlenecks TMAs&#8208;doped CDs face and provide an outlook on their future development.

         <title>Biotin&#8208;based strategies to explore the world of ubiquitin and ubiquitin&#8208;like modifiers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile biotin&#8208;based tools are highlighted here for studying ubiquitin&#8208; and ubiquitin&#8208;like modifications in cells and organisms. These powerful proteomic methods can eventually be coupled with other chemical biology concepts (e.&#8201;g. induced proximity pharmacology, targeted protein degradation, PROTACs, molecular glues, etc.) for addressing specificity and unraveling mechanisms in the complex ubiquitin signaling system.

Abstract
A complex code of cellular signals is mediated by ubiquitin and ubiquitin&#8208;like (Ub/UbL) modifications on substrate proteins. The so&#8208;called Ubiquitin Code specifies protein fates, such as stability, subcellular localization, functional activation or suppression, and interactions. Hundreds of enzymes are involved in placing and removing Ub/UbL on thousands of substrates, while the consequences of modifications and the mechanisms of specificity are still poorly defined. Challenges include rapid and transient engagement of enzymes and Ub/UbL interactors, low stoichiometry of modified versus non&#8208;modified cellular substrates, and protease&#8208;mediated loss of Ub/UbL in lysates. To decipher this complexity and confront the challenges, many tools have been created to trap and identify substrates and interactors linked to Ub/UbL modification. This review focuses on an assortment of biotin&#8208;based tools developed for this purpose (for example BioUbLs, UbL&#8208;ID, BioE3, BioID), taking advantage of the strong affinity of biotin&#8208;streptavidin and the stringent lysis/washing approach allowed by it, paired with sensitive mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based proteomic methods. Knowing how substrates change during development and disease, the consequences of substrate modification, and matching substrates to particular UbL&#8208;ligating enzymes will contribute new insights into how Ub/UbL signaling works and how it can be exploited for therapies.

         <title>Relationship of Thermostability and Binding Affinity in Metal&#8208;binding WW&#8208;Domain Minireceptors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hold on tight. Three metal&#8208;binding WW domains with significantly different thermal stabilities, were designed to investigate the relationship between thermostability and metal binding affinity. We show that the metal&#8208;binding affinities for Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II) correlate with the thermostabilities of the WW domains and attribute this to enhanced preorganization of the metal&#8208;binding site in the more thermally stable scaffolds.







Abstract
The design of metallo&#8208;miniproteins advances our understanding of the structural and functional roles of metals in proteins. We recently designed a metal&#8208;binding WW domain, WW&#8208;CA&#8208;Nle, which displays three histidine residues on its surface for coordination of divalent metals Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II). However, WW&#8208;CA&#8208;Nle is a molten globule in the apo state and thus showed only moderate binding affinities with Kd values in the &#956;M regime. In this report, we hypothesize that improved thermal stability of the apo state of the metal binding WW&#8208;domain scaffold should lead to improved preorganization of the metal&#8208;binding site and consequently to higher metal&#8208;binding affinities. By redesigning WW&#8208;CA&#8208;Nle, we obtained WW&#8208;CA variants, WW&#8208;CA&#8208;min and WW&#8208;CA&#8208;ANG, which were fully folded in the apo states and displayed moderate to excellent thermostabilities in the apo and holo states. We were able to show that the improved thermal stabilities led to improved metal binding, which was reflected in Kd values that were at least one order of magnitude lower compared to WW&#8208;CA&#8208;Nle. EPR spectroscopy and ITC measurements revealed a better defined and predisposed metal binding site in WW&#8208;CA&#8208;ANG.

         <title>Enzymatic Strategies for the Biosynthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Amino Acid Amides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic strategies for the activation of carboxylic acid in the biosynthesis of N&#8208;acyl amino acid amides are reviewed. ATP&#8208;dependent pathways activate the acid via acyl&#8208;AMP, acyl&#8208;CoA or acyl&#8208;ACP before conjugation with an amino acid, while ATP&#8208;independent pathways include the transient activation of the acid in the enzyme's catalytic site or the use of ester&#8208;aminolysis cascade reactions for ester&#8208;amide interconversion.







Abstract
Amide bond&#8208;containing biomolecules are functionally significant and useful compounds with diverse applications. For example, N&#8208;acyl amino acids (NAAAs) are an important class of lipoamino acid amides with extensive use in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Their conventional chemical synthesis involves the use of toxic chlorinating agents for carboxylic acid activation. Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed biotransformation for the green synthesis of these amides is therefore highly desirable. Here, we review a range of enzymes suitable for the synthesis of NAAA amides and their strategies adopted in carboxylic acid activation. Generally, ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes for NAAA biosynthesis are acyl&#8208;adenylating enzymes that couple the hydrolysis of phosphoanhydride bond in ATP with the formation of an acyl&#8208;adenylate intermediate. In contrast, ATP&#8208;independent enzymes involve hydrolases such as lipases or aminoacylases, which rely on the transient activation of the carboxylic acid. This occurs either through an acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate or by favorable interactions with surrounding residues to anchor the acyl donor in a suitable orientation for the incoming amine nucleophile. Recently, the development of an alternative pathway involving ester&#8208;amide interconversion has unraveled another possible strategy for amide formation through esterification&#8208;aminolysis cascade reactions, potentially expanding the substrate scope for enzymes to catalyze the synthesis of a diverse range of NAAA amides.

         <title>Selection and Characterization of DNA Aptamers for Cytidine and Uridine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the library&#8208;immobilization capture&#8208;SELEX method, a highly selective DNA aptamer for cytidine was isolated with a Kd of 0.9&#8197;&#956;M, whereas aptamers for uridine were of lower affinities. These aptamers do not bind to nucleobases or nucleotides and show good tolerance to metal ions.







Abstract
Cytidine and uridine are two essential pyrimidine ribonucleotides, and accurate detection of these nucleosides holds significant biological importance. While many aptamers were reported to bind purines, little success was achieved for pyrimidine binding. This study employs the library&#8208;immobilization capture&#8208;SELEX technique to isolate aptamers capable of selectively binding to cytidine and uridine. First, a selection was performed using a mixture of cytidine and uridine as the target. This selection led to the isolation of a highly selective aptamer for cytidine with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.9&#8197;&#956;M as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In addition, a dual&#8208;recognition aptamer was also discovered, which exhibited selective binding to both cytidine and uridine. Subsequently, a separate selection was carried out using uridine as the sole target, and the resulting uridine aptamer displayed a Kd of 4&#8197;&#956;M based on a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a Kd of 102&#8197;&#956;M based on ITC. These aptamers do not have a strict requirement of metal ions for binding, and they showed excellent selectivity since no binding was observed with their nucleobases or nucleotides. This study has resulted three aptamers for pyrimidines, which can be employed in biosensors and DNA switches.

         <title>Formation of Bridged Disulfide in Epidithiodioxopiperazines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epidithiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) alkaloids possess complex structures and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this concept, we summarize the biosynthesis of &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide bridged ETPs and outline the catalytic machineries for the transannular disulfide construction. This will facilitate the medical and industrial applications of ETPs.







Abstract
Epidithiodioxopiperazine (ETP) alkaloids, featuring a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine core and transannular disulfide bridge, exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. However, the structural complexity has prevented efficient chemical synthesis and further clinical research. In the past few decades, many achievements have been made in the biosynthesis of ETPs. Here, we discuss the biosynthetic progress and summarize them as two comprehensible metabolic principles for better understanding the complex pathways of &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide bridged ETPs. Specifically, we systematically outline the catalytic machineries to install &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by flavin&#8208;containing oxygenases. This concept would contribute to the medical and industrial applications of ETPs.

         <title>Novel bidentate amine ligand and the interplay between Pd(II) and Pt(II) coordination and biological activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt(II) and Pd(II)&#8208;coordinating N&#8208;donor ligands have been extensively studied following the success of cisplatin. In this work, a novel bidentate N&#8208;donor ligand, the N&#8208;[[4&#8208;(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]methyl]&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinemethanamine ligand, was designed to explore the antiparasitic, antiviral, and antitumor activity of its Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes. The ligand incorporates a benzyloxybenzyl moiety reported to improve the biological activity of several organic drugs. Chemical and spectroscopic characterization confirms the formation of [M(L)Cl2] complexes, where M = Pt(II) and Pd(II). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed a square&#8208;planar geometry for the Pd(II) complex, and spectroscopic characterization of the Pt(II) complex suggests a similar structure. 1H&#8208;NMR, 195Pt&#8208;NMR, and HR&#8208;MS analysis of DMSO solutions of the complexes indicated that both compounds exchange the chloride trans to the pyridine for a solvent molecule with different reaction rates. The ligand and the two complexes were tested for in vitro antitumoral, antileishmanial, and antiviral activities. The Pt(II) complex resulted in a GI50 value of 10.5 &#956;M against the NCI&#8208;ADR/Res (multidrug&#8208;resistant ovarian carcinoma) cell line. The ligand and the Pd(II) complex showed good anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 activity, with around a 65% reduction in viral replication at a concentration of 50 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting the Photo&#8208;Physical Properties of Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite nanocrystals show great potential in bioimaging due to their outstanding photophysical properties. Unleashing their capabilities across various imaging modalities requires a deep understanding of the origin of their photophysical properties. This review explores these crucial aspects, demonstrating how the distinctive features of perovskite nanocrystals can be harnessed for visible light, near&#8208;infrared, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.







Abstract
Perovskite nanomaterials have recently been exploited for bioimaging applications due to their unique photo&#8208;physical properties, including high absorbance, good photostability, narrow emissions, and nonlinear optical properties. These attributes outperform conventional fluorescent materials such as organic dyes and metal chalcogenide quantum dots and endow them with the potential to reshape a wide array of bioimaging modalities. Yet, their full potential necessitates a deep grasp of their structure&#8208;attribute relationship and strategies for enhancing water stability through surface engineering for meeting the stringent and unique requirements of each individual imaging modality. This review delves into this evolving frontier, highlighting how their distinctive photo&#8208;physical properties can be leveraged and optimized for various bioimaging modalities, including visible light imaging, near&#8208;infrared imaging, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Recent Advances in RNA&#8208;Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA interference (RNAi) that can specifically regulate the expression and function of certain genes by accurately delivering siRNA to disease lesions, blocking RNAs by small molecules, or covalently modifying the nucleotides has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in gene regulation and protein biosynthesis. Interfering the physiological function of key RNAs to induce cell apoptosis holds great promise for cancer treatment. Many RNA&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;cancer strategies have emerged continuously. Among them, RNA interference (RNAi) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic modality for various disease treatments. Nevertheless, the primary obstacle in siRNA delivery&#8208;escaping the endosome and crossing the plasma membrane severely impedes its therapeutic potential. Thus far, a variety of nanosystems as well as carrier&#8208;free bioconjugation for siRNA delivery have been developed and employed to enhance the drug delivery and anti&#8208;tumor efficiency. Besides, the use of small molecules to target specific RNA structures and disrupt their function, along with the covalent modification of RNA, has also drawn tremendous attention recently owing to high therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we will provide an overview of recent progress in RNA&#8208;targeted cancer therapy including various siRNA delivery strategies, RNA&#8208;targeting small molecules, and newly emerged covalent RNA modification. Finally, challenges and future perspectives faced in this research field will be discussed.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Host&#8208;Guest Assembly/Disassembly for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the superior biocompatibility and specificity for specific substrates, enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies have wide biomedical applications. Herein, we provide a review concerning the concept of enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies, illustrate and discuss several recent relative works, and analyze its ongoing challenges and possible solutions in the future.







Abstract
Compared with the normal assembly/disassembly approaches, enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly strategies due to their superior biocompatibility and specificity for specific substrates, can more effectively and precisely release molecules at lesions for reflecting in&#8197;vivo biological events. Specifically, due to the over&#8208;expression of enzymes in specific tissues, the assembly/disassembly processes can directly occur on the pathological sites (or regions of interest), thus these enzyme&#8208;instructed processes are widely and effectively used for disease treatment or precise bioimaging. Based on it, we introduce the concept and major strategies of enzyme&#8208;instructed host&#8208;guest assembly/disassembly, illustrate their importance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and review their advances in biomedical applications. Further, the challenges of these strategies in the clinic and future tendencies are also prospected.

         <title>A Tight Contact: The Expanding Application of Salicylaldehydes in Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylaldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands can bind the protein targets forming imines with lysine&#8208;amino groups. This drug design improves the affinity and selectivity for specific biological targets. Given the abundance of lysine residues in proteins and the reversible covalent (RC) nature of ligand&#8208;protein interaction, SA&#8208;bearing ligands hold significant promise for future pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
The installation of aldehydes into synthetic protein ligands is an efficient strategy to engage protein lysine residues in remarkably stable imine bonds and augment the compound affinity and selectivity for their biological targets. The high frequency of lysine residues in proteins and the reversibility of the covalent ligand&#8208;protein bond support the application of aldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands, holding promises for their future use as drugs. This review highlights the increasing exploitation of salicylaldehyde modules in various classes of protein binders, aimed at the reversible&#8208;covalent engagement of lysine residues.

         <title>Immunological Quantitation of the Glycation Site Lysine&#8208;414 in Serum Albumin in Human Plasma Samples by Indirect ELISA Using Highly Specific Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycation sites on human serum albumin (HSA) appear to be potential biomarkers for diabetes mellitus. In contrast to previous mass spectrometry techniques, immunoassays including ELISA using specific and sensitive antibodies directed against the glycation site (e.g. Lys414) are suitable for high&#8208;throughput screening and thus for routine laboratory analysis.







Abstract
Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder that is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, is common throughout the world and its prevalence is steadily increasing. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent acute complications and life&#8208;threatening long&#8208;term organ damage. Glycation sites in human serum albumin (HSA) are considered to be promising biomarkers of systemic glycemic status. This work aimed to develop a sensitive and clinically applicable ELISA for the quantification of glycation site Lys414 in HSA (HSAK414). The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated by immunizing mice with a glycated peptide. The established indirect ELISA based on mAb 50D8 (IgG1 isotype) yielded a limit of detection of 0.39&#8197;nmol/g HSA for HSAK414 with a linear dynamic range from 0.50 to 6.25&#8197;nmol/g glycated HSA. The inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;day assays with coefficients of variation less than 20&#8201;% indicated good assay performance and precision. Assay evaluation was based on plasma samples from diabetic and non&#8208;diabetic subjects with known HSAK414 glycation levels previously determined by LC&#8211;MS. Both data sets correlated very well. In conclusion, the generated mAb 50D8 and the established ELISA could be a valuable tool for the rapid quantitation of glycation site HSAK414 in plasma samples to evaluate its clinical relevance.
