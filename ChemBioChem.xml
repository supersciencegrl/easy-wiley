         <title>Strategies for synthesizing and enhancing&#160; the immune response of cancer vaccines based on MUC1 glycopeptide antigens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer vaccines are based on a vaccinology strategy whereby the patient&#8217;s immune system is harnessed to induce a specific immune response to kill cancer cells and comprises two categories: prophylactic and therapeutic. Glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1), which is overexpressed and poorly glycosylated on cancer cells, is one of the most promising candidates for the development of new cancer vaccines. However, it should be noted that mucin&#8208;like glycopeptides are poorly immunogenic and unable to elicit effective and long&#8208;lasting immune responses. Therefore, MUC1&#8208;derived tumor antigens need to be conjugated with immune activators. This review focuses on the synthesis of MUC1 glycopeptides, provides an overview of recently advanced designs of vaccines based on MUC1, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the various strategies devised to date.</dc:description>

         <title>HaloTag&#8208;based reporters for fluorescence imaging and biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing the structure and dynamics of biomolecules is critical to understand biological function, and requires methods to fluorescently label targets of interest in their cellular context. Self&#8208;labelling proteins, which combine a genetically encoded tag with a small&#8208;molecule fluorophore, have attracted considerable attention for this purpose, as they can overcome limitations of fluorescent proteins. Among them, the HaloTag protein is the most broadly used, showing fast specific labelling with a small, easy to functionalize and cell&#8208;permeant ligand. Synthetic chemistry and protein engineering have provided a portfolio of powerful imaging tools exploiting HaloTag, along with general methods to optimize and adapt them to specific applications. Here, we provide an overview of fluorescent reporters based on the HaloTag protein for imaging and biosensing, highlighting engineering strategies and general applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Biocatalytic Synthesis of Aromatic Acid CoA Thioesters utilizing Microbial Aromatic Acid CoA Ligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically labile ester linkages can be introduced into lignin by incorporation of monolignol conjugates, which are synthesized in planta by acyltransferases that use a coenzyme A (CoA) thioester donor and a nucleophilic monolignol alcohol acceptor. The presence of these esters facilitates processing and aids in the valorization of renewable biomass feedstocks. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is potentially limited by the low steady&#8208;state levels of aromatic&#8208;acid thioester donors in plants. As part of an effort to overcome this, aromatic&#8208;acid CoA ligases involved in microbial aromatic degradation were identified and screened against a broad panel of substituted&#8208;cinnamic and benzoic acids involved in plant lignification. Functional fingerprinting of this ligase library identified four robust highly active enzymes capable of facile, rapid, and high&#8208;yield synthesis of aromatic&#8208;acid CoA thioesters under mild aqueous reaction conditions mimicking in planta activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysosomes targeting pH activable imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemistry&#8208;based medical treatment combining light at a specific wavelength and a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of oxygen. Application of PDT as a conventional treatment is limited and clearly the approval in clinics of new PS is challenging. The selective accumulation of the PS in the targeted malignant cells is of paramount importance to reduce the side effects that are typical of the current worldwide approved PS. Here we report a new series of aniline&#8208; and iodine&#8208;substituted BODIPY derivatives (1&#8208;3) as promising lysosome&#8208;targeting and pH&#8208;responsive theranostic PS, which displayed a significant in vitro light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity, efficient imaging properties and low dark toxicity (for 2 and 3). These compounds were obtained in few reproducible synthetic steps and good yields. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations confirmed the quenching of the emissive properties of the PS, while both fluorescence and 1O2 emission were obtained only under acidic conditions inducing amine protonation. The pKa values and pH&#8208;dependent emissive properties of 1&#8208;3 being established, their cellular uptake and activation in the lysosomal vesicles (pH &#8776; 4&#8208;5) were confirmed by their co&#8208;localization with the commercial LysoTracker deep red and light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity (IC50 between 0.16 and 0.06 &#181;M) against HeLa cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Glycocalyx Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New advances in developing tools to engineer surface glycocalyx on live cells and donor organs have paved a transformative road towards glycotherapy for anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammation, and anti&#8208;autoimmune agents, as well as transplantation and other uses.







Abstract
A heavy layer of glycans forms a brush matrix bound to the outside of all the cells in our bodies; it is referred to as the &#8220;sugar forest&#8221; or glycocalyx. Beyond the increased appreciation of the glycocalyx over the past two decades, recent advances in engineering the glycocalyx on live cells have spurred the creation of cellular drugs and novel medical treatments. The development of new tools and techniques has empowered scientists to manipulate the structures and functions of cell&#8208;surface glycans on target cells and endow target cells with desired properties. Herein, we provide an overview of live&#8208;cell glycocalyx engineering strategies for controlling the cell&#8208;surface molecular repertory to suit therapeutic applications, even though the realm of this field remains young and largely unexplored.

         <title>Missing Pieces in Structure Puzzles: How Hyperpolarized NMR Spectroscopy Can Complement Structural Biology and Biochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing inaccessible spaces: The inclusion of hyperpolarized NMR in established experimental methods can provide complementary information about formerly inaccessible conformational spaces. Structural models under physiological conditions or of short&#8208;lived intermediates can be depicted in high detail through the use of hyperpolarized buffers, especially in the context of dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DDNP).







Abstract
Structure determination lies at the heart of many biochemical research programs. However, the &#8220;giants&#8221;: X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance, among others, leave quite a few dark spots on the structural pictures drawn of proteins, nucleic acids, membranes, and other biomacromolecules. For example, structural models under physiological conditions or of short&#8208;lived intermediates often remain out of reach of the established experimental methods. This account frames the possibility of including hyperpolarized, that is, dramatically signal&#8208;enhanced NMR in existing workflows to fill these spots with detailed depictions. We highlight how integrating methods based on dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization can provide valuable complementary information about formerly inaccessible conformational spaces for many systems.

     alt="Missing Pieces in Structure Puzzles: How Hyperpolarized NMR Spectroscopy Can Complement Structural Biology and Biochemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessing inaccessible spaces&lt;/b&gt;: The inclusion of hyperpolarized NMR in established experimental methods can provide complementary information about formerly inaccessible conformational spaces. Structural models under physiological conditions or of short-lived intermediates can be depicted in high detail through the use of hyperpolarized buffers, especially in the context of dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DDNP).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structure determination lies at the heart of many biochemical research programs. However, the &#8220;giants&#8221;: X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance, among others, leave quite a few dark spots on the structural pictures drawn of proteins, nucleic acids, membranes, and other biomacromolecules. For example, structural models under physiological conditions or of short-lived intermediates often remain out of reach of the established experimental methods. This account frames the possibility of including hyperpolarized, that is, dramatically signal-enhanced NMR in existing workflows to fill these spots with detailed depictions. We highlight how integrating methods based on dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization can provide valuable complementary information about formerly inaccessible conformational spaces for many systems. A particular focus will be on hyperpolarized buffers to facilitate the NMR structure determination of challenging systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stairway to Stereoisomers: Engineering Short&#8208; and Medium&#8208;Chain Ketoreductases To Produce Chiral Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most chiral alcohols are generated in labs by using short&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductases. In the natural world, they produce biopolymers, active pharmaceutical intermediates and bioactive compounds. Different engineering and catalysis methods have helped turn these enzymes into effective catalysts; however, the ever&#8208;increasing number of new molecules with chiral centres entails an introspection into engineering these catalysts. This review attempts to encapsulate and summarize the structural hotspots focussed on obtaining chiral synthons of interest.







Abstract
The short&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamilies are responsible for most chiral alcohol production in laboratories and industries. In nature, they participate in diverse roles such as detoxification, housekeeping, secondary metabolite production, and catalysis of several chemicals with commercial and environmental significance. As a result, they are used in industries to create biopolymers, active pharmaceutical intermediates (APIs), and are also used as components of modular enzymes like polyketide synthases for fabricating bioactive molecules. Consequently, random, semi&#8208;rational and rational engineering have helped transform these enzymes into product&#8208;oriented efficient catalysts. The rise of newer synthetic chemicals and their enantiopure counterparts has proved challenging, and engineering them has been the subject of numerous studies. However, they are frequently limited to the synthesis of a single chiral alcohol. The study attempts to defragment and describe hotspots of engineering short&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenases/reductases for the production of chiral synthons.

         <title>A Detailed View on Geosmin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bacterial geosmin synthase is a fascinating bifunctional enzyme that has been discovered almost two decades ago. Several aspects of the cyclisation mechanism from FPP to geosmin are known, but a detailed picture of the stereochemical course of this reaction is unknown. This article reports on a deep investigation of the mechanism of geosmin synthase through isotopic labelling experiments. Furthermore, the effects of divalent cations on geosmin synthase catalysis were investigated. The addition of cyclodextrin to enzymatic reactions, a molecule that can capture terpenes, suggests that the biosynthetic intermediate (1(10)E,5E)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;11&#8208;ol produced by the N&#8208;terminal domain is passed to the C&#8208;terminal domain not through a tunnel, but rather through release into the medium and uptake by the C&#8208;terminal domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of 2&#8208;Methylthio&#8208;methylenethio&#8208;N6&#8208;(cis&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyisopentenyl)adenosine (msms2io6A37) as a Novel Modification at Adenosine 37&#8201;of tRNAs from Salmonella typhimurium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New modification in an old pathway: Using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, we report msms2io6A as a novel derivative of the ms2io6A biosynthesis pathway of tRNAs from S.&#8197;typhimurium. This new redox hydroxylation reaction depends on the activity of tRNA&#8208;hydroxylase enzyme MiaE.







Abstract
Post&#8208;transcriptional modifications of tRNA nucleotide are important determinants in folding, structure and function. We have successfully identified and characterized a new modified base named 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;methylenethio&#8208;N6&#8208;(cis&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyisopentenyl)adenosine, which is present at position 37 in some tRNAs. We also showed that this new modified adenosine is derived from the known 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;methylenethio&#8208;N6&#8208;(isopentenyl)adenosine nucleoside by a catalytic cycle of the tRNA&#8208;diiron monooxygenase, MiaE, present in Salmonella typhimurium.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional chemotherapy (CT) is associated with severe side effects and inducible resistance, making it difficult to meet clinical requirements, forcing the development of new multifunctional prodrugs for precision medicine. In recent decades, researchers and clinicians have focused on developing of multifunctional chemotherapeutic prodrugs with tumor&#8208;targeting capability, activatable and traceable chemotherapeutic activity, as a powerful tool to improve theranostic&#160;outcomes in cancer treatment. The conjugates of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic fluorophores and chemotherapy reagents create an exciting avenue for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery and distribution, as well as the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy&#160;(PDT). Therefore, there are great opportunities for researchers to conceive and exploit multifunctional prodrugs that can visualize chemo&#8208;drugs release and tumor treatment in vivo. In this review, the design strategy and the recent progress of multifunctional organic chemotherapeutic prodrugs for activating NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided therapy are described and discussed in detail. Finally, the prospects and challenges of multifunctional chemotherapeutic prodrugs for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided therapy are provided.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme fusion, the fusion of enzymes with different domains to a single protein, has been widely recognized as a promising strategy in the development of biocatalysts. Nature has evolved gene fusion to combine different catalytic enzymes to function as a fusion enzyme, and this strategy is utilized in many natural product biosynthetic pathways.&#160;Owing to rapid advances in genome sequencing and biosynthetic pathway characterization, there is increasing interest in fusion enzymes from fungal biosynthetic pathways, particularly those involved in tailoring steps. This concept aims to provide an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of fusion enzymes that catalyze tailoring reactions in the biosynthesis of fungal secondary metabolites. Since&#160;fungal fusion enzymes are often associated with novel metabolites,&#160;this pioneering work may stimulate the exploration of the structural diversity of fungal natural products through genome mining of the untapped biosynthetic pathways involving fusion enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa: Improving the Bioactivity of a p53/MDM2 Interaction Inhibitor by Introducing a Solvent&#8208;Exposed Methylene Group</title>

Look away. Modification of the p53/MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin&#8208;3a with an exocyclic methylene group generated the more potent inhibitor Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa. X&#8208;ray analysis of MDM2&#8208;bound Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa indicated that the exocyclic methylene group of Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa faces away from the protein surface. Our data suggest the introduction of exocyclic methylene groups as a possible approach by which to optimize the conformation of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Nutlin&#8208;3a is a reversible inhibitor of the p53/MDM2 interaction. We have synthesized the derivative Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa bearing an additional exocyclic methylene group in the piperazinone moiety. Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa is more active than Nutlin&#8208;3a against purified wild&#8208;type MDM2, and is more effective at increasing p53 levels and releasing transcription of p53 target genes from MDM2&#8208;induced repression. X&#8208;ray analysis of wild&#8208;type MDM2&#8208;bound Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa indicated that the orientation of its modified piperazinone ring was altered in comparison to the piperazinone ring of MDM2&#8208;bound Nutlin&#8208;3a, with the exocyclic methylene group of Nutlin&#8208;3a&#8208;aa pointing away from the protein surface. Our data point to the introduction of exocyclic methylene groups as a useful approach by which to tailor the conformation of bioactive molecules for improved biological activity.

         <title>Rational Design of a Highly Specific Prolyl Endopeptidase To Activate the Antihypertensive Effect of Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eat and relax: By using an energy&#8208;optimized rational design strategy, the antihypertensive properties of food&#8208;derived proteins have been activated through hydrolysis with highly specific proline endopeptidases.







Abstract
Enzymatic hydrolysis of food&#8208;derived proteins to produce bioactive peptides could activate food functions such as antihypertension. However, the diversity of enzymatic hydrolysis products can reduce bioactive peptides&#8217; efficacy. Highly specific proteases can homogenize the hydrolysis products to reduce the production of impotent peptides. In this study, we successfully obtained M.&#8197;xanthus prolyl endopeptidase mutant Y451M by constraint/free molecular dynamics simulations and binding energy calculations. The specificity of Y451M for proline was increased by 286&#8201;% compared to WT, while its activity was almost unchanged. Milk&#8208;derived substrates processed with Y451M showed an antihypertensive effect that was 567&#8201;% higher than without enzymes. The ability to activate food antihypertension increased 152&#8201;% and the use of enzyme by 192&#8201;% compared with WT. Specific proteases are thus valuable tools in the processing of complex substrates to obtain bioactive peptides.

         <title>Cannabidiol&#8208;loaded poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles with improved bioavailability as a potential for osteoarthritis therapeutic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non&#8208;intoxicating cannabinoid from cannabis sativa that has demonstrated efficacious against inflammation, which can be considered as a potential drug for arthritis treatment. However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability limit its clinical application. Here, we report an effective strategy to fabricate CBD&#8208;loaded poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles (CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs), with a spherical morphology and an average diameter of 238 nm. CBD was sustained release from CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs, which improved the bioavailability of CBD. The CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs effectively protect the damage of LPS to cell viability. We observed that CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs significantly suppressed LPS&#8208;induced primary rat chondrocyte expression of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1&#946; (IL&#8208;1&#946;), interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6), tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP&#8208;13). Remarkably, CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs also showed better therapeutic effects of inhibiting the degradation of the extracellular matrix of chondrocytes than equivalent CBD solution. In general, the fabrication CBD&#8208;PLGA&#8208;NPs showed good protection of primary chondrocytes in vitro and is a promising system for osteoarthritis treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Sequence&#8208;Penetration Relationships of Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major limitation for the development of more effective oligonucleotide therapeutics has been a lack of understanding of their penetration into the cytosol. While prior work has shown how backbone modifications affect cytosolic penetration, it is unclear how cytosolic penetration is affected by other features including base composition, base sequence, length, and degree of secondary structure. We have applied the chloroalkane penetration assay, which exclusively reports on material that reaches the cytosol, to investigate the effects of these characteristics on the cytosolic uptake of druglike oligonucleotides. We found that base composition and base sequence had moderate effects, while length did not correlate directly with degree of cytosolic penetration. Investigating further, we found that degree of secondary structure had the largest and most predictable correlations with cytosolic penetration. These methods and observations add an additional layer of design for maximizing the efficacy of new oligonucleotide therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the effects of mutagenesis on FusionRed using excited state QM/MM dynamics and classical force field simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are a powerful tool for examining tissues, cells, and subcellular components in vivo and in vitro. FusionRed is a particular FP variant mutated from mKate2 that, in addition to lower cytotoxicity and aggregation rates, has shown potential for acting as a tunable photoswitch. This was posited to stem partially from the presence of a bulky side chain at position 158 and a further stabilizing residue at position 157. In this work, we apply computational techniques including classical molecular dynamics (MD) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations (QM/MM) to explore the effect of mutagenesis at these locations in FusionRed on the excited state surface and relative stability of the chromophore in the protein pocket. We find connections between the statistical sampling of the underlying protein structure and the nonradiative decay mechanisms from excited state dynamics. A single mutation (C158I) which restricts the motion of the chromophore via a favorable hydrophobic interaction corresponds to an increase in FQY, while a second rescue mutation (C158I&#8208;A157N) partially restores the flexibility of the chromophore and photoswitchability with favorable water interactions on the surface of the protein that counteracts the original interaction. We suggest that applying this understanding of structural features that inhibit or favor rotation on the excited state can be applied for rational design of new, tunable and red photoswitches.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Multienzyme Assemblies for Natural Product Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing multienzyme complexes has become an effective way to optimize metabolic flux and increase the titer of natural products in metabolic engineering recently. In this review, we summarize strategies for constructing synthetic multienzyme complexes in microbial cells and their applications in promoting natural product biosynthesis.







Abstract
In nature, enzymes that catalyze sequential reactions are often assembled as clusters or complexes. The formation of multienzyme complexes, or metabolons, brings the enzyme active sites into proximity to promote intermediate transfer, decrease intermediate leakage, and streamline the metabolic flux towards the desired products. We and others have developed synthetic versions of metabolons through various strategies to enhance the catalytic rates for synthesizing valuable chemicals inside microbes. Synthetic multienzyme complexes range from static enzyme nanostructures to dynamic enzyme coacervates. Enzyme complexation optimizes the metabolic fluxes inside microbes, increases the product titer, and supplies the field with high&#8208;yield microbe strains that are amenable to large&#8208;scale fermentation. Enzyme complexes constructed inside microbial cells can be separated as independent entities and catalyze biosynthetic reactions ex vivo; such a feature gains these complexes another name, &#8220;synthetic organelles&#8221; &#8211; new subcellular entities with independent structures and functions. Still, the field is seeking new strategies to better balance dynamicity and confinement and to achieve finer control of local compartmentalization in the cells, as the natural multienzyme complexes do. Industrial applications of synthetic multienzyme complexes for the large&#8208;scale production of valuable chemicals are yet to be realized. This review focuses on synthetic multienzyme complexes that are constructed and function inside microbial cells.

Industrial applications of synthetic multienzyme complexes for the large-scale production of valuable chemicals are yet to be realized. This review focuses on synthetic multienzyme complexes that are constructed and function inside microbial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;biofilm Activity of Human Milk Oligosaccharides in Clinical Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae with Diverse Capsular and Sequence Types</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shooting down a film: Purified human milk oligosaccharides have potent anti&#8208;biofilm activity against diverse colonizing and invasive clinical isolates of Group&#8197;B Streptococcus. HMOs can inhibit and dismantle biofilm in both invasive and colonizing strains of GBS, which is more clinically relevant than eradicating only their free&#8208;floating counterparts.







Abstract
Group&#8197;B Streptococcus (GBS) is an encapsulated Gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathogen that causes severe perinatal infections. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are short&#8208;chain sugars that have recently been shown to possess antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against a variety of bacterial pathogens, including GBS. We have expanded these studies to demonstrate that HMOs can inhibit and dismantle biofilm in both invasive and colonizing strains of GBS. A cohort of 30 diverse strains of GBS were analyzed for susceptibility to HMO&#8208;dependent biofilm inhibition or destruction. HMOs were significantly effective at inhibiting biofilm in capsular&#8208;type&#8208; and sequence&#8208;type&#8208;specific fashion, with significant efficacy in CpsIb, CpsII, CpsIII, CpsV, and CpsVI strains as well as ST&#8208;1, ST&#8208;12, ST&#8208;19, and ST&#8208;23 strains. Interestingly, CpsIa as well as ST&#8208;7 and ST&#8208;17 were not susceptible to the anti&#8208;biofilm activity of HMOs, underscoring the strain&#8208;specific effects of these important antimicrobial molecules against the perinatal pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae.

         <title>Enabling Technologies in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Automated Glycan Assembly, Flow Chemistry and Data Science</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of homogeneous oligosaccharides is still a challenging task. A series of technologies, including automated glycan assembly, flow chemistry and data science solutions, have enabled the synthesis of structures with unprecedented complexity. It is expected that more results can be obtained by further synergies between these tools.







Abstract
The synthesis of defined oligosaccharides is a complex task. Several enabling technologies have been introduced in the last two decades to facilitate synthetic access to these valuable biomolecules. In this concept, we describe the technological solutions that have advanced glycochemistry using automated glycan assembly, flow chemistry and data science as examples. We highlight how the synergies between these different technologies can further advance the field, with progress toward the realization of a self&#8208;driving lab for glycan synthesis.

         <title>dSTORM&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Cell Protein Quantitative Analysis Can Effectively Evaluate the Degradation Ability of PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting density dynamics: By using innovative single&#8208;color and two&#8208;color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, we have developed a simple and visual method that could analyze dynamic density changes in proteins of interest after treatment with PROTACs, at the single&#8208;cell level and in a fully quantitative degree. This method will be useful in screening PROTACs and accelerating the development of new PROTACs.







Abstract
As an emerging therapeutic strategy, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been proven to be superior to traditional drugs in many aspects. However, due to their unique mechanism of action, existing methods for evaluating the degradation still have many limitations, which seriously restricts the development of PROTACs. In this methodological study, using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM)&#8208;based single&#8208;cell protein quantitative analysis, we systematically investigated the dynamic degradation characteristics of FLT3 protein during PROTACs treatment. We found that the distribution of FLT3 varies between FLT3&#8208;ITD mutation and FLT3&#8208;WT cells. PROTACs had an obvious time&#8208;course effect on protein degradation and present two distinct phases; this provided a basis for deciding when to evaluate protein degradation. High concentrations of PROTACs were more effective than long&#8208;time administration because a higher Dmax was achieved. Two&#8208;color dSTORM&#8208;based colocalization analysis efficiently detected the proportion of ternary complexes, making it very useful in screening PROTACs. Taken together, our findings show that the dSTORM method is an ideal tool for evaluating PROTACs and will accelerate the development of new PROTACs.

         <title>Facile de Novo Sequencing of Tetrazine&#8208;Cyclized Peptides through UV&#8208;Induced Ring&#8208;Opening and Cleavage from the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful design and synthesis of solid&#8208;phase&#8208;bound monocyclic peptides with various charges and hydrophobicity are presented. The design allows the bead&#8208;bound peptides to be linearized and cleaved from the solid phase by a single&#8208;step UV irradiation, allowing facile sequence identification by using tandem mass spectrometry.







Abstract
While most FDA&#8208;approved peptide drugs are cyclic, the robust cyclization chemistry of peptides and the deconvolution of cyclic peptide sequences by using tandem mass spectrometry render cyclic peptide drug discovery difficult. Here we present the successful design of cyclic peptides on solid phase that addresses both of these problems. We demonstrate that this peptide cyclization method using dichloro&#8208;s&#8208;tetrazine on solid phase allows successful cyclization of a panel of random peptide sequences with various charges and hydrophobicities. The cyclic peptides can be linearized and cleaved from the solid phase by simple UV light irradiation, and we demonstrate that accurate sequence information can be obtained for the UV&#8208;cleaved linearized peptides by using tandem mass spectrometry. The tetrazine linker used in the cyclic peptides can further be explored for inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reactions for screening or bioconjugation applications in the future.

         <title>Selection of RNA&#8208;Cleaving TNA Enzymes for Cellular Mg2+ Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live&#8208;cell imaging: New RNA&#8208;cleaving TNA enzymes (TNAzymes) have been identified by in&#8197;vitro selection. TNAzyme 17&#8211;22 catalyzes RNA cleavage with a kcat of 0.017&#8197;min&#8722;1 in the presence of Mg2+. The TNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent sensor has a limit of detection of 0.35&#8197;mM and enables Mg2+ imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Catalytic DNA&#8208;based fluorescent sensors have enabled cellular imaging of metal ions such as Mg2+. However, natural DNA is prone to nuclease&#8208;mediated degradation. Here, we report the in&#8197;vitro selection of threose nucleic acid enzymes (TNAzymes) with RNA endonuclease activities. One such TNAzyme, T17&#8211;22, catalyzes a site&#8208;specific RNA cleavage reaction with a kcat of 0.017&#8197;min&#8722;1 and KM of 675&#8197;nM. A fluorescent sensor based on T17&#8211;22 responds to an increasing concentration of Mg2+ with a limit of detection at 0.35&#8197;mM. This TNAzyme&#8208;based sensor also allows cellular imaging of Mg2+. This work presents the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of using a TNA catalyst in cellular metal ion imaging.

         <title>Synthesis of Uronic Acid 1&#8208;Azasugars as Putative Inhibitors of &#945;&#8208;Iduronidase, &#946;&#8208;Glucuronidase and Heparanase

Potential chaperones: Uronic acid 1&#8208;azasugars (1&#8208;N&#8208;iminosugars) with l&#8208;IdoA and d&#8208;GlcA configurations and their corresponding enantiomers were efficiently synthesized from d&#8208; or l&#8208;arabinose. Compounds were evaluated for the inhibtion of &#945;&#8208;iduronidase, &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase and heparanase, and for activity as potential pharmacological chaperones for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS&#8197;I).







Abstract
1&#8208;Azasugar analogues of l&#8208;iduronic acid (l&#8208;IdoA) and d&#8208;glucuronic acid (d&#8208;GlcA) and their corresponding enantiomers have been synthesized as potential pharmacological chaperones for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS&#8197;I), a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding &#945;&#8208;iduronidase (IDUA). The compounds were efficiently synthesized in nine or ten steps from d&#8208; or l&#8208;arabinose, and the structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of key intermediates. All compounds were inactive against IDUA, although l&#8208;IdoA&#8208;configured 8 moderately inhibited &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase (&#946;&#8208;GLU). The d&#8208;GlcA&#8208;configured 9 was a potent inhibitor of &#946;&#8208;GLU and a moderate inhibitor of the endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase heparanase. Co&#8208;crystallization of 9 with heparanase revealed that the endocyclic nitrogen of 9 forms close interactions with both the catalytic acid and catalytic nucleophile.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Xanthone Analogues Conjugated with Aza&#8208;aromatic Substituents as Promising G&#8208;Quadruplex Stabilizing Ligands and their Selective Cancer Cell Cytotoxic Action</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not for normal cells: Xanthone aza&#8208;aromatic derivatives stabilize higher&#8208;order noncanonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures. Various biophysical experiments substantiated G4 stabilization by these promising small&#8208;molecular ligands. Compound&#8208;induced selective cytotoxic action in cancer cells over normal cells exhibited the potency of these small&#8208;molecules for use in anticancer therapeutics.







Abstract
We have examined the stabilization of higher&#8208;order noncanonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures formed by the G&#8208;rich sequences in the promoter region of oncogenes such as c&#8208;MYC, c&#8208;KIT, VEGF and BCl2 by newly synthesized, novel nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics conjugated to xanthone moiety. Compounds with N&#8208;heterocyclic substituents such as pyridine (XNiso), benzimidazole (XBIm), quinoxaline (XQX) and fluorophore dansyl (XDan) showed greater effectiveness in stabilizing the G4 DNA as well as selective cytotoxicity for cancer cells (mainly A549) over normal cells both in terms of UV&#8208;Vis spectral titrations and cytotoxicity assay. Both fluorescence spectral titrimetric measurements and circular dichroism (CD) melting experiments further substantiated the G4 stabilization phenomenon by these small&#8208;molecular ligands. In addition, these compounds could induce the formation of parallel G4 structures in the absence of any added salt condition in Tris&#8901;HCl buffer at 25&#8201;&#176;C. In a polymerase stop assay, the formation of stable G4 structures in the promoter of oncogenes and halting of DNA synthesis in the presence of the above&#8208;mentioned compounds was demonstrated by using oncogene promoter as the DNA synthesis template. Apoptosis&#8208;mediated cell death of the cancer cells was proved by Annexin V&#8208;PI dual staining assay and cell&#8208;cycle arrest occurred in the S phase of the cell cycles. The plausible mode of binding involves the stacking of the xanthone core on the G4 DNA plane with the possibility of interaction with the 5&#8217;&#8208;overhang as indicated by molecular dynamics simulation studies.

Solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence: A troponyl thymidine derivative exhibits solvatochromisim and localizes at HeLa cells&#8217; nuclei. Its triphosphate derivative is a substrate of DNA polymerase and gets enzymatically incorporated into DNA primer by DNA polymerases.







Abstract
Tropolone is a non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic scaffold with unique photophysical and metal&#8208;chelating properties. Recently, it has been conjugated with DNA, and the photophysical properties of this conjugate have been explored. Tropolonyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (tr&#8208;dU) is a synthetic fluorescent DNA nucleoside analogue that exhibits pH&#8208;dependent emissions. However, its solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties are unexplored owing to its poor solubility in most organic solvents. It would be interesting to incorporate it into DNA primer enzymatically. This report describes the solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties of the silyl&#8208;derivative, and enzymatic incorporation of its triphosphate analogue. For practical use, its cell&#8208;internalization and cytotoxicity are also explored. tr&#8208;dU nucleoside was found to be a potential analogue to design DNA probes and can be explored for various therapeutic applications in the future.

         <title>The Laccase of Myrothecium roridum VKM F&#8208;3565: A New Look at Fungal Laccase Tolerance to Neutral and Alkaline Conditions
</title>

How to work neutrally: A novel biotechnologically valuable laccase from the ascomycete Myrothecium roridum VKM F&#8208;3565, which is atypically active with the row of phenolic compounds and phenylpropanoids under neutral&#8208;alkaline conditions, has been extensively investigated. A new intramolecular proton channel claiming the pivotal role in the functioning of fungal alkaliphilic laccases under neutral or alkaline conditions was found.







Abstract
Most of the currently known fungal laccases show their maximum activity under acidic environmental conditions. It is known that a decrease in the activity of a typical laccase at neutral or alkaline pH values is the result of an increase in the binding of the hydroxide anion to the T2/T3 copper center, which prevents the transfer of an electron from the T1 Cu to the trinuclear copper center. However, evolutionary pressure has resolved the existing limitations in the catalytic mechanism of laccase, allowing such enzymes to be functionally active under neutral/alkaline pH conditions, thereby giving fungi an advantage for their survival. Combined molecular and biochemical studies, homological modeling, calculation of the electrostatic potential on the Connolly surface at pH&#8197;5.0 and 7.0, and structural analysis of the novel alkaliphilic laccase of Myrothecium roridum VKM F&#8208;3565 and alkaliphilic and acidophilic fungal laccases with a known structure allowed a new intramolecular channel near the one of the catalytic aspartate residues at T2&#8208;copper atom to be found. The amino acid residues of alkaliphilic laccases forming this channel can presumably serve as proton donors for catalytic aspartates under neutral conditions, thus ensuring proper functioning. For the first time for ascomycetous laccases, the production of new trimeric products of phenylpropanoid condensation under neutral conditions has been shown, which could have a potential for use in pharmacology.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Assisted Purification of Hydrophobic DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping things separate: The purification of cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA nanostructures has been demonstrated. The formation of aggregates is avoided by adding surfactants, which allows separation of the target structure from others by gel electrophoresis. The surfactant&#8208;assisted gel extraction method purifies the target structures. The purified structures retain the ability to attach to lipid vesicle membranes.







Abstract
Purification of functional DNA nanostructures is an essential step in achieving intended functions because misfolded structures and the remaining free DNA strands in a solution can interact and affect their behavior. However, due to hydrophobicity&#8208;mediated aggregation, it is difficult to purify DNA nanostructures modified with hydrophobic molecules by conventional methods. Herein, we report the purification of cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA nanostructures by using a novel surfactant&#8208;assisted gel extraction. The addition of sodium cholate (SC) to the sample solution before structure folding prevented aggregation; this was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. We also found that adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the sample inhibited structural folding. The cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA nanostructures prepared with SC were successfully purified by gel extraction, and their ability to bind to the lipid membrane surfaces was maintained. This method will facilitate the purification of DNA nanostructures modified with hydrophobic molecules and expand their applicability in the construction of artificial cell&#8208;like systems.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Incorporation of Functional Molecules into DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
No need for phosphoramidites: We have developed a simple and versatile postsynthetic approach for the incorporation of functional molecules into oligonucleotides in aqueous solution. By this method, functional molecules that are difficult to convert to phosphoramidite monomers can be easily incorporated into oligonucleotides. More generally, this method facilitates the conjugation of functional molecules to oligonucleotides.







Abstract
We report a versatile method for the incorporation of functional molecules into oligonucleotides carrying reactive groups by using a template&#8208;directed postsynthetic approach in the solution phase. For this purpose, we prepared oligonucleotides carrying an amino group on the backbone by using an acylic threoninol scaffold. The resulting oligonucleotides could be used to introduce almost any molecule carrying aldehyde, which can be, among other things, a metal&#8208;binding ligand or a fluorophore. In our study, we incorporated aldehyde&#8208;bearing phenanthroline, a metal&#8208;binding ligand, into oligonucleotides by template&#8208;directed reversible conjugation. We observed that the use of an abasic sugar site instead of a natural nucleobase in the template strand increased the yield of conjugation and induced selective incorporation of the phenanthroline. This method could lead progress in the development of probes for the recognition of abasic regions in duplex DNA. Moreover, template&#8208;directed formation of metal ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates might have potential applications in hybrid biocatalysis for enantioselective transformations.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Insights into FIH&#8208;Catalysed Hydroxylation of Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin Repeat Domains</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confirmation analysis: Following the differing conclusions of previous studies, we report biochemical and structural studies on asparaginyl hydroxylation of the ankyrin repeat domains of human transient receptor potential channels TRPA1 and TRPV3 as catalysed by the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate oxygenase factor inhibiting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (FIH).







Abstract
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have important roles in environmental sensing in animals. Human TRP subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) is responsible for sensing allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and other electrophilic sensory irritants. TRP subfamily vanilloid member 3 (TRPV3) is involved in skin maintenance. TRPV3 is a reported substrate of the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate oxygenase factor inhibiting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (FIH). We report biochemical and structural studies concerning asparaginyl hydroxylation of the ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs) of TRPA1 and TRPV3 catalysed by FIH. The results with ARD peptides support a previous report on FIH&#8208;catalysed TRPV3 hydroxylation and show that, of the 12 potential TRPA1 sequences investigated, one sequence (TRPA1 residues 322&#8211;348) undergoes hydroxylation at Asn336. Structural studies reveal that the TRPA1 and TRPV3 ARDs bind to FIH with a similar overall geometry to most other reported FIH substrates. However, the binding mode of TRPV3 to FIH is distinct from that of other substrates.

         <title>Chemoselective Labeling and Immobilization of Phosphopeptides with Phosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorimidazolide reagents react selectively with phosphoryl groups. Using a biotinylated, photocleavable phosphorimidazolide reagent a method was established for capture and release of phosphopeptides which has the potential to mildly and selectively enrich phosphopeptides in biological samples.







Abstract
Protein phosphorylation is one of the most ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modifications, regulating numerous essential processes in cells. Accordingly, the large&#8208;scale annotation of phosphorylation sites continues to provide central insight into the regulation of signaling networks. The global analysis of the phosphoproteome typically relies on mass spectrometry analysis of phosphopeptides, with an enrichment step necessary due to the sub&#8208;stoichiometric nature of phosphorylation. Several affinity&#8208;based methods and chemical modification strategies have been developed to date, but the choice of enrichment method can have a considerable impact on the results. Here, we show that a biotinylated, photo&#8208;cleavable phosphorimidazolide reagent permits the immobilization and subsequent cleavage of phosphopeptides. The method is capable of the capture and release of phosphopeptides of varying characteristics, and this mild and selective strategy expands the current repertoire for phosphopeptide chemical modification with the potential to enrich and identify new phosphorylation sites in the future.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Re&#8208;alignment of the Short Multifunctional Peptide BP100 in Membranes Revealed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A re&#8208;alignment of the short cationic helical peptide BP100 in membranes was detected by using solid&#8208;state 19F, 15N and 2H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy as well as MD simulations. High peptide concentration and temperatures just above the lipid phase transition promoted a flip from a surface&#8208;bound to transmembrane alignment. The inserted state was also favored by thin DLPC bilayers and by the presence of curvature&#8208;inducing lysolipids.







Abstract
BP100 is a cationic undecamer peptide with antimicrobial and cell&#8208;penetrating activities. The orientation of this amphiphilic &#945;&#8208;helix in lipid bilayers was examined under numerous conditions using solid&#8208;state 19F, 15N and 2H&#8197;NMR. At high temperatures in saturated phosphatidylcholine lipids, BP100 lies flat on the membrane surface, as expected. Upon lowering the temperature towards the lipid phase transition, the helix is found to flip into an upright transmembrane orientation. In thin bilayers, this inserted state was stable at low peptide concentration, but thicker membranes required higher peptide concentrations. In the presence of lysolipids, the inserted state prevailed even at high temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that BP100 monomer insertion can be stabilized by snorkeling lysine side chains. These results demonstrate that even a very short helix like BP100 can span (and thereby penetrate through) a cellular membrane under suitable conditions.

         <title>Towards Selective Delivery of a Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complex&#8208;Containing Bombesin Conjugate into Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving your aim: Decreasing the off&#8208;target and general cytotoxicities in the dark of new potential photosensitizers is relevant for increased photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficiency. In this article, we explore the site&#8208;selective bioconjugation of a promising Ru(II) polypyridyl complex to an N&#8208;terminally Cys&#8208;modified bombesin peptide for improved PDT towards cancer cells.







Abstract
An increasing number of novel Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have been successfully applied as photosensitizers (PSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Despite recent advances in optimized PSs with refined photophysical properties, the lack of tumoral selectivity is often a major hurdle for their clinical development. Here, classical maleimide and versatile NHS&#8208;activated acrylamide strategies were employed to site&#8208;selectively conjugate a promising Ru(II) polypyridyl complex to the N&#8208;terminally Cys&#8208;modified Bombesin (BBN) targeting unit. Surprisingly, the decreased cell uptake of these novel Ru&#8208;BBN conjugates in cancer cells did not hamper the high phototoxic activity of the Ru&#8208;containing bioconjugates and even decreased the toxicity of the constructs in the absence of light irradiation. Overall, although deceiving in terms of selectivity, our new bioconjugates could still be useful for advanced cancer treatment due to their nontoxicity in the dark.

         <dc:description>
This cover picture shows how the aggregation of modified DNA nanostructures can be prevented during their purification procedure. In the article by S. M. Nomura and Y. Sato et al., cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA nanostructures are purified by a novel surfactant&#8208;assisted gel extraction method, in which the addition of sodium cholate to the sample solution before structure folding prevented the formation of aggregates. The purified structures retain the ability to attach to lipid vesicle membranes. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Iwabuchi, S. M. Nomura, Y. Sato.

         <title>Front Cover: Chemoselective Labeling and Immobilization of Phosphopeptides with Phosphorimidazolide Reagents (ChemBioChem 4/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective enrichment of phosphopeptides is crucial for investigating protein phosphorylation. Here, we describe the selective, mild capture and release of phosphopeptides (CLIPP). The cover, designed by Barth van&#8197;Rossum, compares the mild conditions of CLIPP to a day in the spa. Phosphopeptides are selectively modified in a &#8220;pool&#8221; of phosphorimidazolide reagent, irradiated with UV light in a &#8220;tanning bed&#8221; to produce pyrophosphopeptides, and finally hydrolyzed to the original phosphopeptide in a lanthanide ion &#8220;sauna&#8221;. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Fiedler et&#8197;al.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Polymer Conjugates for Tuning, Enhancing, and Expanding Biocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 4, February 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assorted tools have been developed in recent years to improve the robustness of biocatalysts, and thereby extend their usefulness, by making use of tailored polymers. This review tackles the use of polymer chemistry approaches, combined with conjugation chemistries, computational modeling, and machine learning tools have led to enzyme&#8208;polymer hybrids with unprecedent added value.







Abstract
Combining polymers with functional proteins is an approach that has brought several successful stories in the field of biomedicine with PEGylated therapeutic proteins. The latest advances in polymer chemistry have facilitated the expansion of protein&#8208;polymer hybrids to other research areas such as biocatalysis. Polymers can impart stability and novel functionalities to the enzyme of interest, thereby improving the catalytic performance of a given reaction. In this review, we have revisited the main methodologies currently used for the synthesis of enzyme&#8208;polymer hybrids, unveiling the interplay between the configuration and the composition of the assembled structure and the eventual traits of the hybrid. Finally, the latest advances, such as the assembly of polymer&#8208;based chemoenzymatic nanoreactors and the use of deep learning methodologies to achieve the most suitable polymer compositions for catalysis, are discussed.

D&#8208;protein enantiomers can be accessed through total chemical synthesis and their preparation enables establishment of mirror&#8208;image life, structural analysis through racemic protein crystallography and discovery of proteolysis&#8208;resistant ligands. Here, we highlight the recent advances in D&#8208;protein and D&#8208;peptide technology and discuss upcoming challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Total chemical protein synthesis provides access to entire D&#8208;protein enantiomers enabling unique applications in molecular biology, structural biology, and bioactive compound discovery. Key enzymes involved in the central dogma of molecular biology have been prepared in their D&#8208;enantiomeric forms facilitating the development of mirror&#8208;image life. Crystallization of a racemic mixture of L&#8208; and D&#8208;protein enantiomers provides access to high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of polypeptides. Additionally, D&#8208;enantiomers of protein drug targets can be used in mirror&#8208;image phage display allowing discovery of non&#8208;proteolytic D&#8208;peptide ligands as lead candidates. This review discusses the unique applications of D&#8208;proteins including the synthetic challenges and opportunities.

         <title>Quality Data from Messy Spectra: How Isometric Points Increase Information Content in Highly Overlapping Spectra</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic reaction monitoring often yields complex and highly overlapping data, which can easily be untangled with the help of isometric points. This allows one to quantitatively follow the progress of chemical transformations from messy spectroscopic data.







Abstract
Spectroscopic techniques are immensely useful for obtaining information about chemical transformations while they are happening. However, such data are often messy, and it is challenging to extract reliable information from them without careful calibrations or internal standards. This short introductory review discusses how isometric points (points in a spectrum where the signal intensity remains constant throughout the progress of a chemical transformation) can be used to derive high&#8208;quality data from messy spectra. Such analyses are helpful in a variety of (bio&#8208;)chemical settings, as selected case studies demonstrate.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for the treatment of liver fibrosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liver fibrosis is a process of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix caused by liver injury. Liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis or even liver cancer if not intervened properly. Till now, no effective therapeutic drugs have been clinically approved for treating liver fibrosis. Hence, the development of safe and effective antifibrotic drugs is particularly important. As a representative biomaterial, peptides have been investigated as the key components for constructing antifibrotic nanomaterials with the advantages of biological origination, synthetic availability, and good biocompatibility. Peptides serve as multiple functional motifs in the antifibrotic nanomaterials, such as liver&#8208;targeting molecules, antifibrotic molecules, as well as self&#8208;assembling building blocks for the formation of the nanomaterials. In this review, we focus on peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for treating liver fibrosis, including the nanomaterials modified with liver&#8208;targeting peptides, nanomaterials for efficient delivery of antifibrotic peptides, and self&#8208;assembled peptide nanomaterials for the delivery of antifibrotic drugs. The design rules of these peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials are described. The antifibrotic mechanisms and effects of these peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in treating liver fibrosis and related diseases are highlighted. The challenges and future perspectives of using peptide&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for the treatment of liver fibrosis are discussed. These results are expected to accelerate the rational design and clinical translation of antifibrotic nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of mRNA for Cell&#8208;Selective CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing using Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Messenger RNA (mRNA) is being used as part of an emerging class of biotherapeutics with great promise for preventing and treating a wide range of diseases, as well as encoding programmable nucleases for genome editing. However, the low stability, immunogenicity, and impermeability of mRNA to the cell membrane greatly limit their potential for therapeutic use. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently one of the most extensively studied nanocarriers for mRNA delivery and have recently been clinically approved for developing mRNA&#8208;based vaccines to prevent COVID&#8208;19. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in designing ionizable lipids and formulating LNPs for intracellular and tissue&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. Furthermore, we discuss the progress of intracellular mRNA delivery for spatiotemporally controlled CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing using LNPs. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of LNP&#8208;based mRNA delivery for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and treatment of genetic disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Deacetylation of arabinosylated xylosyl residues related to plant xylan: significant differences between xylan deacetylases classified into various carbohydrate esterase families</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemical synthesis of two novel phenyl glycosides of trisaccharides related to acetylarabinoxylan is described. The trisaccharides bear acetyl and arabinofuranosyl moieties at the non&#8208;reducing&#8208;end xylopyranosyl residue, which is substituted at positions 2 and 3. Both compounds were treated with various xylan deacetylases classified in different carbohydrate esterase (CE) families and significant differences between the families were found. While the arabinosylation hampers deacetylation by CE2&#8208;CE5 and CE12 family members, both epitopes are deesterified by CE1 and in particular CE6 enzymes. The 3&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 2&#8208;O&#8208;arabinosylated compound is also processed by CE7 and majority of CE16 esterases, but not by a hitherto non&#8208;classified Flavobacterium johnsoniae acetylxylan esterase. The data suggests that a slow deesterification of the 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 3&#8208;O&#8208;arabinosylated compound may be due to the acetyl group migration to position 4 followed by deacetylation of this position.</dc:description>

         <title>New Biocompatible &#946;&#8208;Phosphorylated Linear Nitrones Targeting Mitochondria: Protective Effect in Apoptotic Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria, an essential organelle involved in cellular respiration, energy production, and cell death, is the main cellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide. Mitochondrial diseases resulting from uncontrolled/excess ROS generation are an emerging public health concern and there is current interest for specific mitochondriotropic probes to get information on in situ ROS production. As such, nitrones vectorized by the triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation have recently drawn attention despite reported cytotoxicity. Herein, we describe the synthesis of 13 low&#8208;toxic derivatives of N&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;1&#8208;diethoxyphosphoryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylethylamine N&#8208;oxide (PPN) alkyl chain&#8208;grafted to a pyridinium, triethylammonium or berberinium lipophilic cation. These nitrones showed in vitro superoxide quenching activity and EPR/spin&#8208;trapping efficiency towards biologically relevant free radicals, including superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Their mitochondrial penetration was confirmed by 31P NMR and anti&#8208;apoptotic properties assessed in hydrogen peroxide treated Schwann cells. Two pyridinium substituted PPNs were identified as potentially better alternatives to TPP nitrones conjugates for studies of mitochondrial oxidative damage.</dc:description>

         <title>Polypyridyl Co(II)&#8208;Curcumin Complexes as Photo&#8208;activated Anticancer and Antibacterial Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new Co(II) complexes viz., [Co(bpy)2(acac)]Cl (1), [Co(phen)2(acac)]Cl (2),&#160;[Co(bpy)2(cur)]Cl (3), [Co(phen)2(cur)]Cl (4), where bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (1&#160;and&#160;3), phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (2&#160;and&#160;4),&#160;acac&#160;=&#160;acetylacetonate (1&#160;and&#160;2), cur = curcumin monoanion&#160;(3 and 4) were designed, synthesized and fully characterized. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;indicated that CoN4O2&#160;core has a distorted octahedral geometry. The photoactivity of these complexes was tuned by varying the &#960; conjugation in the ligands.&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;depicted an intense absorption band near 435 nm, which made them useful as visible&#8208;light PDT agents. Curcumin complexes&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;showed fluorescence with &#955;emi&#160;= ca. 565 nm. This fluorescence was useful to study their intracellular uptake and localization in MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells. The acetylacetonate complexes (1&#160;and&#160;2) are used as control complexes to understand the role of curcumin.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four new Co(II) complexes viz., [Co(bpy)2(acac)]Cl (1), [Co(phen)2(acac)]Cl (2),&#160;[Co(bpy)2(cur)]Cl (3), [Co(phen)2(cur)]Cl (4), where bpy = 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine (1&#160;and&#160;3), phen = 1,10-phenanthroline (2&#160;and&#160;4),&#160;acac&#160;=&#160;acetylacetonate (1&#160;and&#160;2), cur = curcumin monoanion&#160;(3 and 4) were designed, synthesized and fully characterized. The X-ray crystal structures of&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;indicated that CoN4O2&#160;core has a distorted octahedral geometry. The photoactivity of these complexes was tuned by varying the &#960; conjugation in the ligands.&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;depicted an intense absorption band near 435 nm, which made them useful as visible-light PDT agents. Curcumin complexes&#160;3&#160;and&#160;4&#160;showed fluorescence with &#955;emi&#160;= ca. 565 nm. This fluorescence was useful to study their intracellular uptake and localization in MCF-7 cancer cells. The acetylacetonate complexes (1&#160;and&#160;2) are used as control complexes to understand the role of curcumin.

         <title>Biochemical Analysis Leads to Improved Orthogonal Bioluminescent Tools</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If you can stand the heat: The substrate selectivity and thermostability of mutant luciferases were analyzed by using a biochemical approach. Mutants derived from two popular luciferases, Pecan and Cashew, were made and assessed to find key residues for selectivity. The mutants were optimized by layering thermal stabilizing mutations. These mutants showed increased substrate preference and activity at higher temperatures. These new enzyme&#8211;substrate pairs provide a blueprint for engineering optimized imaging probes.







Abstract
Engineered luciferase&#8208;luciferin pairs have expanded the number of cellular targets that can be visualized in tandem. While light production relies on selective processing of synthetic luciferins by mutant luciferases, little is known about the origin of selectivity. The development of new and improved pairs requires a better understanding of the structure&#8722;function relationship of bioluminescent probes. In this work, we report a biochemical approach to assessing and optimizing two popular bioluminescent pairs: Cashew/d&#8208;luc and Pecan/4&#8242;&#8208;BrLuc. Single mutants derived from Cashew and Pecan revealed key residues for selectivity and thermal stability. Stability was further improved through a rational addition of beneficial residues. In addition to providing increased stability, the known stabilizing mutations surprisingly also improved selectivity. The resultant improved pair of luciferases are &gt;100&#8208;fold selective for their respective substrates and highly thermally stable. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of mechanistic insight for improving bioluminescent pairs and provides significantly improved Cashew and Pecan enzymes which should be immediately suitable for multicomponent imaging applications.

         <title>Photocatalytic proximity labeling for profiling the subcellular organization of biomolecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the subcellular organization of biomolecules is important for understanding their biological functions. Over the past decade, proximity&#8208;dependent labeling methods have emerged as powerful tools for mapping biomolecules in their native context. These methods often capitalize on the in situ generation of highly reactive intermediates for covalently tagging biomolecules located within nanometers to sub&#8208;micrometers from the source of labeling. Among these, photocatalytic proximity labeling methods achieve precise spatial and temporal control of labeling with visible light illumination. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms and applications of existing photocatalytic proximity labeling methods and discuss future opportunities for method improvement.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyltransferase Domain Exchange between Two Independent Type&#8197;I Polyketide Synthases in the Same Producer Strain of Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Fair exchange: AT domain&#8208;swapping between two independent PKSs in the same producer strain resulted in the production of two new macrolide antibiotics without supply problems of the unique extender units or loss of cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells.







Abstract
Streptomyces graminofaciens A&#8208;8890 produces two macrolide antibiotics, FD&#8208;891 and virustomycin&#8197;A, both of which show significant biological activity. In this study, we identified the virustomycin&#8197;A biosynthetic gene cluster, which encodes type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKSs), ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA biosynthetic enzymes, methoxymalony&#8208;acyl carrier protein biosynthetic enzymes, and post&#8208;PKS modification enzymes. Next, we demonstrated that the acyltransferase domain can be exchanged between the Vsm PKSs and the PKSs involved in FD&#8208;891 biosynthesis (Gfs PKSs), without any supply problems of the unique extender units. We exchanged the malonyltransferase domain in the loading module of Gfs PKS with the ethylmalonyltransferase domain and the methoxymalonyltransferase domain of Vsm PKSs. Consequently, the expected two&#8208;carbon&#8208;elongated analog 26&#8208;ethyl&#8208;FD&#8208;891 was successfully produced with a titer comparable to FD&#8208;891 production by the wild type; however, exchange with the methoxymalonyltransferase domain did not produce any FD&#8208;891 analogs. Furthermore, 26&#8208;ethyl&#8208;FD&#8208;891 showed potent cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells, like natural FD&#8208;891.

         <title>ROS&#8208;Triggered Gel&#8211;Sol Transition and Kinetics&#8208;Controlled Cargo Release by Methionine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gel&#8211;sol transition of self&#8208;assembling peptides is a useful switch for environment&#8208;dependent drug release. For their applications, kinetics control of the responses is important for matching the releasing velocity to the target biological events. Here we demonstrate a chemical control of redox&#8208;triggered gel&#8211;sol transition kinetics of self&#8208;assembling peptides by the amino acid sequence. Amphiphilic peptides with different methionine positions were developed, where the methionine residue locates at the center of JigSAP&#8208;IMI, whereas JigSAP&#8208;MII possesses the methionine residue near the N&#8208;terminus. Both peptides formed hydrogels in a physiological condition by forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;based supramolecular nanofibers. In contrast, the oxidized forms retained solution states under identical conditions by adopting &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich secondary structures. Upon oxidation with H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, JigSAP&#8208;MII showed faster gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition and cargo&#8208;releasing than JigSAP&#8208;IMI, indicating that the phase&#8208;transition and releasing kinetics of self&#8208;assembling peptides can be rationally controlled by the position of the reactive amino acid residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Epitranscriptomic RNA Modifications on the Catalytic Activity of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Replication Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 causes individualized symptoms. Many reasons have been given. We propose that an individual&#8217;s epitranscriptomic system could be responsible as well. The viral RNA genome can be subject to epitranscriptomic modifications, the modifications can be different for different individuals, and thus epitranscriptomics can affect many events including RNA replication differently. In this context, we studied the effects of modifications including pseudouridine (&#936;), 5methylcytosine (m5C), N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A), N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) and N3methylcytosine (m3C) on the activity of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication complex (SC2RC). We found that &#936;, m5C, m6A and m3C had little effects, while m1A inhibited the enzyme. Both m1A and m3C disrupt canonical base&#8208;pairing, but they had different effects. The fact that m1A inhibits SC2RC implies that the modification can be difficult to detect. The fact also implies that individuals with upregulated m1A including cancer, obesity and diabetes patients may have milder symptoms. However, this contradicts clinical observations. Relevant discussions are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Biologically Diverse Tetrahydronaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols through the Synthesis and Phenotypic Profiling of Chemically Diverse, Estradiol&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Synthesis and profiling of a collection of compounds containing the A/B ring system of estradiol fused to nine secondary fragments uncovered five scaffolds with diverse phenotypes, including osteoblast differentiation and autophagy inhibition as well as modulators of tubulin polymerization and potassium channels.







Abstract
Combining natural product fragments to design new scaffolds with unprecedented bioactivity is a powerful strategy for the discovery of tool compounds and potential therapeutics. However, the choice of fragments to couple and the biological screens to employ remain open questions in the field. By choosing a primary fragment containing the A/B ring system of estradiol and fusing it to nine different secondary fragments, we were able to identify compounds that modulated four different phenotypes: inhibition of autophagy and osteoblast differentiation, as well as potassium channel and tubulin modulation. The latter two were uncovered by using unbiased morphological profiling with a cell&#8208;painting assay. The number of hits and variety in bioactivity discovered validates the use of recombining natural product fragments coupled to phenotypic screening for the rapid identification of biologically diverse compounds.

         <title>Affinity Studies of Hemicyanine Derived Water Soluble Colorimetric Probes with Reactive Oxygen/Nitrogen/Sulfur Species</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particular for peroxynitrite: A hemicyanine&#8208;derived, water&#8208;soluble colorimetric probe shows specific and interference&#8208;free affinity towards peroxynitrite among all reactive oxygen/nitrogen/sulfur species. A rapid color change provides a sensitive and selective method for detecting peroxynitrite with a low detection limit of 180&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) is an essential endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in mitochondria under various pathological and physiological conditions. An increase in its level in mitochondria is related to numerous diseases. Herein, we report a series of hemicyanine&#8208;derived water&#8208;soluble colorimetric probes (1&#8211;4) and the reactivity of which was studied with various reactive oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur species. Probes 1&#8211;4 are formed by conjugating 1,2,3,3&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indolium iodide and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde or its derivatives through an alkene linkage formed by the Knoevenagel reaction. Oxidative cleavage of the electron&#8208;rich double bond of the conjugated hemicyanine dye revealed a discerning affinity of probe 3 towards peroxynitrite among all reactive oxygen species. The rapid change in color of 3 provides a sensitive and selective method for detecting peroxynitrite with a low detection limit of 180&#8197;nM. Notably, the water solubility of the probe displays excellent performance for the selective detection of peroxynitrite among ROS and reactive nitrogen (RNS)/sulfur species (RSS). UV&#8208;vis, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopic data and results from theoretical calculations provide further information on the interaction of peroxynitrite with probe 3.

         <title>Cross&#8208;linked enzyme aggregates of fusion enzymes in microaqueous organic media</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenases (BVMOs) are attractive for selectively oxidizing various ketones using oxygen into valuable esters and lactones. However, the application of BVMOs is restrained by cofactor&#8208;dependency and enzyme instability combined with waterrelated downsides such as low substrate loadings, low oxygen capacity, and water&#8208;induced side reactions. Herein, we described a redox&#8208;neutral linear cascade with in situ cofactor regeneration catalyzed by fused alcohol dehydrogenase and cyclohexanone monooxygenase in aqueous and microaqueous organic media. Therein, the cascade conditions have been optimized regarding substrate concentrations as well as the amounts of enzymes and cofactors with the Design of Experiments (DoE). The carrier&#8208;free immobilization technique, cross&#8208;linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), was applied to fusion enzymes. The resultant fusion CLEAs were proven to function in microaqueous organic systems, in which the enzyme ratios, water contents, and stability have been systematically studied. The fusion CLEAs showed promising operational and storage stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Theranostic Nanoprobes with Aggregation&#8208;Induced NIR&#8208;II Emission: from Molecular Design to Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of fluorophores with some other powerful features has received much attention in disease diagnosis and treatment, and nanoprobes (NPs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) demonstrated superior performance in deeper penetration depth with better resolution, higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and lower side effects in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) than in the other range. Herein, the latest advancement of NIR&#8208;II AIE NPs in cancer theranostic is summarized. Especially, we focus on the design of multifunctional AIE agents with both strong NIR&#8208;II emission and effective photothermal conversion or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as their translational biomedical applications, including imaging diagnosis, image&#8208;guided surgery, and image&#8208;guided phototherapy, etc. At the end of this review, the opportunities and challenges of this field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA morphology: Global alteration of DNA topological states induced by chemotherapeutic agents and its implication in cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic topological states of chromosomal DNA regulate many cellular fundamental processes universally in all three domains of life, i.e., bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. The DNA binding proteins maintain the regional and global supercoiling of the chromosome and thereby regulate the chromatin architecture that ultimately influences the gene expression network and other DNA&#8208;centric molecular events in various microenvironments and growth phases. DNA&#8208;binding small molecules ligands are pivotal weapons for treating a wide range of cancer. Recent advancement in single&#8208;molecule biophysical tools has uncovered that many of the DNA binding ligands alter not only the regional DNA supercoiling but also modulate the overall morphology of DNA. Here we provide insight into the recent advancement in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) acquired DNA structural change induced by therapeutically important mono&#8208;intercalating and bis&#8208;intercalating anticancer agents as well as DNA adduct forming anticancer drugs. We also emphasize the growing evidence of the mechanistic relevance of DNA topology change in the anticancer cellular responses by DNA&#8208;targeting chemotherapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Whole&#8208;cell MALDI&#8208;ToF MS coupled with untargeted metabolomics facilitates investigations of microbial chemical interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of drug resistant pathogens necessitates development of new countermeasures. In this regard, the introduction of probiotics to directly attack or competitively exclude pathogens presents a useful strategy. Application of this approach requires an understanding of how a probiotic and its target pathogen interact. A key means of probiotic&#8208;pathogen interaction involves the production of small molecules called natural products (NPs). Here, we report use of whole&#8208;cell matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization&#160;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight&#160;(MALDI&#8208;ToF) mass spectrometry for characterization of NP production by candidate probiotics (mouse airway microbiome isolates) when co&#8208;cultured with respiratory pathogen Burkholderia. We found that a&#160;Bacillus velezensis&#160;strain inhibits growth of and elicits NP production by B. thailandensis. Dereplication of known NPs detected in the metabolome of this B. velezensis strain suggests that a previously unannotated bioactive compound is involved. Thus, we present use of whole&#8208;cell MALDI as a broadly applicable method for screening of NP composition of microbial co&#8208;cultures, which can be combined with other &#8208;omics methods for characterization of probiotic&#8208;pathogen, and other microbe&#8208;microbe, interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Bio&#8208;Epoxidation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active epoxides play important roles in pharmaceutical, agricultural and fine chemical synthesis. There are many chiral medications with pharmacodynamic activity in nature, which can be synthesized by chiral epoxides. In recent years, researchers have developed a variety of biocatalysts for asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes, which use oxygen or hydrogen peroxide as eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost oxidants, to provide better chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under moderate conditions of reaction. In this paper, the advances, opportunities and challenges of the asymmetric epoxidation of unactive alkenes by biocatalyst are reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of UV Stress on the Structure and Function of Pro&#8208;apoptotic Bid and Anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;xl proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV on, apoptosis on: Bcl&#8208;xl anti&#8208;apoptotic protein binds to pro&#8208;apoptotic protein Bid in the BH3 binding region. Pro&#8208;apoptotic protein initiates apoptosis by activating Bax. Bcl&#8208;xl sequesters initiator proteins and does not let Bax activation occur; this results in no apoptosis. It has been observed upon UV exposure, Bcl&#8208;xl binding to pro&#8208;apoptotic protein diminishes, which in&#8208;turn liberates free tBid in solution resulting in apoptosis.







Abstract
Ultraviolet C (UV&#8208;C) radiation induces apoptosis in mammalian cells via the mitochondrion&#8208;mediated pathway. The Bcl&#8208;2 family of proteins are the regulators of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and appears responsive to UV&#8208;C radiation. It is unknown how the structure and, effectively, the function of these proteins are directly impacted by UV&#8208;C exposure. Here, we present the effect of UV&#8208;C irradiation on the structure and function of pro&#8208;apoptotic Bid&#8208;FL and anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;xl&#916;C proteins. Using a variety of biophysical tools, we show that, following UV&#8208;C irradiation, the structures of Bcl&#8208;xl&#916;C and Bid&#8208;FL are irreversibly altered. Bcl&#8208;xL&#916;C is found to be more sensitive to UV stress than Bid&#8208;FL Interestingly, UV&#8208;C exposure shows dramatic chemical shift perturbations in consequence of dramatic structural perturbations (&#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet) in the BH3&#8208; binding region, a crucial segment of Bcl&#8208;xl&#916;C. Furter it has been shown that UV&#8208;exposed Bcl&#8208;xl&#916;C has reduced efficacy of its interactions with pro&#8208;apoptotic tBid.

         <title>Understanding the Interactions of Guanine Quadruplexes with Peptides as Novel Strategies for Diagnosis or Tuning Biological Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G4s for control and diagnosis: We review the study of the specific interactions between G4 (either DNA or RNA) and small synthetic and natural peptides. In particular, we highlight the complementary role of spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling and simulation, while pointing out the future perspectives in the field.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid structures exhibiting a complex structural behavior and exerting crucial biological functions in both cells and viruses. The specific interactions of peptides with G4s, as well as an understanding of the factors driving the specific recognition are important for the rational design of both therapeutic and diagnostic agents. In this review, we examine the most important studies dealing with the interactions between G4s and peptides, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current analytic approaches. We also show how the combined use of high&#8208;level molecular simulation techniques and experimental spectroscopy is the best avenue to design specifically tuned and selective peptides, thus leading to the control of important biological functions.

         <title>Introducing Nanozymes: New Horizons in Periodontal and Dental Implant Care</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes mimic enzyme functions for use in periodontology and implantology, as illustrated on the cover. Periodontal and peri&#8208;implant diseases are important diseases worldwide. As multifunctional nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, nanozymes have made great contributions to maintaining periodontal health and improving the success rate of implantation. Herein, this review describes how nanozymes demonstrate antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, regenerative, and synergistic effects by mimicking properties similar to natural enzymes and exploiting the advantages of nanomaterials. More information can be found in the Review by J. Wu et al.

         <title>Metabolomics Reveals a &#8220;Trimeric&#8221; &#947;&#8208;Actinorhodin from Streptomyces coelicolor M145</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptomyces coelicolor is a prolific producer of natural products and serves as a model organism for their study. It produces several pigmented antibiotics, the most well&#8208;studied of which are the actinorhodins. We utilized a combination of liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) and computational tools used for annotating the detected species (e.g., spectral matching, in silico predictors, molecular networking) to identify putative new actinorhodin analogs. These studies led to the discovery of the first trimeric benzoisochromanequinone, &#952;&#8208;actinorhodin (1).
Further metabolomics analysis revealed that the relative amounts of shunt products produced were similar between the two growth conditions explored. This suggests that while substantially different products were being produced, the biosynthetic gene clusters were similarly active. Overall, this work describes the discovery of the first trimeric benzoisochromanequinone and explores the biosynthetic processes that may lead to its production via metabolomics analysis of relevant intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide for Ratiometric Detection of Heparin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sample serum simply: A new pyrene peptide fluorescence probe based on 1&#8208;pyrenebutanoic acid, phenylalanine and arginine, PyFFRRR, can be used to detect heparin content in aqueous solution and human serum samples quickly, simply and accurately.







Abstract
Heparin is a commonly used anticoagulant in clinical practice; however, excessive heparin can cause serious adverse reactions. Convenient and accurate detection of heparin levels is thus very important. In this research, a pyrene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembling fluorescent peptide PyFFRRR was designed for simple, selective, and efficient heparin detection. The guanidine groups in the arginine residues of PyFFRRR bind tightly with heparin, which is highly sulfated, through electrostatic interactions. Charge neutralization facilitated the self&#8208;assembly of PyFFRRR, resulting in its spectral response changing from deep blue monomer fluorescence to green excimer fluorescence. PyFFRRR exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity for ratiometric detection of heparin. The binding mechanism was investigated by using spectral and simulation tools, and structural observation. Finally, PyFFRRR was employed in human serum samples for ratiometric detection of heparin.

         <title>Substrate Specificity of the Highly Thermostable Esterase EstDZ3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate specificity of the hydrolytic extremozyme EstDZ3 was studied by using various esters with different carbon chain lengths. Computational methods provided an insight into the enzyme's active&#8208;site environment and the hydrophobic content of its amino acid, which seem to play a part in the enzyme's selectivity. The hydrophobic surface of the enzyme in complex with vinyl decanoate is shown in red.







Abstract
Esterases are among the most studied enzymes, and their applications expand into several branches of industrial biotechnology. Yet, despite the fact that information on their substrate specificity is crucial for selecting or designing the best fitted biocatalyst for the desired application, it cannot be predicted from their amino acid sequence. In this work, we studied the substrate scope of the newly discovered hydrolytic extremozyme, EstDZ3, against a library of esters with variable carbon chain lengths in an effort to understand the crucial amino acids for the substrate selectivity of this enzyme. EstDZ3 appears to be active against a wide range of esters with high selectivity towards medium&#8208; to long&#8208;carbon chain vinyl esters. In&#8208;silico studies of its 3D structure revealed that the selectivity might arise from the mainly hydrophobic nature of the active site's environment.

         <title>5&#8208;Ethynyluridine: A Bio&#8208;orthogonal Uridine Variant for mRNA&#8208;Based Therapies and Vaccines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of macrophages by exogenous mRNA: During transfection like electroporation and lipid nanoparticle uptake, mRNA is detected by immune surveillance receptors like toll&#8208;like receptors&#8208;3, &#8722;7 and &#8722;8. These receptors activate the secretion of type I interferons. In turn, autocrine signalling of these interferons activates inflammatory signalling pathways.







Abstract
The identification of pseudo&#8208; and N1&#8208;methylpseudo&#8208;uridine (&#936; and m&#936;, respectively) as immunosilent uridine analogues has propelled the development of mRNA&#8208;based vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we have characterised another uridine analogue, 5&#8208;ethynyluridine (EU), which has an ethynyl moiety. We show that this uridine analogue does not cause immune activation in human macrophages, as it does not induce interleukin&#8208;6 secretion or expression of the inflammatory and antiviral genes MX1, PKR, and TAP2. Moreover, EU allows for prolonged expression, as shown with mRNA coding for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparisons of EU with unmodified, &#936;, and m&#936; revealed that EU&#8208;modified mRNA is expressed at lower levels, but confers similar stability and low immunogenicity to the other uridine analogues. Furthermore, structure analysis of modified mRNAs suggests that the observed phenotype is largely independent of RNA folding. Thus, EU is a potential candidate for RNA&#8208;based vaccines and therapeutics.

         <title>Exploring the Flexibility of the Glycopeptide Antibiotic Crosslinking Cascade for Extended Peptide Backbones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) crosslinking is performed by cytochrome P450 (Oxy) enzymes and is essential for antibiotic activity. Here, we symbolise the process by which we screen for Oxy activity toward altered peptide substrates, which revealed that these enzymes are tolerant of extension at the N&#8208;termini of their peptide substrates. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Tailhades, M. J. Cryle et&#8197;al.

         <title>Mesoporous silica nanoparticles: Drug delivery vehicle for antidiabetic molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are promising nanomaterials that are widely used in biomedical applications like drug delivery, diagnosis, bio&#8208;sensing and cell tracking. MSNs have been investigated meticulously in the drug delivery field due to their unique chemical and pharmacokinetic properties such as highly ordered mesopores, high surface area and pore volume, tunable pore size, stability, surface functionalization, and biocompatibility. The MSN&#8208;based nanocomposites have been used for the delivery of therapeutic molecules like insulin, GLP, exenatide, DPP4 inhibitor and plasmid containing GLP1 gene for managing diabetes mellitus for the last decade. The functionalization property of MSNs makes them substantially capable of co&#8208;delivery, controlled delivery and stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery of antidiabetic drugs. The present review focuses on the delivery of antidiabetic therapeutics with special emphasis on the functionalization of MSNs and stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insights into the activities of major families of enzymes in bacterial peptidoglycan assembly and breakdown</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serving as an exoskeletal scaffold, peptidoglycan is a polymeric macromolecule that is essential and conserved across all bacteria, yet is absent in mammalian cells, which renders bacterial peptidoglycan a well&#8208;established excellent antibiotic target. In addition, soluble peptidoglycan fragments derived from bacteria are increasingly recognized as key signalling molecules in mediating diverse intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;species communications in nature, including in gut microbiota&#8208;host crosstalk. Each bacteria species encodes multiple redundant enzymes for key enzymatic activities involved in peptidoglycan assembly and breakdown. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the biochemical activities of major peptidoglycan enzymes, including peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGT) and transpeptidases (TPs) in the final stage of peptidoglycan assembly, as well as peptidoglycan glycosidases, lytic transglucosylases (LTs), amidases, endopeptidases (EPs) and carboxypeptidases (CPs) in peptidoglycan turnover and metabolism. Biochemical characterisations of these enzymes provide valuable insights on their substrate specificity, regulation mechanisms and potential modes of inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Membrane Transport in Polymeric Biomimetic Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymersome&#8208;based biomimetic nanoreactors (PBNs) have generated great interest in nanomedicine and cell mimicry due to their robustness, tunable chemistry, and broad applicability in biologically relevant fields. In this concept review, we mainly discuss the state of the art in functional polymersomes as biomimetic nanoreactors with membrane&#8208;controlled transport. PBNs that utilize environmental changes or external stimuli to adjust membrane permeability while maintaining structural integrity are highlighted. By encapsulating catalytic species, PBNs are able to convert non&#8208;active substrates into functional products in a controlled manner. In addition, special attention is given to the use of PBNs as tailored artificial organelles with biomedical applications in vitro and in vivo, facilitating the fabrication of next&#8208;generation artificial organelles as therapeutic nanocompartments.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric ene&#8208;reduction by F420&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases B (FDOR&#8208;B) enzymes from Mycobacterium smegmatis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric reduction by ene&#8208;reductases has received considerable attention in recent decades. While several enzyme families possess ene&#8208;reductase activity, the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family has received the most scientific and industrial attention. However, there is a limited substrate range and few stereocomplementary pairs of current ene&#8208;reductases, necessitating the development of a complementary class. Flavin/deazaflavin oxidoreductases (FDORs) that utilize the uncommon cofactor F420 have recently gained attention as ene&#8208;reductases for use in biocatalysis due to their stereocomplmentarity with OYEs. Although the enzymes of the FDOR&#8208;As sub&#8208;group have been characterized in this context and reported to catalyse ene&#8208;reduction enantioselectively, enzymes from the similarly large, but more diverse, FDOR&#8208;B sub&#8208;group have not been investigated in this context. In this study, we investigate the activity of 8 FDOR&#8208;B enzymes distributed across this sub&#8208;group, evaluating their specific activity, kinetic properties, and stereoselectivity against &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds. The stereochemical outcomes of the FDOR&#8208;Bs are compared with enzyme of the FDOR&#8208;A sub&#8208;group and OYE family. Computational modelling and induced&#8208;fit docking are used to rationalize the observed catalytic behaviour and proposed a catalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Colorimetric Determination of Adenylation Domain Activity in Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Using Chrome Azurol S</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stealing iron: The chromogenic complex between Chrome Azurol&#8197;S and ferric iron was repurposed to monitor the substrate specificity of adenylation domains in&#8197;vitro. This assay avoids the requirement for expensive co&#8208;substrates or auxiliary enzymes and can also be applied for adenylation domains that are embedded in entire modules.







Abstract
Adenylation domains are the main contributor to structural complexity among nonribosomal peptides due to their varied but stringent substrate selection. Several in&#8197;vitro assays to determine the substrate specificity of these dedicated biocatalysts have been implemented, but high sensitivity is often accompanied by the cost of laborious procedures, expensive reagents or the requirement for auxiliary enzymes. Here, we describe a simple protocol that is based on the removal of ferric iron from a preformed chromogenic complex between ferric iron and Chrome Azurol&#8197;S. Adenylation activity can be rapidly followed by a decrease in absorbance at 630&#8197;nm, visualized by a prominent color change from blue to orange.

         <title>Amber Light Control of Peptide Secondary Structure by a Perfluoroaromatic Azobenzene Photoswitch</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When amber means &#8220;go&#8221;: A perfluorinated azobenzene was synthesized and stapled to free cysteines within a helical peptide by using site&#8208;selective perfluoroarylation chemistry. Illumination experiments proved successful change of the peptide's secondary structure in response to amber light.







Abstract
The incorporation of photoswitches into the molecular structure of peptides and proteins enables their dynamic photocontrol in complex biological systems. Here, a perfluorinated azobenzene derivative triggered by amber light was site&#8208;specifically conjugated to cysteines in a helical peptide by perfluoroarylation chemistry. In response to the photoisomerization (trans&#8594;cis) of the conjugated azobenzene with amber light, the secondary structure of the peptide was modulated from a disorganized into an amphiphilic helical structure.

         <title>Bifidobacterial GH146 &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Arabinofuranosidase (Bll4HypBA1) as the Last Enzyme for the Complete Removal of Oligoarabinofuranosides from Hydroxyproline&#8208;Rich Glycoproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distantly related homologue of GH127 Bll1HypBA1 &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidase was recently identified as GH146 from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria along with paralogues from Bifidobacterium longum. One of them, Bll4HypBA1, can specifically degrade l&#8208;Araf1&#8208;Hyp in a similarly way to GH146 cysteine glycosidase, as was unequivocally revealed by monitoring the step&#8208;wise enzymatic cleavage of a synthetic extensin hydrophilic motif and potato lectin.







Abstract
In plant cell walls, the hydroxyproline&#8208;rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) such as extensin contain oligoarabinofuranoside linked to a hydroxyproline (Hyp) residue. The mature arabinooligosaccharide was revealed to be a tetrasaccharide (&#945;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf&#8208;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf&#8208;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf, l&#8208;Araf4), whose linkages are targets of the bifidobacterial and Xanthomonas arabinooligosaccharide&#8208;degrading enzymes. The l&#8208;Araf4 motif was cleaved by GH43 &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidase (Arafase) and converted to an l&#8208;Araf3&#8208;linked structure. The latter is then cleaved by GH121 &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinobiosidase (HypBA2), producing &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf&#8208;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;l&#8208;Ara (&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinobiose) and mono&#8208;&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf linked to the HRGP backbone. In bifidobacteria, the &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinobiose is then hydrolyzed by GH127 &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Arafase (Bll1HypBA1), a mechanistically unique cysteine glycosidase. We recently identified the distantly related homologue from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria as GH146 &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Arafase along with paralogues from Bifidobacterium longum, one of which, Bll4HypBA1 (BLLJ_0089), can degrade l&#8208;Araf1&#8208;Hyp in a similar way to that of GH146. As the chemical synthesis of the extensin hydrophilic motif 1&#8201;a, which possesses three distinct linkages that connect four oligoAraf residues [Hyp(l&#8208;Arafn) (n=4, 3, 1)], was achieved previously, we precisely monitored the step&#8208;wise enzymatic cleavage of 1&#8201;a in addition to that of potato lectin. The results unequivocally revealed that this enzyme specifically degrades the Hyp(l&#8208;Araf1) motif.

We recently identified the distantly related homologue from &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas euvesicatoria&lt;/i&gt; as GH146 &#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Ara&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;ase along with paralogues from &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt;, one of which, Bll4HypBA1 (BLLJ_0089), can degrade &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Ara&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Hyp in a similar way to that of GH146. As the chemical synthesis of the extensin hydrophilic motif &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, which possesses three distinct linkages that connect four oligoAra&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; residues [Hyp(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Ara&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=4, 3, 1)], was achieved previously, we precisely monitored the step-wise enzymatic cleavage of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; in addition to that of potato lectin. The results unequivocally revealed that this enzyme specifically degrades the Hyp(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Ara&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) motif.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Cyanobacterial &#8220;Nutraceutical&#8221; Phycocyanobilin Inhibits Cysteine Protease Legumain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the blue: &#8220;Spirulina&#8221; is a biomass of Athrospira cyanobacteria that is widely regarded as a &#8220;superfood&#8221; because of its nutritional properties and various health benefits. Phycocyanobilin, the photosynthetic pigment in spirulina, was demonstrated to inhibit the cysteine protease legumain, which might account for spirulina's capabilities.







Abstract
The blue biliprotein phycocyanin, produced by photo&#8208;autotrophic cyanobacteria including spirulina (Arthrospira) and marketed as a natural food supplement or &#8220;nutraceutical,&#8221; is reported to have anti&#8208;inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and anticancer activity. These diverse biological activities have been specifically attributed to the phycocyanin chromophore, phycocyanobilin (PCB). However, the mechanism of action of PCB and the molecular targets responsible for the beneficial properties of PCB are not well understood. We have developed a procedure to rapidly cleave the PCB pigment from phycocyanin by ethanolysis and then characterized it as an electrophilic natural product that interacts covalently with thiol nucleophiles but lacks any appreciable cytotoxicity or antibacterial activity against common pathogens and gut microbes. We then designed alkyne&#8208;bearing PCB probes for use in chemical proteomics target deconvolution studies. Target identification and validation revealed the cysteine protease legumain (also known as asparaginyl endopeptidase, AEP) to be a target of PCB. Inhibition of this target may account for PCB's diverse reported biological activities.

         <title>Identification of Genes Essential for Fluorination and Sulfamylation within the Nucleocidin Gene Clusters of Streptomyces calvus and Streptomyces virens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A knockout screen along the biosynthetic gene cluster associated with nucleocidin 1 biosynthesis led to different outcomes from a study reported recently. For example, at least 11 genes are involved in installing the sulfamyl moiety on the ribosyl ring of nucelocidin and at least 4 gene are required for fluorometabolite production.







Abstract
The gene cluster in Streptomyces calvus associated with the biosynthesis of the fluoro&#8208; and sulfamyl&#8208;metabolite nucleocidin was interrogated by systematic gene knockouts. Out of the 26 gene deletions, most did not affect fluorometabolite production, nine abolished sulfamylation but not fluorination, and three precluded fluorination, but had no effect on sulfamylation. In addition to nucI, nucG, nucJ, nucK, nucL, nucN, nucO, nucQ and nucP, we identified two genes (nucW, nucA), belonging to a phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS) gene cluster, as required for sulfamyl assembly. Three genes (orf(&#8722;3), orf2 and orf3) were found to be essential for fluorination, although the activities of their protein products are unknown. These genes as well as nucK, nucN, nucO and nucPNP, whose knockouts produced results differing from those described in a recent report, were also deleted in Streptomyces virens &#8211; with confirmatory outcomes. This genetic profile should inform biochemistry aimed at uncovering the enzymology behind nucleocidin biosynthesis.

         <title>Studying Reversible Protein Post&#8208;translational Modification through Co&#8208;translational Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding post&#8208;translational modifications of targeted protein is of great significance to manipulate physiological processes of eukaryotes. Chemical biology tools have been utilized to investigate the biological roles of those post&#8208;translational modifications at particular sites, especially genetic code expansion technology, which can also be combined with the concept of synthetic biology to generate a genetically modified organism with synthetic auxotroph for co&#8208;translational modification components. In this concept, we will introduce applications, limitations, and perspectives of genetic code expansion technology for studying post&#8208;translational modification based on recent progresses. Future perspectives of genetically modified organisms also will be discussed in the application of post&#8208;translational modification research.</dc:description>

         <title>Myxococcus xanthus as Host for the Production of Benzoxazoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazoles are structural motifs of many active pharmaceutical ingredients. The enzymatic synthesis of these heterocycles is mediated by the concerted action of an ATP&#8208;dependent ligase and an amidohydrolase. Expression of the two enzymes in the myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus enables the recombinant production of benzoxazoles from supplemented aryl carboxylic acids. Cognate substrates as well as enzymes that naturally occur in M. xanthus serve as additional puzzle pieces that allow a diversification of the benzoxazole scaffold. In particular, the endogenous enzyme MxcE participates in the activation and incorporation of substrates, which would otherwise not be accessible for benzoxazole biosynthesis. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Nett et al.

         <title>Designer, Programmable DNA&#8208;peptide hybrid materials with emergent properties to probe and modulate biological systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although DNA nanostructures have inviting properties such as a high biocompatibility and biodegradability, a precise control over geometry and high loading capacities, their applications are limited due to a poor stability in biological medium and the elicitation of an adverse immune response. On the other hand, peptides have a better stability in biological medium and do not elicit adverse immune responses, but suffer from other drawbacks such as a low active concentration, high structural complexity and poor metabolic stability. This motivates a venture into the formation of peptide&#8208;DNA complexes that would not only leverage the advantages of each of these biomolecules while mitigating their drawbacks, but also facilitate the emergence of new properties that neither of the individual components possess.







Abstract
The chemistry of DNA endows it with certain functional properties that facilitate the generation of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures, offering precise control over their geometry and morphology, that can be exploited for advanced biological applications. Despite the structural promise of these materials, their applications are limited owing to lack of functional capability to interact favourably with biological systems, which has been achieved by functional proteins or peptides. Herein, we outline a strategy for functionalizing DNA structures with short&#8208;peptides, leading to the formation of DNA&#8208;peptide hybrid materials. This proposition offers the opportunity to leverage the unique advantages of each of these bio&#8208;molecules, that have far reaching emergent properties in terms of better cellular interactions and uptake, better stability in biological media, an acceptable and programmable immune response and high bioactive molecule loading capacities. We discuss the synthetic strategies for the formation of these materials, namely, solid&#8208;phase functionalization and solution&#8208;coupling functionalization. We then proceed to highlight selected biological applications of these materials in the domains of cell instruction &amp; molecular recognition, gene delivery, drug delivery and bone &amp; tissue regeneration. We conclude with discussions shedding light on the challenges that these materials pose and offer our insights on future directions of peptide&#8208;DNA research for targeted biomedical applications.

         <title>Exploring the Flexibility of the Glycopeptide Antibiotic Crosslinking Cascade for Extended Peptide Backbones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) crosslinking is performed by cytochrome P450 (Oxy) enzymes and is essential for antibiotic activity. We show that these Oxy enzymes are tolerant of extension at the N but not the C termini of their peptide substrates. Alterations in peptide length were also able to alter the order of activity observed for the Oxy enzymes.







Abstract
The glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are a clinically approved class of antimicrobial agents that classically function through the inhibition of bacterial cell&#8208;wall biosynthesis by sequestration of the precursor lipid&#8197;II. The oxidative crosslinking of the core peptide by cytochrome&#8197;P450 (Oxy) enzymes during GPA biosynthesis is both essential to their function and the source of their synthetic challenge. Thus, understanding the activity and selectivity of these Oxy enzymes is of key importance for the future engineering of this important compound class. Recent reports of GPAs that display an alternative mode of action and a wider range of core peptide structures compared to classic lipid&#8197;II&#8208;binding GPAs raises the question of the tolerance of Oxy enzymes for larger changes in their peptide substrates. In this work, we explore the ability of Oxy enzymes from the biosynthesis pathways of lipid&#8197;II&#8208;binding GPAs to accept altered peptide substrates based on a vancomycin template. Our results show that Oxy enzymes are more tolerant of changes at the N terminus of their substrates, whilst C&#8208;terminal extension of the peptide substrates is deleterious to the activity of all Oxy enzymes. Thus, future studies should prioritise the study of Oxy enzymes from atypical GPA biosynthesis pathways bearing C&#8208;terminal peptide extension to increase the substrate scope of these important cyclisation enzymes.

         <title>Novel approach for isolation and immobilization of a recombinant transaminase applying an advanced nanocomposite system</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing application of recombinant enzymes demands not only effective and sustainable fermentation, but also highly efficient downstream processing and further stabilization of the enzymes by immobilization. In this study, a novel approach for the isolation and immobilization of His&#8208;tagged transaminase from&#160;Chromobacterium violaceum&#160;(CvTA) has been developed. Simultaneous isolation and immobilization of a recombinant of&#160;CvTA was achieved by binding on silica nanoparticles (SNPs) with metal affinity linkers and additionally within poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanofibers. The linker length and the nature of the metal ion significantly affected the enzyme binding efficiency and biocatalytic activity of&#160;CvTA&#8208;SNPs. Formation of PLA nanofibers by electrospinning technique enabled rapid embedding of&#160;CvTA&#8208;SNPs biocatalysts and ensured enhanced stability, activity. The developed advanced immobilization method reduced the time required for enzyme isolation, purification and immobilization by more than fourfold compared to classical stepwise technique.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nucleophilic Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Profiling of PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes represent an important class of highly &#8220;druggable&#8221; enzymes that perform a wide array of critical reactions to support all organisms. Inhibition of individual members of this family of enzymes have been validated as therapeutic targets for pathologies ranging from infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis to epilepsy. Given the broad nature of the activities within this family of enzymes, we envisioned a universally acting probe to characterize existing and putative members of the family that also includes the necessary chemical moieties to enable activity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments. Hence, we developed a probe that contains an N&#8208;hydroxy alanine warhead, which acts as a mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor of PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, a linear diazirine for UV&#8208;crosslinking, and an alkyne moiety to enable enrichment of crosslinked proteins. Our molecule was utilized to study PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes in vitro as well as look at whole cell lysates of Mtb and assess inhibitory activity. The probe was able to enrich and identify LysA, a PLP&#8208;dependent enzyme crucial for lysine biosynthesis, via mass spectrometry. Overall, our study shows the utility of this trifunctional first&#8208;generation probe. We anticipate further optimization of probes for PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes to enable the characterization of rationally designed mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors of PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes which will expedite the preclinical characterization of these important therapeutic entities.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of A&#946;42 aggregation kinetics and pathway by low molecular weight inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation of amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) is directly related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Here, we have investigated the early stages of the aggregation process, during which most of the cytotoxic species are formed. A&#946;42 aggregation kinetics, characterized by the quantification of A&#946;42 monomer consumption, were tracked by real&#8208;time solution NMR spectroscopy (RT&#8208;NMR) allowing the impact that low molecular weight (LMW) inhibitors and modulators exert on the aggregation process to be analysed. Distinct differences in the A&#946;42 kinetic profiles were apparent and were further investigated kinetically and structurally by thioflavin T (ThT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. LMW inhibitors were shown to have differential impact on early&#8208;state aggregation. Insight provided here may direct future therapeutic design based on kinetic profiling of the fibril formation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled DNA nanocages promote cell migration &amp; differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanocages have been explored for capabilities to influence cellular behavior and its functions. Recent times have seen the development of new emergent functionalities of DNA nanodevices as class of biomaterials with immense capacity to interface with biological systems and having vast potential in disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Being chemically robust and biocompatible in nature, DNA nanocages have been surface modified and structurally fine&#8208;tuned to find emerging applications in the field of stem cell therapy and tissue regeneration. DNA nanocages can be utilized for therapeutic angiogenesis that involves induction of blood vessel formation and can be used to treat ischemic diseases like stroke or heart failure. This work addresses the effect of DNA nanocages&#8217; structural topology in their capacity to stimulate endothelial cells angiogenesis. We tested a panel of four geometries of DNA nanocages and checked their potential on the differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). While different DNA nanocage geometries showed successful angiogenesis induction and cell migration in HUVECs, tetrahedral DNA cages showed the maximum uptake and angiogenesis potential indicating that not only the composition of materials, but also the 3D arrangement of ligands might also play role in stimulating the angiogenesis process.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Encoding of a Photocaged Histidine for Light&#8208;Control of Protein Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of light to control protein function is a critical tool in chemical biology. Here we describe the addition of a photocaged histidine to the genetic code. This unnatural amino acid becomes histidine upon exposure to light and allows for the optical control of enzymes that utilize active site histidine residues. We demonstrate light&#8208;induced activation of a blue fluorescent protein and a chloramphenicol transferase. Further, we genetically encoded photocaged histidine in mammalian cells. We then used this approach in live cells for optical control of firefly luciferase and, Renilla luciferase. This tool should have utility in manipulating and controlling a wide range of biological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Isocoumarin Derivatives Fusamarins is Mediated by the PKS8 Gene Cluster in Fusarium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusaria are plant&#8208;pathogens known to produce various secondary metabolites (SMs). Yet, the majority of them is still cryptic due to low production levels in axenic culture, and even less are assigned to their respective biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Expression of such greatly depends on the chromatin structure that determines the accessibility of the associated DNA. Genetic manipulation of the histone H3K9&#8208;trimethyltransferase revealed the isocoumarin derivatives fusamarins, and allowed to assign these SMs to the respective BGC.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes mimic enzyme functions for antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, regeneration&#8208;promoting, and synergistic effects, providing effective applications in periodontology and implantology. Several major advances in the field are highlighted, along with challenges to be overcome in the future.







Abstract
The prevalence of periodontal and peri&#8208;implant diseases has been increasing worldwide and has gained a lot of attention. As multifunctional nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activity, nanozymes have earned a place in the biomedical field. In periodontics and implantology, nanozymes have contributed greatly to research on maintaining periodontal health and improving implant success rates. To highlight this progress, we review nanozymes for antimicrobial therapy, anti&#8208;inflammatory therapy, tissue regeneration promotion, and synergistic effects in periodontal and peri&#8208;implant diseases. The future prospects of nanozymes in periodontology and implantology are also discussed along with challenges.

         <dc:description>
The design of artificial enzymes has emerged as a promising tool for the generation of potent biocatalysts able to promote new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions. This review aims to give a general overview of suitable protein scaffolds, that could be functionalized with an artificial moiety to develop versatile artificial catalysts.







Abstract
The design of artificial enzymes has emerged as a promising tool for the generation of potent biocatalysts able to promote new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions with improved catalytic performances, providing a powerful platform for wide&#8208;ranging applications and a better understanding of protein functions and structures. The selection of an appropriate protein scaffold plays a key role in the design process. This review aims to give a general overview of the most common protein scaffolds that can be exploited for the generation of artificial enzymes. Several examples are discussed and categorized according to the strategy used for the design of the artificial biocatalyst, namely the functionalization of natural enzymes, the creation of a new catalytic site in a protein scaffold bearing a wide hydrophobic pocket and de novo protein design. The review is concluded by a comparison of these different methods and by our perspective on the topic.

         <title>Myxococcus xanthus as Host for the Production of Benzoxazoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazoles exhibit potent bioactivities and are of great interest for drug development. Upon heterologous expression of two genes from the nataxazole pathway, the myxobacterium M.&#8197;xanthus was able to produce benzoxazoles in significant titers. In M.&#8197;xanthus, benzoxazole biosynthesis recruits the adenylating enzyme MxcE from the endogenous myxochelin pathway; this facilitated the diversification of the benzoxazole scaffold.







Abstract
Benzoxazoles are important structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs. Here, we present the heterologous production of 3&#8208;hydroxyanthranilate&#8208;derived benzoxazoles in the host bacterium Myxococcus xanthus following the expression of two genes from the nataxazole biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. T&#252; 6176. The M.&#8197;xanthus expression strain achieved a benzoxazole titer of 114.6&#177;7.4&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 upon precursor supplementation, which is superior to other bacterial production systems. Crosstalk between the heterologously expressed benzoxazole pathway and the endogenous myxochelin pathway led to the combinatorial biosynthesis of benzoxazoles featuring a 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3&#8208;DHBA) building block. Subsequent in&#8197;vitro studies confirmed that this crosstalk is not only due to the availability of 2,3&#8208;DHBA in M.&#8197;xanthus, rather, it is promoted by the adenylating enzyme MxcE from the myxochelin pathway, which contributes to the activation of aryl carboxylic acids and delivers them to benzoxazole biosynthesis.

         <title>Towards Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few proteins are known to be involved in drug&#8208;triggered ICD effects, some are related to ER stress and others imply new modes of action. Here, the triggering mechanisms underlying drug&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death along with the main biotargets and key mediators involved are reviewed.







Abstract
The discovery of immunogenic cell death (ICD) by small molecules (e.&#8201;g., chemotherapeutic drugs) intrigued medicinal chemists and led them to exploit anticancer agents with such a trait because ICD agents provoke anticancer immune responses in addition to their cytotoxicity. However, the unclear molecular mechanism of ICD hampers further achievements in drug development. Fortunately, increasing efforts have been made in this area in recent years by using either chemical or biological approaches. Here, we review the current achievements towards understanding the mechanisms of small molecule&#8208;induced ICD effects.

     alt="Towards Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms of Immunogenic Cell Death"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only a few proteins&lt;/b&gt; are known to be involved in drug-triggered ICD effects, some are related to ER stress and others imply new modes of action. Here, the triggering mechanisms underlying drug-induced immunogenic cell death along with the main biotargets and key mediators involved are reviewed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of immunogenic cell death (ICD) by small molecules (e.&#8201;g., chemotherapeutic drugs) intrigued medicinal chemists and led them to exploit anticancer agents with such a trait because ICD agents provoke anticancer immune responses in addition to their cytotoxicity. However, the unclear molecular mechanism of ICD hampers further achievements in drug development. Fortunately, increasing efforts have been made in this area in recent years by using either chemical or biological approaches. Here, we review the current achievements towards understanding the mechanisms of small molecule-induced ICD effects. Based on the established role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in ICD, we classify the mechanisms of different inducers by their dependency on UPR. Key proteins and pathways with important implications are discussed in depth. We also give our perspectives on the research strategies for future investigation in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chimeric Peptide Inhibits Red Blood Cell Invasion by Plasmodium falciparum with Hundredfold Increased Efficacy
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed peptide chimera, prepared by combining the best features of two known peptide inhibitors, displayed malaria parasite growth inhibition with a potency two orders of magnitude greater than that of any of its parent peptides.







Abstract
Inhibiting the formation of a tight junction between two malaria parasite proteins, apical membrane antigen 1 and rhoptry neck protein 2, crucial for red blood cell invasion, prevents progression of the disease. In this work, we have used a unique approach to design a chimeric peptide, prepared by fusion of the best features of two peptide inhibitors, that has displayed parasite growth inhibition ex vivo with nanomolar IC50, which is 100 times better than any of its parent peptides. Furthermore, to gain structural insights, we computationally modelled the hybrid peptide on its receptor.

         <title>Metal Complexes for Cancer Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is an emerging cancer treatment methodology in which low&#8208;intensity ultrasound activates ultrasound&#8208;active chemical compounds termed sonosensitizers. Recently metal complexes have attracted much attention as new&#8208;generation sonosensitizers due to their tunable energetics. This concept article summarized the current developments in metal&#8208;based SDT. We also provided future outlook on this area of research.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for cancer treatment is gaining attention owing to its non&#8208;invasive property and ultrasound&#8216;s (US) deep tissue penetration ability. In SDT, US activates the sonosensitizer at the target deep&#8208;seated tumors to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which ultimately damage tumors. However, drawbacks such as insufficient ROS production, aggregation of sonosensitizer, off&#8208;target side effects, etc., of the current organic/nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers limit the effectiveness of cancer SDT. Very recently, metal complexes with tunable physiochemical properties (such as sonostability, HOMO to LUMO energy gap, ROS generation ability, aqueous solubility, emission, etc.) have been devised as effective sonosensitizers, which could overcome the limitations of organic/nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers. This concept introduces all the reported metal&#8208;based sonosensitizers and delineates the prospects of metal complexes in cancer sonodynamic therapy. This new concept of metal&#8208;based sonosensitizer can deliver next&#8208;generation cancer drugs.

         <title>Analysis of Selenoprotein F Binding to UDP&#8208;Glucose:Glycoprotein Glucosyltransferase (UGGT) by a Photoreactive Crosslinker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the SelenoF&#8208;binding domain of UDP&#8208;glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) and its relative position will provide structural insights into the function of SelenoF. A series of pulldown assays revealed that SelenoF binds to the flexible TRXL2 region of UGGT1. SelenoF forms covalent bonds to a wide range of sites on UGGT1, suggesting the cooperative action of SelenoF with these sites. The image illustrates an analogy to SelenoF function in UGGT1 in which an astronaut (representing SelenoF) can move around extensively by binding to a flexible arm on a space station (UGGT) that accepts uncompleted robotic spacecraft (misfolded glycoproteins). More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Ito, Y. Takeda et&#8197;al.

         <title>Biosynthetic Pathways of Dimeric Natural Products Containing Bisanthraquinone and Related Xanthones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimeric natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones, with high bioactivities against bacteria and cancer cells, as well as excellent activity in photodynamic therapy, have been isolated over the years. However, the biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated only recently, which are summarized in this concept article to widen our comprehension and application of these important class of compounds in the future.







Abstract
Many dimeric natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones with diverse structures and versatile bioactivities have been isolated over the years. However, the complicated biosynthetic pathways of such natural products, which have remained elusive until recently, negatively impact their mass bioproduction and biosynthetic structural modification for drug discovery. In this concept, we summarize the recent progress in gene cluster mining and biosynthetic pathway elucidation of natural products containing bisanthraquinone and related xanthones. These pioneering works may pave the way for further biosynthetic pathway elucidation and structure modification of dimeric natural products through gene and protein engineering.

         <title>Reverse Transcriptases: From Discovery and Applications to Xenobiology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reverse transcriptases, enzymes that originally use RNA to write DNA, are featured in the review. They play important roles in modern research as well as diagnostics. Recent fields of activities include their tailoring, detection of RNA modifications or the reverse transcription of xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs).







Abstract
Reverse transcriptases are DNA polymerases that can use RNA as a template for DNA synthesis. They thus catalyze the reverse of transcription. Although discovered in 1970, reverse transcriptases are still of great interest and are constantly being further developed for numerous modern research approaches. They are frequently used in biotechnological and molecular diagnostic applications. In this review, we describe the discovery of these fascinating enzymes and summarize research results and applications ranging from molecular cloning, direct virus detection, and modern sequencing methods to xenobiology.

         <title>Applications of Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Enzyme in Biotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a unique polymerase enzyme that does not require a DNA template in order to amplify DNA. The enzyme allows for the stepwise addition of single nucleotides onto the 3&#8217; end of any oligonucleotide sequence. This has made TdT a very exciting molecular tool in biotechnology applications. In this review we explore these applications.







Abstract
The use of polymerase enzymes in biotechnology has allowed us to gain unprecedented control over the manipulation of DNA, opening up new and exciting applications in areas such as biosensing, polynucleotide synthesis, and DNA storage, aptamer development and DNA&#8208;nanotechnology. One of the most intriguing enzymes which has gained prominence in the last decade is terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is one of the only polymerase enzymes capable of catalysing the template independent stepwise addition of nucleotides onto an oligonucleotide chain. This unique enzyme has seen a significant increase in a variety of different applications. In this review, we give a comprehensive discussion of the unique properties and applications of TdT as a biotechnology tool, and the application in the enzymatic synthesis of poly/oligonucleotides. Finally, we look at the increasing role of TdT enzyme in biosensing, DNA storage, synthesis of DNA nanostructures and aptamer development, and give a future outlook for this technology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase&lt;/b&gt; (TdT) is a unique polymerase enzyme that does not require a DNA template in order to amplify DNA. The enzyme allows for the stepwise addition of single nucleotides onto the 3&#8217; end of any oligonucleotide sequence. This has made TdT a very exciting molecular tool in biotechnology applications. In this review we explore these applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of polymerase enzymes in biotechnology has allowed us to gain unprecedented control over the manipulation of DNA, opening up new and exciting applications in areas such as biosensing, polynucleotide synthesis, and DNA storage, aptamer development and DNA-nanotechnology. One of the most intriguing enzymes which has gained prominence in the last decade is terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is one of the only polymerase enzymes capable of catalysing the template independent stepwise addition of nucleotides onto an oligonucleotide chain. This unique enzyme has seen a significant increase in a variety of different applications. In this review, we give a comprehensive discussion of the unique properties and applications of TdT as a biotechnology tool, and the application in the enzymatic synthesis of poly/oligonucleotides. Finally, we look at the increasing role of TdT enzyme in biosensing, DNA storage, synthesis of DNA nanostructures and aptamer development, and give a future outlook for this technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Analysis of Selenoprotein F Binding to UDP&#8208;Glucose:Glycoprotein Glucosyltransferase (UGGT) by a Photoreactive Crosslinker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoprotein F binds to the TRXL2 domain of human UGGT1, and it forms a covalent bond with amino acids in the TRXL3 region and the interdomain between &#946;S2 and GT24 of human UGGT1 via a synthetic crosslinker.







Abstract
In the endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein quality control system, UDP&#8208;glucose : glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) functions as a folding sensor. Although it is known to form a heterodimer with selenoprotein F (SelenoF), the details of the complex formation remain obscure. A pulldown assay using co&#8208;transfected SelenoF and truncated mutants of human UGGT1 (HUGT1) revealed that SelenoF binds to the TRXL2 domain of HUGT1. Additionally, a newly developed photoaffinity crosslinker was selectively introduced into cysteine residues of recombinant SelenoF to determine the spatial orientation of SelenoF to HUGT1. The crosslinking experiments showed that SelenoF formed a covalent bond with amino acids in the TRXL3 region and the interdomain between &#946;S2 and GT24 of HUGT1 via the synthetic crosslinker. SelenoF might play a role in assessing and refining the disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins in the hydrophobic cavity of HUGT1 as it binds to the highly flexible region of HUGT1 to reach its long hydrophobic cavity. Clarification of the SelenoF&#8208;binding domain of UGGT and its relative position will help predict and reveal the function of SelenoF from a structural perspective.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Isocoumarin Derivatives Fusamarins is Mediated by the PKS8 Gene Cluster in Fusarium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusaria are plant&#8208;pathogenic fungi infecting several staple crops, and accumulating often toxic compounds during infection and hence threaten food security worldwide. The full chemical potential of these notorious pathogens is still elusive. Here, we characterized the previously cryptic PKS8 gene cluster and show that four genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of the dihydroisocoumarin derivates fusamarins with moderate cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
Fusarium mangiferae causes the mango malformation disease (MMD) on young mango trees and seedlings resulting in economically significant crop losses. In addition, F.&#8197;mangiferae produces a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs), including mycotoxins that may contaminate the harvest. Their production is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. Here, we show that lack of the H3&#8197;K9&#8208;specific histone methyltransferase, FmKmt1, influences the expression of the F.&#8197;mangiferae polyketide synthase (PKS) 8 (FmPKS8), a so far cryptic PKS. By a combination of reverse genetics, untargeted metabolomics, bioinformatics and chemical analyses including structural elucidation, we determined the FmPKS8 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and linked its activity to the production of fusamarins (FMN), which can be structurally classified as dihydroisocoumarins. Functional characterization of the four FMN cluster genes shed light on the biosynthetic pathway. Cytotoxicity assays revealed moderate toxicities with IC50 values between 1 and 50&#8197;&#956;M depending on the compound.
