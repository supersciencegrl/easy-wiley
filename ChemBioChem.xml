      <title>Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

      <title>Discovery and Engineering of a Novel Baeyer&#8211;Villiger Monooxygenase from Gordonia sihwensis with High Normal Regioselectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are remarkable biocatalysts for the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of ketones to generate esters or lactones. The regioselectivity of BVMOs is essential for determining the ratio of the two regioisomeric products (&#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;abnormal&#8221;) when catalyzing asymmetric ketone substrates. Starting from a known normal&#8208;preferring BVMO sequence from  Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 (  Pp  BVMO), a novel BVMO from  Gordonia sihwensis  (  Gs  BVMO) with higher normal regioselectivity (up to 97/3) was identified. Furthermore, protein engineering increased the specificity constant (  k  cat  /  K  M  ) 8.9&#8208;fold to 484 s  &#8208;1  mM  &#8208;1  for 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from oleic acid. Consequently, by using the variant  Gs  BVMO  C308L  as an efficient biocatalyst, 10&#8208;ketostearic acid was efficiently transformed into &#160;9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid, with a space&#8208;time yield of 60.5 g L  &#8208;1  d  &#8208;1  .

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are remarkable biocatalysts for the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of ketones to generate esters or lactones. The regioselectivity of BVMOs is essential for determining the ratio of the two regioisomeric products (&#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;abnormal&#8221;) when catalyzing asymmetric ketone substrates. Starting from a known normal&#8208;preferring BVMO sequence from  Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 (  Pp  BVMO), a novel BVMO from  Gordonia sihwensis  (  Gs  BVMO) with higher normal regioselectivity (up to 97/3) was identified. Furthermore, protein engineering increased the specificity constant (  k  cat  /  K  M  ) 8.9&#8208;fold to 484 s  &#8208;1  mM  &#8208;1  for 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from oleic acid.

      <title>Courses Based on iGEM/BIOMOD Competitions Are the Ideal Format for Research&#8208;Based Learning of Xenobiology</title>
      <dc:description>
Competition experiments: &#8220;iGEM&#8208;Synthetic Biology&#8221; is a student&#8208;centered, research&#8208;based teaching format for xenobiology. Students conduct their own experiments in an interdisciplinary team with a focus on participation in an international competition. Such formats motivate students to show the highest performance and are possibly the best way to teach novel emerging research fields within the Humboldtian model of higher education.







Abstract
Synthetic biology and especially xenobiology, as emerging new fields of science, have reached an intellectual and experimental maturity that makes them suitable for integration into the university curricula of chemical and biological disciplines. Novel scientific fields that include laboratory work are perfect playgrounds for developing highly motivating research&#8208;based teaching modules. We believe that research&#8208;based learning enriched by digital tools is the best approach for teaching new emerging essentials of academic education. This is especially true when the scientific field as such is still not canonized with text books and best&#8208;practice examples. Our experience shows that iGEM/BIOMOD competitions represent an excellent basis for designing research&#8208;based courses in xenobiology. Therefore, we present a report on &#8220;iGEM&#8211;Synthetic Biology&#8221; offered at the Technische Universit&#228;t Berlin as an example.

      <title>Self&#8208;Emergent Protocells Generated in an Aqueous Solution with Binary Macromolecules through Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
A cell&#8208;like structure or protocell emerges spontaneously by simply mixing DNAs, phospholipids and two kinds of hydrophilic macromolecules: PEG and dextran (DEX). The top middle picture shows a water/water microdroplet (the DEX&#8208;rich phase surrounded by the PEG&#8208;rich phase) generated through the depletion effect of the different macromolecules. By the addition of DNAs to the solution, the DEX&#8208;rich droplet autonomously takes DNAs inside (see the droplet bottom right). In the coexistence of phospholipids, they cover the droplets, and a stable phospholipid vesicle entrapping DNAs appears in a self&#8208;organized manner (see the protocell bottom left). More information can be found in the communication by K. Takiguchi, K. Tsumoto, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Peptidyl Acyloxymethyl Ketones as Activity&#8208;Based Probes for the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
      <dc:description>
A mock video game of pandemic outbreaks illustrates how scientists around the globe with various resources are tackling missions in the combat against Covid&#8208;19. In their full paper, S.&#8197;H.&#8197;L. Verhelst et&#8197;al. describe the development of an activity&#8208;based probe to selectively detect the active Main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV2. This probe is armed with a cysteine&#8208;reactive acyloxymethyl ketone warhead and a substrate&#8208;based peptide skeleton that allow it to detect the protease even in a complex human proteome.

      <title>Engineering the Next Generation of Matched Models for Chemical Translational Biology</title>
      <dc:description>
Matched models: The translation of drug compounds from high&#8208;throughput models to high&#8208;order, low&#8208;throughput biological models is a major obstacle facing chemical biology. I present here a case for considering the next generation of matched biological models to address this bottleneck.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matched models&lt;/b&gt;: The translation of drug compounds from high&#8208;throughput models to high&#8208;order, low&#8208;throughput biological models is a major obstacle facing chemical biology. I present here a case for considering the next generation of matched biological models to address this bottleneck.

      <title>Metabolic Glycoengineering with Azide&#8208; and Alkene&#8208;Modified Hexosamines: Quantification of Sialic Acid Levels</title>
      <dc:description>Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) is an established method to incorporate chemical reporter groups into cellular glycans for subsequent bioorthogonal labeling. The method has found broad application for the visualization and isolation of glycans allowing to probe their biological roles. Furthermore, targeting of drugs to cancer cells, that present high concentrations of sialic acids on their surface, is an attractive approach. We report the application of a labeling reaction using 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,5&#8208;methylenedioxybenzene for the quantification of sialic acid derivates after MGE with various azide&#8208; and alkene&#8208;modified ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc derivatives. We followed the time course of sialic acid production and were able to detect sialic acids modified with the chemical reporter group not only after addition of ManNAc derivatives to the cell culture. A cyclopropane&#8208;modified ManNAc derivative, being a model for the corresponding cyclopropene analog that undergoes fast inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines, resulted in the highest incorporation efficiency. Furthermore, we investigated whether feeding of the cells with natural and unnatural ManNAc derivative results in increased levels of sialic acids and found that this is strongly dependent on the investigated cell type and cell fraction. For HEK 293T cells, a strong increase of free sialic acids in the cell interior was found whereas cell&#8208;surface sialic acid levels are only moderately increased.</dc:description>

      <title>Superior Proton Transfer Catalytic Promiscuity of Cytochrome C in Self&#8208;organized Media</title>
      <dc:description>Evolutionarily elderly proteins commonly feature greater catalytic promiscuity. Cytochrome c (cyt c) is one among first set of proteins in evolution with known prospects in electron transport and peroxidative property. Here we report that cyt c is a proficient proton transfer catalyst too and enhances the Kemp elimination (KE) (model reaction to show proton transfer catalytic property) by ~750 fold on self&#8208;organized systems like&#8208; micelles and vesicles. The self&#8208;organized systems mimic the mitochondrial environment in&#8208;vitro for cyt c. Using an array of biophysical and biochemical mutational assays, mechanistic pathways involving both acid/base and redox have been explored. The histidine (His&#8208;18) moiety close to hemin group is mainly responsible for proton abstraction to promote the concerted E2 pathway for KE catalysis when cyt c is in oxidized form which has also been confirmed by a H18A mutant version of cyt c. However, redox pathway is more predominant under reducing condition in presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH range 6 to 7.4. Interestingly, we have found an almost 750&#8208;fold enhanced KE catalysis by cyt c compared to aqueous buffer. Overall, the presented data apart from providing mechanistic insights, it reveals an unprecedented catalytic property of cyt c which can be of high importance in evolutionary perspective considering its role in delineating phylogenic tree and also towards generating programmable designer biocatalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Quantification of Neurotransmitters in Single Live Cell Vesicles Shows Exocytosis is Predominantly Partial</title>
      <dc:description>
Partial release mechanism of exocytosis: This minireview highlights the recent progress in amperometric measurement for monitoring exocytosis from single cells, and electrochemical cytometry measurement of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Evidence from several studies supports the hypothesis that partial release is the primary mechanism during regular exocytosis.







Abstract
Exocytosis plays an essential role in the communication between cells in the nervous system. Understanding the regulation of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis and the amount of neurotransmitter content that is stored in vesicles is of importance, as it provides fundamental insights to understand how the brain works and how neurons elicit a certain behavior. In this minireview, we summarize recent progress in amperometric measurements for monitoring exocytosis in single cells and electrochemical cytometry measurements of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Important steps have increased our understanding of the different mechanisms of exocytosis. Increasing evidence is firmly establishing that partial release is the primary mechanism of release in multiple cell types.

      <title>Efficient Editing of Silver Nanoclusters by Changing Simply One Cytosine in DNA Template</title>
      <dc:description>DNA with genetic information was edited to regulate and repair the structure and function of the protein. In DNA nanotechnology, DNA with programmable information can be designed to edit fluorescence intensity and emissive colors of DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCS). By introducing and moving one cytosine in spacer of emitter domain, we have built up a simple strategy to regulate excitation and emission wavelength of AgNCs. With replacement of thymine in the spacer of emitter with one cytosine, the expected excitation and emission change don&#8217;t occur. However, after moving the introduced cytosine, DNA templates produce AgNCs with extremely different excitation and emission wavelength compared to the initial template, obtaining one template for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive species with the highest fluorescence intensity. The formation of AgNCs induces DNA template into condensed secondary structure based on altered migration rate on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The simple strategy by moving one cytosine in spacer in emitter domain can enrich the library of templates for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs and have a great potential in bioimaging and probe design.</dc:description>

In DNA nanotechnology, DNA with programmable information can be designed to edit fluorescence intensity and emissive colors of DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCS). By introducing and moving one cytosine in spacer of emitter domain, we have built up a simple strategy to regulate excitation and emission wavelength of AgNCs. With replacement of thymine in the spacer of emitter with one cytosine, the expected excitation and emission change don&#8217;t occur. However, after moving the introduced cytosine, DNA templates produce AgNCs with extremely different excitation and emission wavelength compared to the initial template, obtaining one template for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive species with the highest fluorescence intensity. The formation of AgNCs induces DNA template into condensed secondary structure based on altered migration rate on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The simple strategy by moving one cytosine in spacer in emitter domain can enrich the library of templates for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs and have a great potential in bioimaging and probe design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Turn it on: Efficacy of traditional small molecules/inhibitors relies on achieving optimal target/ligand occupancy. New concepts, such as gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, are beginning to break these shackles. Discussed herein is the current knowledge about small molecule&#8208;induced gain&#8208;of&#8208;function and how emerging data and paradigms could prove useful in harnessing this powerful concept.







Abstract
The pressing need for innovation in drug discovery is spurring the emergence of drugs that turn on protein function, as opposed to shutting activity down. Several pharmacophores usher protein target gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, for instance: PROTACs promote protein target degradation; other drug candidates have been reported to function through dominant&#8208;negative inhibition of their target enzyme. Such classes of molecules are typically active at low target occupancy and display numerous advantages relative to canonical inhibitors, whose function is intrinsically tied to achieving, or exceeding a threshold occupancy. However, our ability to generally tap into gain&#8208;of&#8208;function processes through small molecule interventions is overall in its infancy. Herein, I outline how chemical biology is poised to help us bring this powerful idea to fruition. I further outline means through which gain&#8208;of&#8208;function events can be identified and harnessed.

Abstract
In this viewpoint, the concepts that chemistry transcends the laboratory into the clinic and beyond is explored from the perspective of a single individual who began strictly within synthetic chemistry.

In recent years, the secondary messenger, cyclic di&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP), has been identified as an essential signaling molecule in a diverse array of bacterial genera. We and others have shown that defects in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP homeostasis result in severe physiological defects and virulence attenuation in many bacterial species. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP levels.

      <title>Millisecond Allosteric Dynamics of Activated Ras Reproduced with a Slowly Hydrolyzable GTP Analogue</title>
      <dc:description>The millisecond timescale dynamics of activated Ras transiently sample a low&#8208;populated conformational state that has distinct surface property from the major state and represents a promising target for binding of small&#8208;molecule compounds. To avoid complications of hydrolysis, dynamics and other properties of active Ras have so far been routinely investigated using non&#8208;hydrolyzable GTP analogues, which, however, were previously reported to alter both the kinetics and distribution of the conformational exchange. In this study, we quantitatively measure and validate the internal dynamics of Ras complexed with a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP&#947;S, which increases the lifetime of active Ras by 23 times relative to that of native GTP. It is found that GTP&#947;S, in addition to its better mimicking of the exchange kinetics than the commonly used non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogues GppNHp and GppCH  2  p, can rigorously reproduce the natural dynamics network in active Ras, indicating its fitness for use in the development of allosteric inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Ligand Binds Ascaris Telomere Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with Blue&#8208;Shift and Enhanced Emission</title>
      <dc:description>The development of small molecules, which can selectively target G4 DNAs has drawn considerable attention due to their unique physiological and pathological functions. However, only a few molecules were found to selective binding of a particular G4 DNA structure. Herein, we have developed a fluorescence ligand  Q1  , a molecular scaffold of carbazole&#8208;pyridine core bridged with a phenylboronic acid side chain, exhibited as a selective ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 ligand with about 18 nm blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced fluorescence intensity. Photophysical properties revealed that  Q1  was sensitive to the microenvironment and gave the best selectivity to ASC20 with equilibrium binding constant (  K  a  = 6.04 &#180; 10  5  M  &#8208;1  ). The time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies also demonstrated that  Q1  showed a longer fluorescence lifetime in the presence of ASC20. The binding characteristics of  Q1  with ASC20 were described in detail by &#64258;uorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay, 2&#8208;Ap titration experiment and molecular docking. Ligand  Q1  could adopt an appropriate pose at terminal G&#8208;quartets of ASC20 via the multiple interactions including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between aromatic rings, thus led to a strong fluorescence enhancement. In addition, co&#8208;staining image showed  Q1  mainly distributed in the cytoplasm area. According, this work provides insights for the development of ligands that selectively targeting a specific G4 DNA structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Evolutionary History of Bioessential Elements Can Guide the Search for Life in the Universe</title>
      <dc:description>
Astrobiology, origins of life and metals: The environmental availabilities of biologically useful elements such as transition metals might influence natural selection. Understanding the evolution of life's essential chemical elements is also critical for detecting and interpreting potential biological signatures elsewhere in the universe.







Abstract
Our understanding of life in the universe comes from one sample, life on Earth. Current and next&#8208;generation space missions will target exoplanets as well as planets and moons in our own solar system with the primary goal of detecting, interpreting and characterizing indications of possible biological activity. Thus, understanding life's fundamental characteristics is increasingly critical for detecting and interpreting potential biological signatures elsewhere in the universe. Astrobiologists have outlined the essential roles of carbon and water for life, but we have yet to decipher the rules governing the evolution of how living organisms use bioessential elements. Does the suite of life's essential chemical elements on Earth constitute only one possible evolutionary outcome? Are some elements so essential for biological functions that evolution will select for them despite low availability? How would this play out on other worlds that have different relative element abundances? When we look for life in the universe, or the conditions that could give rise to life, we must learn how to recognize it in extremely different chemical and environmental conditions from those on Earth. We argue that by exposing self&#8208;organizing biotic chemistries to different combinations of abiotic materials, and by mapping the evolutionary history of metalloenzyme biochemistry onto geological availabilities of metals, alternative element choices that are very different from life's present&#8208;day molecular structure might result. A greater understanding of the paleomolecular evolutionary history of life on Earth will create a predictive capacity for detecting and assessing life's existence on worlds where alternate evolutionary paths might have been taken.

      <title>Regulation of Lipid Bilayer Ion Permeability by Antibacterial Polymethyloxazoline&#8208;Polyethyleneimine</title>
      <dc:description>&lt;p class="BDAbstract" style="line&#8208;height:normal"&gt;Amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers display activity against the outer bacterial cell membrane, triggering various physiological effects. We investigated the regulation of ion transport across the lipid bilayer to understand differences in biological activity for a series of amphiphilic polymethyloxazoline&#8208;polyethyleneimine copolymers. Results confirmed that tested structures were able to increase the permeability of the LB membrane or its rupture. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments show that triggered conductance profile and its character is strongly correlated with the polymer structure and zeta&#8208;potential. The polymer exhibiting the highest antimicrobial activity promotes ion transport using a unique mechanism and step&amp;ndash;like characteristics with well&#8208;defined discreet openings and closings.

      <title>Stepwise strategy for one&#8208;pot synthesis of single&#8208;stranded DNA rings from multiple short fragments</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Cyclic rings of single&#8208;stranded DNA have various unique properties, but still wider applications have been hampered by their poor availability. This paper reports a convenient one&#8208;pot method in which these rings are efficiently synthesized by using T4 DNA ligase through convergent cyclization of easily&#8208;available short DNA fragments. The key of the present method is to separate all the splint oligonucleotides into several sets, and add each set sequentially with appropriate interval to the solutions containing all the short DNA fragments. Compared with simple one&#8208;pot strategy involving simultaneous addition of all the splints at the beginning of reaction, both the selectivity and the yields of target single&#8208;stranded DNA rings are greatly improved. This convergent method is especially useful to prepare large&#8208;sized rings which are otherwise hardly obtainable. By starting from six short DNA fragments (71&#8208;82 nt), prepared by a DNA synthesizer, a single&#8208;stranded DNA ring of 452&#8208;nt size was synthesized in 35 mol% yield and in high selectivity.

      <title>Novel dioxane and morpholine nucleotide analogs: Syntheses and RNA&#8208;hybridization properties</title>
      <dc:description>A novel class of nucleotide analogs with a dioxane ring as central scaffold was developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized and the final thymidine analogs synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide syntheses.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel class of nucleotide analogs with a dioxane ring as central scaffold was developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized and the final thymidine analogs synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide syntheses. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to the analogous morpholine derivatives, which opens the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double stranded RNA&#8208;sequences and their hybridization properties investigated by melting temperature analysis.

      <title>Fluorescent peptide biosensor for probing CDK6 activity in lung cancer cell extracts</title>
      <dc:description>CDK6 kinase regulates cell cycle progression in G1, together with CDK4, but has cell&#8208;, tissue&#8208; and developmentally&#8208;distinct functions associated with transcription, angiogenesis and metabolism. Although CDK6 constitutes an attractive cancer biomarker and target there are no means of assessing its activity in a complex environment. In this study we describe design, engineering and characterization of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase that reports on CDK6 kinase activity through sensitive changes in fluorescence intensity. This biosensor can report on CDK6 activity in a dose&#8208;dependent fashion, thereby enabling quantification of differences in kinase activity in complex and physiologically&#8208;relevant environments. Further implementation of this biosensor in different lung and melanoma cell lines, as well as in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients together with a CDK4 biosensor highlighted differences in kinase activity between CDK6 and CDK4 kinase. This work demonstrates the utility of these selective tools for monitoring two closely related kinases comparatively and simultaneously in the same samples, thereby offering attractive perspectives for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</dc:description>

      <title>Quinone methide based organophosphate hydrolases inhibitors: Trans proximity labelers versus Cis labeling activity&#8208;based probes</title>
      <dc:description>Quinone methide (QM) chemistry is widely applied including in enzyme inhibitors. Typically, enzyme&#8208;mediated bond&#8208;breaking releases a phenol product that rearranges into an electrophilic QM that in turn covalently modifies protein side&#8208;chains. However, the factors that govern the reactivity of QM&#8208;based inhibitors, and their mode of inhibition, have not been systematically explored. Foremost, enzyme inactivation may occur in  cis  , whereby one of the QM molecules inactivates the very same enzyme molecule that released it, or by  trans  , if the released QMs diffuse away and inactivate other enzyme molecules. We examined QM&#8208;based inhibitors for enzymes exhibiting phosphoester hydrolase activity. We tested different phenolic substituents and benzylic leaving groups, thereby modulating the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis, phenolate&#8208;to&#8208;QM rearrangement, and the electrophilicity of the resulting QM. By developing assays that distinguish between  cis  versus trans inhibition, we have identified certain combinations of leaving groups and phenyl substituents that lead to inhibition in the  cis  mode, while other combinations led to  trans  inhibition. Our results suggest that  cis  acting QM&#8208;based substrates may be used as activity&#8208;based probes for identifying various phospho&#8208; and phosphono&#8208;ester hydrolases, and potentially other hydrolases.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural insights into the interaction of heme with protein tyrosine kinase JAK2</title>
      <dc:description>Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is the most important signal transducing tyrosine kinase in erythropoietic precursor cells. Its malfunction drives several myeloproliferative disorders. Heme is a small metal ion&#8208;carrying molecule, which is incorporated into hemoglobin in erythroid precursor cells to transport oxygen.

      <title>A FRET&#8208;based fluorescent probe to screen anti&#8208;cancer drugs, inhibiting p73 binding to MDM2.</title>
      <dc:description>The protein p73 acts as a transcription factor, resulting in tumor suppression. MDM2, an oncogenic protein, can negatively influence p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis by binding to p73 transactivation domains (TAD). The inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interaction between p73 and oncogenic proteins is an attractive strategy for promoting p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Herein, we describe the use of a modified p73&#8208;TAD peptide for the FRET&#8208;based assay of the binding of p73&#8208;TAD to MDM2. The FRET probe equipped with 1&#8208;naphthylamine (&#955;  ex  = 330 nm, &#955;  em  = 445 nm) serves as a FRET acceptor, and the tryptophan (Trp) of the protein acts as FRET donor (Trp, &#955;  ex  = 280 nm, &#955;  em  = 340 nm). Sensitized emission of the FRET probe was observed upon excitation of the protein&#8208;FRET&#8208;probe complex at the excitation wavelength of Trp. Furthermore, addition of the MDM2 inhibitor Nutiln&#8208;3 drastically reduced the FRET signal, indicating that the FRET probe competes with Nutiln&#8208;3 for MDM2 binding. The developed FRET binding assay may be applicable in high&#8208;throughput screening of novel drugs that inhibit interactions between p73 and MDM2.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of new DNA Aptamers for anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 Reverse Transcriptase</title>
      <dc:description>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV&#8208;1 RT) is a necessary enzyme for retroviral replication which is the main target for antiviral therapy against AIDs. The effective anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT drugs are classified into two groups; nucleoside inhibitors (NRTI) and non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI) which inhibit the DNA polymerase function. In this study, new DNA aptamers were isolated as anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT inhibitors. The selected DNA aptamer (WT62) presented with high affinity and inhibition against wild type (WT) HIV&#8208;1 RT and gave  a K  D  value of 75.10 &#177; 0.29 nM and an IC  50  value of 84.81 &#177; 8.54 nM. Moreover, WT62 decreased the DNA polymerase function of K103N/Y181C double mutant (KY) HIV&#8208;1 RT by around 80%. Furthermore, the ITC results showed that this aptamer has slightly small binding enthalpies with both WT and KY HIV&#8208;1 RTs through which the complex may form a hydrophobic interaction or non&#8208;covalent bonding. The NMR result also suggested that the WT62 aptamer could bind with both WT and KY mutant HIV&#8208;1 RT at the connection domain.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemically Diverse Multifunctional Peptide Platforms with Antimicrobial and Cell Adhesive Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial infections and incomplete biomaterial integration represent major problems that can lead to failure of medical implants. However, simultaneously addressing these two issues remains a challenge. Here, we present a chemical peptide library based on a multifunctional platform containing the antimicrobial peptide LF1&#8208;11 and the cell adhesive motif RGD. The scaffolds were customized with catechol groups to ensure the straightforward functionalization of the implant surface, and linkers of different length to assess the effect of peptide accessibility on the biological response. The peptidic platforms significantly improved the adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells and showed antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus. Of note, the peptides bearing too long spacers displayed the lowest efficiency. Subsequently, we designed a platform replacing linear by cyclic RGD, which further enhanced eukaryotic cell adhesion while retaining excellent antimicrobial properties, thus being a suitable candidate for tissue engineering applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Repressor&#8208;like on&#8208;off regulation of protein expression by the DNA&#8208;binding transcription activator&#8208;like effector in T7 promoter&#8208;based cell&#8208;free protein synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The aim of this study was to develop a transcription activator&#8208;like effector (TALE)&#8208;based technology to regulate protein synthesis in cell&#8208;free systems. We attempted to regulate the T7 promoter system, which has no natural mechanism of expression control, and sought to arbitrarily induce protein expression through the formation and dissociation of TALE and target DNA complexes. Protein synthesis was performed in a cell&#8208;free system in the presence of TALE, which recognized and bound to a sequence upstream of the T7 promoter, and protein expression was suppressed by approximately 80% compared to the absence of TALE. This suggests that the masking of part of the promoter region strongly suppresses protein synthesis. Additionally, competitive inhibition of TALE binding to the target DNA template led to protein synthesis levels that were equivalent to the levels in the absence of TALE. Our results demonstrate that DNA recognition by TALE can regulate the expression of the T7 promoter system.</dc:description>

      <title>Why does the novel Coronavirus Spike Protein interact so strongly with the human ACE2? A thermodynamic answer.</title>
      <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic is the biggest health concern today, but until now there are no treatments. One possible drug target is the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from the Coronavirus&#8217; Spike Protein, which recognizes the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Our in silico study discusses crucial structural and thermodynamic aspects of the interactions involving RBDs from the SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with the hACE2. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations explained why the chemical affinity of the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 for hACE2 is much higher than in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV, revealing an intricate pattern of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and estimating a free energy of binding, consistently much more negative in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This work presents a chemical reason for the difficulty in treating the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus using drugs targeting its Spike Protein and helps to explain its infectiousness.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmed and Sequential Disassembly of Multi&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Protein Nanoassemblies: A Detailed Mechanistic Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>We report a novel chemical method for the construction of multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoassemblies using custom&#8208;designed facially amphiphilic monodisperse protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The macromolecular synthons contain a globular hydrophilic protein domain site&#8208;specifically conjugated to photo&#8208;responsive hydrophobic benzyl&#8208;ether dendron of different generations using oligoethylene glycol linkers of defined length. The size of the protein nanoassemblies can be systematically tuned by choosing an appropriate dendron or linker of defined length. Exposure of protein nanoassemblies to light results in partial disassembly of complex rather than complete disassembly. The newly formed protein nanoparticle no longer responds to light but could be disassembled into constitutive monomers at the acidic condition or further treatment with a small molecule. More interestingly, the distribution ratio of assembled versus disassembled states of protein nanoassemblies after photochemical reaction does not depend on the dendron generation or nature of linker functionality or the identity of the protein, but heavily influenced by choice of linker length. Altogether, this work discloses a new chemical method for the rational design of a monodisperse multi&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based supramolecular system with exquisite control over the disassembly process.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange of Selective PyFALGEA Oligopeptide Ligands Towards Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>The biorelevant selective PyFALGEA oligopeptide ligand towards epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is successfully employed as substrate in magnetic resonance signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) experiments. It is demonstrated that PyFALGEA and the iridium catalyst &#8208; IMes form a PyFALGEA:IMes molecular complex. The interaction between PyFALGEA:IMes and H  2  results in a ternary SABRE complex. Selective 1D EXSY experiments reveal that this complex is labile, which is an essential condition for successful hyperpolarization via SABRE. Polarization transfer from parahydrogen to PyFALGEA is observed leading to significant enhancement of the  1  H NMR signals of PyFALGEA. Different iridium catalysts and peptides are inspected to discuss the influence of their molecular structures on the efficiency of hyperpolarization. It is observed that the PyFALGEA oligopeptide hyperpolarization is more efficient when an iridium catalyst with a sterically less demanding NHC&#8208;ligand system such as IMesBn is employed. Experiments with shorter analogues of PyFALGEA i.e. PyLGEA and PyEA, show that the bulky phenylalanine from the PyFALGEA oligopeptide causes sterical hindrance in the SABRE complex, which hampers hyperpolarization with IMes. Finally, the single&#8208;scan  1  H NMR SABRE experiment of PyFALGEA with IMesBn revealed a unique pattern of NMR lines in the hydride region, which can be treated as a fingerprint of this important oligopeptide.</dc:description>

      <title>Identification of&#160;L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;as a&#160;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B&#160;substrate using K&#8208;BIPS</title>
      <dc:description>Kinases and phosphatases are major players in a variety&#160;of cellular events, including cell signaling. Aberrant activity or&#160;mutations in kinases and phosphatases can lead to diseases, such as&#160;cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Compared to kinases,&#160;phosphatases are understudied, which is partly a result of the limited&#160;methods to identify substrates. As a solution, we developed a&#160;proteomics&#8208;based method called Kinase&#8208;catalyzed Biotinylation to&#160;Identify Phosphatase Substrates (K&#8208;BIPS) that previously identified&#160;substrates of Ser/Thr phosphatases using small molecule inhibitors.&#160;Here, for the first time, K&#8208;BIPS was applied to identify substrates of a&#160;tyrosine phosphatase, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B),&#160;using siRNA knockdown conditions. Eight possible substrates of&#160;PTP1B were discovered in HEK293 cells, including the known&#160;substrate Pyruvate Kinase. In addition, L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;(LDHA) was validated as a novel PTP1B substrate. With the ability to&#160;use knockdown conditions with Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphatases, K&#8208;BIPS&#160;represents a general discovery tool to explore phosphatases biology&#160;by identifying unanticipated substrates.</dc:description>

As a solution, we developed a&#160;proteomics&#8208;based method called Kinase&#8208;catalyzed Biotinylation to&#160;Identify Phosphatase Substrates (K&#8208;BIPS) that previously identified&#160;substrates of Ser/Thr phosphatases using small molecule inhibitors.&#160;Here, for the first time, K&#8208;BIPS was applied to identify substrates of a&#160;tyrosine phosphatase, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B),&#160;using siRNA knockdown conditions. Eight possible substrates of&#160;PTP1B were discovered in HEK293 cells, including the known&#160;substrate Pyruvate Kinase. In addition, L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;(LDHA) was validated as a novel PTP1B substrate. With the ability to&#160;use knockdown conditions with Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphatases, K&#8208;BIPS&#160;represents a general discovery tool to explore phosphatases biology&#160;by identifying unanticipated substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The broad field of Structural DNA Nanotechnology has diverged into various areas of applications ranging from computing, photonics, synthetic biology, biosensing to in&#8208;vivo bioimaging and therapeutic delivery to name a few. Though the field began to exploit DNA to build various nanoscale architectures, it has now taken a new path to diverge from structural DNA nanotechnology to functional or applied DNA nanotechnology.

In this review, we summarize the key developments in DNA nanotechnology revealing a current trend, which merges the functionality of DNA devices with the specificity of biomolecules to access a range of functions in biological systems. This review seeks to provide a perspective on evolution and biological applications of DNA nanotechnology, where integration of DNA structures with biomolecules can now uncover phenomena of interests to biologists and biomedical scientists. Finally, we conclude with the challenges, limitations, and perspectives of DNA nanodevices in fundamental and applied research.</dc:description>

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
