         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Oxygen&#8208;Independent DNA Photodegradation by Pheophorbide a: Implications for Future Photodynamic Therapy Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the oxygen&#8208;independent photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA provides new insights into potential photodynamic therapy strategies. Our study highlights Phed a&#8217;s ability to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals under anoxic conditions, allowing for effective DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). This capability may enhance cancer treatment in hypoxic environments.







Abstract
This study explores the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA under anoxic conditions, emphasizing its potential for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in hypoxic tumor environments. We used electron spin resonance (ESR), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to assess the radical generation and DNA interaction capabilities of Phed a compared to Pyropheophorbide a (Pyro a) under both oxygenated and anoxic conditions. Our results reveal that Phed a effectively degrades G&#8208;quadruplex DNA in the absence of oxygen, whereas Pyro a does not. Under anoxic conditions, Phed a generates unique carbon&#8208;centered radicals, as indicated by distinctive ESR signals, which are not observed in aerobic environments or with Pyro a. These radicals facilitate DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phed a&#8217;s ability to degrade DNA independently of oxygen underscores its potential as a versatile and effective PDT agent, especially for hypoxic tumors where traditional photosensitizers are ineffective. This study paves the way for the development of new PDT agents that can operate under different oxygen levels. Phed a&#8217;s radical generation and oxygen&#8208;independent DNA degradation mechanisms make it a promising candidate for future PDT applications.

         <dc:description>Ruthenium complexes are among the most extensively studied and developed luminescent transition&#8208;metal complexes for anticancer applications. Dinuclear Ru(II) complexes have caught significant interest for larger size, higher charge, and variable complex shapes. In this concept, we explore past and recent works on the possible biological applications of versatile tetrapyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2,3&#8208;c:3,2&#8208;h:2&#8244;,3&#8244;&#8208;j]phenazine (tppz)&#8208;based dinuclear Ru(II) complexes with a focus on their use as quadruplex DNA probes, organelle imaging, and phototherapeutic agents. This concept also points out that a particular type of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes can act as multitargeting and multifunctional anticancer agents &#8208;making this an exciting area in which an array of further applications will likely emerge.</dc:description>

         <title>An upgraded solid&#8208;phase assembly of chelators (DOTA and NOTA) enabled bacterial uptake studies of radiolabeled peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among popular radio metal chelators, DOTA and NOTA have been remarkably considered in radionuclide therapy and imaging studies due to several advantages in pharmacology. Here, we developed a practical and general method for assembling DOTA and NOTA in the solid phase peptide (pseudo&#8208;dilute conditions) with a wide range of solvents using easily accessible and economical feedstocks, which mitigated unprecedented challenges faced by previously reported methods. This upgraded approach enabled an efficient installation of these two chelators on various bioactive peptide sequences. Finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of the DOTA&#8208; and NOTA&#8208;attached Combi peptides to B. subtilis, which was found to be intact. The authenticity of the assembled DOTA framework was assessed by labeling 177Lu and in vitro bacterial uptake in E. coli and S. aureus. 177Lu&#8208;labeled DOTA&#8208;Combi peptide exhibited promising uptake for developing a bacterial infection imaging agent while negligible hemolysis activity even at &gt; 200 &#181;M. This contribution will be valued for developing peptide radiopharmaceuticals with operational simplicity and economic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Navigating the deuteration landscape: innovations, challenges, and clinical potential of deuterioindoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoles, pivotal to the realm of drug discovery, underpin numerous FDA&#8208;approved therapeutics. Despite their clinical benefits, pharmacokinetic and toxicity concerns have occasionally hampered their broader application. A notable advancement in this domain is the substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium, known as deuterium modification, which significantly enhances the pharmacological properties of these compounds. This review elucidates the progression of deuterium chemistry, culminating in approval of Deutetrabenazine in 2017. This milestone has catalyzed additional research into deuterated indoles, such as Dosimertinib, which have demonstrated enhancements in stability, toxicity profiles, and therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the review addresses challenges and patent issues in the synthesis of deuterated indoles and highlights their potential applications in precision medicine. In the future, deuterated indoles may positively impact therapy and contribute to advances in precision medicine through molecular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts for enantioselective reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beyond the pivotal genetic roles of DNA, its duplex structures as chiral scaffolds interacting with metal complexes give rise to DNA hybrid catalysts for a set of aqueous&#8208;phase enantioselective reactions. Besides DNA duplex, DNA quadruplexes including G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif show tunable structures with variable non&#8208;canonical base pairs. In this concept, based on the interaction between metal species and DNA, we classify the constructing strategies of quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts into supramolecular, covalent and coordinative modes. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between DNA quadruplexes and their enantioselective catalytic performance. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and prospect the future directions in DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis.</dc:description>

We greatly increased the expression of the &#946;&#8208;subunit of recombinant nitrile hydratase by replacing the RBS located in front of the &#946;&#8208;subunit gene sequence of the nitrile hydratase recombinant plasmid, and the efficiency of the modified nitrile hydratase in catalysing the generation of 5&#8208;cyanopentanamide from adiponitrile, as well as the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed efficiency from both were dramatically enhanced.







Abstract
Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most commonly used bacterial recombinant protein production system due to its easy genetic modification properties. In our previous study, a recombinant plasmid expressing the Fe&#8208;type nitrile hydratase derived from Rhodococcus erythropolis CCM2595 (ReNHase) was successfully constructed and the recombinant ReNHase exerted an excellent catalytic effect on dinitrile compounds. Nevertheless, the ReNHases were confronted with imbalanced subunit expression during heterologous expression, which restricted the enzymes assemble functionally. In this study, the secondary structure of mRNA in the ribosome binding sequence region of the &#946;&#8208;subunit was optimized to elevate the translation efficiency of the &#946;&#8208;subunit gene and balance the expression of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;subunits in ReNHase. The optimized ReNHase showed a 12&#8208;fold increase in specific enzyme activity over wild&#8208;type ReNHase. To further enhance the soluble expression of ReNHase, the ReNHase was labeled using three different fusion tags, resulting in three new recombinant ReNHases. In these recombinant ReNHases, some of the fusion tags promoted the soluble expression of ReNHase, but also affected the balance of &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;subunit expression and the secondary structure of the ReNHase, and reduced the enzyme activity. In conclusion, our results provide an optimized strategy for the heterologous expression of multi&#8208;subunit proteins.

         <title>Research Progress in the Field of Hydrogen Sulfide Donors in the Last Five Years</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the progress of research on H2S donors in the last five years. In addition to inorganic sulfide salts, it is elaborated in the following four main sections. They are indirect release of H2S small molecule donor carbonyl sulfide, direct release of hydrogen sulfide small molecule donor, nanocomposite scaffold, and hydrogel.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) serves as the third gasotransmitter, crucial in various physiological processes involving its production and metabolism. Elevated levels of H2S can result in acute or chronic poisoning, whereas lower concentrations are involved in regulating diverse physiological and pathological activities within the human body. Moreover, it actively participates in maintaining normal cellular function by exerting cell protection and anti&#8208;apoptotic effects. In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to explore the physiological significance of H2S and its potential applications in developing prodrugs. To further unravel the biological and clinical potential of H2S, H2S donors have gained widespread utilization. These compounds facilitate our understanding of the specific functional aspects governed by H2S and hold promise as potential therapeutic agents. Therefore, it is necessary to study H2S as a delivery vehicle at the cellular and in&#8197;vivo levels. This review provides an overview of advancements made over the past five years regarding H2S donors and their applications in biology, encompassing indirectly released donors of carbonyl sulfide (COS), directly released small molecule donors, Nanocomposite scaffolds, and hydrogels.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems has emerged as a transformative approach in biosensing and therapeutic applications. Unique features of DNA, like its programmability and specificity, complement the diverse functions of nanomaterials, leading to the creation of advanced systems for detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Here, we review the developments in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, emphasizing their enhanced functionalities and potential across various biomedical applications. We first discuss the methodologies for synthesizing these conjugates, distinguishing between covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. We then categorize DNA&#8208;nanomaterials conjugates based on the properties of the DNA and nanomaterials involved, respectively. DNA probes are classified by their application into biosensing or therapeutic uses, and, several nanomaterials are highlighted by their recent progress in living biological. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field, anticipating that significant progress in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates will greatly enhance precision medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>The Structural Permissiveness of Triosephosphate Isomerase (TpiA) of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase has a typical (&#946;&#945;)8&#8208;barrel superfold with eight &#946;&#945; units, linked together by loops which wrap around to form a cylinder of parallel &#946;&#8208;strands (&#946;&#8208;barrel) surrounded by a layer of parallel &#945;&#8208;helices. Such loops L1&#8211;L3 are candidates for insertion of extra amino acids, but genetic analyses shown in this work reveals permissiveness in other structured sites also.







Abstract
Triosephosphate isomerase (TpiA) is widely regarded as an example of an optimally evolved enzyme due to its essential role in biological systems, its structural conservation, and its near&#8208;perfect kinetic parameters. In this study, we investigated the structural robustness of the archetypal TpiA variant from Escherichia coli using an in&#8197;vitro 5&#8208;amino acid linker scanning method. The resulting library was introduced into a tpiA mutant strain for functional complementation. From this library, 16 TpiA variants that were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild&#8208;type enzyme were selected for further analysis. Although all variants retained enzymatic activities within the wild&#8208;type range, several insertions were found in highly structured protein domains where the linker was expected to cause significant structural perturbations. Despite these potentially disruptive additions, the enzymes maintained their activity even when expressed in a dnaK mutant, suggesting that chaperones did not compensate for structural abnormalities in&#8197;vivo. Additionally, when these mutant TpiA variants were produced using an in&#8197;vitro transcription/translation system, they exhibited enzymatic activity comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the non&#8208;mutated enzyme. AlphaFold2 exposed that insertions reconstructed the local architecture of the nearby amino acid sequences. The evolutionary implications of this remarkable structural resilience are discussed.

         <title>Compartmentalized Sesquiterpenoid Biosynthesis and Functionalization in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Plastid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthetic microalgae were engineered for compartmentalized sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis by targeting synthases and cytochrome P450s to the chloroplast. The plastid's electron transport chain drives P450&#8208;mediated oxidation without reductase partners, enabling production of complex functionalized terpenes. This metabolic engineering approach demonstrates how photosynthetic biochemistry can be harnessed for sustainable production of valuable compounds from CO2.







Abstract
Terpenoids play key roles in cellular metabolism and can have specialized functions. Their heterologous production in microbial hosts offers an alternative to natural extraction. Here, we developed a subcellular engineering approach in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by targeting both sesquiterpenoid synthases and cytochrome P450s (CYPs) to the plastid, exploiting its photosynthetic electron transport chain to drive CYP&#8208;mediated oxidation without reductase partners. Nuclear&#8208;encoded sesquiterpenoid synthases were expressed with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase fusions and targeted to the plastid, while CYPs were modified for soluble localization in the plastid stroma by removing transmembrane domains. The plastid environment supported hydroxylation, epoxidation, and oxidation reactions, with functionalization efficiencies reaching 80&#8201;% of accumulated products. Carbon source availability influenced product ratios, revealing metabolic flexibility in the engineered pathways. Overall sesquiterpenoid yields ranged between 250&#8211;2500&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 under screening conditions, establishing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for using plastid biochemistry in complex terpenoid biosynthesis. Living two&#8208;phase terpenoid extractions with different perfluorinated solvents revealed variable performances based on sesquiterpenoid functionalization and solvent type. This work demonstrates that photosynthetic electron transport can drive CYP&#8208;mediated functionalization in engineered subcellular compartments. However, improvements in photobioreactor cultivation concepts will be required to facilitate the use of algal chassis for scaled production.

         <title>Antigen Presentation in an Artificial and Cell Membrane: Blood Group A Glycan Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space filling models of the synthesized blood group A related glycolipid constructs, which were inserted into an artificial membrane and into erythrocytes, and then compared with each other for their interaction with anti&#8208;A antibodies. 3D structure of A(type&#8197;2) tetrasaccharide was calculated on the website https://glycam.org/ [glycam.org]; other fragments of these molecules were calculated in a HyperChem using MM+ in a vacuum. The same figure magnified is given in Supplementary Material.







Abstract
Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are functionally important components of the cell membrane and recognition of their glycan &#8220;head&#8221; by the immune system is a key part of normal and pathological processes. Recognition of glycolipid antigens on a living cell, their structure, &#8220;context&#8221; (microenvironment and clustering), presentation including orientation and distance from the plasma membrane, as well as molecular dynamics are important. GSL antigens are targets for the development of anticancer vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, therefore, control of the presentation of their glycans by synthetic methods opens up new possibilities in medicine. In this work, we synthesized 13 GSL analogues as function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipids (FSLs) with the same head (blood group A tetrasaccharide, ABO system) but each either differing in the structure of the lipid tail, or the length of the region between the head and the tail, or cluster organization of the head (from 2 to 4 tetrasaccharides in a cluster). The insertion of these FSLs into an artificial and erythrocyte membranes was compared, and their interaction with antibodies was studied, including erythrocyte agglutination. The results give further insight into knowledge of the membrane presentation of GSLs (some results can be extrapolated to glycoproteins) and factors involved in their interaction with antibodies.

         <title>Analysis and Prediction of Chymotrypsin Substrate Preferences through Large Data Acquisition with Target&#8208;Free mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral peptide therapeutics may be degraded by gut proteases like chymotrypsin. We used mRNA display to generate large datasets of chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant peptides and created a predictive machine learning model for chymotrypsin stability. We also identified protective and destabilizing residues and their positionally dependent effects on peptide cleavage. Finally, we validated both the computational and NGS model through half&#8208;life measurement experiments.







Abstract
Oral delivery of peptide therapeutics is limited by degradation by gut proteases like chymotrypsin. Existing databases of peptidases are limited in size and do not enable systematic analyses of protease substrate preferences, especially for non&#8208;natural amino acids. Thus, stability optimization of hit compounds is time and resource intensive. To accelerate the stability optimization of peptide ligands, we generated large datasets of chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant peptides via mRNA display to create a predictive model for chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant sequences. Through analysis of enriched motifs, we recapitulate known chymotrypsin cleavage sites, reveal positionally dependent effects of monomers on peptide cleavage, and report previously unidentified protective and destabilizing residues. We then developed a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based model predicting peptide resistance to chymotrypsin cleavage and validated both model performance and the NGS experimental data by measuring chymotrypsin half&#8208;lives for a subset of peptides. Finally, we simulated stability predictions on non&#8208;natural amino acids through a leucine hold&#8208;out model and observed robust performance. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of mRNA display as a tool for big data generation and show that pairing mRNA display with machine learning yields valuable predictions for chymotrypsin cleavage. Expansion of this workflow to additional proteases could provide complementary predictive models that focus future peptide drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework as Selective Fluorescence Sensors for Cancer Inducing Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;precision detection and quantification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is imperative for early diagnosis of several terminal diseases. Owing to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong covalent linkers, porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have found widespread application in the benign fluorescence&#8208;based sensing of diverse VOCs. This article highlights the synthesis of COFs, and the mechanism of their action in VOC detection.







Abstract
Certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as formaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol, are overexpressed in some terminal diseases like cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. Therefore, high&#8208;precision detection and quantification of VOCs is imperative for early diagnosis of such detrimental diseases. Non&#8208;invasive and accurate fluorescence&#8208;based detection of such analytes has garnered widespread attention. The inherent luminescent properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), resulting from their extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation, have made them suitable for sensing applications. Structural tunability and strong covalent linkers facilitate sensing by COFs. Appropriate choices of linker and skeletal units of the COF can help detect various biologically important analytes selectively. The most common linkers used in this regard is the imine linker, which can undergo excellent hydrogen bonding with different protic VOCs e.&#8201;g., ethanol, methanol, etc. Besides imine detection, hydrogen bonding also proved useful for detection of aldehydes. Suitable combinations of donors and acceptors enable the COFs to have specific charge transfer interactions with many electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor VOCs. In this review, we have highlighted the syntheses of selective COFs incorporating linkers designed for sensing cancer&#8208;inducing VOCs. A detailed discussion of the interaction mechanisms between COFs and these VOCs is provided, along with examples from recent literature in this field.

         <title>Engineering Gas&#8208;Releasing Nanomaterials for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, including NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, as well as synergistic therapeutic strategies with other treatment modalities such as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are discussed in wound repair.







Abstract
The escalating prevalence of tissue damage and its associated complications has elicited global apprehension. While nanomaterial&#8208;based wound healing exhibits significant potential in terms of curbing infections and surpassing conventional methods, unresolved concerns regarding nanomaterial controllability and precision remain unresolved, jeopardizing its practical applications. In recent years, a unique strategy for creating gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials for wound repair has been proposed, involving the creation of gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials to facilitate wound repair by generating gas donor moieties. The operational spatiotemporal responsiveness and broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial properties of these gases, combined with their inability to generate bacterial resistance like traditional antibiotics, establish their efficacy in addressing chronic non&#8208;healing wounds, specifically diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). In this review, we delve into the intricacies of wound healing process, emphasizing the chemical design, functionality, bactericidal activity, and potential of gas&#8208;release materials, encompassing NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, for effective wound healing. Furthermore, we explore the advancements in synergistic therapy utilizing these gases, aiming to enhance our overall comprehension of this field. The insights gleaned from this review will undoubtedly aid researchers and developers in the creation of promising gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, thus propelling efficient wound healing in the future.

In this review, we delve into the intricacies of wound healing process, emphasizing the chemical design, functionality, bactericidal activity, and potential of gas-release materials, encompassing NO, CO, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for effective wound healing. Furthermore, we explore the advancements in synergistic therapy utilizing these gases, aiming to enhance our overall comprehension of this field. The insights gleaned from this review will undoubtedly aid researchers and developers in the creation of promising gas-releasing nanomaterials, thus propelling efficient wound healing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A colorimetric assay for DNase I detection based functional nucleic acids with peroxidase&#8208;like activity.







Abstract
DNase I plays a crucial role in fundamental biological processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and efficient method to detect DNase I activity. In this work, a colorimetric assay based on functional nucleic acid for sensitive DNase I detection was reported. The functional nucleic acids with G&#8208;rich bases exhibit peroxidase&#8208;like activity under acetic acid conditions, capable of catalyzing the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The specific nucleic acid is designed as the substrate for DNase I, which can hydrolyze the strand and reduce the catalytic activity of the reaction system. Based on this, a sensitive, simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective colorimetric detection platform was constructed for the quantitative analysis of DNase I. The detection limit (3&#963;/s) for DNase I was 0.046&#8197;U/mL with a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;U/mL. Moreover, the practicality of this colorimetric detection platform was demonstrated by detecting DNase I in human serum.

         <title>A Photo&#8208;Caged Cross&#8208;Linker for Identifying Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a novel crosslinker with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photoresponsive groups. These o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester (o&#8208;NBE) groups enhance the stability and hydrophobic properties of the crosslinker and add the potential for temporal resolution. A controlled activation mechanism enables precise UV&#8208;triggered protein crosslinking. We also demonstrate its ability to enter intact Hela cells, thereby indicating its future potential as a useful tool to study PPIs within the cellular environment.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) has seen significant improvements which have enhanced its utility for studying protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs), primarily due to the emergence of novel crosslinkers and the development of streamlined analysis workflows. Nevertheless, poor membrane permeability and side reactions with water limit the extent of productive intracellular crosslinking events that can be achieved with current crosslinkers. To address these problems, we have synthesized a novel crosslinker with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photoresponsive groups. These o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester (o&#8208;NBE) groups enhance the stability and hydrophobic properties of the crosslinker and add the potential for temporal resolution, i.&#8201;e. the ability to control the initiation of the crosslinking reaction. Upon exposure to UV light the resulting aldehyde product reacts with adjacent amino groups and subsequent reductive amination of the formed Schiff&#8208;bases yields stable secondary amine linkages. This controlled activation mechanism enables precise UV&#8208;triggered protein crosslinking. We demonstrate proof&#8208;of principle of our o&#8208;NBE cross&#8208;linker to reliably detect PPIs by XL&#8211;MS using a recombinant model protein. We also demonstrate its ability to enter intact Hela cells, thereby indicating its future potential as a useful tool to study PPIs within the cellular environment.

         <title>Visual and Quantitative Analysis of Dietary Fiber&#8208;Microbiota Interactions via Metabolic Labeling In Vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the dietary fibers&#8217; (DFs) interactions with bacteria in the gut is important in guiding the DF&#8208;based interventions towards the goal of establishing a health&#8208;promoting gut microbiota. However, directly investigating DFs&#8217; interactions with bacteria in the gut remains very difficult. Here, we develop an in&#8197;vivo metabolic labeling&#8208;based strategy to visually investigate and identify the DF&#8208;binding bacteria in the gut and quantitatively analyze their affected metabolic status caused by specific DF.







Abstract
Dietary fiber (DF)&#8208;based interventions are crucial in establishing a health&#8208;promoting gut microbiota. However, directly investigating DFs&#8217; in&#8197;vivo interactions with intestinal bacteria remains challenging due to the lack of suitable tools. Here, we develop an in&#8197;vivo metabolic labeling&#8208;based strategy, which enables not only imaging and identifying the bacteria that bind with specific DF in the intestines, but also quantifying DF's impact on their metabolic status. Four DFs, including galactan, rhamnogalacturonan and two inulins, are fluorescently derivatized and used for in&#8197;vivo labeling to visually record DFs&#8217; interactions with gut bacteria. The subsequent cell&#8208;sorting, 16S rDNA sequencing, and fluorescence in&#8197;situ hybridization identify the taxa that bind each DF. We then select a DF&#8208;binding species newly identified herein and verify its DF&#8208;catabolizing capability in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, we find that the indigenous metabolic status of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whether inulin&#8208;binders or not, is significantly enhanced by the inulin supplement. This trend is not observed in Gram&#8208;negative microbiota, even for the inulin&#8208;binders, demonstrating the ability of our methods in differentiating the primary, secondary DF&#8208;degraders from cross&#8208;feeders, a question that is difficult to answer by using other methods. Our strategy provides a novel chemical biology tool for deciphering the complex DF&#8208;bacteria interactions in the gut.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Rational Design of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron&#8208;Based Lysine Dioxygenase Improves its Total Turnover Number</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a new rational design strategy that synergizes a structure&#8208;based self&#8208;supervised machine learning framework, MutComputeX, with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to engineer a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;based lysine dioxygenase. Rationally designed variants displayed greater purification yields and all increased turnover number relative to WT. This method drastically lowers the cost of sampling single mutant sequence space for protein engineering campaigns and accelerates the development of industrially relevant biocatalysts.







Abstract
Highly selective C&#8722;H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure&#8208;based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure&#8208;based self&#8208;supervised machine learning framework, MutComputeX, with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before&#8208;hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2&#8208;fold higher expression yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40&#8201;% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN=160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low&#8208;barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre&#8208;existing protein engineering strategies.

         <title>Autoinhibition in (Bio)Chemistry: Identification and Mechanistic Classification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconciliation of the considerable disagreement about the usage of term autoinhibition in biochemistry and in chemical kinetics is presented by mechanistic classification of different types of autoinhibitions. A useful guiding tool is also provided serving as a solid starting point for correct identification which inhibitory enzymatic reactions may be referred to as an autoinhibitory system.







Abstract
Autoinhibition is a frequently invoked self&#8208;regulatory mechanism involved in various cellular processes to interpret clearly how these cells may control their complex functioning. This type of temporal behavior generally results in self&#8208;retardation or even in complete shuts down of the undesired reactions to occur meaning that the rate of a certain biochemical reaction is partially or completely retarded. Precise characterization and classification of a complex system where deceleration of the reaction rate is found, however, requires special circumspection to avoid false interpretation. Hereby, it was clearly demonstrated that the retardation effect of an inhibitor is unexpectedly often misidentified as autoinhibition, especially in complex biochemical enzymatic systems.

     alt="Autoinhibition in (Bio)Chemistry: Identification and Mechanistic Classification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconciliation of the considerable disagreement about the usage of term autoinhibition in biochemistry and in chemical kinetics is presented by mechanistic classification of different types of autoinhibitions. A useful guiding tool is also provided serving as a solid starting point for correct identification which inhibitory enzymatic reactions may be referred to as an autoinhibitory system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoinhibition is a frequently invoked self-regulatory mechanism involved in various cellular processes to interpret clearly how these cells may control their complex functioning. This type of temporal behavior generally results in self-retardation or even in complete shuts down of the undesired reactions to occur meaning that the rate of a certain biochemical reaction is partially or completely retarded. Precise characterization and classification of a complex system where deceleration of the reaction rate is found, however, requires special circumspection to avoid false interpretation. Hereby, it was clearly demonstrated that the retardation effect of an inhibitor is unexpectedly often misidentified as autoinhibition, especially in complex biochemical enzymatic systems. It prompted us to clarify unambiguously the difference between inhibition and autoinhibition. The latter kinetic phenomenon is a special type of inhibition where the inhibitor forms by the result of a chemical or biochemical event exerting the self-decelerating effect on the rate of its own formation resulting thus in significantly different temporal patterns compared to the ones observed in the case of simple inhibitions. Kinetic activity of autoinhibitor towards the species involved in the given system allowed us to classify direct, indirect and dual autoinhibitions to be supported by real chemical examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photodynamic Inactivation of Bacteria Using Nickel(II) Complexes with Catecholate and Phenanthroline Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;ligand Ni(II) complexes, incorporating phenanthroline and naturally occurring coumarin (esculetin) ligands, exhibit significant singlet oxygen&#8208;mediated photodynamic inactivation (antibacterial) activity against both Gram&#8208;(+) and Gram&#8208;(&#8722;) bacteria under visible light, paving the way for Ni(II)&#8208;based non&#8208;macrocyclic photosensitizers for treating bacterial infections.







Abstract
Metal complexes activated by light can combat infections by triggering the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. Herein, we report six mixed&#8208;ligand nickel(II) complexes with the formulation [Ni(NN)2(L)] (1&#8211;6), where NN represents an N,N&#8208;donor phenanthroline ligand, specifically 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen in 1, 2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq in 3, 4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz in 5, 6), while L is an O,O donor bidentate ligand derived from catechol (cat2&#8722;, in 1, 3, 5) or esculetin (esc2&#8722;, in 2, 4, 6). The paramagnetic d8 octahedral complexes demonstrated good dark and photostability in the solution phase and exhibited significant light absorption in the visible (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) region. When exposed to low&#8208;energy visible light, these complexes demonstrated significant photodynamic inactivation activity against both Gram&#8208;(+) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram&#8208;(&#8722;) Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. This resulted in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.31&#8211;9.49&#8197;&#956;M. The activity was caused by the cell&#8208;damaging singlet oxygen species produced by the complexes under light exposure. Notably, the complexes showed no bacterial inhibition activity under dark conditions. This study marks the first examples of Ni(II) complexes designed for light&#8208;triggered antibacterial activity, illuminating the path for Ni(II)&#8208;based non&#8208;macrocyclic complexes for antibacterial PDT applications.

         <title>Enhanced Molecular Imaging through a Versatile Peptide Nanofiber for Self&#8208;Assembly and Precise Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;based imaging probe (TAP) is designed through effective combination of the signal unit, recognition motif, assembly motif and Pro&#8208;leverage. TAP could combine with imaging probes through unique self&#8208;assembly strategies and specifically bind to PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive tumor with high specificity and stability. The TAP probe is an effective tool for diagnostic and therapeutic integration of tumors.







Abstract
Designing molecules for multivalent targeting of specific disease markers can enhance binding stability which is critical in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. Through rational molecular design, the nanostructures formed by self&#8208;assembly of targeting peptides are expected to achieve multivalent targeting by increasing the density of recognition ligands. However, the balance between targeting peptide self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition remains elusive. In this study, we designed a targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;based imaging probe system TAP which consist of the signal unit, the recognition motif, the assembly motif and a Pro&#8208;leverage. It is verified that TAP could specifically binds to PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive tumor cells in a multivalent manner to produce biological effects, and could also be combined with imaging probes through unique self&#8208;assembly strategies. By the balance between the peptide self&#8208;assembly and targeting recognition, the specificity and stability can be improved while the accumulation capacity of the probes at the tumor site can be greatly enhanced compared with the conventional strategy, thus reducing side effects, providing an effective tool for diagnostic and therapeutic integration of tumors.

         <title>Development of Nanomaterials&#8208;Based Agents for Selective Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents emerge as promising solutions to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of specific bacteria remains crucial. This review examines nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents and their mechanisms, including hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, protein and nucleic acid leakage, selective labelling and killing, extracellular and intracellular ROS generation, and damage to inner and outer membranes, all contributing to selective antibacterial activity.







Abstract
Bacterial infections continue to threaten public health due to limitations in rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques. While broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics offer empirical treatment, their overuse has fuelled the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens, posing a critical global public health challenge. In this critical scenario, nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents emerge as a promising solution to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of pathogenic bacteria is paramount. This review highlights recent advancements in developing nanomaterials for selective antibacterial activity. We categorize these agents based on their mode of action, exploring how they selectively interact with bacteria and their potential antibacterial mechanisms. This review offers crucial insights for researchers exploring the potential of nanotechnology to address the growing threat of AMR.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the structure and function of proteins is a critical objective in the life sciences. Protein sequencing, a central aspect of this endeavor, was first accomplished through Edman degradation in the 1950s. Since the late 20th century, mass spectrometry has emerged as a prominent method for protein sequencing. In recent years, single&#8208;molecule technologies have increasingly been applied to this field, yielding numerous innovative results. Among these, nanopore sensing has proven to be a reliable single&#8208;molecule technology, enabling advancements in amino acid recognition, short peptide differentiation, and peptide sequence reading. These developments are set to elevate protein sequencing technology to new heights. The next generation of protein sequencing technologies is anticipated to revolutionize our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biological processes and significantly enhance clinical diagnostics and treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Porphyrin&#8208;Loaded Scintillating Nanoparticles Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy in Hypoxic Cancer Cells under X&#8208;ray Irradiation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor hypoxia represents a major challenge to achieving successful therapy outcomes with photodynamic therapy (PDT). We hypothesized that systemic loading of dual porphyrins, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as a photosensitizer (PS) and hemin (Fe3+&#8208;PPIX) as an oxygen generator, onto Eu&#8208;doped NaYF4 scintillator (Sc), collectively terms as Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, could enhance the activity of X&#8208;ray mediated PDT. Catalase&#8208;like property of hemin in the presence of H2O2 facilitated the production of oxygen molecules (3O2) in hypoxic cancer cells. The produced 3O2 reacts with nearby excited PPIX molecules (PPIX*) in the Sc&#8208;PS pairs to produce singlet oxygen (1O2), as cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of ~60 nm efficiently produced oxygen in the presence of H2O2, which its concentration in tumor cells is higher than that in normal cells. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin generated similar amounts of ROS in hypoxic cultured cancer cells under low dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (0.5 Gy), compared to those in normoxic cancer cells. Notably, Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin exhibited similar cytotoxic effects in both hypoxic and normoxic cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Overall, the mutual Sc&#8208;PS performance between PPIX and Eu was synergistically enhanced by hemin in Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, which relieved hypoxia in the cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation.</dc:description>

Eu-PPIX@Hemin generated similar amounts of ROS in hypoxic cultured cancer cells under low dose X-ray irradiation (0.5 Gy), compared to those in normoxic cancer cells. Notably, Eu-PPIX@Hemin exhibited similar cytotoxic effects in both hypoxic and normoxic cancer cells under X-ray irradiation. Overall, the mutual Sc-PS performance between PPIX and Eu was synergistically enhanced by hemin in Eu-PPIX@Hemin, which relieved hypoxia in the cancer cells under X-ray irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanomaterial&#8208;Enhanced Red Blood Cell Biopreservation: From Refrigeration to Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions represent a cornerstone of clinical practice, with RBCs constituting the primary component in transfusion therapy. Extending the preservation of RBCs while maintaining their functional integrity would offer considerable advancements for both transfusion medicine and military healthcare. Despite decades of research, progress in achieving long&#8208;term RBC preservation has been limited. A key challenge is the range of physical and biochemical damage RBCs incur during storage, leading to marked changes in their morphology, physiological function, and viability. While traditional preservation techniques have provided partial mitigation of these damages, their efficacy remains suboptimal. In contrast, nanomaterials, with their distinctive spatial architectures and surface properties, offer a promising avenue for minimizing storage&#8208;related damage and extending RBC preservation. This review provides an overview of the major categories of damage encountered during RBC biopreservation, classified into storage lesions and cryolesions. We also highlight the key role of nanomaterials in enhancing the storage quality of RBCs and prolonging their preservation duration. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and pressing issues faced by nanomaterial&#8208;based RBCs biopreservation.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the P&#8208;Cluster of Vanadium Nitrogenase: an EPR and XAS Study of the Holo vs. Apo Forms of the Enzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study brings a combination of biochemical techniques, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data to help to understand the P&#8208;cluster of nitrogenases, in particular the differences between the holo and apo&#8208;forms of the nitrogenase VFe protein. It is demonstrated that apo&#8208;VFe does not contain fully matured P&#8208;clusters.







Abstract
The catalytic moiety of nitrogenases contains two complex metalloclusters: The M&#8208;cluster (also called cofactor), where the catalytic reduction of substrates takes place, and the [Fe8S7] P&#8208;cluster responsible for electron transfer. Due to discrepancies between crystallography and EPR spectroscopy, the exact structure of the P&#8208;cluster in the VFe protein remains a topic of debate. Herein, we use an apo&#8208;form of VFe (which retains the P&#8208;cluster but lacks the FeVco) to study the VFe P&#8208;cluster. SDS&#8208;PAGE and NativePAGE showed a heterogeneous composition of the VFe and the apo&#8208;VFe samples with the presence of &#945;1&#946;2&#948;2 and &#945;1&#946;2 complexes. The parallel mode EPR measurements of IDS oxidized MoFe, apo&#8208;MoFe, and VFe samples reveal a signal at g=12 associated with the two&#8208;electron oxidized state of the P&#8208;cluster (P2+) for all three samples, albeit with different intensities. In contrast, no P2+ was observed for IDS oxidized apo&#8208;VFe. Additionally, comparisons between apo&#8208;MoFe, apo&#8208;VFe and the model complex (NBu4)2[Fe4S4(SPh)4] via EXAFS measurements showed that apo&#8208;VFe does not contain a fully formed [Fe8S7] P&#8208;cluster, but rather is comprised of fragmented iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Our results point to a possible variation in the structure of the P&#8208;cluster in the different forms of the nitrogenase.

         <title>Improving Retinoic Acid Efficacy: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Derivatives with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipase&#8208;catalyzed approach was applied to the synthesis of nine derivatives of retinoic acid (four of them new compounds) with excellent yield and low environmental impact. Several synthesized compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the retinoic acid in Vero cells and a remarkably higher antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;1 (HSV&#8208;1) and Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;2 (HSV&#8208;2).







Abstract
An efficient enzymatic approach was applied to the synthesis of new derivatives of retinoic acid. Nine derivatives, four of them new compounds, were obtained through lipase&#8208;catalysis with excellent yield. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, the influence of various parameters such as enzyme source, nucleophile&#8201;:&#8201;substrate ratio, enzyme&#8201;:&#8201;substrate ratio, solvent and temperature was studied. The excellent results obtained by lipase catalysis made the procedure very efficient considering their advantages such as mild reaction conditions and low environmental impact. In addition, several synthesized compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the retinoic acid in Vero cells and a remarkably higher antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;1 (HSV&#8208;1) and Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;2 (HSV&#8208;2).

         <title>Nucleic Acid Covalent Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review evaluates recent advancements in nucleic acid&#8208;based tags for protein labeling, with a particular emphasis on covalent labeling approaches, including the use of aptamers, protein fusion tags, and metabolic oligosaccharide engineering. It highlights emerging trends in protein detection, visualization, functionalization, and targeted degradation, which play crucial roles in diverse chemical and biomedical applications.







Abstract
The selective and site&#8208;specific chemical labeling of proteins has emerged as a pivotal research area in chemical biology and cell biology. An effective protein labeling typically meets several criteria, including high specificity, rapid and robust conjugation under physiological conditions, operation at low concentrations with biocompatibility, and minimal perturbation of the protein function and activity. The conjugation of nucleic acids with proteins has garnered significant attention recently due to the rapid advancements in nucleic acid probe technologies, leveraging the programmable nature of nucleic acids alongside the multifaceted functionalities of proteins. It helps to convert protein&#8208;specific information into nucleic acid signals, facilitating upstream versatile recognition and downstream signal amplification for the target protein. This review critically evaluates the recent progress in nucleic acid&#8208;based protein labeling methodologies, with a specific focus on covalent labeling using aptamer tags, protein fusion tags or the technique of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering. The tags establish covalent linkages with target proteins through various modalities such as small molecules or metabolic glycan engineering. The insights presented in the review highlight promising avenues for the development of highly specific and versatile protein labeling techniques, which is essential for the improvement of protein&#8208;targeted detection and imaging across diverse biological contexts.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Sheet&#8208;Mediated Multivalent Capture of Cells with Enhanced Tunability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the creation of multivalent ligand surfaces for cell capture by conjugation of ligand&#8208;appended 2D peptide assemblies on an antifouling glass substrate. The sheet&#8208;like structures organize ligands into non&#8208;uniform, patchy patterns, enhancing multivalent cell targeting. A 155% increase in captured cells was achieved compared to the presentation of the ligands on surfaces lacking the peptide sheets. Being orthogonal to the commonly used dendrimer&#8208; and cyclic organic molecular&#8208;based scaffolds, this peptide assembly&#8208;based approach offers a facile method to modulate the identity, number, and spatial distribution of ligands through controlled peptide coassembly. Using this method, we constructed a surface bearing two types of ligands, which demonstrates a 128% enhancement in targeting selectivity between two model cells compared to the mono&#8208;ligand surface. These findings illustrate that integration of peptide assemblies into ligand substrates permits robust and effective manipulation of multivalent cell targeting, advancing the development of customizable cell&#8208;binding materials.</dc:description>

Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) have been extensively studied and they represent promising biocatalysts that utilize chloride, bromide, or iodide ions to selectively halogenate electron&#8208;rich aryl moieties under consumption of FADH2. The resulting aryl halides are valuable intermediates for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Recent research expanded this to protein targets, facilitating bioconjugation through late&#8208;stage biocatalytic halogenation combined with biorthogonal Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, ensuring selectivity and stability of the conjugate.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) are the most extensively researched halogenases and show great potential for biotransformation applications. These enzymes use chloride, bromide, or iodide ions as halogen donors to catalyze the oxygen&#8208;dependent halogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl moieties, requiring stochiometric amounts of FADH2 in the process. This makes FDH&#8208;catalyzed aryl halogenation a highly selective and environmentally friendly tool for the synthesis of aryl halides. The latter in turn serve as valuable intermediates for transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions for C&#8722;C bond formation. Previous research made extensive use of this approach to halogenate small molecules as building blocks for late&#8208;stage functionalization by transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Based on these results, several groups have managed to expand this research to protein targets over the past two years. Their work indicates an emerging methodology for bioconjugation using late&#8208;stage biocatalytic halogenation in conjunction with biorthogonal Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This strategy could present an attractive alternative to existing approaches due to the stability of the C&#8722;C bond bridging the generated biaryl moiety and the ease of late&#8208;stage enzymatic modification while maintaining excellent selectivity under mild conditions.

         <title>SnO2 Encapsulated in Alginate Matrix: Evaluation and Optimization of Bioinspired Nanoadsorbents for Azo Dye Removal</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of SnO2 nanoparticles in alginate matrix using CaCl2 as cross&#8208;linker ensures effective and economic removal of azo dye. Encapsulation efficiency is primarily determined by concentration of alginate and cross&#8208;linker. SnO2 NPs maintain consistent adsorption efficiency in different physical forms. This method is proposed as a sustainable approach for development of prototype for treatment of textile and related effluents.







Abstract
Synthesized SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate potential capacity to adsorb toxic azo Congo red dye. The formation of rutile phase SnO2 NPs was confirmed using Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and spherical morphology was corroborated through SEM imaging. TEM analysis confirms average particle size of SnO2 NPs is nearly 3&#8197;nm. High azo dye removal efficiency is attributed to large surface area and presence of oxygen vacancies which were substantiated through BET and XPS analysis, respectively. To mitigate the leaching of NPs in treated water, NPs are encapsulated in sodium alginate (SA) matrix, which is proposed as an environmentally friendly, biocompatible, and economic solution. This study specifically focuses on investigating the parameters for the encapsulation of NPs within a sodium alginate matrix using CaCl2 as cross&#8208;linker. This work investigates the effect of physical shape of encapsulation, effect of SA and cross&#8208;linker (CaCl2) concentration on the feasibility of NP encapsulation and overall adsorption efficiency. Experimental results indicated that the physical form of encapsulation, such as spherical, wire&#8208;like, or irregular shape maintained consistent adsorption efficiency, which indicates its versatility. For effective encapsulation of NPs and adsorption, SA and CaCl2 concentration are suggested to be within the range of 0.2&#8211;0.3&#8197;g and &gt;0.5&#8197;M, respectively.

         <title>The Multifunctional Preprotein Binding Domain of SecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SecA protein has evolved to perform multiple tasks. Its Preprotein Binding Domain (PBD) is a key module, adopting three conformational states. The PBD's inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;protomeric interactions, along with biophysical data, reveal the influence of these states on the translocation process. Key elements provide stabilization and promote the activation of the ATPase motor, described as the Prl phenotype.







Abstract
Sec&#8208;pathway is the main protein secretion pathway in prokaryotes and is essential for their survival. The motor protein SecA is the main coordinator of the pathway in bacteria as it is has evolved to perform multiple tasks, acting like a &#8220;swiss army knife&#8221;, from binding pre&#8208;proteins to altering its oligomeric and conformational states. This study focuses on the role of its Preprotein Binding Domain (PBD), which is a key protein module that identified in three conformational states (Wide&#8208;Open (WO), Open (O) and Closed (C)). A thorough analysis was conducted to identify PBD's inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;protomeric interactions, highlighting the most significant and conserved ones. Both crystallographic and biophysical data indicate that the WO state is the main during dimerization, while the monomeric structure can adopt all three states. C&#8208;tail, StemPBD and 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD are important elements for the stabilization of different oligomeric and conformational states, as they offer specific interactions. Alterations in the lipophilicity of the StemPBD causes increased proteins dynamics or/and Prl phenotype. In the C state, 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD interacts and opens the ATPase motor. We hypothesize that this partial opening of the motor with the increased dynamics describes the Prl phenotype.

The reversible photoisomerization and susceptibility to reduction&#8208;mediated cleavage of azobenzene (Azo) make them valuable for various biomedical applications.

Abstract
Azobenzene (Azo) and its derivatives are versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules. Their reversible photoisomerization and susceptibility to reduction&#8208;mediated cleavage make them valuable for various biomedical applications. Upon exposure to the UV light, Azo units undergo a thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transition, which can be reversed by heating in the dark or irradiation with visible light. Additionally, the N=N bonds in azobenzenes can be cleaved under hypoxic conditions by azoreductase, making azobenzenes useful as hypoxia&#8208;responsive linkers. The integration of azobenzenes into nanomedicines holds promise for enhancing therapeutic efficacy, particularly in tumor targeting and controllable drug release. In this Concept paper, recent advances in the design and applications of azobenzene&#8208;based nanomedicines are updated, and future development opportunities are also summarized.

Self&#8208;assembly of metabolites which gets accumulated in rare inborn errors of metabolisms namely alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia were studied. The results presented strongly suggest their aggregation may follow an amyloidogenic pathway.







Abstract
The transformation of metabolites into amyloidogenic aggregates represent an intriguing dimension in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders, including alkaptonuria, canavan disease, and isovaleric acidemia. Central to this phenomenon are the metabolites homogentisic acid (HA), N&#8208;acetyl aspartic acid (NAA), and isovaleric acid (IVA), which we found, weave an intricate network of self&#8208;assembled structures. Leveraging an array of microscopy techniques, we traced the morphological behavior of these assemblies that exhibit concentration and time&#8208;dependent morphological transitions from isolated globules to clustered aggregates. MD simulation studies suggest significant role of hydrogen bonding interactions in the aggregation process. While displaying strong amyloidogenic propensity in solution, these aged aggregates were significantly cytotoxic to mouse neural N2a cell lines. In vivo effect in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode further validated cytotoxicity of aggregates. Our findings provide fresh insights to amyloidogenic nature of HA, NAA, and IVA aggregates and their possible role in associated metabolic disorders such as alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia.

While displaying strong amyloidogenic propensity in solution, these aged aggregates were significantly cytotoxic to mouse neural N2a cell lines. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; effect in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;) nematode further validated cytotoxicity of aggregates. Our findings provide fresh insights to amyloidogenic nature of HA, NAA, and IVA aggregates and their possible role in associated metabolic disorders such as alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzymatic Cascade for Toxicant Degradation and Sugar Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot biocatalytic cascade for sugar acid production not only breaks down hazardous chemicals and generates benzoquinone but also enhances antioxidant activity and water uptake in hydrogels. This is achieved through the coordinated action of multiple enzymes, including organophosphate hydrolase (OPD), HadA monooxygenase (HadA), thermostable flavin reductase (C1&#8208;A58P), Bacillus simplex formate dehydrogenase (BsFDH), and pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH).







Abstract
This study introduces a novel one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade approach for converting toxicants and continuously generating an electron acceptor for production of sugar acids. This method offers a promising solution to concerns about pesticide toxicity and environmental contamination by transforming hazardous substances into a useful electron acceptor. This acceptor is then utilized to produce valuable chemicals with broad industrial applications, particularly in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. The cascade reaction employs organophosphate hydrolase (OPD) to convert pesticides into 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP), which is subsequently transformed into 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone by HadA monooxygenase (HadA). 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone serves as an electron acceptor in the catalysis of sugar acid formation via pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH). The results indicate that this cascade reaction effectively converts lactose to lactobionic acid and xylose to 2&#8208;keto&#8208;xylonic acid. The latter can be further processed into xylonic acid through NaBH4 reduction. Notably, the one&#8208;pot reaction yields up to 10&#8201;% higher compared to the direct addition of 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. The synthesized xylonic acid exhibits exceptional water uptake properties in hydrogels, and the synthesized lactobionic acid shows antioxidant activity comparable to well&#8208;established antioxidants. These findings demonstrate the technological viability of these reaction cascades for various applications.

         <title>High Content Screening Assay of Inhibitors of the Legionella Pneumophila Histone Methyltransferase RomA in Infected Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The set&#8208;up and validation of a high content screening assay allowed the evaluation of an epigenetic chemical library of 477 compounds for their ability to inhibit H3&#8197;K14methylation in host cells infected by Legionella.







Abstract
Resistance to anti&#8208;microbial agents is a world&#8208;wide health threat. Thus, there is an urgent need for new treatments. An alternative approach to disarm pathogens consists in developing drugs targeting epigenetic modifiers. Bacterial pathogens can manipulate epigenetic regulatory systems of the host to bypass defences to proliferate and survive. One example is Legionella pneumophila, a Gram&#8208;negative intracellular pathogen that targets host chromatin with a specific, secreted bacterial SET&#8208;domain methyltransferase named RomA. This histone methyltransferase specifically methylates H3&#8197;K14 during infection and is responsible for changing the host epigenetic landscape upon L. pneumophila infection. To inhibit RomA activity during infection, we developed a reliable high&#8208;content imaging screening assay, which we used to screen an in&#8208;house chemical library developed to inhibit DNA and histone methyltransferases. This assay was optimised using monocytic leukemic THP&#8208;1 cells differentiated into macrophages infected with L. pneumophila in a 96&#8208; or 384&#8208;well plate format using the Opera Phenix (Perkin Elmer) confocal microscope, combined with Columbus software for automated image acquisition and analysis. H3&#8197;K14 methylation was followed in infected, single cells and cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel. A first pilot screening of 477 compounds identified a potential starting point for inhibitors of H3&#8197;K14 methylation.

         <title>A Single Interfacial Point Mutation Rescues Solution Structure Determination of the Complex of HMG&#8208;D with a DNA Bulge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Line&#8208;broadening due to intermediate rate dynamics within an interface can confound NMR structure determination of complexes. In this study, a carefully selected point mutation was shown to rescue the NMR properties of such a system, a complex of the protein HMG&#8208;D with a dA2 bulge DNA ligand designed to mimic a natural bend, allowing high&#8208;resolution structure determination to succeed and correcting a previously proposed structural model.







Abstract
Broadening of signals from atoms at interfaces can often be a limiting factor in applying solution NMR to the structure determination of complexes. Common contributors to such problems include exchange between free and bound states and the increased molecular weight of complexes relative to the free components, but another cause that can be more difficult to deal with occurs when conformational dynamics within the interface takes place at an intermediate rate on the chemical shift timescale. In this work we show how a carefully chosen mutation in the protein HMG&#8208;D rescued such a situation, making possible high&#8208;resolution structure determination of its complex with a dA2 bulge DNA ligand designed to mimic a natural DNA bend, and thereby revealing a new spatial organization of the complex.

         <title>Synthesis and Antimycobacterial Evaluation of Novel Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazolines and Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazole&#8208;enaminones are suitable starting materials for the regioselective synthesis of pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines and the respective pyrazole&#8208;isoxazoles, obtained in excellent yields. The obtained bi&#8208;heterocycles are potential antimycobacterial agents, as they show significant inhibition of bacterial growth with a time&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent bactericidal effect. Both series of compounds show positive in&#8197;vitro profiles, without altering cell viability, NO production or dsDNA release.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of a new series of pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines, at very good yields, from the cyclocondensation reaction of pyrazole&#8208;enaminones with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Dehydration of the pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines furnished another new series of the respective pyrazole&#8208;isoxazoles, at excellent yields. Both series of the obtained compounds were screened for antimycobacterial activity, and compounds 4&#8201;f and 5&#8201;c showed significant inhibition of bacterial growth with a time&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent bactericidal effect. Cytotoxicity tests in VERO cell line did not indicate toxicity of compounds 4&#8201;f and 5&#8201;c regarding cellular prediction, NO production or dsDNA release. However, both compounds were associated with an increase in total ROS levels, providing induction of oxidative stress, but without compromising cellular targets. These results highlight compounds 4&#8201;f and 5&#8201;c as promising candidates for antimycobacterial treatment with a favorable safety profile.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on the Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Interaction with Clicked Peptide&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates: a Vision Toward the Detection of A&#946; Peptides in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three porphyrin&#8208;peptide conjugates have been synthesized by copper catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and their interaction with A&#946;42 investigated using different experimental techniques. The zinc containing peptide conjugate can evoke an induced dichroic signal upon its interaction with A&#946;42. The peptide systems are not cytotoxic and can be taken up by differentiated SH&#8208;SY&#8208;5Y cells.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial form of dementia mainly affecting people in the elderly, but no effective cure is available. According to the amyloid hypothesis the aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric toxic species is believed to concur with the onset and progression of the disease heavily. By using a click chemistry approach, we conjugated a suitable designed peptide sequence to a metalloporphyrin moiety to obtain three hybrid peptide systems to be studied for their interaction with Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides. The aim is to get new tools for the diagnosis and therapy in AD. The results described in this study, which were obtained through spectroscopic techniques (UV&#8208;Vis, CD, bis&#8208;Ans and intrinsic porphyrin Fluorescence), Microfluidics (GCI) and cell biology (MTT, Live cell imaging and flow cytometry), reveal interesting features about the structure&#8208;activity relationships connecting these conjugates with the interaction with A&#946;, as well as on their potential use as sensing systems. In our opinion the data reported in this paper make the porphyrin&#8208;peptide conjugates highly compelling for further exploration as spectroscopic probes to detect A&#946; biomarkers in biological fluids.

         <title>Covalent Labeling of Matrix Metalloproteases with Affinity&#8208;Based Probes Containing Tuned Reactive N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfonamide Cleavable Linkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Original affinity&#8208;based probes with a N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamide (NASA) cleavable linker were designed to covalently modify several human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs). The electrophilicity of the cleavable linker was optimized to reduced unspecific reactivity of the probes in complex biological matrices. The probes, tested in varied proteomes containing MMP&#8208;13, showed improved selectivity and reduced off&#8208;target propensity.







Abstract
Original covalent probes with an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamide cleavable linker were developed to target a broad set of human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs). The electrophilicity of this cleavable linker was modulated to improve the selectivity of the probes as well as reduce their unspecific reactivity in complex biological matrices. We first demonstrated that targeting the S3 subsite of MMPs enables access to broad&#8208;spectrum affinity&#8208;based probes that exclusively react with the active version of these proteases. The probes were further assessed in proteomes of varying complexity, where human MMP&#8208;13 was artificially introduced at known concentration and the resulting labeled MMP was imaged by in&#8208;gel fluorescence imaging. We showed that the less reactive probe was still able to covalently modify MMP&#8208;13 while exhibiting reduced off&#8208;target unspecific reactivity. This study clearly demonstrated the importance of finely controlling the reactivity of the NASA warhead to improve the selectivity of covalent probes in complex biological systems.

         <title>Versatile and Efficient Protein Association Through Chemically Modified Sphingomyelin Nanosystems (SNs) for Enhanced Delivery</title>

         <dc:description>
Graphic representation of the work carried out in this research, the main objective of which was the development of a nanoplatform for the efficient delivery of proteins (Protein Sphingomyelin Nanosystems; P&#8208;SNs), regardless of their molecular weight (MW), net charge, or isoelectric point (pI). Additionally, its efficient internalization in different cell lines and its cytotoxic profile were evaluated for subsequent use in cancer, gene therapy, and protein replacement therapies, among other biomedical applications (DSPE&#8208;PEG2k&#8208;X; X=DBCO, maleimide, NHS, TFP, COOH).







Abstract
Proteins are biological macromolecules well known to regulate many cellular signaling mechanisms. For instance, they are very appealing for their application as therapeutic agents, presenting high specificity and activity. Nonetheless, they suffer from unfolding, instability and low bioavailability making their administration through systemic and other routes very tough. To overcome these drawbacks, drug delivery systems and nanotechnology have arisen to deliver biomolecules in a sustained manner while, at the same time, increasing dose availability, protecting the cargo without compromising proteins&#8217; bioactivity, and enhancing intracellular delivery. In this work, we proposed the optimization of sphingomyelin nanosystems (SNs) for the delivery of a wide collection of proteins (ranging from 10&#8211;500&#8197;kDa and pI) using diverse chemical association strategies. We have further characterized SNs by varied analytical methodologies. We have also carried out in&#8197;vitro experiments to validate the potential of the developed formulations. As the final goal, we aim to obtain evidence of the potential use of SNs for the development of protein therapeutics.

         <title>Adsorption and Distribution of Triplex&#8208;Hybridizing Bioconjugated Gold Nanoclusters Inside Spermatozoa&#8208; A Study Using Confocal Microscopy and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional fluorescently labelled Au NCs&#8208;bioconjugate was developed where the biomolecules such as an oligonucleotide and a positively net charged cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, were coupled to the Au NCs surface using simple thiol&#8208;gold conjugation chemistry. Internalization of bioconjugated Au NCs inside spermatozoa was successfully monitored by employing CLSM, 3D particle distribution and FLIM.







Abstract
The study of the interactions between biofunctionalized gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) and spermatozoa is highly relevant to evaluate the potential of Au NCs as imaging probes and transfection agents in reproductive biology. In this work, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate the distribution of Au NCs bioconjugated with peptide (nuclear localisation sequence, NLS) and oligonucleotide (locked nucleic acid, LNA) ligands in bovine spermatozoa. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) was employed to detect changes in the NC's chemical environment. We observed a pronounced regio&#8208;selective accumulation of the bioconjugates in spermatozoa with high concentration at the equatorial segment. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;CLSM showed successful non&#8208;endosomal cellular uptake of the conjugates by intact sperm cells and the distribution of the bioconjugates was found to be influenced by the ligand types. Interestingly, the FLIM data showed differences in lifetime depending on membrane integrity. Furthermore, ligand&#8208;dependent changes in lifetime between NC bioconjugates carrying peptide and oligonucleotide ligands were found, probably attributed to specific interactions with sperm cell compartments.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of DNMT3A by an N&#8208;Mustard Analog of S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;L&#8211;Methionine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examination of an N&#8208;mustard analogue of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine with DNA methyltransferase 3A revealed irreversible inhibition through covalent labeling of active site cysteine residues.







Abstract
DNA methylation, an important epigenetic modification, is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases and is essential in the regulation of gene expression. Here, the utility of an N&#8208;mustard analog designed to mimic the native methyl donor, S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM), was explored with the DNA methyltransferase 3A catalytic domain (DNMT3AC). In lieu of the expected analog transfer to DNA, methyltransferase activity was instead inhibited in a concentration dependent manner. Further investigation into the mechanism of analog inhibition did not reveal a typical competitive mechanism. Instead, mass spectrometry analysis provided direct evidence of two cysteine residues in the SAM binding site covalently modified by the SAM analog and confirmed its&#8217; function as an irreversible inhibitor of DNMT3AC.

Instead, mass spectrometry analysis provided direct evidence of two cysteine residues in the SAM binding site covalently modified by the SAM analog and confirmed its&#8217; function as an irreversible inhibitor of DNMT3AC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioactive Microgels with Tunable Microenvironment as a 3D Platform to Guide the Complex Physiology of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Spheroids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flow&#8208;focusing microfluidic device is used to generate spherical microgels consisting of gelatin and hyaluronic acid (HA) encapsulated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (HepG2 or Hep3B). The spheroid growth and differentiation state of HCC as well as the response to chemotherapeutic screening are remarkably influenced by the mechanical stiffness and the presence of HA of the microgels.







Abstract
Miniaturized three&#8208;dimensional tissue models, such as spheroids, have become a highly useful and efficient platform to investigate tumor physiology and explore the effect of chemotherapeutic efficacy over traditional two&#8208;dimensional monolayer culture, since they can provide more in&#8208;depth analysis, especially in regards to intercellular interactions and diffusion. The development of most tumor spheroids relies on the high proliferative capacity and self&#8208;aggregation behavior of tumor cells. However, it often disregards the effect of microenvironmental factors mediated by extracellular matrix, which are indispensable components of tissue structure. In this study, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are encapsulated in bioactive microgels consisting of gelatin and hyaluronic acid designed to emulate tumor microenvironment in order to induce hepatic tumor spheroid formation. Two different subtypes of HCC's, HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines, are explored. The physicomechanical and biochemical properties of the microgels, controlled by changing the crosslinking density and polymer composition, are clearly shown to have substantial influence over the formation and spheroid formation. Moreover, the spheroids made from different cells and microgel properties display highly variable chemoresistance effects, further highlighting the importance of microenvironmental factors guiding tumor spheroid physiology.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase Catalysis Mediated by Type I Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study evaluated the light&#8208;driven oxidation of PASC using LPMOs mediated by typical photodynamic therapy (PDT) photosensitizers. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Type I PDT methylene blue (MB) photosensitizer irradiated by light was able to fuel LPMO reaction even without addition of the chemical reducing agents. Using MB and porphyrin as models, we demonstrated that the LPMO peroxigenase reaction can only be driven by Type I, but not Type II, light&#8208;irradiated photosensitizers.







Abstract
The use of light as abundant, renewable, and clean energy source to boost lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) reactions represents an exciting and yet under&#8208;explored opportunity. Herein we demonstrated that photosensitizers, commonly used in photodynamic therapy, which act through the photocatalytic Type I mechanism can drive the oxidation of PASC by LPMOs, whereas Type II photosensitizers are not capable of promoting the LPMO activity. We analyzed Type I and Type II photosensitizers (methylene blue and tetraiodide salt of meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridyl) porphyrin, respectively) and demonstrated that, even without an addition of external reductant, Type I was capable of boosting Thermothelomyces thermophila MtLPMO9A activity in the presence of light. We also evaluated the photobiosystem in the presence and/or absence of molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and investigated the role of superoxide radical in the methylene blue fueled reactions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3), a chemical scavenger of H2O2, acts by safeguarding the enzyme from oxidative damage caused by accumulation of H2O2 early in photosensitizer&#8208;driven LPMO reactions. Finally, the results of the present work demonstrated that light&#8208;driven LPMO reactions mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) Type I photosensitizers, which also includes molecules such as curcumin and riboflavin, is a general phenomenon.

         <title>Optimizing Transfection Efficiency of Spermine Polar Head Cholesterol&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids with Amino Acid Linker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>

Spermine polar head cholesterol&#8208;based cationic lipids with amino acid spacers exhibited greater transfection efficiency compared to commercially available reagent under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions.







Abstract
In this work, a series of spermine polar head cholesterol&#8208;based cationic lipids with various amino acid spacers were synthesized and evaluated as non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. The physicochemical properties of the resulting lipoplexes, formed from these lipids and DOPE, were assessed, including zeta&#8208;potential, DNA binding and DNA protection from serum. Transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity were examined under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum&#8208;containing conditions. The results showed that the physicochemical properties of cationic lipids, both with and without amino acid spacers, were not significantly different. Cationic liposomes composed of lipid Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol, which has a 6&#8208;aminohexanoic acid spacer, and DOPE exhibited greater transfection efficiency in HeLa cells compared to Lipofectamine3000, both in the absence and presence of 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum. Additionally, lipid Sper&#8208;His&#8208;Chol with a histidine spacer and Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol showed higher efficiency than Lipofectamine3000 against HEK293T under 40&#8201;% serum conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of amino acids into the cationic lipids can significantly enhance their DNA delivery efficiency. Specifically, certain amino acid modifications improved transfection efficiency while maintaining low cytotoxicity. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;tailored cationic lipids as promising vectors for enhanced DNA delivery.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Folding in a Dopamine&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding and ligand&#8208;induced structure formation of a dopamine&#8208;binding DNA aptamer as a function of stem length is reported. All constructs show folding with ligand binding, but only aptamers with a short stem are functional biosensors.







Abstract
Aptamers are often employed as molecular recognition elements in the development of different types of biosensors. Many of these biosensors take advantage of the aptamer having a ligand&#8208;induced structure&#8208;formation binding mechanism. However, this binding mechanism is poorly understood. Here we use isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to study the binding and ligand&#8208;induced structural change exhibited by a dopamine&#8208;binding DNA aptamer. We analysed a series of aptamers where we shorten the terminal stem that contains the 5' and 3' termini of the aptamer sequence. All aptamers bind dopamine in an enthalpically driven process coupled with an unfavorable entropy. A general trend of the aptamer having a weaker binding affinity is observed as the terminal stem is shortened. For all aptamers studied, numerous signals appear in the imino region of the 1H NMR spectrum indicating that new structure forms with ligand binding. However, it is only when this region of structure formation in the aptamer is brought close to the sensor surface that we obtain a functional electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.

M at work: PsiM is the methyltransferase that completes psilocybin biosynthesis in magic mushrooms. Crystal structures and kinetic analyses of the wild type enzyme and two engineered variants provided profound insight into why the residue Asn247 is key for PsiM's capability to dimethylate.







Abstract
The Psilocybe cubensis SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferase, PsiM, catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of psilocybin. Likely evolved from monomethylating RNA methyltransferases, PsiM acquired a key amino acid exchange in the secondary sphere of the active site, M247&#8197;N, which is responsible for its capacity to dimethylate. Two variants, PsiMN247M and PsiMN247A, were generated to further examine the role of Asn247 for mono&#8208; and dimethylation in PsiM. Herein, we present the kinetic profiles of both variants and crystal structures at resolutions between 0.9 and 1.0&#8197;&#197;. Each variant was crystallized as a ternary complex with the non&#8208;methylated acceptor substrate, norbaeocystin and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine, and in a second complex with the cofactor analog, sinefungin, and the monomethylated substrate, baeocystin. Consistent with the inability of the variants to catalyze a second methyl transfer, these structures reveal catalytically non&#8208;productive conformations and a high level of disorder of the methylamine group of baeocystin. Additionally, both variants exhibit destabilization in the &#946;5&#8208;&#946;7 sheets and a conserved &#946;&#8208;turn of the core Rossmann fold, causing 20&#8208;fold reduced substrate binding and 2&#8208;fold lower catalytic efficiency even with norbaeocystin. Our structural and kinetic analyses of the variants suggest that Asn247 is essential to allow enough space in the active site for multiple methylations while also participating in a network of hydrogen bonds that stabilizes secondary structure elements in the immediate vicinity of the active site for optimal methylation of norbaeocystin.

         <title>Manganese Complex&#8208;Gold Nanoparticle Hybrid for Biofilm Inhibition and Eradication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese complex modified gold nanoparticle for effective biofilm formation inhibition and eradication. Biofilms resistant to standard treatments pose challenges in medical and industrial settings. Manganese complex&#8208;gold nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;DPA&#8208;AuNPs) offer a new biofilm inhibition strategy. These nanoparticles enhance reactive oxygen species generation and significantly reduce bacterial regrowth, particularly in P. aeruginosa. This approach highlights the potential of integrating manganese complexes with gold nanoparticles as advanced antimicrobial agents.







Abstract
Biofilms, which are resistant to conventional antimicrobial treatments, pose significant challenges in medical and industrial environments. This study introduces manganese complex&#8208;gold nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;DPA&#8208;AuNPs) as a hybrid strategy for biofilm inhibition and eradication. Upon exposure to green light, these nanoparticles significantly enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. This activity substantially reduces the regrowth potential of the surviving bacteria within the biofilm, with marked efficacy noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. This study highlights the potential of integrating manganese complexes with gold nanoparticles to develop advanced antimicrobial agents against resistant biofilms, offering a promising approach to enhance microbial control in diverse settings.

         <title>Photoswitchable Detergents for Light&#8208;Controlled Liposome Lysis and Channel Gating</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable detergents provide an additional opportunity for spatiotemporal membrane modulation alongside photolipids. Here, we describe three classes of visible light&#8208;sensitive surfactants with azobenzene tails. The detergents enabled the light&#8208;induced vesicle rupture as well as spatiotemporal activation of a mechanosensitive channel and expand the toolbox for photostimulation of membranes.







Abstract
Modulation of membrane properties via photoswitchable lipids has attracted attention due to the unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of their functional control. Beside lipids, detergents are another prominent class for selective membrane perturbations owing to their ease of handling and spontaneous insertion in lipid bilayers. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of three classes of visible light&#8208;sensitive surfactants with various azobenzene tail chain lengths. The photoswitchable detergents show water&#8208;solubility and micellization as well as undergo reversible isomerization under blue&#8208;/green light illumination. We demonstrate that the light&#8208;induced structural change of azobenzene can lead to vesicle rupture, making them a tool for controlled cargo release from vehicles. Via spontaneous insertion into the plasma membrane of mammalian cells transiently transfected with MscL, we used the azobenzene&#8208;derived detergents to optically activate the transmembrane mechanosensitive channel. This led to the rapid controlled uptake of membrane&#8208;impermeable molecules. Since detergents are extensively used in biochemistry and biotechnology, we propose that the photoswitchable detergents will be useful tools for the spatiotemporal modulation of membrane properties. Additionally, our work provides a design strategy for new detergents in membrane (protein) research.

         <title>Synthesis and Antiproliferative Activity of Cisplatin&#8208;3&#8211;Chloropiperidine Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and characterization of two novel cisplatin&#8208; alkylating agents conjugates. Combining cisplatin with a sterically demanding cyclic nitrogen mustard. Cytotoxicity of the ligands and the complexes examined with MTT assays. The novel conjugates displayed a high antiproliferative potency against 5 human cancer cell lines. Both complexes were able to largely circumvent the acquired cisplatin resistance of A2780cisR ovarian cancer cells.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of two novel cisplatin&#8208; alkylating agents conjugates. Combining a platinum based cytostatic agent with a sterically demanding alkylating agent could potentially induce further DNA damage, block cell repair mechanisms and keep the substrate active against resistant tumor cell lines. The 3&#8208;chloropiperidines utilized as ligands in this work are cyclic representatives of the N&#8208;mustard family and were not able to coordinate platinum on their own. The introduction of a second coordination site, in form of a pyridine moiety, led to the isolation of the desired conjugates. They were characterized with HRMS, CHN&#8208;analyses and XRD. We concluded this work by examining the cytotoxicity of the ligands and the obtained complexes with MTT assays in human cancer cell lines. While the ligands showed hardly any activity, the novel conjugates both displayed a high antiproliferative and cytotoxic potency in a panel of three cell lines. Moreover, both complexes were able to largely circumvent the acquired cisplatin resistance of A2780cisR ovarian cancer cells, both in the MTT assay and a flow&#8208;cytometric apoptosis assay.

         <title>Modulating Polymerase Activity Through Light&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Voltage Domain Insertion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of light&#8208;switchable allosteric domains is becoming increasingly prevalent in biochemical research, offering a potential solution to control enzymatic activity and cellular processes with spatial and temporal precision, without the use of potentially toxic small molecules. The establishment of guidelines for the insertion and evaluation of these switchable proteins is of great scientific importance.







Abstract
Biochemical reaction networks adapt to environmental conditions by sensing chemical or physical stimuli and using tightly controlled mechanisms. While most signals come from molecules, many cells can also sense and respond to light. Among the biomolecular structures that enable light sensing, we selected a light&#8208;oxygen&#8208;voltage (LOV) domain in a previous study that tested the engineering of novel regulatory mechanisms into a nucleic acid polymerase. In this follow&#8208;up study, we studied the activities of previously selected variants in kinetic detail, and we generated additional LOV&#8208;polymerase fusion variants based on further insertion criteria. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how LOV domain insertion influences polymerase activity in a light&#8208;responsive manner: All active and photoresponsive enzyme variants studied by us to date were partially inhibited (i.&#8201;e., &#8220;turned off&#8221;) after irradiation with blue light at 470&#8197;nm, which can be explained by specific obstructions of the polymerase entry or exit structures (substrate entry channels or product exit channels, or both). Although the effects observed are moderate, we anticipate further engineering strategies that could be used to improve the extent of switchability and possibly to develop a &#8220;turn&#8208;on mode&#8221; insertion.

DXP synthase operates in bacterial metabolism with potential roles in metabolic adaptation. Its ligand gated mechanism poises DXPS to sense and respond to chemical cues. Here we took first steps to investigate the chemical scope of ligand&#8208;induced carbanion formation on DXPS, identifying a variety of aldehyde &#8220;triggers&#8221; of LThDP decarboxylation.







Abstract
1&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose 5&#8208;phosphate synthase (DXPS) catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent formation of DXP from pyruvate (donor substrate) and d&#8208;glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate (d&#8208;GAP, acceptor substrate) in bacterial central metabolism. DXPS uses a ligand&#8208;gated mechanism in which binding of a small molecule &#8220;trigger&#8221; activates the first enzyme&#8208;bound intermediate, C2&#945;&#8208;lactylThDP (LThDP), to form the reactive carbanion via LThDP decarboxylation. d&#8208;GAP is the natural acceptor substrate for DXPS and also serves a role as a trigger to induce LThDP decarboxylation in the gated step. Additionally, we have shown that O2 and d&#8208;glyceraldehyde (d&#8208;GA) can induce LThDP decarboxylation. We hypothesize this ligand&#8208;gated mechanism poises DXPS to sense and respond to cellular cues in metabolic remodeling during bacterial adaptation. Here we sought to characterize features of small molecule inducers of LThDP decarboxylation. Using a combination of CD, NMR and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy aldehyde moiety of d&#8208;GAP is sufficient to induce LThDP decarboxylation en route to DXP formation. A variety of aliphatic aldehydes also induce LThDP decarboxylation. The study highlights the capacity of DXPS to respond to different molecular cues, lending support to potential multifunctionality of DXPS and its metabolic regulation by this mechanism.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Noncanonical Substrate Library for Protease Profiling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded noncanonical peptide library is conjugated with a biotin molecule at its N&#8208;terminus for immobilization on a solid support. Upon protease hydrolysis, the substrate peptides are hydrolyzed, and the attached DNA tags are released to identify the sequences of the peptides. This technology is useful for discovering protease substrate preferences.







Abstract
Profiling the substrate sequence preferences of proteases is important for understanding both biological functions as well as for designing protease inhibitors. Several methods are available for profiling the sequence specificity of proteases. However, there is currently no rapid and high&#8208;throughput method to profile specificity of proteases for noncanonical substrates. In this study, we described a strategy to use a DNA&#8208;encoded noncanonical substrate library to identify the protease substrates composed of both canonical and noncanonical amino acids. This approach uses a DNA&#8208;encoded peptide library and introduces a biotin molecule at the N&#8208;terminus to immobilize the library on a solid support. Upon protease hydrolysis, the released DNA tag of the substrate peptides can be sequenced to identify the substrate structures. Using this approach, we profiled trypsin and fibroblast activation protein &#945; and discovered noncanonical substrates that were more efficiently cleaved than the commonly used substrates. The identified substrates of FAP were further used to design corresponding covalent inhibitors containing non&#8208;canonical sequences with high potency for the target protease. Overall, our approach can aid in the development of new protease substrates and inhibitors.

         <title>Exploring the Lower Limit of Target Concentration in Capture&#8208;SELEX Using Guanine as a Model Target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a lower target concentration may generate aptamers with higher affinities. This paper aims to answer if there is a lower limit in target concentration and discusses the relationship between aptamer enrichment and target concentration.







Abstract
During an aptamer selection, using a lower target concentration may result in aptamers with a higher binding affinity. Consequently, this begs the question of whether there is a lower limit for target concentration. In this work, we conducted three aptamer selections using 5&#8197;&#956;M, 500&#8197;nM and 50&#8197;nM guanine as the targets, respectively. Successful enrichment of the same guanine aptamers was achieved at both 5&#8197;&#956;M and 500&#8197;nM guanine, but not with 50&#8197;nM. Using 5&#8197;&#956;M guanine, the aptamer was enriched in eight rounds of selection, compared to that for 500&#8197;nM, which was accomplished in 17 rounds. We discuss the relation of optimal target concentration to the observed Kd value of the resulting aptamers, of which the highest affinity aptamer had a measured Kd of 200&#8197;nM. Additionally, we investigated the binding of the aptamers through mutation studies, revealing a critical cytosine. Mutating this cytosine to a thymine switched the selectivity from guanine to adenine, which is reminiscent of the guanine riboswitch. This study revealed a limit in using low target concentration, and the insights described in this article will be useful for guiding the choice of target concentration during capture&#8208;SELEX.

         <title>Mono&#8208;Palmitoyl&#8208;N&#8208;Alkylurea Ligands as Specific Activators of Human Toll&#8208;Like Receptor 2/6 Heterodimer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The derivatives of the synthetic hTLR2 agonist mini&#8208;UPam were synthesized and biologically evaluated to explore its TLR heterodimer specificity. Mini&#8208;Upam is similar to the well&#8208;known immunostimulatory lipopeptide Pam2CysSK4, which is a potential adjuvant for synthetic vaccines. Our research shows that mini&#8208;UPam and its more lipophilic alkylurea derivatives require the heterodimer hTLR2/hTLR6, rather than hTLR2/hTLR1, to exert their immunostimulatory activity.







Abstract
Ligands for Toll&#8208;like&#8208;receptor 2 (TLR2) have demonstrated significant potential as immune&#8208;stimulating components in synthetic vaccines. Activation of TLR2 relies on the formation of dimeric complexes with either TLR1 or TLR6 and the nature of these dimers can impact therapeutic outcomes. The lipopeptide&#8208;based TLR2 ligands Pam3CysSK4 and Pam2CysSK4 have been extensively studied, and their recognition by different TLR&#8208;receptor heterodimers, TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6, respectively, has been established. However, the high lipophilicity of these ligands, containing multiple palmitoyl residues, can result in solubility issues when used as vaccine adjuvants. To address this, we previously synthesized a less lipophilic ligand containing a single palmitoyl chain called mini&#8208;UPam, which effectively stimulates human moDC maturation. We here probe the receptor&#8208;dimer specificity of several mini&#8208;Upam derivatives and reveal that these mini&#8208;UPam are hTLR2/TLR6 selective ligands and that the introduction of longer urea alkyl chains does not shift the binding specificity to hTLR2/TLR1 heterodimers, in contrast to their Pam2CysSK4 and Pam3CysSK4 counterparts, pointing to a different binding mode of the UPam ligands.

&lt;p&gt;The derivatives of the synthetic hTLR2 agonist mini-UPam were synthesized and biologically evaluated to explore its TLR heterodimer specificity. Mini-Upam is similar to the well-known immunostimulatory lipopeptide Pam&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CysSK&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a potential adjuvant for synthetic vaccines. Our research shows that mini-UPam and its more lipophilic alkylurea derivatives require the heterodimer hTLR2/hTLR6, rather than hTLR2/hTLR1, to exert their immunostimulatory activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligands for Toll-like-receptor 2 (TLR2) have demonstrated significant potential as immune-stimulating components in synthetic vaccines. Activation of TLR2 relies on the formation of dimeric complexes with either TLR1 or TLR6 and the nature of these dimers can impact therapeutic outcomes. The lipopeptide-based TLR2 ligands Pam&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CysSK&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Pam&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CysSK&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have been extensively studied, and their recognition by different TLR-receptor heterodimers, TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6, respectively, has been established. However, the high lipophilicity of these ligands, containing multiple palmitoyl residues, can result in solubility issues when used as vaccine adjuvants. To address this, we previously synthesized a less lipophilic ligand containing a single palmitoyl chain called mini-UPam, which effectively stimulates human moDC maturation. We here probe the receptor-dimer specificity of several mini-Upam derivatives and reveal that these mini-UPam are hTLR2/TLR6 selective ligands and that the introduction of longer urea alkyl chains does not shift the binding specificity to hTLR2/TLR1 heterodimers, in contrast to their Pam&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CysSK&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Pam&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CysSK&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; counterparts, pointing to a different binding mode of the UPam ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling of Mo&#8208; and V&#8208;Nitrogenases Permits Protein&#8208;Mediated Protection from Oxygen Deactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeSII (or &#8220;Shethna&#8221;) protein from Azotobacter vinelandii can protect the Mo&#8208;dependent nitrogenase system from O2 damage. Here, we confirm that V&#8208;dependent nitrogenase does not benefit from this mechanism (shown in&#8197;vitro). Interestingly, cross&#8208;coupling V&#8208; and Mo&#8208;nitrogenase proteins enables FeSII&#8208;mediated protection.







Abstract
Nitrogenases catalyze dinitrogen (N2) fixation to ammonia (NH3). While these enzymes are highly sensitive to deactivation by molecular oxygen (O2) they can be produced by obligate aerobes for diazotrophy, necessitating a mechanism by which nitrogenase can be protected from deactivation. In the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, one mode of such protection involves an O2&#8208;responsive ferredoxin&#8208;type protein (&#8220;Shethna protein II&#8221;, or &#8220;FeSII&#8221;) which is thought to bind with Mo&#8208;dependent nitrogenase's two component proteins (NifH and NifDK) to form a catalytically stalled yet O2&#8208;tolerant tripartite protein complex. This protection mechanism has been reported for Mo&#8208;nitrogenase, however, in&#8197;vitro assays with V&#8208;nitrogenase suggest that this mechanism is not universal to the three known nitrogenase isoforms. Here we report that the reductase of the V&#8208;nitrogenase (VnfH) can engage in this FeSII&#8208;mediated protection mechanism when cross&#8208;coupled with Mo&#8208;nitrogenase NifDK. Interestingly, the cross&#8208;coupling of the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase reductase NifH with the V&#8208;nitrogenase VnfDGK protein does not yield such protection.

         <title>Single Point Mutation Abolishes Water Capture in Germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering water capture in sesquiterpene synthase (GdolS) is explored by manipulating highly conserved active site residues. This work demonstrates that hydroxylation in sesquiterpene synthases can be prevented resulting in the formation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons from carbocation intermediates.







Abstract
The high&#8208;fidelity sesquiterpene cyclase (&#8722;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol synthase (GdolS) converts farnesyl diphosphate into the macrocyclic alcohol (&#8722;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis was used to decipher the role of key residues in the water control mechanism. Replacement of Ala176, located in the G1/2 helix, with non&#8208;polar aliphatic residues of increasing size (valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine) resulted in the accumulation of the non&#8208;hydroxylated products germacrene A and germacrene D. In contrast, hydroxylation was maintained when the polar residues threonine, glutamine or aspartate replaced Ala176. Additionally, although a contribution of His150 to the nucleophilic water addition could be ruled out, the imidazole ring of His150 appears to assist carbocation stabilisation. The results presented here shed light on how hydroxylating sesquiterpene synthases can be engineered to design modified sesquiterpene synthases to reduce the need for further steps in the biocatalytic production of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a Versatile Immunoproteasome Activity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ONX&#8208;0914&#8208;alkyne probe described here allows for the conjugation to a variety of fluorophores through click chemistry. It can then be used to visualize immunoproteasome activity in gel&#8208;based, microscopy, and flow cytometry experiments.







Abstract
The immunoproteasome (iCP) has gained significant interest in recent years as it has been discovered to be significantly expressed under inflammatory conditions, as well as playing significant roles in several diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, viral infection, and cancer. Selective inhibitors have been generated as a method to overcome the off&#8208;target effects of current proteasome inhibitor therapeutics. However, selective probes that allow for monitoring this protein complex remain limited, hindering our understanding of the iCP. Current probes are non&#8208;selective, not commercially available, or require difficult synthesis. Here, we describe the modular synthesis and application of an iCP&#8208;selective probe. The modular nature of the synthetic strategy can enable the incorporation of different fluorophores and covalent warheads, demonstrating the versatility of this probe.

Modulation of terpene synthase activity will likely enable a biocatalytic future in which complex hydroxylated hydrocarbons may be generated enzymatically. In article 10.1002/cbic.202400290, Rudolf K Allemann and co&#8208;workers identify a functional loop within the terpene synthase GdolS which controls quench of the final carbocationic intermediate of its catalytic cycle by H2O quench or proton loss. The image shows the enzyme with substrate bound and a blow&#8208;up of the critical loop motif. The background shows various natural sources for this enzyme.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Drug Design Targeting Abl Kinase: How Structure and Regulation Can Assist in Designing New Drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abelson kinase (Abl) plays a central role in cell signaling, and its dysregulation is implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This paper explores molecular mechanisms involved in regulating Abl activity and the historical evolution of Abl kinase inhibitors. Strategies to overcome resistance, minimize side effects, and consider future implications for kinase&#8208;targeted therapies are also discussed.







Abstract
The human protein Abelson kinase (Abl), a tyrosine kinase, plays a pivotal role in developing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Abl's involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its significance in regulating fundamental biological processes, including DNA damage responses, actin polymerization, and chromatin structural changes. The discovery of the Bcr&#8208;Abl oncoprotein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation in CML patients, revolutionized the understanding and treatment of the disease. The introduction of targeted therapies, starting with interferon&#8208;alpha and culminating in the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib, significantly improved patient outcomes. However, challenges such as drug resistance and side effects persist, indicating the necessity of research into novel therapeutic strategies. This review describes advancements in Abl kinase inhibitor development, emphasizing rational compound design from structural and regulatory information. Strategies, including bivalent inhibitors, PROTACs, and compounds targeting regulatory domains, promise to overcome resistance and minimize side effects. Additionally, leveraging the intricate structure and interactions of Bcr&#8208;Abl may provide insights into developing inhibitors for other kinases. Overall, this review highlights the importance of continued research into Abl kinase inhibition and its broader implications for therapeutic interventions targeting kinase&#8208;driven diseases. It provides valuable insights and strategies that may guide the development of next&#8208;generation therapies.

         <title>Regioselective Deacetylation in Nucleosides and Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in acetylated nucleosides demonstrates practical significance in synthetic processes. It simplifies the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarized and evaluated recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylation, and de&#8208;N&#8208;acetylation) are summarized and discussed within each section of this report.







Abstract
Nucleoside analogues are a promising class of natural compounds in the pharmaceutical industry, and many antiviral, antibacterial and anticancer drugs have been created through structural modification of nucleosides scaffold. Acyl protecting groups, especially the acetyl group, play an important role in the protection of hydroxy groups in nucleoside synthesis and modification; consequently, numerous methodologies have been put forth for the acetylation of free nucleosides. However, for nucleosides that contain different O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities, selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in nucleosides has been studied little, despite its practical significance in simplifying the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini&#8208;review, recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues are summarized and evaluated. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylation, and de&#8208;N&#8208;acetylation) are summarized and discussed in each section.

         <title>Biosynthesis and Assembly Logic of Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks of polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine relies on the collaboration of terpene cyclases (TCs) or prenyltransferases (PTs) with polyketide synthases (PKSs), nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPSs), or glycosyltransferases (GTs), these combination strategies significantly contribute to the formation of hybrid terpenoid natural products in fungi.







Abstract
In recent decades, fungi have emerged as significant sources of diverse hybrid terpenoid natural products, and their biosynthetic pathways are increasingly unveiled. This review mainly focuses on elucidating the various strategies underlying the biosynthesis and assembly logic of these compounds. These pathways combine terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks including polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine, resulting in the formation of plenty of hybrid terpenoid natural products via C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, or C&#8722;N bond linkages. Subsequent tailoring steps, such as oxidation, cyclization, and rearrangement, further enhance the biological diversity and structural complexity of these hybrid terpenoid natural products. Understanding these biosynthetic mechanisms holds promise for the discovery of novel hybrid terpenoid natural products from fungi, which will promote the development of potential drug candidates in the future.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrochemiluminescence Visual Biosensing and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applications of electrochemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) for visual biosensing and bioimaging in recent years were reviewed. Some existing challenges and feasible solutions were presented aiming to provide general guidelines for broadening the research field of ECLM.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is one of the most powerful techniques that meet the needs of analysis and detection in a variety of scenarios, because of its highly analytical sensitivity and excellent spatiotemporal controllability.

         <title>Freezing Functional Nucleic Acids: From Molecular Reactions to Surface Immobilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freezing aqueous solution of functional nucleic acids can accelerate reactions across different scales mainly via the freeze&#8208;concentration effect. These reactions include molecular ligation and cleavage, nanoparticle conjugation, and immobilization on bulk surfaces.







Abstract
Biochemical reactions are typically slowed down by decreasing temperature. However, accelerated reaction kinetics have been observed for a long time. More recent examples have highlighted the unique role of freezing in fabricating supermaterials, degrading environmental contaminants, and accelerating bioreactions. Functional nucleic acids are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with versatile properties, including target recognition, catalysis, and molecular co4mputing. In this review, we discuss the current observations and understanding of freezing&#8208;facilitated reactions involving functional nucleic acids. Molecular reactions such as ligation/conjugation, cleavage, and hybridization are discussed. Moreover, freezing&#8208;induced DNA&#8208;nanoparticle conjugations are introduced. Then, we describe our effect in immobilizing DNA on bulk surfaces. Finally, we address some critical questions and research opportunities in the field.

         <title>Organ&#8208;On&#8208;A&#8208;Chip Devices: Technology Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chips (OsCs) are bioengineered miniaturized systems lined with cells/tissues grown inside microfluidic chips. This article summarizes the progress and development of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips. Many aspects of each OoCs system are investigated such as the microfluidic design, materials used, models, and applications.







Abstract
Organ&#8208;On&#8208;a&#8208;Chip (OOC) is a multichannel 3D&#8208;microfluidic cell&#8208;culture system incorporated in a chip that simulates the behavior of an organ. This technology relies on a multidisciplinary science that benefits from and contributes in the progress of many fields including microbiology, microfluidics, biomaterials, and bioengineering. This review article summarizes the progress and achievements of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies. It highlights the significant advantages of this technology in terms of reducing animal testing and providing personalized medical responses. In addition, this paper demonstrates how OOC is becoming a promising and powerful tool in pharmaceutical research to combat diseases. It predicts not only the effects of drugs on the target organs but also, using body&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems, it may provide insights into the side effects of the drug delivery on the other organs. Likewise, the models used for the construction of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices are investigated along with the design and materials of microfluidic devices. For each OOC, the integrated monitoring devices within the chips (e.&#8201;g., sensors and biosensors) are discussed. We also discuss the evolution of FDA regulations and the potential in the near future for integrating OOCs into protocols that support and reduce the need for and the failure rates in preclinical and clinical studies.

         <title>Exploring the World of Curcumin: Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Applications in Nanoscience and Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>

The importance of curcumin lies not only in its photophysical properties but also in its diverse applications in nanoscience and biology.







Abstract
Curcumin is a bright yellow naturally occurring polyphenol which is the principal component of turmeric. It is used as herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, and food coloring agent. Over the years, the therapeutic properties of the natural product curcumin have gone unexploited but not unnoticed. Curcumin cannot be employed as a drug due to limitations such as low aqueous solubility and limited bioavailability. Many attempts have been made to overcome these limitations by confining the drug in various confined media to enhance its bioavailability. The biomolecule is emissive and undergoes fundamental excited state processes such as solvation dynamics and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials are also a fast advancing field where curcumin is an intrinsic component necessary for formation of these materials and no longer added as an external free drug. In this review, we will summarize the recent research on the photophysical and photochemical properties of curcumin and its excited state dynamics in various bio&#8208;mimicking systems. At the same time we wish to also incorporate the various applications of curcumin, especially in biology. Lastly due to the growing importance of materials science, we will briefly discuss some recent advances on curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials. We believe such a compilation of recent research surrounding curcumin will provide an overall understanding of its potentialities in different areas.

         <title>Detection Strategies for Sialic Acid and Sialoglycoconjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 23, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialic acid is a glycan residue found at the termini of many glycoconjugates. This residue, and the underlying residues it covers, form critical recognition epitopes in glycobiology. In this review we discuss methods to detect sialoglycoconjugates and sialic acids which are either substrates or products of the enzymes that form these conjugates &#8211; sialyltransferases (SiaT) and neuraminidases (NEU).







Abstract
Glycoconjugates are a vast class of biomolecules implicated in biological processes important for human health and disease. The structural complexity of glycoconjugates remains a challenge to deciphering their precise biological roles and for their development as biomarkers and therapeutics. Human glycoconjugates on the outside of the cell are modified with sialic (neuraminic) acid residues at their termini. The enzymes that install sialic acids are sialyltransferases (SiaTs), a family of 20 different isoenzymes. The removal and degradation of sialic acids is mediated by neuraminidase (NEU; sialidase) enzymes, of which there are four isoenzymes. In this review, we discuss chemical and biochemical approaches for the detection and analysis of sialoglycoconjugate (SGC) structures and their enzymatic products. The most common methods include affinity probes and synthetic substrates. Fluorogenic and radiolabelled substrates are also important tools for many applications, including screening for enzyme inhibitors. Strategies that give insight into the native substrate&#8208;specificity of enzymes that regulate SGCs (SiaT &amp; NEU) are necessary to improve our understanding of the role of sialic acid metabolism in health and disease.

         <title>Designer Helical Fibers and Tubes: Self&#8208;assembling Hybrid Peptides via Leu/Ile&#8208;Phe Zipper</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dipeptides with phenylene urea at their N&#8208;terminus exhibit tubular or fibrous assemblies, depending on the dipeptide sequence. Tubular structures are formed through an Ile/Leu&#8208;Phe zipper involving a double helical arrangement. The self&#8208;assembled structures also display autofluorescence and red&#8208;edge excitation behaviour.







Abstract
Here, we present a family of simple peptides that show diverse self&#8208;assembling behaviors. We used aliphatic (Leu/Ile) and aromatic (Phe) amino acids to delineate our design. The design consists of phenylene urea at the N&#8208;terminus of the peptide. The urea peptides with sequence Phe&#8208;LeuOMe (1) or Phe&#8208;IleOMe (2) associate to form polygonal peptide tubes via zipper arrangements, supported by microscopic and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The peptide with Phe placed away from the phenylene urea (3 and 4), showed fibrous assembly. All the peptides showed autofluorescence and red edge excitation behavior upon self&#8208;assembly.

Tubular structures are formed through an Ile/Leu-Phe zipper involving a double helical arrangement. The self-assembled structures also display autofluorescence and red-edge excitation behaviour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a family of simple peptides that show diverse self-assembling behaviors. We used aliphatic (Leu/Ile) and aromatic (Phe) amino acids to delineate our design. The design consists of phenylene urea at the N-terminus of the peptide. The urea peptides with sequence Phe-LeuOMe (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) or Phe-IleOMe (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) associate to form polygonal peptide tubes via zipper arrangements, supported by microscopic and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The peptide with Phe placed away from the phenylene urea (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), showed fibrous assembly. All the peptides showed autofluorescence and red edge excitation behavior upon self-assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptides for Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation: An Emerging Biomaterial</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advances in peptides for liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and highlights their crucial role in drug delivery, catalysis, biosensing, and detection. We focus on the strategies used to design LLPS peptide sequences and emphasize their potential biomedical applications. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as next&#8208;generation biomaterials.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) refers to a spontaneous separation behavior of biomacromolecules under specific physiological conditions, playing a crucial role in regulating various biological processes. Recent advances in synthetic peptides have greatly improved our understanding of peptide&#8208;based coacervate droplets and expanded their applications in biomedicine. Numerous peptide sequences have been reported that undergo phase separation, enabling the concentration and sequestration of different guest molecules for purposes such as drug delivery, catalytic performance, and bioanalytical techniques. Particularly, some of these peptides offer significant advantages in controlled drug release, efficient cell transfection, accelerated reaction kinetics, and selective biomarker detection. This review provides an overview of recent developments in peptide&#8208;based LLPS, exploring various strategies for designing peptide sequences and their biomedical applications. It also addresses the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as promising biomaterials.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterisation of a Bacterial Lactoperoxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the biochemical and structural characterization of CyanoPOX, a heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16. Expressed in E.&#8197;coli, the enzyme exhibits properties similar to bovine lactoperoxidase despite low sequence identity. CyanoPOX demonstrates optimal activity in slightly acidic conditions and efficiently oxidizes various substrates. Structural analysis reveals a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor and a conserved active site pocket.







Abstract
Peroxidases belong to a group of enzymes that are widely found in animals, plants and microorganisms. These enzymes are effective biocatalysts for a wide range of oxidations on various substrates. This work presents a biochemical and structural characterization of a novel heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16, CyanoPOX. This cyanobacterial enzyme was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble, heme&#8208;containing monomeric enzyme. Although CyanoPOX shares relatively low sequence identity (37&#8201;%) with bovine lactoperoxidase, it displays comparable biochemical properties. CyanoPOX is most stable and active in slightly acidic conditions (pH 6&#8211;6.5) and moderately thermostable (melting temperature around 48&#8201;&#176;C). Several compounds that are typical substrates for mammalian lactoperoxidases were tested to establish the catalytic potential of CyanoPOX. Potassium iodide showed the highest catalytic efficiency (126&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), while various aromatic compounds were also readily converted. Structural elucidation of CyanoPOX confirmed the presence of a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor that is situated in the central core of the protein. Except for a highly similar overall structure, CyanoPOX also has a conserved active site pocket when compared with mammalian lactoperoxidases. Due to its catalytic properties and high expression in a bacterial host, this newly discovered peroxidase shows promise for applications.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective NanoBRET Probe to Assess MAGL Inhibition in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new intracellular NanoBRET assay was developed to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. To this end, a potent reversible preclinical inhibitor was linked to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 fluorophore by means of structure&#8208;based design, and MAGL was engineered with a fused nanoluciferase (Nluc) protein as a suitable donor counterpart. The assay was validated using representative irreversible and reversible MAGL inhibitors, followed by profiling of over 1&#8217;900 project compounds. This study demonstrates the advantages of cell&#8208;based assays in accelerating compound profiling in early project stages.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;free enzymatic assays are highly useful tools in early compound profiling due to their robustness and scalability. However, their inadequacy to reflect the complexity of target engagement in a cellular environment may lead to a significantly divergent pharmacology that is eventually observed in cells. The discrepancy that emerges from properties like permeability and unspecific protein binding may largely mislead lead compound selection to undergo further chemical optimization. We report the development of a new intracellular NanoBRET assay to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. Based on a reverse design approach, a highly potent, reversible preclinical inhibitor was conjugated to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 acceptor fluorophore while retaining its overall balanced properties. An engineered MAGL&#8208;nanoluciferase (Nluc) fusion protein provided a suitable donor counterpart for the facile interrogation of intracellular ligand activity. Validation of assay conditions using a selection of known MAGL inhibitors set the stage for the evaluation of over 1&#8217;900 MAGL drug candidates derived from our discovery program. This evaluation enabled us to select compounds for further development based not only on target engagement, but also on favorable physicochemical parameters like permeability and protein binding. This study highlights the advantages of cell&#8208;based target engagement assays for accelerating compound profiling and progress at the early stages of drug discovery programs.

         <title>Design of a Bioluminescent Assay Platform for Quantitative Measurement of Histone Acetyltransferase Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive novel bioluminescent system was developed that can accurately quantify the kinetics of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) catalyzed acylation reactions. This system utilizes acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 and firefly luciferase for a coupled reaction that generates luminescence proportional to acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA) concentrations allowing for determination of AcCoA consumption by a HAT catalyzed reaction. This system can be used in high throughput for inhibition studies.







Abstract
Protein acetylation and acylation are widespread post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Histone acetyltransferase (HATs) enzymes catalyze the addition of short&#8208;chain acyl moieties to lysine residues on cellular proteins. Many HAT members are found to be dysregulated in human diseases, especially oncological processes. Screening potent and selective HAT inhibitors has promising application for therapeutic innovation. A biochemical assay for quantification of HAT activity utilizing luminescent output is highly desirable to improve upon limitations associated with the classic radiometric assay formats. Here we report the design of a bioluminescent technological platform for robust and sensitive quantification of HAT activity. This platform utilizes the metabolic enzyme acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) for a coupled reaction with firefly luciferase to generate luminescent signal relative to the HAT&#8208;catalyzed acetylation reaction. The biochemical assay was implemented in microtiter plate format and our results showed this assay sensitively detected catalytic activity of HAT enzyme p300, accurately measured its steady&#8208;state kinetic parameters of histone acetylation and measured the inhibitory potency of HAT inhibitor. This platform demonstrated excellent robustness, reproducibility, and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, with a screening window Z&#8217;=0.79. Our new bioluminescent design provides an alternative means for HAT enzymatic activity quantitation and HAT inhibitor screening.

         <title>Impact of Antioxidants on Mechanical Properties and ROS Levels of Neuronal Cells Exposed to &#946;&#8208;Amyloid Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effects of antioxidants on oxidative stress and mechanical properties of neuronal cells exposed to &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregates. Using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy and electrochemical methods, it was highlighted how NAC and SOD1 reduce ROS&#8208;induced cellular stiffness, revealing a link between oxidative stress and cytoskeletal dynamics relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
This study aims to investigate the potential role of antioxidants in oxidative stress and its consequent impact on the mechanical properties of neuronal cells, particularly the stress induced by amyloid&#8208;beta (1&#8211;42) (A&#946;42) aggregates. A key aspect of our research involved using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy (SICM) to assess the mechanical properties (Young's modulus) of neuronal cells under oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured in single&#8208;cell using the electrochemical method by low&#8208;invasive Pt nanoelectrode. We investigated the effects of the low molecular weight antioxidant N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) on the physiological and mechanical properties of neuronal cells using SICM. Using electrochemical method and SICM, NAC effectively reduces oxidative stress and restores Young's Modulus in SH&#8208;SY5Y cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide and A&#946;42 oligomers. Our study first examined the influence of SOD1 on intracellular ROS levels in the presence of A&#946; oligomers. The investigation into the effects of SOD1 and its nanoparticle form SOD1 on SH&#8208;SY5Y cells reveals impacts on mechanical properties and oxidative stress. The combined use of SICM and electrochemical measurements provided a comprehensive understanding of how oxidative stress, including that triggered by the A&#946; oligomers affects the mechanical properties of cells.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction and Conformational Change in the Alpha&#8208;Helical Membrane Transporter BtuCD&#8208;F in the Native Cellular Envelope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, the &#945;&#8208;helical membrane proteins are located in the inner membrane (IM) and further nanoconfined into the complex cellular envelope, which additionally consists of the periplasm and the outer membrane (OM). Here, we show that the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair combined with pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy can be used to observe the conformational change of a membrane transporter in the cellular envelope.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins perform numerous critical functions essential for the survival of living organisms. Traditionally, these proteins are extracted from membranes using detergent solubilization and reconstitution into liposomes or nanodiscs. However, these processes often obscure the effects of nanoconfinement and the native environment on the structure and conformational heterogeneity of the target protein. We demonstrate that pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy, combined with the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair, enables the selective observation of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD&#8722;F in its native cellular envelope. Despite the high levels of non&#8208;specific labeling in the envelope, this orthogonal approach combined with the long phase&#8208;memory time for the Gd3+ spin enables the observation of the target protein complex at a few micromolar concentrations with high resolution. In the native envelope, vitamin B12 induces a distinct conformational shift at the BtuCD&#8208;BtuF interface, which is not observed in the micelles. This approach offers a general strategy for investigating protein&#8208;protein and protein&#8208;ligand/drug interactions and conformational changes of the alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins in their native envelope context.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multifunctional roles of NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs) in biocatalysis beyond traditional cofactor regeneration. It highlights their emerging applications in catalyzing key reactions for small molecule synthesis, including reductions of ketones, imines, and aldehydes, as well as dehydrogenation processes, emphasizing their potential in drug discovery and development.







Abstract
The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress in the field of biocatalysis. One of the most frequently utilized enzymes in diverse biocatalytic applications is NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs). Traditionally, these enzymes are employed for their role in regenerating NAD(P)H in various enzymatic reactions utilizing glucose. However, recent studies have expanded the scope of GDHs beyond cofactor regeneration, highlighting their potential as biocatalysts in diverse chemical transformations. GDHs have demonstrated versatility in catalyzing key reactions in the synthesis of various drug molecules and intermediates, including ketone reduction to produce alcohols, imine reduction of C=N bonds to yield amines, reduction of aldehydes to alcohols, and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol derivatives. This review highlights recent advancements in elucidating the multifunctional roles of NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs) in biocatalysis, with an emphasis on their growing applications and significant potential in small molecule synthesis.

         <title>Towards Bacterial Resistance via the Membrane Strategy: Enzymatic, Biophysical and Biomimetic Studies of the Lipid cis&#8208;trans Isomerase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti), a heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, induces a swift membrane rigidification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under stress conditions that impede bacterial growth. This study provides understanding of the enzyme's heme coordination and redox state as well as some insights into the catalytic mechanism and reveals that phospholipids, alongside fatty acids, serve as substrate for this metalloenzyme.







Abstract
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti) is a periplasmic heme&#8208;c enzyme found in several bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen known for causing nosocomial infections. This metalloenzyme catalyzes the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids in order to rapidly modulate membrane fluidity in response to stresses that impede bacterial growth. As a consequence, breakthrough in the elucidation of the mechanism of this metalloenzyme might lead to new strategies to combat bacterial antibiotic resistance. We report the first comprehensive biochemical, electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Cti enzyme. This has been possible by the successful purification of Cti from P. aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;Cti) in favorable yields with enzyme activity of 0.41&#8197;&#956;mol/min/mg when tested with palmitoleic acid. Through a synergistic approach involving enzymology, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, Raman spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electrochemistry, we identified the heme coordination and redox state, pinpointing Met163 as the sixth ligand of the FeII of heme&#8208;c in Pa&#8208;Cti. Significantly, the development of an innovative assay based on liposomes demonstrated for the first time that Cti catalyzes cis&#8208;trans isomerization directly using phospholipids as substrates without the need of protein partners, answering the important question about the substrate of Cti within the bacterial membrane.

The purification is based on oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to 3&#8217; poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA. This method provides a new platform for rapid optimization of chemically modified mRNAs and advancement of their pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
Position&#8208;specific nucleoside sugar modifications have been shown to improve the translational activity and stability of chemically synthesized mRNA. For pharmaceutical applications of chemically modified mRNAs, a rapid purification methodology is imperative to identify the optimal modification pattern. However, while the chemical synthesis of mRNAs can be accomplished by splint ligation of oligonucleotide fragments, the current purification method for ligated mRNAs based on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tends to be time consuming. In this study, we developed a two&#8208;step affinity purification method for rapid sample preparation. In this method, ligated mRNA is captured by oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to the 3&#8217;&#8208;poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA, respectively. Therefore, the target mRNA can be isolated from a complex mixture of splint ligations. Using this method, six sugar&#8208;modified mRNAs were simultaneously purified, and the translational activities of these mRNAs were evaluated immediately after purification. The results demonstrate that this methodology is suitable for the rapid preparation of various chemically synthesized mRNAs to identify their optimal modification patterns.

         <title>Protein Condensates Unfold G&#8208;Quadruplex Resembling a Helicase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of biomolecules plays a significant role in intracellular condensation. Our findings of G4 unfolding within protein condensates reveal intriguing insights into how a protein gain a new function through the formation of condensates, enriching our comprehension of cellular processes at the molecular level.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;less organelles, formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, participate in many vital cellular processes and have received extensive attention recently. A notable form of noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structure, G&#8208;quadruplex (G4), interacts with the scaffolding proteins in these membrane&#8208;less organelles and becomes an integral part of this condensed phase. However, the structure and stability features of the integrated G4 remain poorly characterized. Herein, we employed NMR along with other biophysical methods to investigate the conformation of a G4 within condensates formed by a disordered protein known as DDX4N1. We discovered that the human telomeric sequence MHT24, which forms a G4 structure in a non&#8208;condensed phase solution of protein DDX4N1, unfolds when it is within DDX4N1 condensates due to phase separation. Our findings provide an instance of a protein acquiring new functionality through phase separation process, which deepen our understanding of how protein condensates regulate G4 structure and their functions.

         <title>Chondroitin Sulfate&#8208;Coated Heteroduplex&#8208;Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[60]fullerene&#8208;based molecular spherical nucleic acids (MSNAs) were used as hybridization&#8208;mediated carriers for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate (CS) tetrasaccharides. The impact of the MSNA&#8208;carriers and the CS&#8208;halo on the cellular uptake and suppression of Tau&#8208;protein was studied with hippocampal neurons in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids (MSNAs) are atomically uniform dendritic nanostructures and potential delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The radial formulation combined with covalent conjugation may hide the oligonucleotide content and simultaneously enhance the role of appropriate conjugate groups on the outer sphere. The conjugate halo may be modulated to affect the delivery properties of the MSNAs. In the present study, [60]fullerene&#8208;based molecular spherical nucleic acids, consisting of a 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide and a ribonucleotide sequence, were used as hybridization&#8208;mediated carriers (&#8220;DNA and RNA&#8208;carriers&#8221;) for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, (i.&#8201;e. Tau&#8208;ASO) and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides (CS) with different sulfation patterns. The impact of the MSNA carriers, CS&#8208;moieties on the conjugates and the CS&#8208;decorations on the MSNAs on cellular uptake and &#8208; activity (Tau&#8208;suppression) of the Tau&#8208;ASO was studied with hippocampal neurons in&#8197;vitro. The formation and stability of these heteroduplex ASO&#8208;MSNAs were evaluated by UV melting profile analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography equipped with a multi angle light scattering detector (SEC&#8208;MALS). The cellular uptake and &#8208; activity were studied by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis, respectively.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Various Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Derivatives in Enzyme Supramolecular Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin derivatives are produced and used to build a protective layer shielding surface&#8208;immobilized enzymes. These macrocycles act as artificial chaperones and support protein stability under thermal stress conditions. Along with providing protection to enzymes exposed to chaotropic stress, the macrocycles support protein refolding and activity recovery.







Abstract
Enzyme stability and activity are pivotal factors for their implementation in different industrial applications. Enzyme supramolecular engineering relies on the fabrication of a tailor&#8208;made enzyme nano&#8208;environment to ensure enzyme stability without impairing activity. Cyclodextrins (CDs), cyclic oligomers of glucose, act as protein chaperones and stabilize, upon interaction with hydrophobic amino acid residues exposed at the protein surface, its three&#8208;dimensional structure. When used to build an organosilica layer shielding an enzyme, they enhance the protective effect of this layer. In the present study, we systematically assessed the protective effects of three organosilane derivatives based on &#593;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CDs. A model lipase enzyme was immobilized at the surface of silica nanoparticles and shielded in an organosilica layer containing these organosilanes. Besides layer thickness optimization, the effect of different stressors (i.&#8201;e., temperature, SDS, urea) was tested. Our results showed that organosilica layers produced with CDs improve enzyme thermal stability. They also support enzyme refolding after denaturation under chaotic conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the protective effect of the smallest CD derivative tested, namely &#593;&#8208;CD, surpassed the other macrocycles studied for conferring the immobilized enzyme with higher resistance to stress conditions. This protection strategy was also applied to a thermostable &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme.

         <title>Auto&#8208;Deactivation of BODIPY&#8208;Derived Type I Photosensitizer Post Photodynamic Therapy under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage photochemical process on BODIPY&#8208;derived photosensitizers is investigated under oxygen&#8208;free conditions to automatically switch off the photoactivity post photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment. The NADH&#8208;driven mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosystem exhibits great potential for safe and efficient PDT beyond reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fighting hypoxia.







Abstract
The long&#8208;lasting activity of photosensitizers during photodynamic therapy (PDT) causes excessive damage and arouses great concerns about biosafety. Herein, we synthesized a pyridinium&#8208;decorated diiodo&#8208;BODIPY compound (PyBDP) and investigated its photosensitizing activity under hypoxic condition in the presence of NADH that is abundant in the mitochondria of hypoxic tumors. The unique property of PyBDP lies in the redox environment&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response. At green light exposure, PyBDP is converted into a colorless inactive form by interacting with NADH in a two&#8208;step one&#8208;electron transfer process. Interestingly, the NADH&#8208;dependent hydrogenation of PyBDP is affected by the presence of cytochrome c (Cyt cox) that is an important component of mitochondrial electron transport chain (Mito&#8208;ETC), unless Cyt cox is exhausted. Active radical species is produced during the photocatalytic reaction, which adds the understanding of PyBDP&#8208;induced photodamage. Therefore, we applied the strategy of auto&#8208;deactivation PDT using a BODIPY photosensitizer by tethering triphenylphosphonium to PyBDP. After PDT effect in a type I pathway, the photosensitizer underwent almost entire auto&#8208;deactivation in hypoxic HeLa cells. This work paves a way for the development of reductive PDT with enhanced safety and efficacy in fighting hypoxic tumors independent on reactive oxygen species (ROS).

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Modulated Excited Triplet States and Activities of Ruthenium Complexes for Dual Photodynamic/Sonodynamic Therapy to Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes with distinct intraligand transition nature of the lowest excited triplet states were designed for single&#8208;molecule PDT/SDT synergistic multimodal anticancer toward cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer. They could induce both apoptosis and ferroptosis of tumor cells by light&#8208; and sonication&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
Six polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes were designed for single&#8208;molecule photodynamic and sonodynamic therapy (PDT/SDT) synergistic multimodal anticancer toward cisplatin&#8208;resistant NSCLC. They demonstrated lowest 3ES with distinct intraligand transition nature, which is beneficial for singlet oxygen generation. Remarkable quantum yields of both singlet oxygen and superoxide anion under either 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation or ultrasonic treatment and could induce apoptosis and ferroptosis of A549R cells. Cytotoxicity experiments clearly demonstrated a synergistic effect between PDT and SDT. The relationship between the structures of these complexes and their cellular biological mechanisms has been explored in detail. Using a single&#8208;molecule sensitizer to achieve synergistic PDT/SDT may provide valuable insights for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant tumors that located deeply and in hypoxic microenvironment.

         <title>Tailoring CotA Laccase Substrate Specificity by Rationally Reshaping Pocket Edge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the protein engineering work against CotA laccase, all mutants show impaired activities against small size sinapic acid, in contrast, A227E, G321F and G321P showed around 25&#8201;% increase of activities against big size ditaurobilirubin compared to WT. Unexpectedly, heterologous expression yields of T262F, T262F/G321F and T262F/G321P increased by around 5, 7 and 21 folds compared to WT, respectively.







Abstract
CotA is a bacterial multicopper oxidase, capable of oxidizing lots of substrates. In previous work, small size lignin phenol derivates were found to lie only in the partially covered part of pocket. However, big size substate would occupy the whole pocket to react. In this work, five residues sitting at the edge of the pocket were selected to study their roles in regulating activities against different size substrates. All mutants showed impaired activities against small size sinapic acid, however, A227E, G321F and G321P showed around 25&#8201;% increase of activities against big size ditaurobilirubin compared to wild type (WT). T262F/G321F showed moderate increased activity to alazin red S. kcat/Kms against ditaurobilirubin of A227E, T262F and G321F are around 1.5, 3 and 1.5 folds of WT's. Unexpectedly, heterologous expression yields of T262F, T262F/G321F and T262F/G321P in Escherichia coli greatly increased by around 5, 7 and 21 folds compared to WT, respectively. It is speculated positive mutants would provide a beneficial orientation for big size substrates. Substituting semi&#8208;buried residue T262 by a hydrophobic amino acid might enhance expression yields mainly by increasing van der waals and hydrophobic interaction. This work exemplified rationally regulating specific activities of laccase and is valuable for industrial application.

         <title>Photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Library Enables Covalent Chemical Capture of Solvent&#8208;Exposed TPR Domain Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the unnatural amino acid, p&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Bpa), we developed a photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) library to covalently capture protein&#8208;protein interactions along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. This library explicitly targets the less&#8208;studied TPR binding surface, over the lumenal substrate&#8208;binding surface, and expands the toolbox for both targeted discovery of new interactors and characterization of OGT's TPR interactome.







Abstract
O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is an essential, stress&#8208;sensing enzyme responsible for adding the O&#8208;GlcNAc monosaccharide to thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins to regulate cellular homeostasis. OGT substrates are found in almost all intracellular processes, and perturbations in protein O&#8208;GlcNAc levels have been implicated in proteostatic diseases, such as cancers, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration. This broad disease activity makes OGT an attractive therapeutic target; however, the substrate diversity makes pan&#8208;inhibition as a therapeutic strategy unfeasible. Rather, a substrate&#8208;specific approach to targeting is more advantageous, but how OGT chooses its substrates remains poorly understood. Substrate specificity is controlled by the interactions between OGT's non&#8208;catalytic tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, rather than its glycosyltransferase domain. OGT's TPR domain forms a 100&#8197;&#197; superhelical structure, containing a lumenal surface, known as the substrate&#8208;binding surface, and a solvent&#8208;exposed surface. To date, there are no tools to site&#8208;selectively target regions of the domain and differentiate between the two binding surfaces. Here, we developed a library of recombinant OGT constructs containing site&#8208;specifically incorporated photoactivatable unnatural amino acids (UAAs) along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the TPR domain to covalently capture and map OGT's interactome.

         <title>Exploring Fluorinase Substrate Tolerance at C&#8208;2 of SAM</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate tolerance of the fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) is explored by introducing untested substituents at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring. The most active analogues were N&#8208;alkylated amines and as a class these were much better than O&#8208; or S&#8208; ethers. The outcomes are supported by in silico analysis. This tolerance broadens the utility of the fluorinase as a tool for introducing the fluorine&#8208;18 isotope into ligands for positron emission tomography applications.







Abstract
The fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) utilises fluoride ion and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) as substrates for conversion to 5&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;adenosine (5&#8242;&#8208;FDA) and L&#8208;methionine (L&#8208;Met). The enzyme has a very strict substrate specificity, however it has been shown to tolerate acetylenes and NH2 replacements for H at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring of SAM. This substrate tolerance is explored further here with &#8722;NHR, &#8722;N3, &#8722;OR and &#8722;SR substituents attached to C&#8208;2. New activities are demonstrated, for example with NH&#8208;methyl, NH&#8208;propyl,NH&#8208;butyl and O&#8208;butyl substrates at C&#8208;2, however azide and thioethers were not tolerated. Outcomes are supported by in silico analysis, revealing favourable H&#8208;bonding interactions involving NH and O substituents at the adenine C&#8208;2 position with N278 and the backbone amide of A279 at the active site respectively. The study informs on the selectivity of the fluorinase as a tool for radiolabelling candidate ligands with fluorine&#8208;18 for positron emission tomography programmes.

         <title>Recent Insights into the Reaction Mechanisms of Non&#8208;Heme Diiron Enzymes Containing Oxoiron(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;valent oxoiron(IV): This review outlines the structures, formation mechanisms, and functions of high&#8208;valent oxoiron(IV) intermediates in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The discussion emphasizes the structural and mechanistic diversity across different enzyme subfamilies.







Abstract
Oxoiron(IV) complexes are key intermediates in the catalytic reactions of some non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. These enzymes, across various subfamilies, activate dioxygen to generate high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo species, which, in turn, drive the activation of substrates and mediate a variety of challenging oxidative transformations. In this review, we summarize the structures, formation mechanisms, and functions of high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo intermediates in eight representative diiron enzymes (sMMO, RNR, ToMO, MIOX, PhnZ, SCD1, AlkB, and SznF) spanning five subfamilies. We also categorize and analyze the structural and mechanistic differences among these enzymes.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Discovery of Substrate Peptide Sequences for E3 Ubiquitin Ligases Using a cDNA Display Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a screening system for E3 substrate sequences based on a cDNA display method. A randomized library of potential E3 substrates was displayed in the form of covalent conjugates between the peptide sequences and their corresponding DNA sequences. The displayed library was subjected to in&#8197;vitro ubiquitylation, the ubiquitylated sequences were pulled down by the anti&#8208;ubiquitin antibody, and the corresponding peptide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing.







Abstract
Cells utilize ubiquitin as a posttranslational protein modifier to convey various signals such as proteasomal degradation. The dysfunction of ubiquitylation or following proteasomal degradation can give rise to the accumulation and aggregation of improperly ubiquitylated proteins, which is known to be a general causation of many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the characterization of substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases is crucial in biological and pharmaceutical sciences. In this study, we developed a novel high&#8208;throughput screening system for substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases using a cDNA display method, which enables covalent conjugation between peptide sequences and their corresponding cDNA sequences. First, we focused on the MDM2 E3 ligase and its known peptide substrate as a model to establish the screening method, and confirmed that cDNA display method was compatible with in&#8197;vitro ubiquitylation. Then, we demonstrated identification of MDM2 substrate sequences from random libraries to identify a novel motif (VKFTGGQLA). Bioinformatics analysis of the hit sequences was performed to gain insight about endogenous substrate proteins.

         <title>Anion and Substituents Effect on Spectral&#8208;Kinetic and Biological Characteristics of Spiropyran Salts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
These spiropyran are characterized by NIR absorption and fluorescence of their merocyanine forms, making them promising fluorescent probes and markers. It was shown that the counterion has minimal effect on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the dyes but dramatically affects the toxicity of the compounds. Using the most appropriate compounds, bioimaging experiments were carried out to visualize planktonic bacteria and bacterial biofilms.







Abstract
Spiropyran salts containing a cationic vinyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indolium moiety are characterized by NIR absorption and fluorescence of their merocyanine forms. This feature makes them promising fluorescent probes and markers for bioimaging. The article focuses on the synthesis and study of the spectral, kinetic and toxic characteristics of such compounds with respect to various substituents in different moieties and the type of anion. A detailed analysis of the acquired data made it possible to draw some important conclusions regarding the influence of structural factors, which will be very useful for the further rational design of such derivatives. In particular, it was shown that the counterion has minimal effect on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the dyes but dramatically affects the toxicity of the compounds. Following selection of the most appropriate compounds, bioimaging experiments were carried out to visualize planktonic bacteria and bacterial biofilms of E. coli and A. calcoaceticus. The ability to visualize biofilms is critical for the diagnosis of chronic diseases. By the results of molecular docking a theoretical interaction pattern between spiropyran molecules and DNA was proposed.

         <title>Close Proximity of Cholesterol Anchors in Membrane Induces the Dissociation of Amphiphilic DNA Strand from Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular base paring in the terminal base pair of amphiphilic DNA strand labelled with cholesterol anchors was modulated by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction. The close proximity of cholesterol anchors within the membrane could result in the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA strand from the membrane surface.







Abstract
Dynamic DNA nanotechnology is appealing for membrane surface engineering due to their versatility and programmability. To modulate the dynamic interactions between the DNA functional units immobilized on membrane surface, membrane&#8208;anchored DNA functional units often come into close proximity each other due to DNA base pairing, which also leads to the close contact of the hydrophobic anchors in membrane. However, whether the close contact of hydrophobic anchors induces the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA structures from membrane surface is not concerned. Herein, we utilized cholesterol&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a simplified amphiphilic DNA structure to investigate the stability of membrane anchored DNA strands upon the closely contact of cholesterol anchors. The close contact of cholesterol&#8208;labelled ssDNA molecules driven by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction leads to approximately 41&#8201;% membrane anchored ssDNA dissociation from membrane surface, indicating the proximal cholesterol anchors in membrane could reduce the anchoring stability of cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands. This work enhances our understanding of the interactions between amphiphilic DNA and membranes, and provides valuable insights for the design of future DNA constructs intended for applications involving dynamic DNA reactions on membrane surface.

         <title>Mitochondrial Viscosity Probes: Iridium(III) Complexes Induce Apoptosis in HeLa Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new Ir(III) complexes containing 5&#8208;fluorouracil derivatives as ligands were synthesized. Among these, Ir1 selectively induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of Ir1 demonstrated high sensitivity to intracellular viscosity changes, enabling real&#8208;time fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of cellular micro&#8208;viscosity during apoptosis.







Abstract
Mitochondrial viscosity has emerged as a promising biomarker for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, yet accurately measuring viscosity at the subcellular level remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized and characterized three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8208;Ir3) containing 5&#8208;fluorouracil derivatives as ligands. Among these, Ir1 selectively induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered a cascade of events leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of Ir1 demonstrated high sensitivity to intracellular viscosity changes, enabling real&#8208;time fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of cellular micro&#8208;viscosity during apoptosis. These findings underscore the potential of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications at the subcellular level.

         <title>A Rapid and Sensitive MicroPlate Assay (MPSA) Using an Alkyne&#8208;Modified CMP&#8208;Sialic Acid Donor to Evaluate Human Sialyltransferase Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a sensitive microplate assay to explore the enzymatic activities of human sialyltransferases using an alkyne&#8208;modified CMP&#8208;sialic acid donor. This method allows for comprehensive kinetic analysis, revealing the substrate tolerance and enzyme specific activities of 13 human sialyltransferases.







Abstract
Human sialyltransferases primarily utilize CMP&#8208;Sias, especially transferring Neu5Ac from CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac to various acceptors. Advances in chemical biology have led to the synthesis of novel CMP&#8208;Sia donors suitable for bioorthogonal reactions in cell&#8208;based assays. However, the compatibility of these donors with all human enzymes remains uncertain. We synthesized a non&#8208;natural CMP&#8208;Sia donor with an alkyne modification on the N&#8208;acyl group of Neu5Ac, which was effectively used by human ST6Gal&#8197;I and ST3Gal&#8197;I. A sensitive MicroPlate Sialyltransferase Assay (MPSA) was developed and expanded to a panel of 13 human STs acting on glycoproteins. All assayed enzymes tolerated CMP&#8208;SiaNAl, allowing for the determination of kinetic parameters and turnover numbers. This study enhances the biochemical characterization of human sialyltransferases and opens new avenues for developing sialyltransferase inhibitors.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a sensitive microplate assay to explore the enzymatic activities of human sialyltransferases using an alkyne-modified CMP-sialic acid donor. This method allows for comprehensive kinetic analysis, revealing the substrate tolerance and enzyme specific activities of 13 human sialyltransferases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human sialyltransferases primarily utilize CMP-Sias, especially transferring Neu5Ac from CMP-Neu5Ac to various acceptors. Advances in chemical biology have led to the synthesis of novel CMP-Sia donors suitable for bioorthogonal reactions in cell-based assays. However, the compatibility of these donors with all human enzymes remains uncertain. We synthesized a non-natural CMP-Sia donor with an alkyne modification on the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl group of Neu5Ac, which was effectively used by human ST6Gal&#8197;I and ST3Gal&#8197;I. A sensitive MicroPlate Sialyltransferase Assay (MPSA) was developed and expanded to a panel of 13 human STs acting on glycoproteins. All assayed enzymes tolerated CMP-SiaNAl, allowing for the determination of kinetic parameters and turnover numbers. This study enhances the biochemical characterization of human sialyltransferases and opens new avenues for developing sialyltransferase inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular conductive hydrogels attract significant interest for their fibrous architecture and high water content, which mimic the extracellular matrix and integrate the benefits of electrical components, making them suitable for electrogenic tissue engineering. This review highlights recent advances in supramolecular conductive hydrogels, emphasizing their applications in cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering while outlining future development opportunities in this innovative field.







Abstract
Owing to their unique attributes, including reversibility, specificity, directionality, and tunability, supramolecular biomaterials have evolved as an excellent alternative to conventional biomaterials like polymers, ceramics, and metals. Supramolecular hydrogels, in particular, have garnered significant interest because their fibrous architecture, high water content, and interconnected 3D network resemble the extracellular matrix to some extent. Consequently, supramolecular hydrogels have been used to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. Supramolecular conductive hydrogels combine the advantages of supramolecular soft materials with the electrical properties of metals, making them highly relevant for electrogenic tissue engineering. Given the versatile applications of these hydrogels, it is essential to periodically review high&#8208;quality research in this area. In this review, we focus on recent advances in supramolecular conductive hydrogels, particularly their applications in tissue engineering. We discuss the conductive components of these hydrogels and highlight notable reports on their use in cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering. Additionally, we outline potential future developments in this field.

         <title>Distinct Effects of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein Segments on Structural Stability, Amyloidogenic Potential, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigated the structural properties and amyloidogenic implications of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein segment SK9, demonstrating that its intrinsically disordered nature facilitates rapid amyloid formation and acceleration of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation, while rationally engineered variants with stable secondary structures abolished these pathogenic effects, which suggest the importance of preserving structural disorder in viral&#8208;derived peptides for developing potential therapeutic interventions targeting protein&#8208;protein interactions and aggregation against viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
Amyloidosis is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins, called amyloid fibrils, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. Recent studies on the amyloidogenesis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protein segments have raised concerns on their potential link to post&#8208;infection neurodegeneration, however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the structure, stability, and amyloidogenic propensity of a nine&#8208;residue segment (SK9) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein and their impact on neuronal protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) aggregation. Specifically, the amino acid sequence of the SK9 wildtype has been modified from a basic and positively charged peptide (SFYVYSRVK), to a nearly neutral and more hydrophobic peptide (SAAVASAVK, labelled as SK9 var1), and to an acidic and negatively charged peptide (SDAVANAVK, labelled as SK9 var2). Our findings reveal that the SK9 wildtype exhibited a pronounced amyloidogenic propensity due to its disordered and unstable nature, while the SK9 variants possessed more ordered and stable structures preventing the amyloid formation. Significantly, the SK9 wildtype demonstrated distinct effect on &#945;Syn aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology to facilitate the formation of &#945;Syn aggregates with enhanced resistance against enzymatic degradation. This study highlights the potential of modifying short peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune their properties, providing insights into understanding and regulating viral&#8208;induced amyloid aggregations.

Discover the potential of d&#8208;Galacturonic acid and l&#8208;Arabinose in different industries. These monosaccharides are rich in sugar beet pulp biomass and can be used to prepare bioactive compounds, personal care products, building blocks and more.







Abstract
This review provides a perspective on the industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp (SBP) derived monosaccharides. The broad application of these monosaccharides could contribute to bio&#8208;based alternatives and sustainable practices, essential for the transition towards a more circular economy. This review focuses on the utilization and application of two SBP monosaccharides, d&#8208;galacturonic acid (d&#8208;GalA) and l&#8208;arabinose (l&#8208;Ara), derived from pectin and hemicellulose. These polysaccharides are major components of sugar beet pulp, an important side stream of sucrose production. d&#8208;GalA and l&#8208;Ara are therefore abundant in biomass and offer unique molecular structures amenable to selective chemical or enzymatic modifications. We review their application in various industrial applications such as the development and production of bioactive compounds, home and personal care products, and other industries.

         <title>Reprogramming of Glucose Metabolism for Revisiting Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resistance to Transcatheter Hepatic Arterial Chemoembolization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic&#8208;based drug delivery systems and innovative treatment strategies hold significant promise in overcoming the challenges associated with transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. By targeting the unique metabolic pathways of cancer cells, these approaches can enhance therapeutic efficacy, improve drug distribution, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes in TACE resistance.







Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is recognized globally as one of the most lethal tumors, presenting a significant menace to patients&#8217; lives owing to its exceptional aggressiveness and tendency to recur. Transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy, as a first&#8208;line treatment option for patients with advanced HCC, has been proven effective. However, it is disheartening that nearly 40&#8201;% of patients exhibit resistance to this therapy. Consequently, this review delves into the metabolic aspects of glucose metabolism to explore the underlying mechanisms behind TACE treatment resistance and to propose potentially fruitful therapeutic strategies. The ultimate objective is to present novel insights for the development of personalized treatment methods targeting HCC.

         <title>Mechanistic Perspective on Oxygen Activation Chemistry by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze crucial chemical reactions. Oxygen activation typically occurs at two sites on flavin: the C4a site, generating flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H), which is responsible for hydroxylation, halogenation, dehalogenation, and Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, and the N5 site, forming flavin&#8208;N5OOH, which functions as a nucleophile or base, facilitating nonoxidative C&#8722;X (X=N, S, Cl) bond cleavage and oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze a panoply of chemical transformations essential for living organisms. Through oxygen activation, flavoenzymes could generate diverse flavin&#8208;oxygen species that mediate numerous redox and non&#8208;redox transformations. In this review, we highlight the extensive oxygen activation chemistry at two sites of the flavin cofactor: C4a and N5 sites. Oxygen activation at the C4a site generates flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H) species for various monooxygenation reactions, while activation at the N5 site produces negatively charged flavin&#8208;N5OOH species, which act as highly reactive nucleophiles or bases. The selective oxygen activation at either the C4a or N5 site depends on the nature of substrates and is controlled by the active site architecture. These insights have expanded our understanding of oxygen activation chemistry in flavoenzymes and will serve as a foundation for future efforts in enzyme engineering and redesign.

&lt;p&gt;Flavin-dependent enzymes catalyze a panoply of chemical transformations essential for living organisms. Through oxygen activation, flavoenzymes could generate diverse flavin-oxygen species that mediate numerous redox and non-redox transformations. In this review, we highlight the extensive oxygen activation chemistry at two sites of the flavin cofactor: C4a and N5 sites. Oxygen activation at the C4a site generates flavin-C4aOO(H) species for various monooxygenation reactions, while activation at the N5 site produces negatively charged flavin-N5OOH species, which act as highly reactive nucleophiles or bases. The selective oxygen activation at either the C4a or N5 site depends on the nature of substrates and is controlled by the active site architecture. These insights have expanded our understanding of oxygen activation chemistry in flavoenzymes and will serve as a foundation for future efforts in enzyme engineering and redesign.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Geranylation of Cyclic Dipeptides and Naphthols by the Fungal Prenyltransferase CdpC3PT_F253G</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The F253G mutation of CdpC3PT exhibited enhanced catalytic efficiency in geranylation of cyclic dipeptides and naphthols. The mutant's reaction specificity is towards C7&#8208;geranylation of cyclic dipeptides, while 1&#8208;naphthol and its derivatives were converted into C4&#8208;geranylated products. Furthermore, five geranylated products (2G1 and 4G1&#8211;7G1) displayed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values ranging from 4 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/mL, surpassing their non&#8208;geranylated precursors. This research broadens the range of geranyl&#8208;modifying biocatalysts and highlights the potential for developing efficient or functionally modified biocatalysts.







Abstract
Prenyl modification often improves the biological activities of compounds. Prenyltransferases have attracted attention as environmentally friendly biocatalysts for catalyzing prenyl modification of compounds. Compared to dimethylallyl modifications, research on geranyl modifications is relatively limited. To enrich biocatalytic toolboxes for generating potentially bioactive geranylated derivatives, this study developed methodologies to synthesize two types of geranylated compounds, i.&#8201;e., geranylated tryptophan&#8208;containing cyclic dipeptides and geranylated naphthols, employing the F253G mutant of CdpC3PT, a cyclic dipeptide prenyltransferase from Neosartorya fischeri. The cyclic dipeptides (1&#8211;3) were transformed into C7&#8208;geranylated products (1G1&#8211;3G1), whereas 1&#8208;naphthol (4) and derivatives (5&#8211;6) yielded C4&#8208;geranylated products (4G1&#8211;6G1) and 2,7&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (7) generated a C3&#8208;geranylated product (7G1). All seven substrates and their geranylated products underwent antibacterial efficacy testing against Bacillus subtilis. Among them, five geranylated compounds (2G1 and 4G1&#8211;7G1) demonstrated antibacterial efficacies against Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values ranging from 4 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/mL, surpassing their non&#8208;geranylated precursors. This research broadens the tools of geranyl&#8208;modifying biocatalysts, illustrates a case for developing highly efficient or function&#8208;altered biocatalysts and showcases the potential of prenyltransferases in the biosynthesis of bioactive small molecules.

         <title>Marker&#8208;Dependent Cleavage of RNA by Binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz) and Binary DNA Machines (BiDM)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA&#8208;based constructions called binary DNAzyme machines are activated by binding cancer marker strand following by binding targeted RNA by Arms 1, 2, 3 and 4 and cleaving it. Binary DNAzyme machines can cleave certain RNA targets with higher affinity and selectivity than optimized DNAzyme constructions that use only Arms 1 and 2.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) can be used to suppress specific RNA in cells and thus has been explored for gene therapy. Despite extensive effort, there is no clinically significant OGT for treating cancer. Low efficiency of OGT is one of the problems. Earlier, we proposed to address this problem by suppressing the most vital genes in cancer cells e.&#8201;g. housekeeping genes. To achieve specific activation of the OGT agents in cancer but not in normal cells, we designed a binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz) activated by cancer&#8208;related nucleic acid sequences. This work is devoted to BiDz optimization for efficient cleavage of structured RNA targets upon activation with a cancer marker&#8208;related sequence. To achieve efficient binding of folded RNA, the BiDz was equipped with RNA binding/unwinding arms to produce &#8216;Binary DNA&#8208;nanomachines&#8217; (BiDM). It was demonstrated that BiDM can improve both the rate and selectivity of RNA cleavage in comparison with BiDz. For the best selectivity, single&#8208;nucleotide variations should be recognized by the strand detached from the common DNA scaffold of BiDM. Further development of DNA nanotechnology&#8208;inspired agents can advance OGT in treating cancer, viral infections, and genetic disorders.

         <title>ER Oxidoreductin 1&#8208;Like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Drives Protein Disulfide Isomerase in an Electron Relay System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) &#8211; a typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;resident oxidoreductase &#8211; donates electrons to O2 via ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), turning its own catalytic cycle to promote oxidative folding. This study showed that cyclic diselenides imitate Ero1 activity, enhancing PDI function and hence promoting PDI&#8208;catalyzed folding of drug&#8208;related proteins, including insulin.







Abstract
Disulfide formation generally involves a two&#8208;electron oxidation reaction between cysteine residues. Additionally, disulfide formation is an essential post&#8208;translational modification for the structural maturation of proteins. This oxidative folding is precisely controlled by an electron relay network constructed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), with a CGHC sequence as the redox&#8208;active site, and its family enzymes. Creating reagents that mimic the functions of these enzymes facilitates folding during chemical protein synthesis. In this study, we aimed to imitate a biological electron relay system using cyclic diselenide compounds as surrogates for endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), which is responsible for the re&#8208;oxidation of PDI. Oxidized PDI (PDIox) introduces disulfide bonds into substrate proteins, resulting in its conversion to reduced PDI (PDIred). The PDIred is then re&#8208;oxidized to PDIox by a coexisting cyclic diselenide compound, thereby restoring the function of PDI as a disulfide&#8208;forming agent. The produced diselenol state is readily oxidized to the original diselenide state with molecular oxygen, continuously sustaining the PDI catalytic cycle. This artificial electron relay system regulating enzymatic PDI function effectively promotes the oxidative folding of disulfide&#8208;containing proteins, such as insulin &#8211; a hypoglycemic formulation &#8211; by enhancing both yield and reaction velocity.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;based Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, as favorable molecular tools, offer novel insights into immune checkpoint research. Here, we aim to provide a review for the potential of aptamers in developing immune therapeutic strategies and investigating molecular mechanisms.







Abstract
Cancer has long been a significant threat to human life and health. The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer&#8208;induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, which possess the same specificity and affinity as antibodies, are advantageous due to their synthetic accessibility and ease of modification, providing novel insights for immune checkpoint research. In this review, we outline the key aptamers currently developed for immune checkpoints such as CTLA&#8208;4, PD&#8208;1, PD&#8722;L1 and Siglec&#8208;15. We explore their potential in therapeutic strategies, including functionalizing or engineering aptamers for covalent binding, valency control, and nanostructure assembly, as well as investigating molecular mechanisms such as glycosylated protein functions and cell&#8208;cell interactions. Finally, the future applications of aptamers in immunotherapy are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer has long been a significant threat to human life and health. The advent of immune checkpoint blockade strategies has reversed cancer-induced immune suppression, advanced the development of immunotherapy, and offered new hope in the fight against cancer. Aptamers, which possess the same specificity and affinity as antibodies, are advantageous due to their synthetic accessibility and ease of modification, providing novel insights for immune checkpoint research. In this review, we outline the key aptamers currently developed for immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4, PD-1, PD&#8722;L1 and Siglec-15. We explore their potential in therapeutic strategies, including functionalizing or engineering aptamers for covalent binding, valency control, and nanostructure assembly, as well as investigating molecular mechanisms such as glycosylated protein functions and cell-cell interactions. Finally, the future applications of aptamers in immunotherapy are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving CsOAC Activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Directed Production of Olivetolic Acid through Rational Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. If the substrate is not catalyzed by the olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC), the by&#8208;product olivetol (OL) is formed. Following an in silico rational design, protein variants were evaluated regarding for OA and OL production in&#8197;vivo using S. cerevisiae. The G82&#8197;A/L92Y variant showed a successful shift towards OA.







Abstract
Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. It is produced through a unique interaction between the two proteins, olivetol synthase (CsOLS) and olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC). When the OA biosynthesis is transferred to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, olivetol (OL) is produced as a side product, even with a high enhancement of copy number of CsOAC. In order to increase the OA titer while decreasing the OL titer in S. cerevisiae, rational design was applied to CsOAC using in silico approaches such as protein&#8208;ligand docking to find potential protein variants. In vivo screening and also testing different approaches for both proteins was applied to identify the best performing variants of CsOAC. Four variants were identified that gave the desired properties. The best CsOAC variant, G82&#8197;A/L92Y, resulted in a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in OA production and a shift in the ratio between the two products towards OA.

         <title>Nanozymes as Antibacterial Agents: New Concerns in Design and Enhancement Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work enumerates new research concerns in designing antibacterial nanozymes with additional functionality or enhanced biosafety, presents non&#8208;redox nanozymes independent of highly toxic ROS and the nanozymes that combat non&#8208;common pathogenic bacteria, and reviews new enhancement strategies of using external physical (light, ultrasound) stimulation, extrinsic small molecule introduction, and various H2O2 self&#8208;supply strategies to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes.







Abstract
Nanozymes exhibiting natural enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities as antibacterial agents present several advantages, including high stability, low cost, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity, ease of preparation and storage, and minimal bacterial resistance. Consequently, they have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the rapid expansion of antimicrobial nanozyme research has resulted in pioneering reviews that do not comprehensively address emerging concerns and enhancement strategies within this field. This paper first summarizes the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of nanozymes; subsequently, we outline new research considerations for designing antibacterial nanozymes with enhanced functionality and biosafety features such as degradable, imageable, targeted, and bacterial&#8208;binding nanozymes as well as those capable of selectively targeting pathogenic bacteria while sparing normal cells and probiotics. Furthermore, we review novel enhancement strategies involving external physical stimuli (light or ultrasound), the introduction of extrinsic small molecules, and self&#8208;supplying H2O2 to enhance the activity of antibacterial nanozymes under physiological conditions characterized by low concentrations of H2O2 and O2. Additionally, we present non&#8208;redox nanozymes that operate independently of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) alongside those designed to combat less common pathogenic bacteria. Finally, we discuss current issues, challenges faced in the field, and future prospects for antibacterial nanozymes.

         <title>Computational Studies and Functional Validation of Eugenol and Ferulic Acid as Inhibitors of Against Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the binding of natural compounds to EfSrtA by computational and experimental methods. Computational studies reveal that the ligands interacted with the protein significantly. Further to confirm the results, an enzymatic assay and functional validation on bacterial growth are also reported. The study indicates that the ligands bind to EfSrtA with significant interactions and show promising results.







Abstract
Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is commonly occurring pathogen associated with nosocomial infections. Infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) nature and their tendency to form biofilms. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches to treatment. In this regard, targeting an important protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface&#8208;exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it's a promising drug target for the development of anti&#8208;microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development. To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have expressed and purified E. faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA&#916;N59). Structural studies using homology modelling along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were also done. The results were confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti&#8208;biofilm assays and inhibition assays of selected ligands were also done against E. faecalis individually and in synergistic combinations. Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to EfSrtA&#916;N59 with significant interactions and show promising results.

         <title>Multidrug Resistance Reversed by Maleimide Interactions. A Biological and Synthetic Overview for an Emerging Field</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidrug resistance is the new big menace of the century and must be tackled, but in order to do so, we must understand how it works and what has been done about it. Herein we explore the main molecular mechanism focusing on cancer, and in the big future prospect for its treatment, maleimide, the chemical building block that could.







Abstract
Multidrug Resistance (MDR) can be considered one of the most frightening adaptation types in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and eukaryotic cells. It allows the organisms to survive the attack of many drugs used in the daily basis. This forces the development of new and more complex, highly specific drugs to fight diseases. Given the high usage of medicaments, poor variation in active chemical cores, and self&#8208;medication, the appearance of MDR is more frequent each time, and has been established as a serious medical and social problem. Over the years it has been possible the identification of several genes and proteins responsible for MDR and with that the development of blockers of them to reach MDR reversion and try to avoid a global problem. These mechanisms also have been observed in cancer cells, and several calcium channel blockers have been successful in MDR reversion, and the maleimide can be found included in them. In this review, we explore particularly the tree main proteins involved in cancer chemoresistance, MRP1 (encoded by ABCC1), BCRP (encoded by ABCG2) and P&#8208;gp (encoded by ABCB1). The participation of P&#8208;gp is remarkably important, and several aspects of its regulations are discussed. Additionally, we address the history, mechanisms, reversion efforts, and we specifically focused on the maleimide synthesis as MDR&#8208;reversers in co&#8208;administration, as well as on how their biological applications are imperative to expand the available information and explore a very plausible MDR reversion source.
