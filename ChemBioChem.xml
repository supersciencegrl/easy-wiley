         <title>Discovery of Two Novel Oxidases Using a High&#8208;Throughput Activity Screen</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In search of novel enzymatic activities: Application of a high&#8208;throughput activity screening platform has led to the discovery of two novel enzymes: N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;hexosamine oxidase, a previously orphan enzyme, and a novel type of long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase, a non&#8208;homologous isofunctional enzyme (NISE) to known enzymes with this activity.







Abstract
Discovery of novel enzymes is a challenging task, yet a crucial one, due to their increasing relevance as chemical catalysts and biotechnological tools. In our work we present a high&#8208;throughput screening approach to discovering novel activities. A screen of 96 putative oxidases with 23 substrates led to the discovery of two new enzymes. The first enzyme, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;hexosamine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.29) from Ralstonia solanacearum, is a vanillyl alcohol oxidase&#8208;like flavoprotein displaying the highest activity with N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. Before our discovery of the enzyme, its activity was an orphan one &#8208; experimentally characterized but lacking the link to amino acid sequence. The second enzyme, from an uncultured marine euryarchaeota, is a long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase (LCAO, EC 1.1.3.20) active with a range of fatty alcohols, with 1&#8208;dodecanol being the preferred substrate. The enzyme displays no sequence similarity to previously characterised LCAOs, and thus is a completely novel representative of a protein with such activity.

         <title>The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Yariv reagents are a class of tris&#8208;azo dyes, some of which stain and precipitate arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), plant cell wall proteoglycans. These dyes form supramolecular aggregates in solution. In this study, CD spectroscopy revealed that the aggregates exhibit helical chirality. Only those aggregates with right&#8208;handed helicity have a fertile interaction with AGP, while those with left&#8208;handed helicity do not bind. Artwork credit: D. Caianiello and M. Bohne. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Basu et&#8197;al.

         <title>(R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine as a 19F NMR Probe for the Monitoring of Protease Digestion of Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A useful fluorinated NMR probe: &#945;&#8208;Quaternarized (R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) is a good tool for providing convenient and accurate 19F NMR&#8208;based monitoring of trypsin proteolytic activity and increases resistance towards pepsin degradation.







Abstract
Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are useful tools for improving the bioavailability of peptides but can also serve as fluorinated probes in 19F NMR&#8208;based enzymatic assays. We report herein that the use of the non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;quaternarized (R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine ((R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) provides convenient and accurate monitoring of trypsin proteolytic activity and increases resistance towards pepsin degradation.

         <title>Strong and Specific Recognition of CAG/CTG Repeat DNA (5&#8217;&#8208;dWGCWGCW&#8208;3&#8217;) by a Cyclic Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide, which binds to the CAG/CTG repeat sequence with high specificity and affinity, is reported.







Abstract
Abnormally expanded CAG/CTG repeat DNA sequences lead to a variety of neurological diseases, such as Huntington's disease. Here, we synthesized a cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide (cPIP), which can bind to the minor groove of the CAG/CTG DNA sequence. The double&#8208;stranded DNA melting temperature (Tm) and surface plasmon resonance assays revealed the high binding affinity of the cPIP. In addition, next&#8208;generation sequencing showed that the cPIP had high specificity for its target DNA sequence.

         <title>Galacto&#8208;oligosaccharide Supplementation Modulates Pathogen&#8208;Commensal Competition between Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus salivarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The members of the infant microbiome are governed by feeding choice (breastmilk vs. formula). Regardless of feeding choice, a competitive growth advantage can be provided to commensals through prebiotics &#8208; either human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) or plant oligosaccharides that are supplemented into formula. To characterize how prebiotics modulate commensal &#8211; pathogen interactions, we have designed and studied a minimal microbiome where a pathogen,&#160;  Streptococcus agalactiae&#160;  engages with a commensal,&#160;  Streptococcus salivarius  . We discovered that while&#160;  S. agalactiae  suppresses the growth of&#160;  S. salivarius  &#160;via increased lactic acid production, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation reverses the effect. This result has major implications in characterizing how single species survive in the gut, what niche they occupy, and how they engage with other community members.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting the Central Pocket of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen that produces two lectins, LecA and LecB, as part of its large arsenal of virulence factors. Both carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are central to the initial and later persistent infection processes, i.e. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The biofilm matrix is a major resistance determinant and protects the bacteria against external threats such as the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the development of drugs against the P. aeruginosa biofilm is of particular interest to restore efficacy of antimicrobials. Carbohydrate&#8208;based inhibitors for LecA and LecB were previously shown to efficiently reduce biofilm formations. Here, we report a new approach for inhibiting LecA with synthetic molecules bridging the established carbohydrate&#8208;binding site and a central cavity located between two LecA protomers of the lectin tetramer. Inspired by in silico design, we synthesized various galactosidic LecA inhibitors with aromatic moities targeting this central pocket. These compounds reached low micromolar affinities, validated in different biophysical assays. Finally, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the interactions of this compound class with LecA. This new mode of action paves the way to a novel route towards inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilms.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembling Properties and Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells of Chemically Synthesized Mannosylerythritol Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), which are one of the representative sugar&#8208;based biosurfactants (BSs) produced by microorganisms, have attracted much attention in various fields in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) era. However, they are inseparable mixtures with respect to the chain length of the fatty acids. In this study, self&#8208;assembling properties and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of recovery effects on damaged skin cells using chemically synthesized MELs were investigated. It was revealed, for the first time, that synthetic and homogeneous MELs exhibited significant self&#8208;assembling properties to form droplets or giant vesicles. In addition, a small difference in the length of the fatty acid chains of the MELs significantly affected their recovery effects on the damaged skin cells. MELs with medium or longer length alkyl chains exhibited much higher recovery effects than that of C18&#8208;ceramide NP.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Linear dsDNA Tagging Using Deoxyuridine Excision**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3214-3224, November 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular barcoding is used to tag nucleic acids with sequence&#8208;encoded identifiers to distinguish between different samples or individual molecules. I describe a one&#8208;pot procedure for efficiently tagging linear dsDNA with molecular barcodes. This approach has potential utility for high&#8208;throughput in&#8197;vitro biochemical experiments that require uniform and quantitative dsDNA tagging.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific strategies for exchanging segments of dsDNA are important for DNA library construction and molecular tagging. Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3&#8217; ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi&#8208;base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT&#8594;dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non&#8208;perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called deoxyUridine eXcision&#8208;tagging (dUX&#8208;tagging), is an efficient one&#8208;pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3&#8217; overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5&#8217; overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX&#8208;tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX&#8208;tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high&#8208;efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3208-3213, November 16, 2021. </description>

Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs allows efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The method will make existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies to probe and manipulate proteins in live cells accessible in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models.







Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized studies on human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac&#8208;mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to an amber stop codon. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA&#8208;bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site&#8208;directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC&#8208;derived cell types and complex tissue models.

         <title>Discovery, Biocatalytic Exploration and Structural Analysis of a 4&#8208;Ethylphenol Oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis</title>

Gc4EO, a new member of the VAO/PCMH family from the actinobacteria Gulosibacter chungangensis was discovered. This oxidase is a very appealing biocatalyst for the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylphenols, exhibiting high conversion yields with an attractive chemoselectivity towards the production of alkenes. Gc4EO showed high activity to produce 4&#8208;vinylphenol, an interesting building block for the synthesis of polyvinylphenol.







Abstract
The vanillyl&#8208;alcohol oxidase (VAO) family is a rich source of biocatalysts for the oxidative bioconversion of phenolic compounds. Through genome mining and sequence comparisons, we found that several family members lack a generally conserved catalytic aspartate. This finding led us to study a VAO&#8208;homolog featuring a glutamate residue in place of the common aspartate. This 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis (Gc4EO) shares 42&#8201;% sequence identity with VAO from Penicillium simplicissimum, contains the same 8&#945;&#8208;N3&#8208;histidyl&#8208;bound FAD and uses oxygen as electron acceptor. However, Gc4EO features a distinct substrate scope and product specificity as it is primarily effective in the dehydrogenation of para&#8208;substituted phenols with little generation of hydroxylated products. The three&#8208;dimensional structure shows that the characteristic glutamate side chain creates a closely packed environment that may limit water accessibility and thereby protect from hydroxylation. With its high thermal stability, well defined structural properties and high expression yields, Gc4EO may become a catalyst of choice for the specific dehydrogenation of phenolic compounds bearing small substituents.

Metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) were designed and synthesized that self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. The obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell membranes to improve their stability and dispersity.

To overcome high toxicity, low bioavailability and poor water solubility of chemotherapeutics, a variety of drug carriers have been designed. However, most carriers are severely limited by low drug loading capacity and adverse side e&#64256;ects. Here, a new type of metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) was designed and synthesized. The MDNs self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. To assist systemic delivery and prolong circulation time, the obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell (RBCs) membranes (RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs) to improve their stability and dispersity. The RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs presented pH&#8208;responsive release functionalities, resulting in drug release accelerated in acidic tumor microenvironments. The outstanding in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor therapeutic outcome was realized by RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs. This study provides an innovative design guideline for chemotherapy and demonstrates the great capacity of nanomaterials in anticancer treatments.

Site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;amino acylation of proteins with N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;HisTags using 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone (6AGDL) is reported. To demonstrate the usefulness of this reaction, we multimerise the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) protein antigen onto virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). The resulting COVID&#8208;19 vaccine candidate induces single&#8208;shot seroconversion, and virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies in mice.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific protein modifications are vital for biopharmaceutical drug development. Gluconoylation is a non&#8208;enzymatic, post&#8208;translational modification of N&#8208;terminal HisTags. We report high&#8208;yield, site&#8208;selective in&#8197;vitro &#945;&#8208;aminoacylation of peptides, glycoproteins, antibodies, and virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) with azidogluconolactone at pH&#8197;7.5 in 1&#8197;h. Conjugates slowly hydrolyse, but diol&#8208;masking with borate esters inhibits reversibility. In an example, we multimerise azidogluconoylated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) onto VLPs via click&#8208;chemistry, to give a COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. Compared to yeast antigen, HEK&#8208;derived RBD was immunologically superior, likely due to observed differences in glycosylation. We show the benefits of ordered over randomly oriented multimeric antigen display, by demonstrating single&#8208;shot seroconversion and best virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies. Azidogluconoylation is simple, fast and robust chemistry, and should accelerate research and development.

Inclusion in cells: Supramolecular porphyrin/per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin complexation is highly specific. Per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin bearing cell&#8208;penetrating peptide and BODIPY is efficiently taken up by cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways and delivers porphyrin into the cells. The supramolecular complexation in cells was directly detected by FRET between porphyrin and BODIPY.







Abstract
Artificial supramolecular systems capable of self&#8208;assembly and that precisely function in biological media are in high demand. Herein, we demonstrate a highly specific host&#8208;guest&#8208;pair system that functions in living cells. A per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative (R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe) bearing both an octaarginine peptide chain and a BODIPY dye was synthesized as a fluorescent intracellular delivery tool. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe was efficiently taken up by HeLa cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) as a guest molecule in water, from which fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe to TPPS was observed. The FRET phenomenon was clearly detected in living cells using confocal microscopy techniques, which revealed that the formed supramolecular R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe/TPPS complex was maintained within the cells. The R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe cytotoxicity assay revealed that the addition of TPPS counteracts the strong cytotoxicity (IC50=16&#8197;&#956;M) of the CD cavity due to complexation within the cells. A series of experiments demonstrated the bio&#8208;orthogonality of the supramolecular per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD/tetraarylporphyrin host&#8208;guest pair in living cells.

Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs enables efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The cover feature demonstrates how PylT recodes an amber stop codon within a GFP reporter to direct site&#8208;specific incorporation of an ncAA, leading to GFP fluorescence throughout the organoid, as visible by light&#8208;sheet microscopy. The method will help to implement existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies for probing and manipulating proteins in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. van&#8197;Husen et&#8197;al.

This picture shows the 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) motif which chelates the zinc ion of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). To identify non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases, the TFMAL motif was discovered by screening a metal chelator chemical library. Subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design led to the discovery of compounds that exhibit sufficient HDAC6 inhibitory activity and selectivity in both in vitro and in cellulo experiments. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Suzuki et&#8197;al.

         <title>Recent Advances in Light Energy Conversion with Biomimetic Vesicle Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3140-3147, November 16, 2021. </description>

Vesicles can be used for the compartmentalization of chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembly of reaction partners. This minireview highlights recent advances in biomimetic and light&#8208;induced energy conversions with liposomes and polymersomes, relevant in the context of energy transfer, electron transfer, photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable self&#8208;assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane&#8208;facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer. The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer&#8208;membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light&#8208;driven reactions.

Fluorescent probes play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of molecular science. This review provides an overview of the methods used to discover fluorescent natural products, beginning with classical synthetic approaches. Here, lessons are presented that provide modern examples for classical methods and identify new classics that chart novel avenues for probe discovery. The central focus of this work embodies an understanding of the fundamental properties that guide the development of fluorescent probes and the challenges within their design.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes have gained profound use in biotechnology, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, molecular and cell biology. The development of methods for the translation of fluorophores into fluorescent probes continues to be a robust field for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists, alike. Access to new experimental designs has enabled molecular diversification and led to the identification of new approaches to probe discovery. This review provides a synopsis of the recent lessons in modern fluorescent probe discovery.

         <title>Probing the Role of Chirality in Phospholipid Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3148-3157, November 16, 2021. </description>

Molecular handedness, or chirality, can determine the nature of molecular interactions. A key feature of life is the homochirality of biological molecules, including phospholipids. Chemical probes have been used to understand stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes, which has been applied to the development of safer therapeutics and selective chemical tools.







Abstract
Nucleotides, amino acids, sugars, and lipids are almost ubiquitously homochiral within individual cells on Earth. While oligonucleotides and proteins exist as one natural chirality throughout the tree of life, two stereoisomers of phospholipids have separately emerged in archaea and bacteria, an evolutionary divergence known as &#8220;the lipid divide&#8221;. Within this review, we focus on the emergence of phospholipid homochirality and compare the stability of synthetic homochiral and heterochiral membranes in&#8197;vitro. We discuss chemical probes designed to study the stereospecific interactions of lipid membranes in&#8197;vitro. Overall, we aim to highlight studies that help elucidate the determinants of stereospecific interactions between lipids, peptides, and small molecule ligands. Continued work in understanding the drivers of favorable interactions between chiral molecules and biological membranes will lead to the design of increasingly selective chemical tools for bioorthogonal labeling of lipid membranes and safer membrane&#8208;associating pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Modular Design of Supramolecular Ionic Peptides with Cell&#8208;Selective Membrane Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3164-3168, November 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly designed cationic peptides having low membrane activity undergo cell&#8208;specific enzyme triggered chemical transformation and self&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular cationic clusters with enhanced membrane activity. The cell&#8208;selective membrane activity by in&#8197;situ formed peptide assembly is a highly desirable feature for targeted molecular imaging and therapy.







Abstract
The rational design of materials with cell&#8208;selective membrane activity is an effective strategy for the development of targeted molecular imaging and therapy. Here we report a new class of cationic multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated molecular transformation followed by supramolecular assembly to form nanofibers in which cationic clusters are presented on a rigid &#946;&#8208;sheet backbone. This structural transformation, which is induced by cells overexpressing the specific enzymes, led to a shift in the membrane perturbation potential of the MDPs, and consequently enhanced cell uptake and drug delivery efficacy. We envision the directed self&#8208;assembly based on modularly designed MDPs as a highly promising approach to generate dynamic supramolecular nanomaterials with emerging membrane activity for a range of disease targeted molecular imaging and therapy applications.

         <title>Structural Basis of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diene Forming Acyl&#8208;Coenzyme A Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3173-3177, November 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the biocatalytic repertoire: Canonical acyl&#8208;coenzyme dehydrogenases catalyze the 1,2&#8208;dehydrogenation of aliphatic thioesters in a highly conserved manner with a invariant glutamate serving as catalytic base and a flavin as hydride acceptor. By removal of this glutamate and positioning of a novel aspartate base at C3, an 1,4 dehydrogenation activity is achieved, thereby generating a cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building block.







Abstract
The biologically important, FAD&#8208;containing acyl&#8208;coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenases (ACAD) usually catalyze the anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination of a proton and a hydride of aliphatic CoA thioesters. Here, we report on the structure and function of an ACAD from anaerobic bacteria catalyzing the unprecedented 1,4&#8208;elimination at C3 and C6 of cyclohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1CoA) to cyclohex&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1,5CoA) and at C3 and C4 of the latter to benzoyl&#8208;CoA. Based on high&#8208;resolution Ch1CoA dehydrogenase crystal structures, the unorthodox reactivity is explained by the presence of a catalytic aspartate base (D91) at C3, and by eliminating the catalytic glutamate base at C1. Moreover, C6 of Ch1CoA and C4 of Ch1,5CoA are positioned towards FAD&#8208;N5 to favor the biologically relevant C3,C6&#8208; over the C3,C4&#8208;dehydrogenation activity. The C1,C2&#8208;dehydrogenation activity was regained by structure&#8208;inspired amino acid exchanges. The results provide the structural rationale for the extended catalytic repertoire of ACADs and offer previously unknown biocatalytic options for the synthesis of cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building blocks.

Non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors: We identified isoindoline compounds bearing 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel zinc binding group by screening a compound library and the subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design (SBDD). The identified inhibitor exhibited potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced Treg cell differentiation.







Abstract
Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer and immunological diseases. Most of the previously reported HDAC6 inhibitors have a hydroxamate group as a zinc binding group (ZBG), which coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion of HDAC6. The hydroxamate group is liable to metabolically generate mutagenetic hydroxylamine; therefore, non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors would be advantageous. In this study, to identify novel non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors, screening of a chemical library and the subsequent structural optimization were performed, which led to the identification of HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel ZBG. The identified inhibitor showed potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation.

         <title>Engineering Leifsonia Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Thermostability and Catalytic Efficiency by Enhancing Subunit Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3178-3183, November 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the subunit interface of Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) yielded thermostability, and catalytic efficiency significantly improved in the mutant T100R/S148I. T100R/S148I can efficiently convert various ketone substrates into nearly optically pure chiral alcohols at elevated temperature in a very low enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;500).







Abstract
Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) is a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. However, limitations of wild&#8208;type LnADH observed for practical application include low activity and poor stability. In this work, protein engineering was employed to improve its thermostability and catalytic efficiency by altering the subunit interfaces. Residues T100 and S148 were identified to be significant for thermostability and activity, and the melting temperature (&#916;Tm) and catalytic efficiency of the mutant T100R/S148I toward ketone substrates was improved by 18.7&#8201;&#176;C and 1.8&#8211;5.5&#8208;fold. Solving the crystal structures of the wild&#8208;type enzyme and T100R/S148L revealed beneficial effects of mutations on stability and catalytic activity. The most robust mutant T100R/S148I is promising for industrial applications and can produce 200&#8197;g&#8201;liter&#8722;1&#8201;day&#8722;1 chiral alcohols at 50&#8201;&#176;C by only a 1&#8201;:&#8201;500 ratio of enzyme to substrate.

         <title>Identification of the Catalytic Residues in the Cyclase Domain of the Class IV Lanthipeptide Synthetase SgbL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 22, Page 3169-3172, November 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL were identified and validated in this study. It was demonstrated how each of these residues is crucial for the formation of the methyllanthionine &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks from Cys thiols and dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine residues in the modified globisporin precursor peptide SgbA(S20T).







Abstract
Lanthipeptides belong to the family of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and are subdivided into different classes based on their processing enzymes. The three&#8208;domain class IV lanthipeptide synthetases (LanL enzymes) consist of N&#8208;terminal lyase, central kinase, and C&#8208;terminal cyclase domains. While the catalytic residues of the kinase domains (mediating ATP&#8208;dependent Ser/Thr phosphorylations) and the lyase domains (carrying out subsequent phosphoserine/phosphothreonine (pSer/pThr) eliminations to yield dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine (Dha/Dhb) residues) have been characterized previously, such studies are missing for LanL cyclase domains. To close this gap of knowledge, this study reports on the identification and validation of the catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL, which facilitate the nucleophilic attacks by Cys thiols on Dha/Dhb residues for the formation of &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Unprotected Dipeptides into Hydrogels: Water&#8208;Channels Make the Difference.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprotected dipeptides are attractive building blocks for environmentally&#8208;friendly hydrogel biomaterials in virtue of their low&#8208;cost and ease of preparation. This work investigates the self&#8208;assembling behavior of the distinct stereoisomers of Ile&#8208;Phe and Phe&#8208;Ile in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to form hydrogels, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), circular dichroism (CD), and oscillatory rheometry. Each peptide purity and identity was also confirmed by 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR and HPLC&#8208;MS. Finally, single&#8208;crystal XRD data allowed to reveal the key interactions responsible for the supramolecular packing into amphipathic layers or water&#8208;channels. Presence of the latter in the crystal structure is a distinctive feature of the only gelator of this work that self&#8208;organizes into stable hydrogels with fast kinetics and the highest elastic modulus amongst its structural isomers and stereoisomers.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160; NIR emitting cyanine probe with large Stokes&#8217; shift for mitochondria&#160; and&#160; identification of their mitochondria membrane potential disruption</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An NIR emitting (&#955;  em  &#8776; 730 nm) cyanine probe  ExCy  was synthesized in good yields by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length (i.e., with furan moiety) to the donor&#8208;accepter system.  ExCy  exhibited a large Stokes shift (&#916;&#955; &#8776; 100 nm) due to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and high fluorescence quantum yield (&#1092;  fl  &#8776; 0.47 in DCM).  Due to its low fluorescence in aqueous environment (&#1092;  fl  ~ 0.007 in H  2  O), the probe exhibited the potential of achieving a large fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon entering a hydrophobic cellular environment. &#160;Fluorescence confocal microscopy studies revealed that  ExCy  was readily excitable with a far&#8208;red laser line (i.e., 640 nm) while the corresponding emission was collected in the NIR region.  ExCy  exhibited an exceptional selectivity towards live cell mitochondria according to the co&#8208;localization studies. The probe also exhibited high photostability, long&#8208;term imaging ability and wash&#8208;free staining ability, when being applied to live cells. Our studies indicated that the mitochondrial localization of  ExCy  was dependent on the membrane potential of mitochondria. In this work,  ExCy  was successfully utilized as a mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction indicator to visually identify cells with mitochondrial dysfunction via fluorescence confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

In this work,  ExCy  was successfully utilized as a mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction indicator to visually identify cells with mitochondrial dysfunction via fluorescence confocal microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable and Selective &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis Catalyzed by Promiscuous l&#8208;Threonine Transaldolase ObiH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ObiH is an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase which catalyzes the diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. We have demonstrated the synthetic utility of this enzyme through preparative scale reactions to selectively generate a structurally diverse array of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, as well as downstream functionalization to generate important organic building blocks, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;keto acids.







Abstract
Enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways possess broad potential for the selective synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. However, the practical application of these enzymes for organic synthesis is dependent on the development of efficient, economical, operationally simple, and well&#8208;characterized systems for preparative scale reactions. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap for the selective biocatalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, which are important synthetic building blocks. To achieve this goal, we demonstrated the ability of ObiH, an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase, to achieve selective milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of a diverse array of non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs) using a scalable whole cell platform. We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids possessing broad functional&#8208;group diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ObiH&#8208;generated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids could be modified through additional transformations to access important motifs, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and substituted &#945;&#8208;keto acids.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural proteins are essential biomacromolecules that fulfill versatile functions in the living organism, such as their usage as cytoskeleton, nutriment transporter, homeostasis controller, catalyzer, or immune guarder. Due to the excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility/biodegradability, natural protein&#8208;based biomaterials are well equipped for prospective applications in various fields. Among these natural proteins, stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins&#160;can be reversibly and precisely manipulated on demand, rendering the protein&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for numerous applications, including disease detection, drug delivery, bio&#8208;sensing, and regenerative medicine. Therefore, we present some typical natural proteins with diverse physical stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, including temperature, light, force, electrical, and magnetical sensing in this review. The structure&#8208;function mechanism of these proteins is discussed in detail. Finally, we give a summary and perspective for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the indolizidine alkaloid iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in  Streptomyces  remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from  Streptomyces griseus  . The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total.  In vitro  analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl&#8208;CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular System for the Rapid Comparison of Different Membrane Anchors for Surface Display on Escherichia Coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Comparison of different membrane anchor motifs for the surface display of a protein of interest (passenger) is crucial to achieve the best possible performance. However, generating genetic fusions of the passenger to various membrane anchors is time&#8208;consuming. We herein employ a recently developed modular display system, in which the membrane anchor and the passenger are expressed separately and assembled  in situ  via SpyCatcher and SpyTag interaction, to readily combine a model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3) with four different membrane anchors (Lpp&#8208;OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA&#8208;I). This approach has the significant advantage that passengers and membrane anchors can be freely combined in a modular fashion without the need to generate direct genetic fusion constructs in each case. We demonstrate that the membrane anchors impact not only cell growth and membrane integrity, but also the BM3 surface display capacity and whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic activity. The previously used Lpp&#8208;OmpA as well as PgsA were found to be efficient for the display of BM3 via SpyCatcher/SpyTag interaction. Our strategy can be transferred to other user&#8208;defined anchor and passenger combinations and could thus be used for acceleration and improvement of various applications involving cell surface display.</dc:description>

         <title>The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 glutamine driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu triad: a computational study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was herein studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia&#8211;the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate(PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens.&#160;For this reason,Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases.
The results herein obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i) activation of Cys87, (ii) deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii) hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv) enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature(19.1&#8211;19.5 kcal mol&#8208;1) agrees very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step(18.2 kcal.mol&#8208;1), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site.
This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii)Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process.</dc:description>

Protein catalysts with varied levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions were generated using the same protein scaffold.







Abstract
Natural aldolase enzymes and created retro&#8208;aldolase protein catalysts often catalyze both aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions depending on the concentrations of the reactants and the products. Here, we report that the directionality of protein catalysts can be altered by replacing one amino acid. The protein catalyst derived from a scaffold of a previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst, catalyzed aldol reactions more efficiently than the previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst. The retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst efficiently catalyzed the retro&#8208;aldol reaction but was less efficient in catalyzing the aldol reaction. The results indicate that protein catalysts with varying levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions can be generated from the same protein scaffold.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Up Sugars: Glycosyltransferase Cross&#8208;Reactivity in Cancerous Tissues and Their Therapeutic Targeting</title>

         <dc:description>
Genetically incompatible and/or cryptic glycans can be expressed in cancer. In humans, both humoral and cellular natural immunity exists against these glycans. The fact that tumors expressing these glycans grow indicates that immunity is not strong enough. However, it can be enhanced by active/passive immunization, for example, using mini&#8208;transfusion of glycan&#8208;expressing red blood cells, which may have the potential to be used for novel cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
The main categories of glycan changes in cancer are: (1)&#8197;decreased expression of histo&#8208;blood group A and/or B antigens and increased Lewis&#8208;related antigens, (2)&#8197;appearance of cryptic antigens, such as Tn and T, (3)&#8197;emergence of genetically incompatible glycans, such as A antigen expressed in tumors of individuals of group B or O and heterophilic expression of Forssman antigen (FORS1), and (4)&#8197;appearance of neoglycans. This review focuses on the expression of genetically incompatible A/B/FORS1 antigens in cancer. Several possible molecular mechanisms are exemplified, including missense mutations that alter the sugar specificity of A and B glycosyltransferases (AT and BT, respectively), restoration of the correct codon reading frame of O alleles, and modification of acceptor specificity of AT to synthesize the FORS1 antigen by missense mutations and/or altered splicing. Taking advantage of pre&#8208;existing natural immunity, the potential uses of these glycans for immunotherapeutic targeting will also be discussed.

         <title>Selective capture of anti&#8208;N&#8208;glucosylated NTHi adhesin peptide antibodies by a multivalent dextran conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tentacle&#8208;like polymers decorated with several copies of peptide antigens can be interesting tools to increase the ability to capture circulating antibodies in patient sera, using cooperative effects for stronger avidity. We previously showed&#160;that antibodies from multiple sclerosis (MS) patient sera preferentially recognize hyperglucosylated adhesin protein HMW1 of non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) . We selected the C&#8208;terminal HMW1(1347&#8208;1354) minimal epitope and prepared the diglucosylated analogue Ac&#8208;KAN(Glc)VTLN(Glc)TTG&#8208;K(N 3 )&#8208;NH 2 to graft a 40 kDa dextran scaffold&#160;modified with glycidyl&#8208;propargyl moieties to perform a copper catalysed alkyne&#8208;azide coupling reaction (CuAAC). Quantitative NMR measurements allowed to characterize the peptide loading (19.5%) on the multivalent dextran conjugate. This novel polymeric structure displayed optimal capturing properties of both IgG and, more interestingly, IgM antibodies in MS sera. Specific antibodies from a representative MS serum, were successfully depleted using a sepharose resin bearing the new glucosylated multivalent conjugate, as confirmed by ELISA. These results may offer a promising proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the selective purification of high affinity autoantibodies from sera of patients affected by autoimmune patients, in general, and of specific high affinity antibodies against a minimal glycosylated epitope Asn(Glc) from sera of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in particular.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid estimation of membrane protein orientation in liposomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The topological organization of proteins embedded in biological membranes is crucial for the tight interplay between these enzymes and their accessibility to substrates in order to fulfil enzymatic activity. The orientation of a membrane protein reconstituted in artificial membranes depends on many parameters and is hardly predictable. Here, we present a convenient approach to assess this important property independent of the enzymatic activity of the reconstituted protein. Based on cysteine&#8208;specific chemical modification of a target membrane protein with a cyanine fluorophore and a corresponding membrane&#8208;impermeable fluorescence quencher, the novel strategy allows rapid evaluation of the distribution of the two orientations after reconstitution. The assay has been tested for the respiratory complexes bo3 oxidase and ATP synthase of Escherichia coli and the results agree well with other orientation determination approaches. Given the simple procedure, the proposed method is a powerful tool for optimization of reconstitution conditions or quantitative orientation information prior to functional measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding methylarginines and methyllysines as free amino acids: a comparative study of multiple host classes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylated free amino acids are an important class of targets for host&#8208;guest chemistry that have recognition properties distinct from those of methylated peptides and proteins. We present comparative binding studies for three different host classes that are each studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships. The hosts studied are all anionic and include three calixarenes, two acyclic cucurbiturils, and two other cleft&#8208;like hosts, a clip and a tweezer. We determined the binding association constants for a panel of methylated amino acids using indicator displacement assays. The acyclic cucurbiturils display stronger binding to the methylated amino acids, and some unique patterns of selectivity. The two other cleft&#8208;like hosts follow two different trends, shallow host (clip) following similar trends to the calixarenes, and the other more closed host (tweezer) binding certain less&#8208;methylated amino acids stronger than their methylated counterparts. Molecular modeling sheds some light on the different preferences of different hosts. The results identify hosts with new selectivities and with affinities in a range that could be useful for biomedical applications. The overall selectivity patterns are explained by a common framework that considers the geometry, depth of binding pockets, and functional group participation across all host classes.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Interactions within Amyloid Protein Corona Based on 2D MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer can be adsorbed to the surface of the MoS2 nanosheet through van der Waals forces. Especially the hIAPP (human islet amyloid peptide) pentamer can attach to the surface in a stable standing mode. The entire parallel surface of the &#946;&#8208;pleated structure greatly contributes to the interaction with the neighboring protein molecules, and further enhances the probability of amyloid formation.







Abstract
The interfacial interaction within the amyloid protein corona based on MoS2 nanomaterial is crucial, both for understanding the biological effects of MoS2 nanomaterial and the evolution of amyloid diseases. The specific nano&#8208;bio interface phenomenon of human islet amyloid peptide (hIAPP) and MoS2 nanosheet was investigated by using theoretical and experimental methods. The MoS2 nanosheet enables the attraction of hIAPP monomer, dimer, and oligomer on its surface through van der Waals forces. Especially, the means of interaction between two hIAPP peptides might be changed by MoS2 nanosheet. In addition, it is interesting to find that the hIAPP oligomer can stably interact with the MoS2 nanosheet in one unique &#8220;standing&#8221; binding mode with an entire exposed &#946;&#8208;sheet surface. All the interaction modes on the surface of MoS2 nanosheet can be the essence of amyloid protein corona that may provide the venue to facilitate the fibrillation of hIAPP proteins. Further, it was verified experimentally that MoS2 nanosheets could accelerate the fibrillation of hIAPP at a certain concentration mainly based on the newly formed nano&#8208;bio interface. In general, our results provide insight into the molecular interaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;bio interface within the amyloid protein corona, and shed light on the pathway of amyloid protein aggregation that is related to the evolution of amyloid diseases.

Further, it was verified experimentally that MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets could accelerate the fibrillation of hIAPP at a certain concentration mainly based on the newly formed nano-bio interface. In general, our results provide insight into the molecular interaction mechanism of the nano-bio interface within the amyloid protein corona, and shed light on the pathway of amyloid protein aggregation that is related to the evolution of amyloid diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Various nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, and differentiate. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool.







Abstract
At the cellular level, numerous nanocues guide the cells to adhere, interact, proliferate, differentiate, etc. Understanding and manipulating the cellular functions in&#8197;vitro, necessitates the elucidation of these nanocues provided to the cells by the extracellular matrix (ECM), neighbouring cells or in the form of ligands. DNA nanotechnology is a biocompatible, flexible and a promising molecular level toolkit for mimicking cell&#8208;cell and cell&#8208;matrix interactions. In this review, we summarize various advances in cell&#8208;matrix, cell&#8208;cell and cell receptor&#8208;ligand interactions using DNA nanotechnology as a tool. We also provide a brief outlook on the current challenges and the future potentials of these DNA&#8208;based nanostructures so as to inspire novel innovations in the field.

         <title>Optochemical control of bacterial gene expression &#8211; novel photocaged compounds for different promoter systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaged compounds are applied for implementing precise, optochemical control of gene expression in bacteria. To broaden the scope of UV&#8208;light&#8208;responsive inducer molecules, six photocaged carbohydrates were synthesised and photochemically characterized, with the absorption exhibiting a red&#8208;shift. Their differing linkage through ether, carbonate, and carbamate bonds revealed that carbonate and carbamate bonds are convenient. Subsequently, those compounds were successfully applied  in&#160;vivo  for controlling gene expression in  E.&#160;coli  via  blue light illumination. Furthermore, benzoate&#8208;based expression systems were subjected to light control by establishing a novel photocaged salicylic acid derivative. Besides its synthesis and  in&#160;vitro  characterisation, we demonstrate the challenging choice of a suitable promoter system for light&#8208;controlled gene expression in  E.&#160;coli  . We illustrate various bottlenecks during both photocaged inducer synthesis and  in&#160;vivo  application and possibilities to overcome them. These findings pave the way towards novel caged inducer&#8208;dependent systems for wavelength&#8208;selective gene expression.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Enzymatic Activity by Modulating the Oligomerization State via Chemical Rescue and Optical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching activity by switching the oligomerization state: The cover feature illustrates the switching of an enzyme's activity by modulating its oligomerization state using light. A photo&#8208;sensitive unnatural amino acid (UAA) was incorporated into the oligomerization interface of the enzyme, leading to disassembly of the native hexamer into dimers. This was associated with a loss of activity, symbolized by the red dots at the active sites. Upon light exposure, the UAA was cleaved, which led to hexamer reformation and recovery of activity (green dots at the active sites). More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Kropp, A. Bruckmann, and P. Babinger.

         <title>Recent Advances in Small Molecule&#8208;Based Intracellular pH Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular pH plays a significant role in many pathological and biological processes. Abnormal physiological pH is an indication of many health disorders. Small molecule (quinoline, coumarin, rhodamine, indolium, BODIPY)&#8208;based fluorescent probes are found to be an effective tool for the determination of biological pH through cell imaging studies. This review article is focused on recent advances in small&#8208;molecule based biological pH probes.







Abstract
Intracellular pH plays an important role in many biological and pathological processes. Small&#8208;molecule based pH probes are found to be the most effective for pH sensing because of ease of preparation, high sensitivity, and quick response. They have many advantages such as small perturbation to the functions of the target, functional adaptability, cellular component&#8208;specific localization, etc. The present review highlights the flurry of recent activity in the development of such probes. The probes are categorized based on the type of fluorophore used like quinoline, coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, indolium, naphthalimide, etc., and their analytical performance is discussed.

         <title>The Conversion of Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by Nitrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogenases reduce inert dinitrogen to bioavailable ammonia and thus &#8216;feed&#8217; the Earth's biosphere. To catalyze this challenging reaction, nitrogenases are equipped with a complex reduction machinery that also permits the remarkable conversion of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In particular, the formation of methane and hydrocarbons opens up the prospect of future biotechnological processes for carbon capture and utilization by nitrogenases.







Abstract
Nitrogenases are the only known family of enzymes that catalyze the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3). The N2 reduction drives biological nitrogen fixation and the global nitrogen cycle. Besides the conversion of N2, nitrogenases catalyze a whole range of other reductions, including the reduction of the small gaseous substrates carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to hydrocarbons. However, it remains an open question whether these &#8216;side reactivities&#8217; play a role under environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these reactivities and particularly the formation of hydrocarbons have spurred the interest in nitrogenases for biotechnological applications. There are three different isozymes of nitrogenase: the molybdenum and the alternative vanadium and iron&#8208;only nitrogenase. The isozymes differ in their metal content, structure, and substrate&#8208;dependent activity, despite their homology. This minireview focuses on the conversion of CO and CO2 to methane and higher hydrocarbons and aims to specify the differences in activity between the three nitrogenase isozymes.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a Stable Isostere of Malonyllysine**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal&#8208;induced decarboxylation property of lysine malonylation may impose potential challenges to its study. Our study demonstrated that malonyltetrazole&#8208;modified lysine outstands as a stable bioisostere of malonyllysine to address such challenges. Enzymology data also verified that malonyl and malonyltetrazole share similar molecular interaction surfaces for receptor recognition.







Abstract
Lysine malonylation is a recently characterized post&#8208;translational modification involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and gene expression. One unique feature of this post&#8208;translational modification is its potential susceptibility to decarboxylation, which poses possible challenges to its study. As a step towards addressing these challenges, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a stable isostere of malonyllysine. First, we find that synthetic substitution of the malonyl group with a tetrazole isostere results in amino acid's resistant to thermal decarboxylation. Next, we demonstrate that protected variants of this amino acid are readily incorporated into peptides. Finally, we show that tetrazole isosteres of malonyllysine can be recognized by anti&#8208;malonyllysine antibodies and histone deacylases, validating their ability to mimic features of the endogenous lysine modification. Overall, this study establishes a new chemical strategy for stably mimicking a metabolite&#8208;derived post&#8208;translational modification, providing a foothold for tool development and functional analyses.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The thermal-induced&lt;/b&gt; decarboxylation property of lysine malonylation may impose potential challenges to its study. Our study demonstrated that malonyltetrazole-modified lysine outstands as a stable bioisostere of malonyllysine to address such challenges. Enzymology data also verified that malonyl and malonyltetrazole share similar molecular interaction surfaces for receptor recognition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lysine malonylation is a recently characterized post-translational modification involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and gene expression. One unique feature of this post-translational modification is its potential susceptibility to decarboxylation, which poses possible challenges to its study. As a step towards addressing these challenges, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a stable isostere of malonyllysine. First, we find that synthetic substitution of the malonyl group with a tetrazole isostere results in amino acid's resistant to thermal decarboxylation. Next, we demonstrate that protected variants of this amino acid are readily incorporated into peptides. Finally, we show that tetrazole isosteres of malonyllysine can be recognized by anti-malonyllysine antibodies and histone deacylases, validating their ability to mimic features of the endogenous lysine modification.

         <title>Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/S and S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds in Small Molecules and Proteins: A Combined CSD and PDB Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chalcogen bonds involving selenium and sulfur are prevalent in proteins. The work presented herein is the first extensive report on chalcogen bonds in proteins. Quantum mechanical calculations suggest that these interactions are highly directional and quite strong noncovalent interactions; the interaction energy can be as much as &#8722;15&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
The importance of selenium&#8208;centered noncovalent chalcogen bonds represented as Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;A (A=O/S) has been explored for short directional contacts in small molecules and proteins. In addition, S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O centered contacts have been analyzed. Computational analyses involving the quantitative assessment of the associated energetics, the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP), and electron density derived topological parameters, namely, quantum theory of atom in molecules (QTAIM) analyses, and NBO (natural bond orbital) based calculations, have been performed to unequivocally establish the strength, stability, and attractive role of chalcogen bonds in the solid&#8208;state. This investigation has been performed in molecules from both the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and Protein Data Bank (PDB). Thus futuristic materials may be designed keeping in mind the significance of these interactions, including their relevance in biology.

         <title>Engineering of a Plant Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthase for Development of Irregular Coupling Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side activity of a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase results in two non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail terpene structures. For one of them, a cyclobutane planococcyl diphosphate, this is the first example of an efficient enzymatic synthesis. Rational design of the protein allowed for a considerable increase of the irregular activity. The engineered enzyme can be implicated in the sustainable production of insect pheromones for environment&#8208;friendly pest control.







Abstract
We performed mutagenesis on a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (IDS), neryl diphosphate synthase from Solanum lycopersicum (SlNPPS), that has a structurally related analogue performing non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling of two dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) units, lavandulyl diphosphate synthase from Lavandula x intermedia (LiLPPS). Wild&#8208;type SlNPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in cis&#8208;orientation resulting in the formation of neryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able to catalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregular monoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis of their dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The second compound is the trans&#8208;isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregular cyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregular activity of SlNPPS constitutes 0.4&#8201;% of its regular activity and is revealed only if the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in the absence of IPP. The exchange of asparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling. While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutant reaches 13.1&#8201;% of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regular IDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at the development of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.

Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a remarkable biocatalyst for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acid (GABA) from l&#8208;glutamate. In this study, artificial GAD named FcGAD (full consensus glutamate decarboxylase) was designed by consensus protein design. FcGAD exhibits suitable properties for application in GABA biosynthesis. This Front Cover (created by Takashi Tsujino, Science Graphics. Co., Ltd.) highlights the design concept and application of FcGAD to the biosynthesis.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidation of protein interactions in living cells is a critical step in deciphering pharmacological targets. Here, we apply an orthogonal labeling approach to G protein&#8208;coupled receptors by two peptide pairs, interacting through coiled&#8208;coil motifs. The rapid reporter introduction in a one&#8208;pot reaction allows the investigation of transient and proximity&#8208;dependent interplay of different receptor proteins at the cell membrane. Focusing on prominent cardiovascular receptors, present in heart and blood vessel tissue, distinct receptor&#8211;receptor interactions have been identified that modulate intracellular signaling cascades. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;G. Beck&#8208;Sickinger et&#8197;al.

         <title>Xanthopsin&#8208;Like Systems via Site&#8208;Specific Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Retinoic Acid Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed in the irreversible site&#8208;specific and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket. This research opens the way to the preparation of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors, potentially useful for both optogenetic and &#8220;lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule&#8221; tools.







Abstract
The use of light&#8208;responsive proteins to control both living or synthetic cells, is at the core of the expanding fields of optogenetics and synthetic biology. It is thus apparent that a richer reaction toolbox for the preparation of such systems is of fundamental importance. Here, we provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration that Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed to perform a facile site&#8208;specific, irreversible and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket and yielding an unnatural chromophore with an extended &#960;&#8208;system. In doing so we effectively open the path to the in&#8197;vitro preparation of a library of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors. We argue that such a library, made of variable unnatural chromophores inserted in an easy&#8208;to&#8208;mutate and crystallize retinoic acid transporter, significantly expand the scope of the recently introduced rhodopsin mimics as both optogenetic and &#8220;lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule&#8221; tools.

         <title>Predictive Engineering of Class I Terpene Synthases Using Experimental and Computational Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a remarkable lack of sequence&#8208;function relationship within the terpene synthase family making product&#8208;outcome predictions from sequences alone challenging. Engineering of designer terpene synthases is enabled via integration of multidisciplinary approaches, including generation of sequence diversity, genome mining, high&#8208;throughput product profiling, modelling and computational chemistry, and data&#8208;driven computational tools.







Abstract
Terpenoids are a highly diverse group of natural products with considerable industrial interest. Increasingly, engineered microbes are used for the production of terpenoids to replace natural extracts and chemical synthesis. Terpene synthases (TSs) show a high level of functional plasticity and are responsible for the vast structural diversity observed in natural terpenoids. Their relatively inert active sites guide intrinsically reactive linear carbocation intermediates along one of many cyclisation paths via exertion of subtle steric and electrostatic control. Due to the absence of a strong protein interaction with these intermediates, there is a remarkable lack of sequence&#8208;function relationship within the TS family, making product&#8208;outcome predictions from sequences alone challenging. This, in combination with the fact that many TSs produce multiple products from a single substrate hampers the design and use of TSs in the biomanufacturing of terpenoids. This review highlights recent advances in genome mining, computational modelling, high&#8208;throughput screening, and machine&#8208;learning that will allow more predictive engineering of these fascinating enzymes in the near future.

         <title>Peptides Derived from Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B Show Potent Binding to Neuropilin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VEGF&#8208;B binds to the b1 domain of neuropilin&#8208;1. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides show potent binding to neuropilin&#8208;1 (KD=0.13 to 9.55&#8197;&#956;M) and inhibit binding of VEGF&#8208;A in a cell&#8208;based assay (IC50=0.3 to 2.0&#8197;&#956;M). Peptide lipidation increased binding and plasma half&#8208;lives.







Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate significant pathways in angiogenesis, myocardial and neuronal protection, metabolism, and cancer progression. The VEGF&#8208;B growth factor is involved in cell survival, anti&#8208;apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms, through binding to VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin&#8208;1 (NRP1). We employed surface plasmon resonance technology and X&#8208;ray crystallography to analyse the molecular basis of the interaction between VEGF&#8208;B and the b1 domain of NRP1, and developed VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus derived peptides to be used as chemical tools for studying VEGF&#8208;B &#8208; NRP1 related pathways. Peptide lipidation was used as a means to stabilise the peptides. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides containing a C&#8208;terminal arginine show potent binding to NRP1&#8208;b1. Peptide lipidation increased binding residence time and improved plasma stability. A crystal structure of a peptide with NRP1 demonstrated that VEGF&#8208;B peptides bind at the canonical C&#8208;terminal arginine binding site. VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus imparts higher affinity for NRP1 than the corresponding VEGF&#8208;A165 region. This tight binding may impact on the activity and selectivity of the full&#8208;length protein. The VEGF&#8208;B167 derived peptides were more effective than VEGF&#8208;A165 peptides in blocking functional phosphorylation events. Blockers of VEGF&#8208;B function have potential applications in diabetes and non&#8208;alcoholic fatty liver disease.

         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle&#8208;based affinity labeling probes displaying electrophilic groups and a carbohydrate ligand were synthesized and their reactivity toward carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins was evaluated. The cover feature shows a cartoon scene where a carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein, displayed as a nobility&#8208;like figure, is seated on a carbohydrate ligand and is receiving guests, each offering an electrophilic group as a gift. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Sakurai et&#8197;al.

As academia and industry push the boundaries of chemical biology more and more from basic science into impacting human health, we asked experts in the field what uniquely positions chemical biology as a translational science, how and when to maximize its potential, and where the field is headed. We also reflect personally on how chemical biology has impacted our careers in industry and academia.

         <title>Structures of the Human SPAK and OSR1 Conserved C&#8208;Terminal (CCT) Domains</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>STE20/SPS1&#8208;related proline/alanine&#8208;rich kinase (SPAK) and Oxidative Stress Responsive 1 (OSR1) kinase are two serine/threonine protein kinases that regulate the function of ion co&#8208;transporters through phosphorylation. The highly conserved&#160;  C  &#8208;terminal (CCT) domains of SPAK and OSR1 bind to RFx[V/I] peptide sequences from their upstream With No Lysine Kinases (WNKs), facilitating their activation via phosphorylation. Thus, the inhibition of SPAK and OSR1 binding, via their CCT domains, to WNK kinases is a plausible strategy for inhibiting SPAK and OSR1 kinases. To facilitate structure&#8208;guided drug design of such inhibitors, we expressed and purified human SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains and solved their crystal structures. Interestingly, these crystal structures show a highly conserved primary pocket adjacent to a flexible secondary pocket. We also employed a biophysical strategy and determined the affinity of SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains to short peptides derived from WNK4 and NKCC1. Together, this work provides a platform that facilitates the design of CCT domain specific small molecule binders that inhibit SPAK&#8208; and OSR1&#8208;activation by WNK kinases, and these could be useful in treating hypertension and ischemic stroke.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct enzymatic synthesis of fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatty amines represent an important class of commodity chemicals which have broad applicability in different industries. The synthesis of fatty amines starts from renewable sources such as vegetable oils or animal fats, but the process has multiple drawbacks that compromise the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the synthesis. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biocatalytic alternative towards the synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils. By coupling a lipase with a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA), we have accomplished the direct synthesis of multiple medium and long chain primary fatty amines in one pot with analytical yields as high as 97%. We have also performed a 75 mL preparative scale reaction for the synthesis of laurylamine from trilaurin, obtaining 73% isolated yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress on the Physiological Function of Mitochondrial DNA and Its Specific Detection and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and status quo of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) imaging and detection are highlighted in this minireview, and insights for designing excellent mtDNA probes are provided. New treatments for mtDNA&#8208;related diseases are also discussed.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the genetic information of mitochondrion, and its structure is circular double&#8208;stranded. Despite the diminutive size of the mitochondrial genome, mtDNA mutations are an important cause of mitochondrial diseases which are characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial diseases are involved in multiple systems, particularly in the organs that are highly dependent on aerobic metabolism. The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is more complicated since mtDNA mutations can cause various clinical symptoms. To realize more accurate diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial diseases, the detection of mtDNA and the design of drugs acting on it are extremely important. Over the past few years, many probes and therapeutic drugs targeting mtDNA have been developed, making significant contributions to fundamental research including elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases at the genetic level. In this review, we summarize the structure, function, and detection approaches for mtDNA. The most current topics in this field, such as mechanistic exploration and treatment of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related disorders, are also reviewed. Specific attention is given to discussing the design and development of these probes and drugs for mtDNA. We hope that this review will provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the importance of mtDNA, and promote the development of effective molecules for theragnosis of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Design of a Full&#8208;Consensus Glutamate Decarboxylase and Its Application to GABA Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;based protein design has the potential to generate highly functional enzymes. A full consensus glutamate decarboxylase, FcGAD, has high thermal stability and catalytic rate, which can be used in the synthesis of gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA). Utilizing E. coli which express FcGAD as biocatalyst, we achieved the synthesis of GABA at gram scale in a one&#8208;pot reaction.







Abstract
Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyses the decarboxylation of L&#8208;glutamate to gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA). Improvement of the enzymatic properties of GAD is important for the low&#8208;cost synthesis of GABA. In this study, utilizing sequences of enzymes homologous with GAD from lactic acid bacteria, highly mutated GADs were designed using sequence&#8208;based protein design methods. Two mutated GADs, FcGAD and AncGAD, generated by full&#8208;consensus design and ancestral sequence reconstruction, had more desirable properties than native GADs. With respect to thermal stability, the half&#8208;life of the designed GADs was about 10&#8201;&#176;C higher than that of native GAD. The productivity of FcGAD was considerably higher than those of known GADs; more than 250&#8197;mg/L of purified enzyme could be produced in the E. coli expression system. In a production test using 26.4&#8197;g of l&#8208;glutamate and 3.0&#8197;g of resting cells, 17.2&#8197;g of GABA could be prepared within one hour, without purification, in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.

Twisted supramolecular recognition? CD spectroscopy of Yariv reagent dyes identifies a correlation between positive couplets in CD spectra, indicative of helical chirality, and the ability of the dyes to bind arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs).







Abstract
Yariv reagents are glycosylated triphenylazo dyes that bind to arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), proteoglycans found in plant cell walls that are integral for plant growth and development. Yariv reagents are widely utilized as imaging, purification, and quantification tools for AGPs and represent the only small molecule probe for interrogating AGP function. The ability of Yariv reagents to bind to AGPs is dependent on the structure of the terminal glycoside on the dye. The reason for this selectivity has not been understood until the present work. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the Yariv reagents form supramolecular aggregates with helical chirality. More significantly, the ability of the Yariv reagent to bind AGPs is correlated with this helical chirality. This finding paves the way towards developing a more detailed understanding of the nature of the Yariv&#8208;AGP complex, and the design of AGP&#8208;binding reagents with higher affinities and selectivities.

         <title>Creation of an engineered amide synthetase biocatalyst by the rational separation of a two&#8208;step nitrile synthetase.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly&#8208;used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitriles synthetases (NSs) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The B. subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is a NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly&#8208;conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Head Comparison of Selected Extra&#8208; and Intracellular CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules on Their CO&#8208;Releasing and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beneficial anti&#8208;inflammatory effects of carbon monoxide were studied using differently triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs). In particular, some acyloxy&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes acting as enzyme&#8208;triggered CORMs showed pronounced cellular effects regardless of whether CO release was intra&#8208; or extracellular.







Abstract
Over the past decade, a variety of carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed and tested. Some CORMs spontaneously release CO once in solution, while others require a trigger mechanism to release the bound CO from its molecular complex. The modulation of biological systems by CORMs depends largely on the spatiotemporal release of CO, which likely differs among the different types of CORMs. In spontaneously releasing CORMs, CO is released extracellularly and crosses the cell membrane to interact with intracellular targets. Other CORMs can directly release CO intracellularly, which may be a more efficient method to modulate biological systems. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of extracellular and intracellular CO&#8208;releasing CORMs that either release CO spontaneously or require an enzymatic trigger. The efficacy of such CORMs to modulate HO&#8208;1 and VCAM&#8208;1 expression in TNF&#8208;&#945;&#8208;stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was evaluated.

         <title>Orthogonal Peptide&#8208;Templated Labeling Elucidates Lateral ETAR/ETBR Proximity and Reveals Altered Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GPCR&#8208;GPCR interactions can influence signaling events but are difficult to investigate in live cell setups. Here, we report on an orthogonal labeling approach, which excludes intracellular background signals and allows the installment of different dyes. Using this technique, the interaction of homo&#8208;receptors demonstrated for different GPCRs, but hetero&#8208;interaction was limited to ETAR/ETBR. For the latter, impaired ETBR signaling was shown.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that lateral GPCR interactions in the cell membrane can impact signaling profiles. Here, we report on a one&#8208;step labeling method of multiple membrane&#8208;embedded GPCRs. Based on short peptide tags, complementary probes transfer the cargo (e.&#8201;g. a fluorescent dye) by an acyl transfer reaction with high spatial and temporal resolution within 5&#8197;min. We applied this approach to four receptors of the cardiovascular system: the endothelin receptor A and B (ETAR and ETBR), angiotensin II receptor type 1, and apelin. Wild type&#8208;like G protein activation after N&#8208;terminal modification was demonstrated for all receptor species. Using FRET&#8208;competent dyes, a constitutive proximity between hetero&#8208;receptors was limited to ETAR/ETBR. Further, we demonstrate, that ETAR expression regulates the signaling of co&#8208;expressed ETBR. Our orthogonal peptide&#8208;templated labeling of different GPCRs provides novel insight into the regulation of GPCR signaling.

         <title>Novel Antibacterial Targets in Protein Biogenesis Pathways</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial protein biogenesis pathways are attractive antibacterial targets since many of them, or their substrates, are essential for bacterial survival. We review the various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis that show promise as potential antibacterial targets. This information will facilitate rational antibiotic design to help combat antibacterial resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat due to the ability of bacteria to quickly evolve in response to the selection pressure induced by anti&#8208;infective drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against resistant bacteria. In this review, we discuss pathways involving bacterial protein biogenesis as attractive antibacterial targets since many of them are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. We discuss the structural understanding of various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis, which in turn can be utilized for rational antibiotic design. We highlight efforts made towards developing inhibitors of these pathways with insights into future possibilities and challenges. We also briefly discuss other potential targets related to protein biogenesis.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Removable Photocaging Groups Accepted by MjMAT Variant: Structural Basis and Compatibility with DNA and RNA Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MAT (methionine adenosyltransferase) exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red&#8208;shifted ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl (ONB)&#8208;derivatives and is compatible with methyltransferases from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. This enables photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light. The crystal structure reveals details about substrate accommodation.







Abstract
Methylation and demethylation of DNA, RNA and proteins constitutes a major regulatory mechanism in epigenetic processes. Investigations would benefit from the ability to install photo&#8208;cleavable groups at methyltransferase target sites that block interactions with reader proteins until removed by non&#8208;damaging light in the visible spectrum. Engineered methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) have been exploited in cascade reactions with methyltransferases (MTases) to modify biomolecules with non&#8208;natural groups, including first evidence for accepting photo&#8208;cleavable groups. We show that an engineered MAT from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (PC&#8208;MjMAT) is 308&#8208;fold more efficient at converting ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;(ONB)&#8208;homocysteine than the wildtype enzyme. PC&#8208;MjMAT is active over a broad range of temperatures and compatible with MTases from mesophilic organisms. We solved the crystal structures of wildtype and PC&#8208;MjMAT in complex with AdoONB and a red&#8208;shifted derivative thereof. These structures reveal that aromatic stacking interactions within the ligands are key to accommodating the photocaging groups in PC&#8208;MjMAT. The enlargement of the binding pocket eliminates steric clashes to enable AdoMet analogue binding.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An engineered MAT&lt;/b&gt; (methionine adenosyltransferase) exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red-shifted &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl (ONB)-derivatives and is compatible with methyltransferases from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. This enables photo-deprotection of modified DNA by visible light. The crystal structure reveals details about substrate accommodation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methylation and demethylation of DNA, RNA and proteins constitutes a major regulatory mechanism in epigenetic processes. Investigations would benefit from the ability to install photo-cleavable groups at methyltransferase target sites that block interactions with reader proteins until removed by non-damaging light in the visible spectrum. Engineered methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) have been exploited in cascade reactions with methyltransferases (MTases) to modify biomolecules with non-natural groups, including first evidence for accepting photo-cleavable groups. We show that an engineered MAT from &lt;i&gt;Methanocaldococcus jannaschii&lt;/i&gt; (PC-MjMAT) is 308-fold more efficient at converting &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl-(ONB)-homocysteine than the wildtype enzyme. PC-MjMAT is active over a broad range of temperatures and compatible with MTases from mesophilic organisms. We solved the crystal structures of wildtype and PC-MjMAT in complex with AdoONB and a red-shifted derivative thereof. These structures reveal that aromatic stacking interactions within the ligands are key to accommodating the photocaging groups in PC-MjMAT. The enlargement of the binding pocket eliminates steric clashes to enable AdoMet analogue binding. Importantly, PC-MjMAT exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red-shifted ONB-derivatives enabling photo-deprotection of modified DNA by visible light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoactivation of Innate Immunity Receptor TLR8 in Live Mammalian Cells by Genetic Encoding of Photocaged Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic balance between the resting and active states of the immune response is essential for the host defense against invasion. Photocontrol of the innate immunity receptor TLR8 achieved precise regulation and dynamics programming. By genetic encoding of unnatural, photocaged tyrosine into TLR8, the receptor can be regulated by UV light with high spatiotemporal resolution, making it a suitable tool for TLR8 biological studies. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Yin et&#8197;al.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hydrogen Peroxide Responsive Organoborons for Biological and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elevated H2O2 has been observed under various disease conditions. Due to the chemoselective reaction between boron functional groups and H2O2, numerous deactivated organoborons have been developed for H2O2&#8208;mediated activation to form an active hydroxyl product. These include H2O2 bioimaging probes and H2O2&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;prochelators, prodrugs, and theranostic agents.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable reactive oxygen species generated endogenously, participating in numerous physiological processes and abnormal pathological conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that a higher level of H2O2 exists in various disease conditions. Thus, H2O2 functions as an ideal target for site&#8208;specific bioimaging and therapeutic targeting. The unique reactivity of organoborons with H2O2 provides a method for developing chemoselective molecules for biological and biomedical applications. This review highlights the design and application of boron&#8208;derived molecules for H2O2 detection, and the utility of boron moieties toward masking reactive compounds leading to the development of metal prochelators and prodrugs for selectively delivering an active species at the target sites with elevated H2O2 levels. Additionally, the emergence of H2O2&#8208;responsive theranostic agents consisting of both therapeutic and diagnostic moieties in one integrated system are discussed. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of the role of boron&#8208;derived molecules toward biological and pharmacological applications.

Diselenide&#8208;based S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic: This study demonstrates the potential of 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine conjugated with Pro&#8208;His dipeptide as a novel S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic, which catalytically promotes cysteinyl S&#8208;denitrosylation in the presence of a thiol co&#8208;substrate and prevents protein misfolding caused by S&#8208;nitrosylation. The cover image shows how the catalytic cycle involved a highly reactive diselenol species forming a &#947;&#8208;turn structure, and highlights the mystique of the reaction controlled by Selene, goddess of the moon and origin of the name for the element, selenium.

         <title>Defluorination Capability of l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid Dehalogenases in the HAD&#8208;Like Hydrolase Superfamily Correlates with Active Site Compactness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
You have to come close if you want a reaction: Several members of the haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like hydrolases superfamily were found to break carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds. The only features that differentiate between them and other family members unable to achieve this feat were small changes in distance between selected active site residues and protein dynamics leading to tighter interactions between protein and halogen.







Abstract
l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid dehalogenases, industrially and environmentally important enzymes that catalyse cleavage of the carbon&#8208;halogen bond in S&#8208;2&#8208;halocarboxylic acids, were known to hydrolyse chlorinated, brominated and iodinated substrates but no activity towards fluorinated compounds had been reported. A screen for novel dehalogenase activities revealed four l&#8208;2&#8208;haloacid dehalogenases capable of defluorination. We now report crystal structures for two of these enzymes, Bpro0530 and Rha0230, as well as for the related proteins PA0810 and RSc1362, which hydrolyse chloroacetate but not fluoroacetate, all at &#8764;2.2&#8197;&#197; resolution. Overall structure and active sites of these enzymes are highly similar. In molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, only the defluorinating enzymes sample more compact conformations, which in turn allow more effective interactions with the small fluorine atom. Structural constraints, based on X&#8208;ray structures and MD calculations, correctly predict the defluorination activity of the homologous enzyme ST2570.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotide Modified with Disulfide Units Induces Efficient Exon Skipping in mdx Myotubes through Enhanced Membrane Permeability and Nucleus Internalization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced cellular uptake was achieved using a disulfide&#8208;unit&#8208;containing membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotide (MPON). Long&#8208;term incubation enabled their nuclear internalization and subsequent exon skipping.







Abstract
We have found that antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA molecules modified with repeat structures of disulfide units can be directly introduced into the cytoplasm and exhibit a suppressive effect on gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of cellular uptake of these membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotides (MPONs). Time&#8208;course analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the uptake of MPONs from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm reached 50&#8201;% of the total uptake in about 5&#8197;min. In addition, analysis of the plasma membrane proteins to which MPONs bind, identified several proteins, including voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel. Next, we analyzed the behavior of MPONs in the cell and found them to be abundant in the nucleus as early as 24&#8197;h after addition with the amount increasing further after 48 and 72&#8197;h. The amount of MPONs was 2.5&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified oligonucleotides in the nucleus after 72&#8197;h. We also designed antisense oligonucleotides and evaluated the effect of MPONs on mRNA exon skipping using DMD model cells; MPONs caused exon skipping with 69&#8201;% efficiency after 72&#8197;h, which was three times higher than the rate of the control. In summary, the high capacity for intracytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of MPONs is expected to be useful for therapeutic strategies targeting exon skipping.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enhanced cellular uptake&lt;/b&gt; was achieved using a disulfide-unit-containing membrane-permeable oligonucleotide (MPON). Long-term incubation enabled their nuclear internalization and subsequent exon skipping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found that antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA molecules modified with repeat structures of disulfide units can be directly introduced into the cytoplasm and exhibit a suppressive effect on gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of cellular uptake of these membrane-permeable oligonucleotides (MPONs). Time-course analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the uptake of MPONs from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm reached 50&#8201;% of the total uptake in about 5&#8197;min. In addition, analysis of the plasma membrane proteins to which MPONs bind, identified several proteins, including voltage-dependent anion channel. Next, we analyzed the behavior of MPONs in the cell and found them to be abundant in the nucleus as early as 24&#8197;h after addition with the amount increasing further after 48 and 72&#8197;h. The amount of MPONs was 2.5-fold higher than that of unmodified oligonucleotides in the nucleus after 72&#8197;h. We also designed antisense oligonucleotides and evaluated the effect of MPONs on mRNA exon skipping using DMD model cells; MPONs caused exon skipping with 69&#8201;% efficiency after 72&#8197;h, which was three times higher than the rate of the control. In summary, the high capacity for intracytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of MPONs is expected to be useful for therapeutic strategies targeting exon skipping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Fluorination as Modification for Peptide&#8208;Based Fusion Inhibitors against HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated variants of an HIV entry inhibitor inspired by clinically applied T20 were systematically studied. The results reveal six&#8208;helix bundle formation for the fluorine&#8208;containing sequences in the presence of wildtype N&#8208;terminal heptad repeat peptide of gp41. X&#8208;ray crystal structures confirm favorable packing of the fluorinated groups and in&#8197;vitro infection experiments with CEMx174 SEAP cells reveal nanomolar inhibition.







Abstract
With the emergence of novel viruses, the development of new antivirals is more urgent than ever. A key step in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) infection is six&#8208;helix bundle formation within the envelope protein subunit gp41. Selective disruption of bundle formation by peptides has been shown to be effective; however, these drugs, exemplified by T20, are prone to rapid clearance from the patient. The incorporation of non&#8208;natural amino acids is known to improve these pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we evaluate a peptide inhibitor in which a critical Ile residue is replaced by fluorinated analogues. We characterized the influence of the fluorinated analogues on the biophysical properties of the peptide. Furthermore, we show that the fluorinated peptides can block HIV&#8208;1 infection of target cells at nanomolar levels. These findings demonstrate that fluorinated amino acids are appropriate tools for the development of novel peptide therapeutics.

         <title>The Inhibition Effect of Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking between Probes in Photo&#8208;Induced Double Duplex Invasion DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced double duplex invasion (pDDI) was enabled by ultrafast DNA photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK) and photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitor, 5&#8208;cyanouracil(CNU). In this study, we evaluated the effect on pDDI efficiency using spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS), which are considered to have photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability, similar to CNU. As a result, CNU had the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were found to be not very different.







Abstract
Double duplex invasion (DDI) DNA is a useful antigene method that inhibits expression of genomic DNA. We succeeded in performing photoinduced&#8208;DDI (pDDI) using ultrafast photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking. 5&#8208;Cyanouracil (CNU) has been used in pDDI to inhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking between probes, but its importance has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of spacer (S) and d&#8208;spacer (dS) that exhibit photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability similar to that of CNU. CNU exhibited the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were not very different. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect was better with S and dS than with thymidine (T). Conversely, the thermal stability was significantly lower with S and dS than with T. The results suggest that the pDDI efficiency is determined by the balance between the photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and the thermal stability, which is the introduction efficiency for double&#8208;stranded DNA. Therefore, CNU, which has a photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and a high Tm value, showed the highest inhibitory efficiency.

         <title>Target&#8208;Mediated 5&#8217;&#8208;Exonuclease Digestion of DNA Aptamers with RecJ to Modulate Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protect and detect: a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 5&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ followed by introduction of a circular template and phi29 DNA polymerase to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing low picomolar detection limits for a protein (thrombin) and a small molecule (OTA) target.







Abstract
We report a new method for biosensing based on the target&#8208;mediated resistance of DNA aptamers against 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion, allowing them to act as primers for rolling circle amplification (RCA). A target&#8208;bound DNA strand containing an aptamer region on the 5&#8217;&#8208;end and a primer region on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end is protected from 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ exonuclease in a target&#8208;dependent manner. As the protected aptamer is at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end, the exposed primer on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template to generate a turn&#8208;on sensor. Without target, RecJ digests the primer and prevents RCA from occurring, allowing quantitative fluorescence detection of both thrombin, a protein, and ochratoxin A (OTA), a small molecule, at picomolar concentrations.

         <title>Controlling Enzymatic Activity by Modulating the Oligomerization State via Chemical Rescue and Optical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous control of the association state of enzyme complexes can be used to switch activity. A cation&#8208;&#960; bond in the oligomerization interface was disrupted either by a Lys&#8208;to&#8208;Cys mutation or by incorporation of an unnatural amino acid (UAA), resulting in complex disassembly and loss of activity. For switching activity on again, Lys was chemically rescued or the UAA was decaged by light. The complex was reformed and the activity was fully restored.







Abstract
Selective switching of enzymatic activity has been a longstanding goal in synthetic biology. Drastic changes in activity upon mutational manipulation of the oligomerization state of enzymes have frequently been reported in the literature, but scarcely exploited for switching. Using geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase as a model, we demonstrate that catalytic activity can be efficiently controlled by exogenous modulation of the association state. We introduced a lysine&#8208;to&#8208;cysteine mutation, leading to the breakdown of the active hexamer into dimers with impaired catalytic efficiency. Addition of bromoethylamine chemically rescued the enzyme by restoring hexamerization and activity. As an alternative method, we incorporated the photosensitive unnatural amino acid o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;O&#8208;tyrosine (ONBY) into the hexamerization interface. This again led to inactive dimers, but the hexameric state and activity could be recovered by UV&#8208;light induced cleavage of ONBY. For both approaches, we obtained switching factors greater than 350&#8208;fold, which compares favorably with previously reported activity changes that were caused by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

         <title>HaloTag Engineering for Enhanced Fluorogenicity and Kinetics with a Styrylpyridium Dye</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein engineering techniques were implemented to improve the fluorogenicity and kinetics of an accessible dye&#8208;HaloTag construct. The engineered protein showed dramatically improved fluorescent properties with purified HaloTag and enabled live&#8208;cell imaging in mammalian cells.







Abstract
HaloTag is a small self&#8208;labeling protein that is frequently used for creating fluorescent reporters in living cells. The small&#8208;molecule dyes used with HaloTag are almost exclusively based on rhodamine scaffolds, which are often expensive and challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report the engineering of HaloTag for use with a chemically accessible, inexpensive fluorophore based on the dimethylamino&#8208;styrylpyridium dye. Through directed evolution, the maximum fluorogenicity and the apparent second&#8208;order bioconjugation rate constants could be improved up to 4&#8208;fold and 42&#8208;fold, respectively. One of the top variants, HT&#8208;SP5, enabled reliable imaging in mammalian cells, with a 113&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement over the parent protein. Additionally, crystallographic characterization of selected mutants suggests the chemical origin of the fluorescent enhancement. The improved dye system offers a valuable tool for imaging and illustrates the viability of engineering self&#8208;labeling proteins for alternative fluorophores.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Phage&#8208;Displayed Helix&#8208;Loop&#8208;Helix Peptides to Construct Kinase&#8208;Focused Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptide libraries: A phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptide library was chemically modified with adenosine as an anchor molecule for binding to the ATP binding site of protein kinase. This approach to the construction of target&#8208;focused HLH peptide libraries would enable the efficient generation of selective inhibitors not only for protein kinases, but also for other proteins of interest.







Abstract
Conformationally constrained peptides hold promise as molecular tools in chemical biology and as a new modality in drug discovery. The construction and screening of a target&#8208;focused library could be a promising approach for the generation of de novo ligands or inhibitors against target proteins. Here, we have prepared a protein kinase&#8208;focused library by chemically modifying helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptides displayed on phage and subsequently tethered to adenosine. The library was screened against aurora kinase A (AurA). The selected HLH peptide Bip&#8208;3 retained the &#945;&#8208;helical structure and bound to AurA with a KD value of 13.7&#8197;&#956;M. Bip&#8208;3 and the adenosine&#8208;tethered peptide Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc provided IC50 values of 103&#8197;&#956;M and 7.7&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, suggesting that Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc bivalently inhibited AurA. In addition, the selectivity of Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc to several protein kinases was tested, and was highest against AurA. These results demonstrate that chemical modification can enable the construction of a kinase&#8208;focused library of phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptides.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attention in synthetic biology and biotechnology. To leverage their catalytic efficiency, different strategies have been developed including substrate engineering, allosteric effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, one&#8208;pot multienzyme reactions (OPME), and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization. These research efforts also have important implications for the study of other enzymes and many fields of application. More information can be found in the Minireview by L. Zhang and Q. Wang.

         <title>Visual Detection of Adenosine Triphosphate by Taylor Rising: A Simple Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Method Based on Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid run! A new point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing method for adenosine triphosphate detection was developed based on Taylor rising. This approach is quite general, includes naked eye quantification and does not require cumbersome equipment.







Abstract
Rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) is an extremely critical mission in practical applications, especially for rigorous military medicine, home health care, and in the third world. Here, we report a visual POCT method for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection based on Taylor rising in the corner of quadratic geometries between two rod surfaces. We discuss the principle of Taylor rising, demonstrating that it is significantly influenced by contact angle, surface tension, and density of the sample, which are controlled by ATP&#8208;dependent rolling circle amplification (RCA). In the presence of ATP, RCA reaction effectively suppresses Taylor&#8208;rising behavior, due to the increased contact angle, density, and decreased surface tension. Without addition of ATP, untriggered RCA reaction is favorable for Taylor rising, resulting in a significant height. With this proposed method, visual sensitive detection of ATP without the aid of other instruments is realized with only a 5 &#956;L droplet, which has good selectivity and a low detection limit (17&#8197;nM). Importantly, this visual method provides a promising POCT tool for user&#8208;friendly molecular diagnostics.

         <title>Chemical Biology Toolbox to Visualize Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical biology methods to visualize protein aggregation in live cells are presented in this review. The methods discussed include fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small molecule probes.







Abstract
Protein misfolding and aggregation is a complex biochemical process and has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. Developing novel chemical and biological tools and approaches to visualize aggregated proteins in live cells is in high demand for mechanistic studies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the recent developments in the chemical biology toolbox applied to protein aggregation studies in live cells. These methods exploited fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small&#8208;molecule probes to visualize the protein&#8208;aggregation process, detect proteome stresses, and quantify the protein homeostasis network capacity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical biology methods&lt;/b&gt; to visualize protein aggregation in live cells are presented in this review. The methods discussed include fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small molecule probes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein misfolding and aggregation is a complex biochemical process and has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. Developing novel chemical and biological tools and approaches to visualize aggregated proteins in live cells is in high demand for mechanistic studies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the recent developments in the chemical biology toolbox applied to protein aggregation studies in live cells. These methods exploited fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small-molecule probes to visualize the protein-aggregation process, detect proteome stresses, and quantify the protein homeostasis network capacity. Inspired by these seminal works, we have generalized design principles for the development of new detection methods and probes in the future that will illuminate this important biological process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Weak Binding and Spectroscopic Signature of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 Interaction with RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of nsp14 protein with nascent RNA for the removal of mismatched nucleotide from the newly synthesized RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is reported.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 non&#8208;structural protein 14 (nsp14), known as exoribonuclease is encoded from the large polyprotein of viral genome and is a major constituent of the transcription replication complex (TRC) machinery of the viral RNA synthesis. This protein is highly conserved among the coronaviruses and is a potential target for the development of a therapeutic drug. Here, we report the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 expression, show its structural characterization, and ss&#8208;RNA exonuclease activity through vibrational and electronic spectroscopies. The deconvolution of amide&#8208;I band in the FTIR spectrum of the protein revealed a composition of 35&#8201;% &#945;&#8208;helix and 25&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;sheets. The binding between protein and RNA is evidenced from the spectral changes in the amide&#8208;I region of the nsp14, showing protein conformational changes during the binding process. A value of 20.60&#177;3.81&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 of the binding constant (KD) is obtained for nsp14/RNA complex. The findings reported here can motivate further studies to develop structural models for better understanding the mechanism of exonuclease enzymes for correcting the viral genome and can help in the development of drugs against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Structural Studies Provide New Insights into the Role of Lysine Acetylation on Substrate Recognition by CARM1 and Inform the Design of Potent Peptidomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidomimetics based on the histone H3 tail peptide were used in co&#8208;crystallization studies with coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) to investigate the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. These findings also provide new insights into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation and the development of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of CARM1.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin provides a communication system for the regulation of gene expression. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role that such crosstalk between PTMs plays in chromatin recognition. In this study, (bio)chemical and structural approaches were applied to specifically probe the impact of acetylation of Lys18 in the histone H3 tail peptide on peptide recognition by the protein methyltransferase coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). Peptidomimetics that recapitulate the transition state of protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferases, were designed based on the H3 peptide wherein the target Arg17 was flanked by either a free or an acetylated lysine. Structural studies with these peptidomimetics and the catalytic domain of CARM1 provide new insights into the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. While the co&#8208;crystal structures reveal that lysine acetylation results in minor conformational differences for both CARM1 and the H3 peptide, acetylation of Lys18 does lead to additional interactions (Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) and likely reduces the cost of desolvation upon binding, resulting in increased affinity. Informed by these findings a series of smaller peptidomimetics were also prepared and found to maintain potent and selective CARM1 inhibition. These findings provide new insights both into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation as well as towards the development of peptidomimetic CARM1 inhibitors.

         <title>Harnessing Fluorescent Moenomycin A Antibiotics for Bacterial Cell Wall Imaging Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moenomycin A (MoeA)&#8208;based fluorescent probes were developed for imaging the bacterial cell wall through specific labeling of transglycosylases. The strategy provided stunning imaging probes for mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains.







Abstract
The imaging of peptidoglycan (PGN) dynamics in living bacteria facilitates the understanding of PGN biosynthesis and wall&#8208;targeting antibiotics. The main tools for imaging bacterial PGN are fluorescent probes, such as the well&#8208;known PGN metabolic labeling probes. However, fluorescent small&#8208;molecule probes for labeling key PGN&#8208;synthesizing enzymes, especially for transglycosylases (TGases), remain to be explored. In this work, the first imaging probe for labeling TGase in bacterial cell wall studies is reported. We synthesized various fluorescent MoeA&#8208;based molecules by derivatizing the natural antibiotic moenomycin A (MoeA), and used them to label TGases in living bacteria, monitor bacterial growth and division cycles by time&#8208;lapse imaging, and study cell wall growth in the mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains when the &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based probes were unsuitable.

         <title>The Diverse Antimicrobial Activities of Human Milk Oligosaccharides against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exert various activities against Group B Streptococcus (GBS) including inhibition of bacterial growth, enhanced penetrance, and efficacy of antibiotics via bacterial cell permeabilization, and inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation. This review discusses the most recent studies on the interaction between HMOs and GBS.







Abstract
Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathobiont that is the etiological cause of severe perinatal infections. GBS can colonize the vagina of pregnant patients and invade tissues causing ascending infections of the gravid reproductive tract that lead to adverse outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal or fetal demise. Additionally, transmission of GBS during labor or breastfeeding can also cause invasive infections of neonates and infants. However, human milk has also been shown to have protective effects against infection; a characteristic that is likely derived from antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of molecules that comprise human milk. Recent evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), short&#8208;chain sugars that comprise 8&#8211;20&#8201;% of breast milk, have antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and other bacterial pathogens. Additionally, HMOs have been shown to potentiate the activity of antibiotics against GBS. This review presents the most recent published work that studies the interaction between HMOs and GBS.

         <title>Modulation of Transaminase Activity by Encapsulation in Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus megaterium transaminase (BmTA) shows high immobilization efficiency in upper critical solution temperature type poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) (pNAGA) hydrogels, and high activity in the swollen hydrogel. Upon temperature decrease, the hydrogel swelling and enzyme activity decrease. The deactivation tended to be higher for BmTA immobilized in pNAGA compared to free BmTA due to temperature&#8208;induced hydrogel shrinking.







Abstract
Smart hydrogels hold much potential for biocatalysis, not only for the immobilization of enzymes, but also for the control of enzyme activity. We investigated upper critical solution temperature&#8208;type poly N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (pNAGA) hydrogels as a smart matrix for the amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium (BmTA). Physical entrapment of BmTA in pNAGA hydrogels results in high immobilization efficiency (&gt;89&#8201;%) and high activity (97&#8201;%). The temperature&#8208;sensitiveness of pNAGA is preserved upon immobilization of BmTA and shows a gradual deswelling upon temperature reduction. While enzyme activity is mainly controlled by temperature, deactivation tended to be higher for immobilized BmTA (&#8776;62&#8211;68&#8201;%) than for free BmTA (&#8776;44&#8201;%), suggesting a deactivating effect due to deswelling of the pNAGA gel. Although the deactivation in response to hydrogel deswelling is not yet suitable for controlling enzyme activity sufficiently, it is nevertheless a good starting point for further optimization.

The deactivation tended to be higher for &lt;i&gt;Bm&lt;/i&gt;TA immobilized in pNAGA compared to free &lt;i&gt;Bm&lt;/i&gt;TA due to temperature-induced hydrogel shrinking.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can a common synthetic intermediate be transformed by different functional groups to target different cell organelles? We evaluated the structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes synthesized from the same synthetic intermediate to target nuclei, lysosomes, and mitochondria in live microglial cells.







Abstract
Targeting live cell organelles is essential for imaging, understanding, and controlling specific biochemical processes. Typically, fluorescent probes with distinct structural scaffolds are used to target specific cell organelles. Here, we have designed a modular one&#8208;step synthetic strategy using a common reaction intermediate to develop new lysosomal, mitochondrial, and nucleus&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes that are all based on a single boron dipyrromethane scaffold. The divergent cell organelle targeting was achieved by synthesizing probes with specific functional group changes to the central scaffold resulting in differential fluorescence and pKa. Specifically, we show that the functional group transformation of the same scaffold influences cellular localization and specificity of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes in live primary microglial cells with pKa values ranging from &#8764;3.2&#8211;6.0. We introduce a structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) framework to target nuclei (NucShine), lysosomes (LysoShine), and mitochondria (MitoShine) in live microglia. This work will result in future applications of SOR beyond imaging to target and control organelle&#8208;specific biochemical processes in disease&#8208;specific models.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Detection of Enzymatic Alcohol Dehydrogenase Activity in Microfluidic Droplets with a Direct Fluorogenic Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh throughput screening assay of alcohol dehydrogenases in microfluidic droplets becomes possible with substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore. With a 100&#8197;nM detection threshold and no appreciable leaking even after 6 weeks, less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average is robustly detectable.







Abstract
The exploration of large DNA libraries of metagenomic or synthetic origin is greatly facilitated by ultrahigh&#8208;throughput assays that use monodisperse water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets as sequestered reaction compartments. Millions of samples can be generated and analysed in microfluidic devices at kHz speeds, requiring only micrograms of reagents. The scope of this powerful platform for the discovery of new sequence space is, however, hampered by the limited availability of assay substrates, restricting the functions and reaction types that can be investigated. Here, we broaden the scope of detectable biochemical transformations in droplet microfluidics by introducing the first fluorogenic assay for alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in this format. We have synthesized substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore (8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;pyrenetrisulfonic acid, HPTS) when enzymatic turnover occurs. Pyranine is well retained in droplets for &gt;6 weeks (i.&#8201;e. 14&#8208;times longer than fluorescein), avoiding product leakage and ensuring excellent assay sensitivity. Product concentrations as low as 100&#8197;nM were successfully detected, corresponding to less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average. The potential of our substrate design was demonstrated by efficient recovery of a bona fide ADH with an &gt;800&#8208;fold enrichment. The repertoire of droplet screening is enlarged by this sensitive and direct fluorogenic assay to identify dehydrogenases for biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Mitochondrial Membrane Disrupting Molecules for Selective Killing of Senescent Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here, we showcase the importance of hydrophobicity and charge during the design of new mitochondria&#8208;targeted small molecules as a senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.







Abstract
Cellular senescence, a stable form of cell cycle arrest, facilitates protection from tumorigenesis and aids in tissue repair as they accumulate in the body at an early age. However, long&#8208;term retention of senescent cells causes inflammation, aging of the tissue, and progression of deadly diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Various attempts have been made to achieve selective elimination of senescent cells from the body, yet little has been explored in designing the mitochondria&#8208;targeted senolytic agent. Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here we have designed a library of alkyl&#8208;monoquaternary ammonium&#8208;triphenyl phosphine (TPP) and alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP of varying alkyl chain lengths, which target the mitochondria; we also studied their senolytic properties. It was observed that the alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP with the longest chain length induced apoptosis in senescent cells selectively via an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane disruption. This study demonstrates that mitochondria could be a potential target for designing new small molecules as senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.

         <title>&#8220;A Study in Yellow&#8221;: Investigations in the Stereoselectivity of Ene&#8208;Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Elementary, Watson!&#8221; The recent efforts to investigate and understand the stereochemical course of the asymmetric bioreduction of C=C bonds mediated by ene&#8208;reductases are reviewed, covering the literature of the last two decades. A general binding model is presented and successful approaches to stereodivergent reductions are discussed with representative examples.







Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductases from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily are a well&#8208;known and efficient biocatalytic alternative for the asymmetric reduction of C=C bonds. Considering the broad variety of substituents that can be tolerated, and the excellent stereoselectivities achieved, it is apparent why these enzymes are so appealing for preparative and industrial applications. Different classes of C=C bonds activated by at least one electron&#8208;withdrawing group have been shown to be accepted by these versatile biocatalysts in the last decades, affording a vast range of chiral intermediates employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavours, fragrances and fine chemicals. In order to access both enantiomers of reduced products, stereodivergent pairs of OYEs are desirable, but their natural occurrence is limited. The detailed knowledge of the stereochemical course of the reaction can uncover alternative strategies to orient the selectivity via mutagenesis, evolution, and substrate engineering. An overview of the ongoing studies on OYE&#8208;mediated bioreductions will be provided, with particular focus on stereochemical investigations by deuterium labelling.

         <dc:description>
The modular assembly of synthetic transhydrogenase catalysts is demonstrated using a PEG&#8208;NAD(H) modified formate dehydrogenase (FDH)&#8208;SpyCatcher fusion protein. The front cover highlights how any oxidoreductase enzyme can be outfitted with a simple SpyTag peptide and conjugated to FDH&#8208;SpyCatcher to create new cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalysts driven by formate oxidation. The stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites, emphasizing the functional modularity and predictive nature of this synthetic approach to biocatalyst design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Massad and S. Banta.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High costs and low availability of UDP&#8208;galactose hampers the enzymatic synthesis of valuable oligosaccharides such as human milk oligosaccharides. Here, we report the development of a platform for the scalable, biocatalytic synthesis and purification of UDP&#8208;galactose. UDP&#8208;galactose was produced with a titer of 48 mM (27.2 g/L) in a small&#8208;scale batch process (200 &#181;L) within 24 h using 0.02 g  enzyme  /g  product  . Through  in&#8208;situ  ATP regeneration, the amount of ATP (0.6 mM) supplemented was around 240&#8208;fold lower than the stoichiometric equivalent required to achieve the final product yield. Chromatographic purification using porous graphic carbon adsorbent yielded UDP&#8208;galactose with a purity of 92%. The synthesis was transferred to 1 L preparative scale production in a stirred tank bioreactor. To further reduce the synthesis costs here, the supernatant of cell lysates was used bypassing expensive purification of enzymes. Here, 23.4 g/L UDP&#8208;galactose were produced within 23 h with a synthesis yield of 71% and a biocatalyst load of 0.05 g  total_protein  /g  product  . The costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;galactose synthesized were around 0.26 &#8364;/g.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of Potent Bioactive anti&#8208;TNF&#945; Aptamers by Microbead&#8208;Assisted Capillary Electrophoresis (MACE)&#8208;SELEX</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid identification of high&#8208;affinity aptamers against human TNF&#945;: In vitro selection coupled with microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) separation was performed to rapidly identify anti&#8208;TNF&#945; aptamers; it was completed in only three rounds. Selected Apt14 showed the strongest inhibition activity according to the cell viability assay. Furthermore, by introducing a complementary linker to the aptamers, facile dimerization was performed, resulting in enhanced affinity and inhibition activity compared to that of the monomer.







Abstract
Dysregulation of tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;), a pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine, causes several diseases, making it an important therapeutic target. Here, we identified a novel DNA aptamer against human TNF&#945; using in&#8197;vitro selection, which included a high exclusion pressure process against non&#8208;binding and weak binders through microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) in only three rounds. Among the 15 most enriched aptamers, Apt14 exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for the interaction between TNF&#945; and its cognate receptor in mouse L929 cells. For further improving the bioactivity of the aptamer, dimerization programed by hybridization was evaluated, resulting in the Apt14 dimer exhibited a twofold higher binding affinity and stronger inhibition compared to the monomer counterpart. Rapid identification of bioactive aptamers using MACE in combination with facile dimerization by hybridization accelerates the discovery of novel bioactive aptamers, paving the way toward replacing current monoclonal antibody therapy with the less expensive and non&#8208;immunogenic aptamer therapy.

         <title>Harnessing P450 Enzyme for Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attentions in the synthetic biology and biotechnology areas due to their versatile functions and unique structures. In this article, different strategies that used to leverage P450s catalytic efficiency have been reviewed and discussed, which include substrate engineering, allostery effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, OPME and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization etc.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYPs) catalyze the oxidative transformation of a wide range of organic substrates. Their functions are crucial to xenobiotic metabolism and steroid transformation in humans and other organisms. The enzymes are promising for synthetic biology applications but limited by several drawbacks including low turnover rates, poor stability, the dependance of expensive cofactors and redox partners, and the narrow substrate scope. To conquer these obstacles, emerging strategies including substrate engineering, usage of decoy and decoy&#8208;based small molecules auxiliaries, designing of artificial enzyme cascades and the incorporation of materials have been explored based on the unique properties of P450s. These strategies can be applied to a wide range of P450s and can be combined with protein engineering to improve the enzymatic activities. This minireview will focus on some recent developments of these strategies which have been used to leverage P450 catalysis. Remaining challenges and future opportunities will also be discussed.

         <title>Identification and Composition of Clasper Scent Gland Components of the Butterfly Heliconius erato and Its Relation to Mimicry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scent glands of male Heliconius erato contain up to 350 components with individual compositions. Linear terpenes dominate, either as esters or as long, regular linear isoprene&#8208;oligomers. The high chemical diversity is reflected within the many different mimicry patterns of these butterflies. The compounds were identified by a combination of various methods, including synthesis, which allowed to unravel the underlying biosynthetic pathways used to arrive at these compound bouquets.







Abstract
The butterfly Heliconius erato occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper scent gland releases an anti&#8208;aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)&#8208;analyses, derivatization, and synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3&#8208;oxohexan&#8208;1&#8208;ol and (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol with (S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids, and various alcohols. In addition, linear terpenes with up to seven uniformly connected isoprene units occur, e.&#8201;g. farnesylfarnesol. A large number of the compounds have not been reported before from nature. Discriminant analyses of principal components of the gland contents showed that the iridescent mimicry group differs strongly from the other, mostly also separated, mimicry groups. Comparison with data from other species indicated that Heliconius recruits different biosynthetic pathways in a species&#8208;specific manner for semiochemical formation.

     alt="Identification and Composition of Clasper Scent Gland Components of the Butterfly Heliconius erato and Its Relation to Mimicry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scent glands&lt;/b&gt; of male &lt;i&gt;Heliconius erato&lt;/i&gt; contain up to 350 components with individual compositions. Linear terpenes dominate, either as esters or as long, regular linear isoprene-oligomers. The high chemical diversity is reflected within the many different mimicry patterns of these butterflies. The compounds were identified by a combination of various methods, including synthesis, which allowed to unravel the underlying biosynthetic pathways used to arrive at these compound bouquets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The butterfly &lt;i&gt;Heliconius erato&lt;/i&gt; occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper scent gland releases an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)-analyses, derivatization, and synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3-oxohexan-1-ol and (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-3-hexen-1-ol with (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2,3-dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids, and various alcohols. In addition, linear terpenes with up to seven uniformly connected isoprene units occur, e.&#8201;g. farnesylfarnesol. A large number of the compounds have not been reported before from nature. Discriminant analyses of principal components of the gland contents showed that the iridescent mimicry group differs strongly from the other, mostly also separated, mimicry groups. Comparison with data from other species indicated that &lt;i&gt;Heliconius&lt;/i&gt; recruits different biosynthetic pathways in a species-specific manner for semiochemical formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a biomimetic iron (IV)&#8208;oxo complex (the sun) towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates (the orbiting planets) was investigated. The reaction rates (corresponding to the orbital periods) are in very good agreement with the calculated bond dissociation energies. 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU or the dimethylated compounds 1,5dimC and 1,5dimU. The image was created by coauthor R. Jan&#223;en. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L.&#8197;J. Daumann et&#8197;al.
