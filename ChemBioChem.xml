         <title>Lysosomal Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Control Cell Behavior</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept describes an emerging approach to building functional nanostructures in lysosomes through non&#8208;covalent interactions for tuning lysosomal homeostasis, resulting in modulating cellular behaviors. We discuss several strategies for triggering peptide self&#8208;assembly in lysosomes and briefly discuss the prospects of this emerging field.







Abstract
Lysosomes are membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles that play key roles in degrading and recycling cellular debris, cellular signaling, and energy metabolism processes. Confinement of amphiphilic peptides in the lysosome to construct functional nanostructures through noncovalent interactions is an emerging approach to tune the homeostasis of lysosome. After briefly introducing the importance of lysosome and its functions, we discuss the advantages of lysosomal nanostructure formation for disease therapy. We next discuss the strategy for triggering the self&#8208;assembly of peptides in the lysosome, followed by a concise outlook of the future perspective about this emerging research direction.

         <title>Profiling Cellular Morphological Changes Induced by Dual&#8208;targeting PROTACs of Aurora Kinase and RNA&#8208;binding Protein&#160;YTHDF2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are new chemical modalities that degrade proteins of interest, including established kinase targets and emerging RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs). Whereas diverse sets of biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays are available for the evaluation and optimizations of PROTACs in understanding the involved ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation mechanism and the structure&#8208;degradation relationship, a phenotypic method profiling the cellular morphological changes is rarely used. In this study, first, we reported the only examples of PROTACs degrading the mRNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2 via screening of multikinase PROTACs. Second, we reported the profiling of cellular morphological changes of the dual kinase&#8208; and RBP&#8208;targeting PROTACs using the unbiased cell painting assay (CPA). The CPA analysis revealed the high biosimilarity with the established aurora kinase cluster and annotated aurora kinase inhibitors, which reflected the association between YTHDF2 and the aurora kinase signaling network. Broadly, the results demonstrated that the cell painting assay can be a straightforward and powerful approach to evaluate PROTACs. Complementary to the existing biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays, CPA provided a new perspective in characterizing PROTACs at the cellular morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Antimicrobial&#8208;Immunomodulatory Molecules: Networking Biomolecules of Innate Immunity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A network of biomolecules (peptides, saccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, organic molecules, metal ions) endogenous to the human brain and exhibiting both antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities has been identified. This network constitutes a previously uncatalogued and collectively underappreciated immuno&#8208;active group of synergistic molecular responders within the innate immune system's first line of defence against invasive pathogens.







Abstract
Endogenous antimicrobial&#8208;immunomodulatory molecules (EAIMs) are essential to immune&#8208;mediated human health and evolution. Conventionally, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been regarded as the dominant endogenous antimicrobial molecule; however, AMPs are not sufficient to account for the full spectrum of antimicrobial&#8208;immunomodulatory duality occurring within the human body. The threat posed by pathogenic microbes is pervasive with the capacity for widespread impact across many organ systems and multiple biochemical pathways; accordingly, the host needs the capacity to react with an equally diverse response. This can be attained by having EAIMs that traverse the full range of molecular size (small to large molecules) and structural diversity (including molecules other than peptides). This review identifies multiple molecules (peptide/protein, lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, small organic molecule, and metallic cation) as EAIMs and discusses the possibility of cooperative, additive effects amongst the various EAIM classes during the host response to a microbial assault. This comprehensive consideration of the full molecular diversity of EAIMs enables the conclusion that EAIMs constitute a previously uncatalogued structurally diverse and collectively underappreciated immuno&#8208;active group of integrated molecular responders within the innate immune system's first line of defence.

         <title>Click, Compute, Create: A Review of Web&#8208;based Tools for Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reviewing computational methods for Enzyme Engineering in the era of Machine Learning: A concise overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods, ranging from property engineering to the de novo design of enzymes, with an emphasis on user&#8208;friendly tools that are freely accessible as web&#8208;interfaces.







Abstract
Enzyme engineering, though pivotal across various biotechnological domains, is often plagued by its time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive nature. This review aims to offer an overview of supportive in silico methodologies for this demanding endeavor. Starting from methods to predict protein structures, to classification of their activity and even the discovery of new enzymes we continue with describing tools used to increase thermostability and production yields of selected targets. Subsequently, we discuss computational methods to modulate both, the activity as well as selectivity of enzymes. Last, we present recent approaches based on cutting&#8208;edge machine learning methods to redesign enzymes. With exception of the last chapter, there is a strong focus on methods easily accessible via web&#8208;interfaces or simple Python&#8208;scripts, therefore readily useable for a diverse and broad community.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of Protein Containing Thiotyrosine as an Active Site Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;canonical amino acid thiotyrosine was incorporated into a small cyclic protein by chemical synthesis. Thanks to the aryl&#8208;thiol containing side chain, it is able to serve as a catalyst for ester hydrolysis and native chemical ligation of peptides.







Abstract
Native chemical ligation is a key reaction in the toolbox of chemical methods for the synthesis of native and modified proteins. The catalysis of ligation is commonly performed by using small aryl&#8208;thiol molecules added at high concentrations. In this work, we incorporated thiotyrosine, a non&#8208;canonical amino acid containing an aryl&#8208;thiol moiety, into a designed cyclic protein &#171; sans queue ni t&#234;te &#187;. Importantly, the protein environment reduced the pKa of the thiol group to 5.8&#8211;5.9, which is significantly lower than the previously reported value for thiotyrosine in a short peptide (pKa 6.4). Furthermore, we demonstrated the catalytic activity of this protein both as hydrolase and in native chemical ligation of peptides. These results will be useful for the development of efficient protein catalysts (enzymes) for protein synthesis and modification.

Importantly, the protein environment reduced the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the thiol group to 5.8&#8211;5.9, which is significantly lower than the previously reported value for thiotyrosine in a short peptide (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; 6.4). Furthermore, we demonstrated the catalytic activity of this protein both as hydrolase and in native chemical ligation of peptides. These results will be useful for the development of efficient protein catalysts (enzymes) for protein synthesis and modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Genetically Encoded Photocaged Proteinogenic and Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaged amino acids could be genetically encoded into proteins via genetic code expansion (GCE) and constitute unique tools for innovative protein engineering. There are a number of photocaged proteinogenic amino acids that allow strategic conversion of proteins into their photocaged variants, thus enabling spatiotemporal and non&#8208;invasive regulation of protein functions using light. Meanwhile, there are a hand of photocaged non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids that address the challenges in directly encoding certain non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that structurally resemble proteinogenic ones or possess highly reactive functional groups. Herein, we would like to summarize the efforts in encoding photocaged proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, hoping to draw more attention to this fruitful and exciting scientific campaign.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in the Biosynthesis of Aziridines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Only 0.016% of all known natural products contain an aziridine ring, but this unique structural feature imparts high reactivity and cytotoxicity to the compounds in which it is found. Until 2021, no naturally occurring azirdine&#8208;forming enzymes had been identified. Since 2021, the biosynthetic enzymes for ~10% of known aziridine containing natural products have been identified and characterized. This article describes the recent advances in our understanding of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed aziridine formation in the context of historical means of azirdine formation through synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Orthosteric and Allosteric Pharmacological Chaperones for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB) is an autosomal inherited disease caused by mutations in gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;alpha&#8208;glucosaminidase (NAGLU). These mutations result in reduced NAGLU activity, preventing it from catalyzing the hydrolysis of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). There are currently no approved treatments for MPS IIIB. A novel approach in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases is the use of pharmacological chaperones (PC). In this study, we used a drug repurposing approach to identify and characterize novel potential PCs for NAGLU enzyme. We modeled the interaction of natural and artificial substrates within the active cavity of NAGLU (orthosteric site) and predicted potential allosteric sites. We performed a virtual screening for both the orthosteric and the predicted allosteric site against a curated database of human tested molecules. Considering the binding affinity and predicted blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability and gastrointestinal absorption, we selected atovaquone and piperaquine as orthosteric and allosteric PCs. The PCs were evaluated by their capacity to bind NAGLU and the ability to restore the enzymatic activity in human MPS IIIB fibroblasts These results represent novel PCs described for MPS IIIB and demonstrate the potential to develop novel therapeutic alternatives for this and other protein deficiency diseases</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing External Irradiation for Precise Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Agents in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is a significant global health issue. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, are crucial in clinical anti&#8208;cancer treatment. However, these drugs have limitations such as drug resistance, non&#8208;specific distribution, and irreversible toxic and side effects. In recent years, the development of metal&#8208;based agents has led to the discovery of other anti&#8208;cancer effects beyond chemotherapy. Precise spatiotemporal controlled external irradiation can activate metal&#8208;based agents at specific sites and play a different role from traditional chemotherapy. These strategies can not only enhance the anti&#8208;cancer efficiency, but also show fewer side effects and non&#8208;cross&#8208;drug resistance, which are ideal approaches to solve the problems caused by traditional platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy drugs. In this review, we focus onvarious metal&#8208;based agent&#8208;mediated cancer therapies that are activated by three types of external irradiation: near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, ultrasound (US), and X&#8208;ray, and give some prospects. We hope that this review will promote the generation of new kinds of metal&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Metal Detection with Organic Moiety&#8208;Based Sensors: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy metal hazardous and enduring characteristics present a noteworthy risk to both human well&#8208;being and the ecosystem. Heavy metal level monitoring requires accurate and dependable detection techniques. This review emphasizes the requirement for sophisticated detection methods that can address the issues like sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy cost, ease of use of heavy metal ion and allow for more accurate and trustworthy monitoring using organic moiety. It offers a thorough overview of cutting&#8208;edge organic moiety&#8208;based heavy metal detection technique. It primarily discusses four different types of substituted core structures, including coumarin, porphyrin, Schiff bases, and terpyridine, along with their mechanisms, methods, detection limits, and appropriate metal bindings. These moieties exhibit strong coordination with heavy metal ions because of their distinct structural characteristics. They produce stable complexes with complicated ligand&#8208;metal interactions that are useful in a variety of applications, including sensing and catalysis. Each probe was chosen based on its propensity or capacity to identify important analytes in practical applications. To increase the effectiveness and productivity of fluorescence sensing, researchers have recently been working to create new fluorescence chemosensors that can identify many ions at once.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazoles are tunable nucleofuges for developing tyrosine&#8208;reactive electrophiles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonyl and &#8208;sulfonate (imidazylate) are widely used in synthetic chemistry as nucleofuges for diazotransfer, nucleophilic substitution, and cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The utility of these reagents for protein bioconjugation, in contrast, have not been comprehensively explored and important considering the prevalence of imidazoles in biomolecules and drugs. Here, we synthesized a series of alkyne&#8208;modified sulfonyl&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;imidazole probes to investigate the utility of this electrophile for protein binding. Alkylation of the distal nitrogen activated the nucleofuge capability of the imidazole to produce sulfonyl&#8208;imidazolium electrophiles that were highly reactive but unstable for biological applications. In contrast, arylsulfonyl imidazoles functioned as a tempered electrophile for assessing ligandability of select tyrosine and lysine sites in cell proteomes and when mated to a recognition element could produce targeted covalent inhibitors with reduced off&#8208;target activity. In summary, imidazole nucleofuges show balanced stability and tunability to produce sulfone&#8208;based electrophiles that bind functional tyrosine and lysine sites in the proteome.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunflower Pollen&#8208;Derived Microspheres Selectively Absorb DNA for microRNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the finding that a naturally sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microspheres (HSECs) with hierarchical structures can selectively absorb polyC and polyA with high efficiency and affinity. HSECs exhibit the capability to selectively absorb polyC and polyA ssDNA under neutral and acidic conditions. It has been observed that the presence of metal cations, specifically Ca2+, enhances the absorption efficiency of HSECs. Mechanically, this absorption phenomenon can be attributed to both electrostatic interactions and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such an appealing property enables the functionalization of HSECs for broad potential biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles are a hot topic in the field of nanomaterial research due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. In recent years, DNA&#8208;directed nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly technology has been widely applied to the development of numerous complex nanoparticle superstructures. Due to the inherent stability and surface electric repulsion of nanoparticles, it is difficult to make nanoparticle superstructures respond to molecular signals in the external environment. In fact, enzyme&#8208;programmed molecular systems are developed to allow diverse functions, including logical operations, signal amplification, and dynamic assembly control. Therefore, combining enzyme&#8208;controlled DNA systems may endow nanoparticle assembly systems with more flexibility in program design, allowing them to respond to a variety of external signals. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of enzyme&#8208;controlled DNA/nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and introduce its applications in heavy metal detection, gene expression, proteins inside living cells, cancer cell therapy, and drug delivery. With the continuous development of new nanoparticle materials and the increasing functionality of enzyme DNA circuits, enzyme&#8208;directed DNA/nanoparticle self&#8208;assembled probe technology is expected to see significant future development.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of RNA Modified with Thioamide Internucleoside Linkage</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent success of RNA therapeutics has reinvigorated interest in chemical modifications of RNA. As exemplified by the phosphorothioates, modifications of sugar&#8208;phosphate backbone have been remarkably impactful but relatively underexplored in therapeutic RNAs. The present study reports synthesis, thermal stability, and RNA interference activity of RNAs modified with thioamide linkages. Compared to the previously studied amide&#8208;modified RNA, thioamide linkages strongly destabilized a short self&#8208;complementary RNA model duplex. However, in short interfering RNAs amides and thioamides had a similar effect on duplex stability and target RNA cleavage activity and specificity. Hence, the thioamide may be added to the toolbox of chemical biologist as a useful backbone modification well tolerated by the RNA interference machinery.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Polymeric Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated Autophagy for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autophagy is an important biological mechanism for eukaryotic cells to regulate growth, death, and energy metabolism, and plays an important role in removing damaged organelles, misfolded or aggregated proteins, and clearing pathogens. It has been found that autophagy is closely related to cell survival and death, and is of great significance in cancerigenesis and development, playing a bidirectional role in cancer inhibition and cancer promotion. Therefore, treating cancers by regulating autophagy has attracted much attention. A large amount of research evidence indicates that polymeric nanomaterials are able to regulate cellular autophagy, and their good biocompatibility, degradability, and functionalizable modification open up a broad application prospect for improving the therapeutic effect of cancers. This review provides an overview of the research progress of polymeric nanomaterials for modulating autophagy in the treatment of cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the available RNA labeling toolbox with CutA nucleotidyltransferase for efficient transcript labeling with purine and pyrimidine nucleotide analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA labeling is an invaluable tool for investigation of the function and localization of nucleic acids. Labels are commonly incorporated into 3&#8242; end of RNA and the primary enzyme used for this purpose is RNA poly(A) polymerase (PAP), which belongs to the class of terminal nucleotidyltransferases (NTases). However, PAP preferentially adds ATP analogs, thus limiting the number of available substrates. Here, we report the use of another NTase, CutA from the fungus Thielavia terrestris. Using this enzyme, we were able to incorporate into the 3&#8242; end of RNA not only purine analogs, but also pyrimidine analogs. We engaged strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyl cycloaddition (SPAAC) to obtain fluorescently labeled or biotinylated transcripts from RNAs extended with azide analogs by CutA. Importantly, modified transcripts retained their biological properties. Furthermore, fluorescently labeled mRNAs were suitable for visualization in cultured mammalian cells. Finally, we demonstrate that either affinity studies or molecular dynamic (MD) simulations allow for rapid screening of NTase substrates, what opens up new avenues in the search for the optimal substrates for this class of enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein&#8208;Derived Cyclic Peptides as Modulators of Spike Interaction with GRP78</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaperone protein GRP78 mediates cell entry by various pathogens, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Cyclic peptides based on surface features of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein were synthesised and found to inhibit spike interaction with GRP78. Wuhan and Omicron spike sequences were compared with the known GRP78 ligand Pep42, with the Omicron&#8208;derived peptide showing the highest activity.







Abstract
The human glucose&#8208;regulated protein GRP78 is a human chaperone that translocactes to the cell surface when cells are under stress. Theoretical studies suggested it could be involved in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus entry to cells. In this work, we used in&#8197;vitro surface plasmon resonance&#8208;based assays to show that human GRP78 indeed binds to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. We have designed and synthesised cyclic peptides based on the loop structure of amino acids 480&#8211;488 of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein S1 domain from the Wuhan and Omicron variants and showed that both peptides bind to GRP78. Consistent with the greater infectiousness of the Omicron variant, the Omicron&#8208;derived peptide displays slower dissociation from the target protein. Both peptides significantly inhibit the binding of wild&#8208;type S1 protein to the human protein GRP78 suggesting that further development of these cyclic peptide motifs may provide a viable route to novel anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agents.

         <title>Identifying Potential SOS1 Inhibitors via Virtual Screening of Multiple Small Molecule Libraries against KRAS&#8208;SOS1 Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study aims to identify new SOS1 inhibitors that will disrupt the KRAS&#8208;SOS1 interaction through virtual screening studies. For this aim, small molecule databases were employed with an in&#8208;house virtual screening algorithm that integrates target&#8208;driven and ligand&#8208;based methodologies, resulting in the identification of potent SOS1 inhibitors.







Abstract
The RAS&#8208;MAPK signaling pathway, crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation, involves key proteins KRAS and SOS1. Mutations in the KRAS and SOS1 genes are implicated in various cancer types, including pancreatic, lung, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. There is considerable interest in identifying inhibitors targeting KRAS and SOS1 to explore potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. In this study, advanced in silico techniques were employed to screen small molecule libraries at this interface, leading to the identification of promising lead compounds as potential SOS1 inhibitors. Comparative analysis of the average binding free energies of these predicted potent compounds with known SOS1 small molecule inhibitors revealed that the identified compounds display similar or even superior predicted binding affinities compared to the known inhibitors. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of these compounds as candidates for further development as effective anti&#8208;cancer agents.

     alt="Identifying Potential SOS1 Inhibitors via Virtual Screening of Multiple Small Molecule Libraries against KRAS-SOS1 Interaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aims to identify new SOS1 inhibitors that will disrupt the KRAS-SOS1 interaction through virtual screening studies. For this aim, small molecule databases were employed with an in-house virtual screening algorithm that integrates target-driven and ligand-based methodologies, resulting in the identification of potent SOS1 inhibitors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation, involves key proteins KRAS and SOS1. Mutations in the KRAS and SOS1 genes are implicated in various cancer types, including pancreatic, lung, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. There is considerable interest in identifying inhibitors targeting KRAS and SOS1 to explore potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. In this study, advanced &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; techniques were employed to screen small molecule libraries at this interface, leading to the identification of promising lead compounds as potential SOS1 inhibitors. Comparative analysis of the average binding free energies of these predicted potent compounds with known SOS1 small molecule inhibitors revealed that the identified compounds display similar or even superior predicted binding affinities compared to the known inhibitors. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of these compounds as candidates for further development as effective anti-cancer agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proteomic Profiling of Antimalarial Plasmodione Using 3&#8208;Benz(o)ylmenadione Affinity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe here the design, synthesis and evaluation of an antiplasmodial 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;menadione probe for affinity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments using yeast and P. falciparum parasite lysates. These studies allowed us to identify a first list of proteins interacting with plasmodione in both yeast and P. falciparum late trophozoites.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms of drug action in malarial parasites is crucial for the development of new drugs to combat infection and to counteract drug resistance. Proteomics is a widely used approach to study host&#8208;pathogen systems and to identify drug protein targets. Plasmodione is an antiplasmodial early&#8208;lead drug exerting potent activities against young asexual and sexual blood stages in&#8197;vitro with low toxicity to host cells. To elucidate its molecular mechanisms, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) approach was applied to yeast and P. falciparum proteomes. New (pro&#8208;) AfBPP probes based on the 3&#8208;benz(o)yl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;menadione scaffold were synthesized. With optimized conditions of both photoaffinity labeling and click reaction steps, the AfBPP protocol was then applied to a yeast proteome, yielding 11 putative drug&#8208;protein targets. Among these, we found four proteins associated with oxidoreductase activities, the hypothesized type of targets for plasmodione and its metabolites, and other proteins associated with the mitochondria. In Plasmodium parasites, the MS analysis revealed 44 potential plasmodione targets that need to be validated in further studies. Finally, the localization of a 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoromenadione AfBPP probe was studied in the subcellular structures of the parasite at the trophozoite stage.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Phenylalanine Adenylation Enzyme HitB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenylation enzymes catalyze the selective incorporation of aminoacyl building blocks in the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides and related natural products. Although &#946;&#8208;amino acid units are one of the important aminoacyl building blocks in natural product biosynthesis, very little is known about the engineering of &#946;&#8208;amino acid adenylation enzymes. In this study, we engineered the substrate specificity of the (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine adenylation enzyme, HitB, involved in the biosynthesis of macrolactam polyketide hitachimycin. Based on the previously determined structure of HitB wild&#8208;type, we mutated Phe328 and Ser293, which are located near the meta and ortho position of the (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine moiety, respectively. As a result, the HitB F328V and F328L mutants efficiently activated meta&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs, and the HitB T293G and T293S mutants efficiently activated ortho&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs. Structural analysis of the HitB F328L and T293G mutants with the corresponding nonhydrolyzable intermediate analogs revealed an enlarged substrate binding pocket for (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs, providing detailed insights into the structural basis for creating enzyme substrate promiscuity. Our findings may be useful for production of various &#946;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing natural product analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>IKZF2 Degradation: It's Time to Take into Account it When Designing Cereblon&#8208;based PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) has become a very important means of protein degradation and a new way of disease treatment. In particular, PROTACs constructed with ligands for E3 ligase cereblon account for more than 90% of the PROTACs currently in clinical research. Notably, CRBN ligands themselves are a class of molecular glue compounds capable of degrading neo&#8208;substrate proteins. Compared to the target proteins degradation, the degradation of neo&#8208;substrates, especially IKZF2, has not received enough attention. Therefore, this review summarizes the currently published IKZF2 degraders derived from articles and patents, which are conducive to the design of PROTACs with desired IKZF2 degradation from the perspective of medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Utilizing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as porous supports to encapsulate enzyme represents an advanced strategy for constructing COFs biocatalysts, which has inspired numerous interests across various applications. As the structural advantages including ultrastable covalent&#8208;bonded linkage, tailorable pore structure, and metal&#8208;free biocompatibility, the resultant enzyme&#8208;COFs biocatalysts showcase functional enhancement in catalytic activity, chemical stability, long&#8208;term durability, and recyclability. This Concept describes the recent advances in the methodological strategies for engineering the COFs biocatalysts, with specific emphasis on the pore entrapment and in situ encapsulation strategies. The structural advantages of the COFs hybrid biocatalysts for organic synthesis, environment&#8208; and energy&#8208;associated applications are also canvassed. Additionally, the remaining challenges and the forward&#8208;looking directions in this field are also discussed. We believe that this Concept can offer useful methodological guidance for developing active and robust COFs biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of nanomaterials with multiple enzymatic activities via a facile approach receives growing interests in recent years. Although peptide self&#8208;assembling provides an effective approach for the construction of biomimetic materials in recent years, fabrication of artificial enzymes from self&#8208;assembling peptides with multiple catalytic activities for anticancer therapy is still a challenge. Here, we report a simple method to prepare nanocatalysts with multienzyme&#8208;like activities from self&#8208;assembling peptides containing ATCUN copper&#8208;binding motifs. With the aid of the coordination interactions between the ATCUN motif and Cu(II) ions, these peptides could perform supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to form nanomaterials with biomimetic peroxidase, ascorbate oxidase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Moreover, these trienzyme&#8208;like effects can elevate oxidative stress levels and suppress the antioxidative capability of cancer cells, which synergistically induce the apoptosis of cancer cells. Because of the high biocompatibility, catalytic activities and drug encapsulation properties, this self&#8208;assembled peptide provides a biomimetic platform for the development of new nanocatalytic medicines for multimodal synergistic cancer therapies.</dc:description>

These strategies involve multiple guarantee procedures, utilizing dual signal output mechanisms, and implementing sequential regulation methods. Our goal is to provide new insights into the development of more accurate DNA sensors, ultimately facilitating their widespread application in clinical diagnostics and assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to Understand the Ubiquitination Landscape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a critical and detailed analysis for the use of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a tool to study protein ubiquitination. Topics include the unique approaches where FRET is used to quantify the transfer of ubiquitin through the E1, E2 and E3 enzymes of the ubiquitination cascade, the removal of ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes and the processing of ubiquitin&#8208;labelled proteins by the 26S&#8197;proteasome. FRET methods have enabled protein interactions, conformational changes and dynamics of the ubiquitination pathway to be measured that can be adapted to several high&#8208;throughput technologies and on the single molecule level.







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a fluorescence technique that allows quantitative measurement of protein interactions, kinetics and dynamics. This review covers the use of FRET to study the structures and mechanisms of ubiquitination and related proteins. We survey FRET assays that have been developed where donor and acceptor fluorophores are placed on E1, E2 or E3 enzymes and ubiquitin (Ub) to monitor steady&#8208;state and real&#8208;time transfer of Ub through the ubiquitination cascade. Specialized FRET probes placed on Ub and Ub&#8208;like proteins have been developed to monitor Ub removal by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that result in a loss of a FRET signal upon cleavage of the FRET probes. FRET has also been used to understand conformational changes in large complexes such as multimeric E3 ligases and the proteasome, frequently using sophisticated single molecule methods. Overall, FRET is a powerful tool to help unravel the intricacies of the complex ubiquitination system.

         <title>Enterolyin S, a Polythiazole&#8208;containing Hemolytic Peptide from Enterococcus caccae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptolysin S (SLS)&#8208;type of linear azol(in)e&#8208;containing peptides (LAPs) belong to a family of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) known for their hemolytic activities. The chemical structure of SLS has remained elusive despite its discovery 85&#8197;years ago. We identified a novel SLS&#8208;type hemolytic LAP named Enterolysin S and characterized its unique post&#8208;translational modification as an unprecedented octathiazole.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hemolytic factor streptolysin S (SLS) is an important linear azol(in)e&#8208;containing peptide (LAP) that contributes significantly to the virulence of Streptococcus pyogenes. Despite its discovery 85&#8197;years ago, SLS has evaded structural characterizing owing to its notoriously problematic physicochemical properties. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a structurally analogous hemolytic peptide from Enterococcus caccae, termed enterolysin S (ELS). Through heterologous expression, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, chemoselective modification, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, we found that ELS contains an intriguing contiguous octathiazole moiety. The discovery of ELS expands our knowledge of hemolytic LAPs by adding a new member to this virulence&#8208;promoting family of modified peptides.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of the Effect of Genomic Knock&#8208;Out of Non&#8208;Essential Promiscuous HAD&#8208;Like Phosphatases YcsE, YitU and YwtE on Flavin and Adenylate Content in Bacillus Subtilis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three HAD&#8208;like phosphatases &#8211; YcsE, YwtE and YitU &#8211; that catalyze dephosphorylation of one of the riboflavin biosynthesis intermediates are knocked out singly or in combinations inB. subtilis using CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 genome editing technology. The influence of the knockouts on bacterial fitness as well as on flavin and adenylate intracellular concentration is investigated.







Abstract
Studying the metabolic role of non&#8208;essential promiscuous enzymes is a challenging task, as genetic manipulations usually do not reveal at which point(s) of the metabolic network the enzymatic activity of such protein is beneficial for the organism. Each of the HAD&#8208;like phosphatases YcsE, YitU and YwtE of Bacillus subtilis catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;ribitylamino&#8208;uracil 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate, which is essential in the biosynthesis of riboflavin. Using CRISPR technology, we have found that the deletion of these genes, individually or in all possible combinations failed to cause riboflavin auxotrophy and did not result in significant growth changes. Analysis of flavin and adenylate content in B. subtilis knockout mutants showed that (i) there must be one or several still unidentified phosphatases that can replace the deleted proteins; (ii) such replacements, however, cannot fully restore the intracellular content of any of three flavins studied (riboflavin, FMN, FAD); (iii) whereas bacterial fitness was not significantly compromised by mutations, the intracellular balance of flavins and adenylates did show some significant changes.

         <title>Kinetic ITC of DNA Aptamers Binding for Small Molecules and Implications for Binding Assays and Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of kon and koff values through kinetic analysis is crucial for understanding the intricacies of aptamer&#8208;target binding interactions. By employing kinetic ITC, we systematically analyzed a range of ITC data for various aptamers. Upon plotting their kon and koff values as a function of their Kd values, a notable trend emerged. Across a range of Kd values spanning from 28 nM to 864 &#181;M, the kon value decreased from 2&#180;105 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 to 96 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, whereas the koff value increased from 1.03&#180;10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1 to 0.012 s&#8208;1. Thus, both kon and koff contributed to the change of Kd in the same direction, although the range of kon change was larger. Since experiments are often run at close to the Kd value, this concentration effect also played an important role in the observed binding kinetics. The effect of these kinetic parameters on two common sensing mechanisms, including aptamer beacons and strand&#8208;displacement assays, are discussed. This work has provided the kinetic values of small molecule binding aptamers and provided insights into aptamer&#8208;based biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>An Active and Versatile Electron Transport System for Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases from the Alkane Degrading Organism Acinetobacter sp. OC4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are valuable biocatalysts for the oxyfunctionalization of non&#8208;activated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds. Most CYPs rely on electron transport proteins as redox partners. In this study, the ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Acinetobacter&#160;sp.&#160;OC4 are investigated. Upon heterologous production of both proteins independently in Escherichia&#160;coli, spectral analysis showed their reduction capability towards reporter electron acceptors, e.g., cytochrome c. The individual proteins&#8217; specific activity towards cytochrome c reduction was 25 U&#160;mg&#8209;1. Furthermore, the possibility to enhance electron transfer by artificial fusion of the units was elucidated. FdR and FD were linked by helical linkers [EAAAK]n, flexible glycine linkers [GGGGS]n or rigid proline linkers [EPPPP]n of n&#160;=&#160;1&#160;&#8211;&#160;4 sequence repetitions. The system with a glycine linker (n&#160;=&#160;4) reached an appreciable specific activity of 19&#160;U&#160;mg&#8209;1 towards cytochrome c. Moreover, their ability to drive different members of the CYP153A subfamily is demonstrated. By creating artificial self&#8208;sufficient P450s with FdR, FD, and a panel of four CYP153A representatives, effective hydroxylation of n&#8208;hexane in a whole&#8208;cell system was achieved. The results indicate this protein combination to constitute a functional and versatile surrogate electron transport system for this subfamily.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;cell Catalysis by Tethered Organo&#8208;Osmium Complexes Generates Selectivity for Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anticancer agents that exhibit catalytic mechanisms of action offer a unique multi&#8208;targeting strategy to overcome drug resistance. Nonetheless, many in&#8208;cell catalysts in development are hindered by deactivation by endogenous nucleophiles. We have synthesised a highly potent, stable Os&#8208;based 16&#8208;electron half&#8208;sandwich (&#8216;piano stool&#8217;) catalyst by introducing a permanent covalent tether between the arene and chelated diamine ligand. This catalyst exhibits antiproliferative activity comparable to the clinical drug cisplatin towards triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells and can overcome tamoxifen resistance. Speciation experiments revealed Os to be almost exclusively albumin&#8208;bound in the extracellular medium, while cellular accumulation studies identified an energy&#8208;dependent, protein&#8208;mediated Os accumulation pathway, consistent with albumin&#8208;mediated uptake. Importantly, the tethered Os complex was active for in&#8208;cell transfer hydrogenation catalysis, initiated by co&#8208;administration of a non&#8208;toxic dose of sodium formate as a source of hydride, indicating that the Os catalyst is delivered to the cytosol of cancer cells intact. The mechanism of action involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus exploiting the inherent redox vulnerability of cancer cells, accompanied by selectivity for cancerous cells over non&#8208;tumorigenic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of Rhenium Bisquinoline Tricarbonyl Complexes for their Antibacterial Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes have emerged as a promising source for novel classes of antibacterial agents to combat the rise of antimicrobial resistance around the world. In the exploration of the transition metal chemical space for novel metalloantibiotics, the rhenium tricarbonyl moiety has been identified as a promising scaffold. Here we have prepared eight novel rhenium bisquinoline tricarbonyl complexes and explored their antibacterial properties. Significant activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria was observed. However, all complexes also showed significant toxicity against human cells, putting into question the prospects of this specific rhenium compound class as metalloantibiotics. To better understand their biological effects, we conduct the first mode of action studies on rhenium bisquinoline complexes and show that they are able to form pores through bacterial membranes. Their straight&#8208;forward synthesis and tuneability suggests that further optimisation of this compound class could lead to compounds with enhanced bacterial specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platinum&#8208;Aluminum Bimetallic Salen Complex for Pro&#8208;senescence Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;aluminum bimetallic salen complex combining senescence induction and in&#8197;situ cytotoxicity generation for pro&#8208;senescence cancer therapy.







Abstract
Cell senescence is defined as irreversible cell cycle arrest, which can be triggered by telomere shortening or by various types of genotoxic stress. Induction of senescence is emerging as a new strategy for the treatment of cancer, especially when sequentially combined with a second senolytic drug capable of killing the resulting senescent cells, however severely suffering from the undesired off&#8208;target side effects from the senolytic drugs. Here, we prepare a bimetalic platinum&#8208;aluminum salen complex (Alumiplatin) for cancer therapy&#8208;a combination of pro&#8208;senesence chemotherapy with in&#8197;situ senotherapy to avoid the side effects. The aluminum salen moiety, as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer, enhances the salen's ability to induce cancer cell senescence and this phenotype is in turn sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of the monofunctional platinum moiety. It exhibits an excellent capability for inducing senescence, a potent cytotoxic activity against cancer cells both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and an improved safety profile compared to cisplatin. Therefore, Alumiplatin may be a good candidate to be further developed into safe and effective anticancer agents. This novel combination of cell senescence inducers with genotoxic drugs revolutionizes the therapy options of designing multi&#8208;targeting anticancer agents to improve the efficacy of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Construction of Multi&#8208;enzyme Integrated Catalysts for Deracemization of Cyclic Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;enzyme cascade catalysis has become an important technique for chemical reactions used in manufacturing and scientific study. In this research, we designed a four&#8208;enzyme integrated catalyst and used it to catalyse the racemization reaction of cyclic chiral amines, where monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyses the selective oxidation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline (MTQ), imine reductase (IRED) catalyses the selective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (MDQ), formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is used for the cyclic regeneration of cofactors, and catalase (CAT) is used for decomposition of oxidative reactions. The four enzymes were immobilized via polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;encapsulated dendritic organosilica nanoparticles (DONs) as carriers, resulting in the amphiphilic core&#8208;shell catalysts. The hydrophilic PDA shell ensures the dispersion of the catalyst in water, and the hydrophobic DON core creates a microenvironment with the spatial confinement effect of the organic substrate and the preconcentration effect to enhance the stability of the enzymes and the catalytic efficiency. The core&#8208;shell structure improves the stability and reusability of the catalyst and rationally arranges the position of different enzymes according to the reaction sequence to improve the cascade catalytic performance and cofactor recovery efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational dynamics, energetics, and the divergent evolution of allosteric regulation: the case of the yeast MAPK family</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allosteric mechanisms provide finely&#8208;tuned control over signaling proteins. Proteins of the same family may share high sequence identity and structural similarity but show distinct traits of allosteric control and evolutionary divergent regulation. Revealing the determinants of such properties may be important to understand the molecular bases of different regulatory pathways.
Herein, we investigate whether and how evolutionarily&#8208;divergent traits of allosteric regulation in homologous proteins can be decoded in terms of internal dynamics and interaction networks that support functionally oriented conformations. In this framework, we start from the comparative analysis of the dynamics and energetics of the yeast MAP Kinases (MAPKs) Fus3 and Kss1 in their native basins. Importantly, distinctive dynamic and energetic stabilization features emerge, which can be related to the two proteins&#8217; differential ability to be phosphorylated and engage with the allosteric activator Ste5. We then expanded our study to other evolutionary&#8208;related MAPKs. We show that the dynamical and energetical traits defining the distinct regulatory profiles of Fus3 and Kss1 can be traced along their evolutionary tree. Overall, our approach is able to reconnect (latent) allostery with the principal elements of protein structural stabilization and dynamics, showing how allosteric regulation was encrypted in MAPKs structure well before Ste5 appearance.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Putative Bivalent Dicovalent Ligands for the Adenosine A1 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accumulating evidence suggests that G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) can exist and function in homodimer and heterodimer forms. The adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) has been shown to form both homodimers and heterodimers, but there is a lack of chemical tools to study these dimeric receptor populations. This work describes the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a novel class of bivalent GPCR chemical tools, where each ligand moiety of the bivalent compound contains a sulfonyl fluoride covalent warhead designed to be capable of simultaneously reacting with each A1R of an A1R homodimer. The novel compounds were characterised using radioligand binding assays, including washout assays, and functionally in cAMP assays. The bivalent dicovalent compounds were competitive A1R antagonists and showed evidence of covalent binding and simultaneous binding across an A1R homodimer. Greater selectivity for A1R over the adenosine A3 receptor was observed for bivalent dicovalent over the equivalent monovalent compounds, indicating subtype selectivity can be achieved with dual occupation by a bivalent dicovalent ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dynamic Plasticity of P. aeruginosa CueR Copper Transcription Factor upon Cofactor and DNA Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacteria use specialized proteins, like transcription factors, to rapidly control metal ion balance. CueR is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial copper regulator. The structure of E. coli CueR complexed with Cu(I) and DNA was published, since then many studies have shed light on its function. However, P. aeruginosa CueR, which shows high sequence similarity to E. coli CueR, has been less studied. Here, we applied room&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements to explore changes in dynamics of P. aeruginosa CueR in dependency of copper concentrations and interaction with two different DNA promoter regions. We showed that P. aeruginosa CueR is less dynamic than the E. coli CueR protein and exhibits much higher sensitivity to DNA binding as compared to its E. coli CueR homologue. Moreover, a difference in dynamical behavior was observed when P. aeruginosa CueR binds to the copZ2 DNA promoter sequence compared to the mexPQ&#8208;opmE promoter sequence. Such dynamical differences may affect the expression levels of CopZ2 and MexPQ&#8208;OpmE proteins in P. aeruginosa. Overall, such comparative measurements of protein&#8208;DNA complexes derived from different bacterial systems reveal insights about how structural and dynamical differences between two highly homologous proteins lead to quite different DNA sequence&#8208;recognition and mechanistic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Characterization and Identification of Key Active Site Residues of the L&#8208;aspartate N&#8208;hydroxylase, CreE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CreE is a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase (FMO) that catalyzes three sequential nitrogen oxidation reactions of L&#8208;aspartate to produce nitrosuccinate, contributing to the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial and antiproliferative nautral product, cremeomycin. This compound contains a highly reactive diazo functional group in which the reaction of CreE is essential to its formation. Nitro and diazo functional groups can serve as potent electrophiles, important in some challenging nucleophilic addition reactions. Formation of these reactive groups positions CreE as a promising candidate for biomedical and synthetic applications. Here, we present the catalytic mechanism of CreE and the identification of active site residues critical to binding L&#8208;aspartate, aiding in future enzyme engineering efforts. Steady&#8208;state analysis demonstrated that CreE is very specific for NADPH over NADH and performs a highly coupled reaction with L&#8208;aspartate. Analysis of the rapid&#8208;reaction kinetics showed that flavin reduction is very fast, along with the formation of the oxygenating species, the C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin. The slowest step observed was the dehydration of the flavin. Structural analysis and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis implicated T65, R291, and R440 in the binding L&#8208;aspartate. The data presented describes the catalytic mechanism and the active site architecture of this unique FMO.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Induced Suppression of PEG Crystallization from the Melt in a PEG&#8208;Peptide Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on PEG crystallization is examined for a peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate, YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3k comprising an amyloid peptide YYKLVFF linked to PEG with molar mass 3 kg mol&#8208;1. Remarkably, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous synchrotron small&#8208;angle/wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) show that crystallization of PEG is suppressed by &#945;CD, provided that the cyclodextrin content is sufficient. A hexagonal mesophase is formed instead. The &#945;CD threading reduces the conformational flexibility of PEG and hence suppresses crystallization. These results show that addition of cyclodextrins can be used to tune the crystallization of peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates and potentially other polymer/biomolecular hybrids.</dc:description>

         <title>AM404 Analogs as Activators of the 20S Isoform of the Human Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inducing an increase in 20S proteasome activity through gate opening can occur using lipophilic molecules. Described here are derivatives of AM&#8208;404 which retain 20S proteasome stimulation with decreased toxicity.







Abstract
The proteasome is a multisubunit protease system responsible for the majority of the protein turnover in eukaryotic organisms. Dysregulation of this enzymatic complex leads to protein accumulation, subsequent aggregation, and ultimately diseased states; for that reason, positive modulation of its activity has been recently investigated as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative and age&#8208;related diseases. The small molecule AM404 was recently identified as an activator of the 20S isoform of the proteasome and further exploration of the scaffold revealed the importance of the polyunsaturated fatty acid chain to elicit activity. Herein, we report the investigation of the aromatic region of the scaffold and the evaluation of the small molecules in a variety of proteasome activity and protein degradation assays. We found that derivatives A22 and A23, compared to AM404, exhibit enhanced proteasome activity in biochemical and cellular proteasome assays and more favorable cellular viability profiles. Additionally, these compounds demonstrate the ability to degrade intrinsically disordered proteins, regardless of their molecular weight, and the ability to restore the proteasome activity in the presence of toxic oligomeric &#945;&#8208;Syn species in a biochemical setting.

         <title>Co&#8208;Immobilization of ADH and GDH on Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework: An Effective Biocatalyst for Asymmetric Reduction of Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;composite material was prepared through in&#8197;situ co&#8208;immobilization of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework ZIF&#8208;8, the nano&#8208;cluster could serve as efficient heterogeneous reactor for asymmetric reduction of ketones, and can be recycled for several rounds.







Abstract
Chiral alcohols are not only important building blocks of various bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, but can serve as synthetic precursors for other valuable organic chemicals, thus the synthesis of these products is of great importance. Bio&#8208;catalysis represents one effective way to obtain these molecules, however, the weak stability and high cost of enzymes often hinder its broad application. In this work, we designed a biological nanoreactor by embedding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework ZIF&#8208;8. The biocatalyst ADH&amp;GDH@ZIF&#8208;8 could be applied to the asymmetric reduction of a series of ketones to give chiral alcohols in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;%). In addition, the heterogeneous biocatalyst could be recycled and reused at least four times with slight activity decline. Moreover, E.&#8197;coli containing ADH and GDH was immobilized by ZIF&#8208;8 to form biocatalyst E.&#8197;coli@ZIF&#8208;8, which also exhibits good catalytic behaviours. Finally, the chiral alcohols are further converted to marketed drugs (R)&#8208;Fendiline, (S)&#8208;Rivastigmine and NPS R&#8208;568 respectively.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Recognition Agents of Histamine: A Biopanning Approach with Enhanced Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Histamine is a biogenic amine that affects food quality and causes health problems. This study presents a unique biopanning method to identify histamine&#8208;binding peptides, excluding histidine&#8208;binding sequences. Synthesizing 12&#8208;mer peptides from selected phage sequences, our findings reveal these peptides as potential ligands for biosensor (SPR) applications.







Abstract
Histamine is a biogenic amine that poses a potential threat to public health due to its toxicological effects. In this study, we identified histamine&#8208;binding peptides by screening a random 12&#8208;mer peptide library, employing a novel biopanning approach that excluded histidine&#8208;binding sequences in the final round. This additional step enhanced the selectivity of the peptides and prevented interference from histidine during detection. The binding affinities of synthesized peptides to histamine were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Among the identified peptides, HBF10 (SGFRDGIEDFLW) and HBF26 (IPLENQHKIYST) showed significant affinity to histamine, with Ka values of 2.56&#215;104 (M&#8722;1) and 8.94&#215;104 (M&#8722;1), respectively. Notably, the identified peptides did not demonstrate binding affinity towards histidine, despite its structural similarity to histamine. Subsequently, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface was prepared by immobilizing the peptide HBF26 to investigate the potential of the peptide as a recognition agent for histamine detection. The findings suggest that the identified peptides have an affinity to histamine specifically, showcasing their potential applications as diagnostic agents with specific targeting capabilities.

The findings suggest that the identified peptides have an affinity to histamine specifically, showcasing their potential applications as diagnostic agents with specific targeting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Photoexcited 2&#8208;Chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Dinitrobenzoic Acid as a Chemical Deprenylase of i6A RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA modifications play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular homeostasis. &#160;Modulating RNA modifications, particularly by targeting the enzymes responsible for their catalysis, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. &#160;However, limitations, such as the lack of identified modifying enzymes and compensatory mechanisms, hinder targeted interventions. &#160;Chemical approaches independent of enzymatic activity offer an alternative strategy for RNA modification modulation. &#160;Here, we present the identification of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzoic acid as a highly effective photochemical deprenylase of i6A RNA. &#160;This method demonstrates exceptional selectivity towards i6A, converting its substituent into a "N&#8208;doped" ozonide, which upon hydrolysis releases natural adenine. &#160;We believe that this chemical approach will pave the way for a better understanding of RNA modification biology and the development of novel therapeutic modalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium of human cystatin C during internalization into cancer cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human cystatin C (hCC) is a physiologically important protein that serves as intra&#8208; and extracellular cysteine proteinase inhibitor in homeostasis. However, in pathological states it dimerizes and further oligomerizes accumulating into a toxic amyloid. HCC forms an active monomer in the extracellular space and becomes an inactive dimer when internalized in cellular organelles. However, hCC cell penetration and its oligomeric state during this process are not well understood.&#160; To determine if and how the oligomeric state influences hCC transmembrane migration, we investigated the internalization of the hCC wild type protein as well as three different mutants, which exclusively exist in the monomeric or multimeric state into HeLa cells via confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results showed that the preferred pathway was endocytosis and that the oligomeric state did not significantly influence the internalization because both monomeric and dimeric hCC migrated into HeLa cells. Considering the differences of the active monomeric and the passive dimeric states of hCC, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the intra and extra cellular functions of hCC and their interaction with cysteine proteases.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Benchmark G4 Probes and G4 Clinical Drugs using three Biophysical Methods: A Guideline to Evaluate Rapidly G4&#8208;Binding Affinity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We conducted a systematic affinity ranking of 11&#8197;popular G4 ligands vs 5&#8197;classical G4 sequences using FRET&#8208;melting, G4&#8208;FID assays and SPR. This comparative study enables the establishment of a precise affinity ranking of ligands while also highlighting discrepancies attributable to the limitations and characteristics of each assay.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures (G4) are proven to interfere with most genetic and epigenetic processes. Small molecules binding these structures (G4 ligands) are invaluable tools to probe G4&#8208;biology and address G4&#8208;druggability in various diseases (cancer, viral infections). However, the large number of reported G4 ligands (&gt;1000) could lead to confusion while selecting one for a given application. Herein we conducted a systematic affinity ranking of 11&#8197;popular G4 ligands vs 5&#8197;classical G4 sequences using FRET&#8208;melting, G4&#8208;FID assays and SPR. Interestingly SPR data globally align with the rankings obtained from the two semi&#8208;quantitative assays despite discrepancies due to limits and characteristics of each assay. In the whole, PhenDC3 emerges as the most potent binder irrespective of the G4 sequence. Immediately below PDS, PDC&#8208;360A, BRACO19, TMPyP4 and RHPS4 feature strong to medium binding again with poor G4 topology discrimination. More strikingly, the G4 drugs Quarfloxin, CX5461 and c&#8208;PDS exhibit weak affinity with all G4s studied. Finally, NMM and Cu&#8208;ttpy showed heterogeneous behaviors due, in part, to their physicochemical particularities poorly compatible with screening conditions. The remarkable properties of PhenDC3 led us to propose its use for benchmarking FRET&#8208;melting and G4&#8208;FID assays for rapid G4&#8208;affinity evaluation of newly developed ligands.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Delivery of Glut1 SiRNA Facilitates Glucose Starvation Therapy in Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AuNPs@anti&#8208;miR&#8208;21/siGlut1 nanoparticle delivers siRNA against Glut1 via miR&#8208;21 triggering a toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction for lung cancer starvation therapy. The knockdown of Glut1 limits glucose uptake, and the AuNPs accelerate intracellular glucose consumption. Notably, the AuNPs@anti&#8208;miR&#8208;21/siGlut1 significantly inhibits A549 cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, underscoring its potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.







Abstract
Glucose transporter protein&#8208;1 (Glut1), is highly expressed in many cancer types and plays a crucial role in cancer progression through enhanced glucose transport. Its overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Herein, the nucleic acids modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was synthesized to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Glut1 by microRNA 21 (miR&#8208;21) triggers toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction for lung cancer starvation therapy. Overexpression of miR&#8208;21 triggers toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, releasing the siRNA to knockdown of Glut1 in cancer cell instead of normal cell. Furthermore, the glucose oxidase&#8208;like activity of the AuNPs accelerates intracellular glucose consumption, promoting cancer cell starvation. The engineered AuNPs@anti&#8208;miR&#8208;21/siGlut1 complex inhibits cancer cell proliferation, xenograft tumor growth and promotes apoptosis through glucose starvation and ROS cascade signaling, underscoring its potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.

         <title>Utilization of Free and Dipeptide&#8211;Bound Formyline and Pyrraline by Saccharomyces Yeasts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of the glycated amino acids formyline and pyrraline as well as their peptide&#8211;bound derivatives by 14 Saccharomyces yeasts, including 6 beer yeasts (bottom and top fermenting), one wine yeast, 6&#8197;strains isolated from natural habitats and one laboratory reference yeast strain (wild type) was investigated. All yeasts were able to metabolize glycated amino acids via the Ehrlich pathway to the corresponding Ehrlich metabolites. While formyline and small amounts of pyrraline entered the yeast cells via passive diffusion, the amounts of dipeptide&#8211;bound MRPs, especially the dipeptides glycated at the C&#8208;terminus, decreased much faster, indicating an uptake into the yeast cells. Furthermore, the glycation&#8208;mediated hydrophobization in general leads to an faster degradation rate compared to the native lysine dipeptides. While the utilization of free formyline is yeast&#8208;specific, the amounts of (glycated) dipeptides decreased faster in the presence of brewer&#8216;s yeasts, which also showed a higher formation rate of Ehrlich metabolites compared to naturally isolated strains. Due to rapid uptake of alanyl dipeptides, it can be assumed that the Ehrlich enzyme system of naturally isolated yeasts is overloaded and the intracellularly released MRP is primarily excreted from the cell. This indicates adaptation of technologically used yeasts to (glycated) dipeptides as a nitrogen source.

         <title>Overcoming Solubility Challenges: Liposomal isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole as a Promising Anti&#8208;Tumor Agent for Inoperable and Radiation&#8208;Insensitive cancers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
IsoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole, an analog of isoCA&#8208;4 anti&#8208;tumor agent, is encapsulated into liposomes to overcome its low solubility. In vitro experiments show that loaded liposomes exhibit similar activity to the free form on several human tumor cell lines. In vivo experiments using a palliative intratumoral injection chemotherapy approach demonstrate that isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole loaded liposomes significantly reduce tumor growth in a CA&#8208;4&#8208;resistant HT29 model.







Abstract
This study evaluated the potential of isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole, a diheterocyclic analog of isoCA&#8208;4, as an anti&#8208;tumor agent. To overcome its low aqueous solubility, liposomes were developed as a delivery system for the compound. In vitro experiments showed that loaded liposomes exhibited similar activity to the free form on multiple human tumor cell lines. In vivo experiments using a palliative intratumoral injection chemotherapy approach further demonstrated that isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole loaded liposomes significantly reduced tumor growth in a CA&#8208;4&#8208;resistant HT29&#8197;cell model, without inducing any observable toxicity or weight loss in the treated mice. These findings suggest that liposomal isoCoQ&#8208;Carbazole may hold promise as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of inoperable, radiation&#8208;insensitive cancers.

         <dc:description>
Identifying the drug&#8208;target interactome of small molecule therapeutics is essential for understanding the full pharmacological effects of a compound. Here we provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of current methods to measure drug interactomes, and a practical step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol for using the BioTAC system to assist with drug target and interactome ID.







Abstract
Identifying the drug&#8208;target interactome of small molecule therapeutics is essential for understanding the full pharmacological effects of a compound. These therapies often induce changes within the cellular proteome, leading to unexpected consequences such as changes in the targets complexation state or off&#8208;target interactions between the compound and additional proteins. Currently, unbiased target&#8208;ID approaches are being used to embark on this task. Here we provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of these methods, and a practical step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol for using the BioTAC system to assist with drug target and interactome ID.

         <title>Bile Salt Hydrolase Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Monitoring Gut Microbial Bile Acid Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) is an important microbial enzyme expressed by the gut microbiota that controls secondary bile acid metabolism in the gut. A panel of activity&#8208;based probes and a click chemistry&#8208;based, fluorescent activity assay reveals that BSH activity exhibits diurnal rhythmicity, and its substrate preferences are regulated by circadian rhythms.







Abstract
Bile acids are bioactive metabolites that are biotransformed into secondary bile acids by the gut microbiota, a vast consortium of microbes that inhabit the intestines. The first step in intestinal secondary bile acid metabolism is carried out by a critical enzyme, bile salt hydrolase (BSH), that catalyzes the gateway reaction that precedes all subsequent microbial metabolism of these important metabolites. As gut microbial metabolic activity is difficult to probe due to the complex nature of the gut microbiome, approaches are needed to profile gut microbiota&#8208;associated enzymes such as BSH. Here, we develop a panel of BSH activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) to determine how changes in diurnal rhythmicity of gut microbiota&#8208;associated metabolism affects BSH activity and substrate preference. This panel of covalent probes enables determination of BSH activity and substrate specificity from multiple gut anerobic bacteria derived from the human and mouse gut microbiome. We found that both gut microbiota&#8208;associated BSH activity and substrate preference is rhythmic, likely due to feeding patterns of the mice. These results indicate that this ABP&#8208;based approach can be used to profile changes in BSH activity in physiological and disease states that are regulated by circadian rhythms.

         <title>Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant Arylamines Enabled by a Nitroreductase from Bacillus tequilensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitroreductase from Bacillus tequilensis, named BtNR, enabled the synthesis of arylamines from bulky nitroarenes with good conversions and isolated yields. These enzymatically prepared arylamines are valuable synthons for the production of pharmaceutically active compounds, such as the antibiotic linezolid and the anticancer drugs vismodegib and sonidegib.







Abstract
Arylamines are essential building blocks for the manufacture of valuable pharmaceuticals, pigments and dyes. However, their current industrial production involves the use of chemocatalytic procedures with a significant environmental impact. As a result, flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductases (NRs) have received increasing attention as sustainable catalysts for more ecofriendly synthesis of arylamines. In this study, we assessed a novel NR from Bacillus tequilensis, named BtNR, for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant arylamines, including valuable synthons used in the manufacture of blockbuster drugs such as vismodegib, sonidegib, linezolid and sildenafil. After optimizing the enzymatic reaction conditions, high conversion of nitroaromatics to arylamines (up to 97&#8201;%) and good product yields (up to 56&#8201;%) were achieved. Our results indicate that BtNR has a broad substrate scope, including bulky nitro benzenes, nitro pyrazoles and nitro pyridines. Hence, BtNR is an interesting biocatalyst for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant amine&#8208;functionalized aromatics, providing an attractive alternative to traditional chemical synthesis methodologies.

         <title>Glutamic Acid Modified Gold Nanorod Sensor for the Detection of Calcium ions in Neuronal Cells</title>

The efficacy of GA&#8208;GNR as a probe for selective detection of calcium ions is investigated in neuron cell lysate and a novel portable calcium sensor prototype is devised.







Abstract
Calcium (Ca2+) ions play a crucial role in the functioning of neurons, governing various aspects of neuronal activity such as rapid modulation and alterations in gene expression. Ca2+ signaling has a significant impact on the development of diseases and the impairment of neuronal functions. Herein, the study reports a Ca2+ ion sensor in neuronal cells using a gold nanorod. The gold nanorod (GA&#8208;GNR) conjugated glutamic acid developed in the study was used as a nano&#8208;bio probe for the experimental and in&#8197;vitro detection of calcium. The nanosensor is colloidally stable, preserves plasmonic properties, and shows good viability in neuronal cells, as well as promoting neuron cell line growth. The cytotoxicity and cell penetration of the nanosensor are studied using Raman spectroscopy, brightfield and darkfield microscopy imaging, and MTT assays. The quantification of Ca2+ ions in neuronal cells is determined by monitoring the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the GA&#8208;GNR. The change in the intensity profile in the presence of Ca2+ incubated neurons was effectively used to develop a portable prototype of an optical Ca2+ sensor, proposing it as a tool for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and neuromodulation evaluation.

It is known that lncRNAs can not only form RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplexes, but above all RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triplexes to perform regulatory functions.

Abstract
Long non&#8208;coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and can associate with DNA as RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplexes or RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triple helix structures. Here, we review in&#8197;vitro biochemical and biophysical experiments including electromobility shift assays (EMSA), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, thermal melting analysis, microscale thermophoresis (MST), single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triple helix and RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplex formation. We present the investigations of the antiparallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA MEG3 targeting the gene TGFB2 and the parallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA Fendrr with its target gene Emp2. The thermodynamic properties of these oligonucleotides lead to concentration&#8208;dependent heterogeneous mixtures, where a DNA duplex, an RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplex and an RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triplex coexist and their relative populations are modulated in a temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The in&#8197;vitro data provide a reliable readout of triplex structures, as RNA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA triplexes show distinct features compared to DNA duplexes and RNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA heteroduplexes. Our experimental results can be used to validate computationally predicted triple helix formation between novel disease&#8208;relevant lncRNAs and their DNA target genes.

         <title>Molecular Basis for Chemoselectivity Control in Oxidations of Internal Aryl&#8208;Alkenes Catalyzed by Laboratory Evolved P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational modelling involving density functional theory (DFT) calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, are used to investigate and decipher the mechanism for chemoselectivity control achieved by a set of laboratory evolved P450s for selective allylic C&#8722;H hydroxylation vs. epoxidation and carbonyl formation of internal aryl&#8208;alkenes.







Abstract
P450 enzymes naturally perform selective hydroxylations and epoxidations of unfunctionalized hydrocarbon substrates, among other reactions. The adaptation of P450 enzymes to a particular oxidative reaction involving alkenes is of great interest for the design of new synthetically useful biocatalysts. However, the mechanism that these enzymes utilize to precisely modulate the chemoselectivity and distinguishing between competing alkene double bond epoxidations and allylic C&#8722;H hydroxylations is sometimes not clear, which hampers the rational design of specific biocatalysts. In a previous work, a P450 from Labrenzia aggregata (P450LA1) was engineered in the laboratory using directed evolution to catalyze the direct oxidation of trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylstyrene to phenylacetone. The final variant, KS, was able to overcome the intrinsic preference for alkene epoxidation to directly generate a ketone product via the formation of a highly reactive carbocation intermediate. Here, additional library screening along this evolutionary lineage permitted to serendipitously detect a mutation that overcomes epoxidation and carbonyl formation by exhibiting a large selectivity of 94&#8201;% towards allylic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. A multiscalar computational methodology was applied to reveal the molecular basis towards this hydroxylation preference. Enzyme modelling suggests that introduction of a bulky substitution dramatically changes the accessible conformations of the substrate in the active site, thus modifying the enzymatic selectivity towards terminal hydroxylation and avoiding the competing epoxidation pathway, which is sterically hindered.

         <title>Efficient Transferase Engineering for SAM Analog Synthesis from Iodoalkanes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient enzyme engineering generates transferases with orders of magnitude higher activity for various substrates in just one round of engineering. The engineered enzymes are highly stereoselective and enable SAM analog (re)generation with iodoalkanes. The enzymes and methods reported might further advance the field of biocatalytic alkylation chemistry with &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; alkylating reagents.







Abstract
S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) is an important cosubstrate in various biochemical processes, including selective methyl transfer reactions. Simple methods for the (re)generation of SAM analogs could expand the chemistry accessible with SAM&#8208;dependent transferases and go beyond methylation reactions. Here we present an efficient enzyme engineering strategy to synthesize different SAM analogs from &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; iodoalkanes through enzymatic alkylation of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH). This was achieved by mutating multiple hydrophobic and structurally dynamic amino acids simultaneously. Combinatorial mutagenesis was guided by the natural amino acid diversity and generated a highly functional mutant library. This approach increased the speed as well as the scale of enzyme engineering by providing a panel of optimized enzymes with orders of magnitude higher activities for multiple substrates in just one round of enzyme engineering. The optimized enzymes exhibit catalytic efficiencies up to 31&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, convert various iodoalkanes, including substrates bearing cyclopropyl or aromatic moieties, and catalyze S&#8208;alkylation of SAH with very high stereoselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;de). We further report a high throughput chromatographic screening system for reliable and rapid SAM analog analysis. We believe that the methods and enzymes described herein will further advance the field of selective biocatalytic alkylation chemistry by enabling SAM analog regeneration with &#8220;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf&#8221; reagents.

         <title>Enhancing PET Degrading Enzymes: A Combinatory Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Combinatory Protein Engineering Approach was employed to enhance a PET&#8208;degrading enzyme using structure&#8208;based rational design, ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;based techniques. This resulted in Combi&#8208;PETase, exhibiting optimized catalytic performance, thermal stability, and protein yields. Such a combinatory approach provides a greater chance of successfully enhancing enzymatic properties for future industrial applications.







Abstract
Plastic waste has become a substantial environmental issue. A potential strategy to mitigate this problem is to use enzymatic hydrolysis of plastics to depolymerize post&#8208;consumer waste and allow it to be reused. Over the last few decades, the use of enzymatic PET&#8208;degrading enzymes has shown promise as a great solution for creating a circular plastic waste economy. PsPETase from Piscinibacter sakaiensis has been identified as an enzyme with tremendous potential for such applications. But to improve its efficiency, enzyme engineering has been applied aiming at enhancing its thermal stability, enzymatic activity, and ease of production. Here, we combine different strategies such as structure&#8208;based rational design, ancestral sequence reconstruction and machine learning to engineer a more highly active Combi&#8208;PETase variant with a melting temperature of 70&#8201;&#176;C and optimal performance at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that these approaches, commonly used in other works of enzyme engineering, are most effective when utilized in combination, enabling the improvement of enzymes for industrial applications.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Gene Reporter&#8208;Amplifier Architecture for Enhancing the Sensitivity of Molecular MRI by Water Exchange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>

MRI reporters are essential for the noninvasive examination of biological functions in deep tissues. Unfortunately, current reporters suffer from low sensitivity. To improve sensitivity, we developed an all&#8208;genetic approach that combines heightened cellular paramagnetism with enhanced transmembrane water diffusion. Our approach significantly increases the MRI contrast, enabling the detection of sparse cells that are undetectable using conventional MRI reporters.







Abstract
The development of genetic reporters for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for investigating biological functions in&#8197;vivo. However, current MRI reporters have low sensitivity, making it challenging to create significant contrast against the tissue background, especially when only a small fraction of cells express the reporter. To overcome this limitation, we developed an approach for amplifying the sensitivity of molecular MRI by combining a chemogenetic contrast mechanism with a biophysical approach to increase water diffusion through the co&#8208;expression of a dual&#8208;gene construct comprising an organic anion transporting polypeptide, Oatp1b3, and a water channel, Aqp1. We first show that the expression of Aqp1 amplifies MRI contrast in cultured cells engineered to express Oatp1b3. We demonstrate that the contrast amplification is caused by Aqp1&#8208;driven increase in water exchange, which provides the gadolinium ions internalized by Oatp1b3&#8208;expressing cells with access to a larger water pool compared with exchange&#8208;limited conditions. We further show that our methodology allows cells to be detected using approximately 10&#8208;fold lower concentrations of gadolinium than that in the Aqp1&#8208;free scenario. Finally, we show that our approach enables the imaging of mixed&#8208;cell cultures containing a low fraction of Oatp1b3&#8208;labeled cells that are undetectable on the basis of Oatp1b3 expression alone.

         <title>Investigating the Potential of Phenolic Compounds and Carbohydrates as Acceptor Substrates for Levansucrase&#8208;Catalyzed Transfructosylation Reaction
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Levansucrases from Gluconobacter oxydans, Vibrio natriegens, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, and Paraburkholderia graminis were used to catalyze the transfructosylation of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates. The selected phenolic acceptor substrates were successfully glycosylated with up to five fructosyl groups transferred from the sucrose donor substrate. The transfructosylation of carbohydrates acceptors produced fructosylated trisaccharides that can act as low&#8208;calorie sugar substitutes and/or prebiotic ingredients.







Abstract
This study characterizes the acceptor specificity of levansucrases (LSs) from Gluconobacter oxydans (LS1), Vibrio natriegens (LS2), Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (LS3), and Paraburkholderia graminis (LS4) using sucrose as fructosyl donor and selected phenolic compounds and carbohydrates as acceptors. Overall, V. natriegens LS2 proved to be the best biocatalyst for the transfructosylation of phenolic compounds. More than one fructosyl unit could be attached to fructosylated phenolic compounds. The transfructosylation of epicatechin by P. graminis LS4 resulted in the most diversified products, with up to five fructosyl units transferred. In addition to the LS source, the acceptor specificity of LS towards phenolic compounds and their transfructosylation products were found to greatly depend on their chemical structure: the number of phenolic rings, the reactivity of hydroxyl groups and the presence of aliphatic chains or methoxy groups. Similarly, for carbohydrates, the transfructosylation yield was dependent on both the LS source and the acceptor type. The highest yield of fructosylated&#8208;trisaccharides was Erlose from the transfructosylation of maltose catalyzed by LS2, with production reaching 200&#8197;g/L. LS2 was more selective towards the transfructosylation of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates, while reactions catalyzed by LS1, LS3 and LS4 also produced fructooligosaccharides. This study shows the high potential for the application of LSs in the glycosylation of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates.

         <title>Why Does Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Catalyze the Oxidation of Some Tetrahydropyridines?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unifying hypothesis for the mechanism of monoamine oxidize (MAO) catalyzed oxidations is presented. Most 1&#176; and 2&#176; amines are oxidized by MAO via a polar pathway; 3&#176; amines are generally not substrates. However, for tetrahydropyridines (and similarly structured amines), an otherwise unfavorable electron transfer pathway is driven by a facile deprotonation (Le Chatelier's principle) because the resulting neutral radicals are exceptionally stable.







Abstract
Results pertaining to the mechanism of the oxidation of the tertiary amine 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MMTP, a close analog of the Parkinsonism inducing compound MPTP) by 3&#8208;methyllumiflavin (3MLF), a chemical model for the FAD cofactor of monoamine oxidase, are reported. MMTP and related compounds are among the few tertiary amines that are monoamine oxidase B (MAO&#8722;B) substrates. The MMTP/3MLF reaction is catalytic in the presence of O2 and the results under anaerobic conditions strongly suggest the involvement of radical intermediates, consistent with a single electron transfer mechanism. These observations support a new hypothesis to explain the MAO&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amines. In general, electron transfer is thermodynamically unfavorable, and as a result, most 1&#176; and 2&#176; amines react via one of the currently accepted polar pathways. Steric constraints prevent 3&#176; amines from reacting via a polar pathway. Those select 3&#176; amines that are MAO substrates possess certain structural features (e.&#8201;g., a C&#8722;H bond that is &#945;&#8208; both to nitrogen and a C=C) that dramatically lower the pKa of the corresponding radical cation. Consequently, the thermodynamically unfavorable electron transfer equilibrium is driven towards products by an extremely favorable deprotonation step in the context of Le Chatelier's principle.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;independent CRISPR&#8208;Associated Protein Labeling for Presentation and Co&#8208;delivery of Molecules Toward Genetic and Epigenetic Regulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic method for non&#8208;covalently labeling CRISPR enzymes with small molecules and oligonucleotides. Labeling with a reporter small molecule enables probing bacterial protein expression in realtime. CRISPR enzyme's DNA targeting activity helps deliver small molecules to the mammalian cell nucleus for prospective epigenetic applications. The new oligonucleotide labeling method is crucial for CRISPR&#8208;mediated DNA repair applications.







Abstract
Labeling of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) associated proteins (Cas) remains an immense challenge for their genome engineering applications. To date, cysteine&#8208;mediated bioconjugation is the most efficient strategy for labeling Cas proteins. However, introducing a cysteine residue in the protein at the right place might be challenging without perturbing the enzymatic activity. We report a method that does not require cysteine residues for small molecule presentation on the CRISPR&#8208;associated protein SpCas9 for in&#8197;vitro protein detection, probing cellular protein expression, and nuclear co&#8208;delivery of molecules in mammalian cells. We repurposed a simple protein purification tag His6 peptide for non&#8208;covalent labeling of molecules on the CRISPR enzyme SpCas9. The small molecule labeling enabled us to rapidly detect SpCas9 in a biochemical assay. We demonstrate that small molecule labeling can be utilized for probing bacterial protein expression in realtime. Furthermore, we coupled SpCas9&#8217;s nuclear&#8208;targeting ability in co&#8208;delivering the presenting small molecules to the mammalian cell nucleus for prospective genome engineering applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the method can be generalized to label oligonucleotides for multiplexing CRISPR&#8208;based genome editing and template&#8208;mediated DNA repair applications. This work paves the way for genomic loci&#8208;specific bioactive small molecule and oligonucleotide co&#8208;delivery toward genetic and epigenetic regulations.

         <title>Cobalamins Function as Allosteric Activators of an Angelman Syndrome&#8208;Associated UBE3A/E6AP Variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a high&#8208;throughput screen, cobalamins (vitamin B12 derivatives) were identified as activators of an E6AP variant with compromised ubiquitin ligase activity that has been causally associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder, the Angelman syndrome. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass spectrometry approaches (qXL&#8208;MS, LiP&#8208;MS) show that cobalamins affect the structural dynamics of E6AP and provide a first indication as to which region of E6AP they bind.







Abstract
Genetic aberrations of the maternal UBE3A allele, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP, are the cause of Angelman syndrome (AS), an imprinting disorder. In most cases, the maternal UBE3A allele is not expressed. Yet, approximately 10 percent of AS individuals harbor distinct point mutations in the maternal allele resulting in the expression of full&#8208;length E6AP variants that frequently display compromised ligase activity. In a high&#8208;throughput screen, we identified cyanocobalamin, a vitamin B12&#8208;derivative, and several alloxazine derivatives as activators of the AS&#8208;linked E6AP&#8208;F583S variant. Furthermore, we show by cross&#8208;linking coupled to mass spectrometry that cobalamins affect the structural dynamics of E6AP&#8208;F583S and apply limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry to obtain information about the regions of E6AP that are involved in, or are affected by binding cobalamins and alloxazine derivatives. Our data suggest that dietary supplementation with vitamin B12 can be beneficial for AS individuals.

&lt;p&gt;In a high-throughput screen, cobalamins (vitamin B12 derivatives) were identified as activators of an E6AP variant with compromised ubiquitin ligase activity that has been causally associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder, the Angelman syndrome. State-of-the-art mass spectrometry approaches (qXL-MS, LiP-MS) show that cobalamins affect the structural dynamics of E6AP and provide a first indication as to which region of E6AP they bind.

&lt;p&gt;Genetic aberrations of the maternal UBE3A allele, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP, are the cause of Angelman syndrome (AS), an imprinting disorder. In most cases, the maternal UBE3A allele is not expressed. Yet, approximately 10 percent of AS individuals harbor distinct point mutations in the maternal allele resulting in the expression of full-length E6AP variants that frequently display compromised ligase activity. In a high-throughput screen, we identified cyanocobalamin, a vitamin B12-derivative, and several alloxazine derivatives as activators of the AS-linked E6AP-F583S variant. Furthermore, we show by cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry that cobalamins affect the structural dynamics of E6AP-F583S and apply limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry to obtain information about the regions of E6AP that are involved in, or are affected by binding cobalamins and alloxazine derivatives.

         <title>Bacterial Glycolipid Acting on Protein Transport Across Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Escherichia coli inner membranes, diacylglycerol (DAG) and a glycolipid, named membrane protein integrase (MPIase), particularly influence membrane protein transport. This review explores the mechanisms of membrane protein integration mediated by these factors, and the methods and results of physicochemical analysis are presented.







Abstract
The process of protein transport across membranes involves a variety of factors and has been extensively investigated. Traditionally, proteinaceous translocons and chaperones have been recognized as crucial factors in this process. However, recent studies have highlighted the significant roles played by lipids and a glycolipid present in biological membranes in membrane protein transport. Membrane lipids can influence transport efficiency by altering the physicochemical properties of membranes. Notably, our studies have revealed that diacylglycerol (DAG) attenuates mobility in the membrane core region, leading to a dramatic suppression of membrane protein integration. Conversely, a glycolipid in Escherichia coli inner membranes, named membrane protein integrase (MPIase), enhances integration not only through the alteration of membrane properties but also via direct interactions with membrane proteins. This review explores the mechanisms of membrane protein integration mediated by membrane lipids, specifically DAG, and MPIase. Our results, along with the employed physicochemical analysis methods such as fluorescence measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance, surface plasmon resonance, and docking simulation, are presented to elucidate these mechanisms.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;conjugated Nanoparticle Platforms for Targeted Delivery, Imaging, and Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) are promising platforms for biomedical applications such as drug/gene delivery, targeting, sensing, and imaging. These NPs can offer high specificity, lower toxicity, biocompatibility, and stimuli responsive behavior as therapeutic and diagnostic tools. They can provide non&#8208;invasive detection and monitoring of diseases including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders.







Abstract
Peptides have become an indispensable tool in engineering of multifunctional nanostructure platforms for biomedical applications such as targeted drug and gene delivery, imaging and biosensing. They can be covalently incorporated into a variety of nanoparticles (NPs) including polymers, metallic nanoparticles, and others. Using different bioconjugation techniques, multifunctional peptide&#8208;modified NPs can be formulated to produce therapeutical and diagnostic platforms offering high specificity, lower toxicity, biocompatibility, and stimuli responsive behavior. Targeting peptides can direct the nanoparticles into specific tissues for targeted drug and gene delivery and imaging applications due to their specificity towards certain receptors. Furthermore, due to their stimuli&#8208;responsive features, they can offer controlled release of therapeutics into desired sites of disease. In addition, peptide&#8208;based biosensors and imaging agents can provide non&#8208;invasive detection and monitoring of diseases including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders. In this review, we covered the design and formulation of recent peptide&#8208;based NP platforms, as well as their utilization in in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo applications such as targeted drug and gene delivery, targeting, sensing, and imaging applications. In the end, we provided the future outlook to design new peptide conjugated nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

         <title>Halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles: Valuable Compounds to Access Biologically Relevant Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 10, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are emerging scaffolds with a wide range of applications in the Life Science. In this review, we explore the synthesis, the functionalization, and the applications of halo&#8208;triazole derivatives in biologically relevant molecules including nucleosides, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;triazole is an important building block in organic chemistry. It is now well known as a bioisostere for various functions, such as the amide or the ester bond, positioning it as a key pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry and it has found applications in various fields including life sciences. Attention was first focused on the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole molecules however 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have now emerged as valuable molecules due to the possibility to expand the structural modularity. In the last decade, methods mainly derived from the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction have been developed to access halo&#8208;triazole compounds and have been applied to nucleosides, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins. In addition, late&#8208;stage modification of halo&#8208;triazole derivatives by metal&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling or halo&#8208;exchange reactions offer the possibility to access highly functionalized molecules that can be used as tools for chemical biology. This review summarizes the synthesis, the functionalization, and the applications of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in biologically relevant molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1,4,5-trisubstituted halo-1,2,3-triazoles&lt;/b&gt; are emerging scaffolds with a wide range of applications in the Life Science. In this review, we explore the synthesis, the functionalization, and the applications of halo-triazole derivatives in biologically relevant molecules including nucleosides, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,2,3-triazole is an important building block in organic chemistry. It is now well known as a bioisostere for various functions, such as the amide or the ester bond, positioning it as a key pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry and it has found applications in various fields including life sciences. Attention was first focused on the synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole molecules however 1,4,5-trisubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles have now emerged as valuable molecules due to the possibility to expand the structural modularity. In the last decade, methods mainly derived from the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction have been developed to access halo-triazole compounds and have been applied to nucleosides, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins. In addition, late-stage modification of halo-triazole derivatives by metal-mediated cross-coupling or halo-exchange reactions offer the possibility to access highly functionalized molecules that can be used as tools for chemical biology. This review summarizes the synthesis, the functionalization, and the applications of 1,4,5-trisubstituted halo-1,2,3-triazoles in biologically relevant molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly Sensitive and Selective Fluorescent Sensor for Folic Acid Detection Based on D&#8208;penicillamine Stabilized Ag/Cu Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a highly sensitive and selective method for detecting folic acid (FA) was developed using D&#8208;penicillamine (DPA) stabilized Ag/Cu alloy nanoclusters (DPA@Ag/Cu NCs). The yellow emission of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs was found to be quenched upon the addition of FA to the system. The fluorescence intensity quenching value demonstrated a linear relationship with FA concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1200 &#956;M,&#160;with a limit of detection&#160;(LOD) of 5.3 nM. Furthermore, the detection mechanism was investigated through various characterization analyses, including high resolution transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence spectra, ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectra, and fluorescence lifetime. The results indicated that the fluorescence quenching induced by FA was a result of electron transfer from FA to the ligands of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs.&#160;The selectivity of the FA sensor was also evaluated, showing that common amino acids and inorganic ions had minimal impact on the detection of FA. Moreover, the standard addition method was successfully applied to detect FA in human serum, chewable tablets and FA tablets with promising results. The use of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs demonstrates significant potential for detecting FA in complex biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>In Silico Study of the Early Stages of Aggregation of &#946;&#8208;Sheet Forming Antimicrobial Peptide GL13K</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge repulsion controls GL13K aggregation from a dynamic equilibria of small multimers to irreversible formation of larger aggregates. Sequence dictates stabilization of a folded&#8208;over conformation with potential relevance to AMP function.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are of growing interest as potential candidates that may offer more resilience against antimicrobial resistance than traditional antibiotic agents. In this article, we perform the first in&#8197;silico study of the synthetic &#223; sheet&#8208;forming AMP GL13K. Through atomistic simulations of single and multi&#8208;peptide systems under different conditions, we are able to shine a light on the short timescales of early aggregation. We find that isolated peptide conformations are primarily dictated by sequence rather than charge, whereas changing charge has a significant impact on the conformational free energy landscape of multi&#8208;peptide systems. We demonstrate that the loss of charge&#8208;charge repulsion is a sufficient minimal model for experimentally observed aggregation. Overall, our work explores the molecular biophysical underpinnings of the first stages of aggregation of a unique AMP, laying necessary groundwork for its further development as an antibiotic candidate.

         <title>The PR&#8208;10 Protein Pru p 1&#8201;is an Endonuclease that Preferentially Cleaves Single&#8211;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the function of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1, a PR&#8208;10 protein from peach, identifying it as an endonuclease that preferentially cleaves single&#8208;stranded substrate RNAs. Employing mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate its preference for generating short oligonucleotides and reveal details of RNA binding and cleavage. Our findings, supported by a structure&#8211;based model, offer the first experimental insights into the mechanism by which PR&#8208;10 proteins engage in ribonuclease activity.







Abstract
Pathogenesis&#8211;related class 10 (PR&#8208;10) proteins play a crucial role in plant defense by acting as ribonucleases. The specific mechanism of action and substrate specificity of these proteins have remained largely unexplored so far. In this study, we elucidate the enzymatic activity of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1, a PR&#8208;10 protein from peach. We demonstrate that this protein catalyzes the endonucleolytic backbone cleavage of RNA substrates into short oligonucleotides. Initial cleavage products, identified through kinetic analysis, can bind again, priming them for further degradation. NMR binding site mapping reveals that the large internal cavity of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1, which is characteristic for PR&#8208;10 proteins, serves as an anchoring site for single&#8211;stranded ribonucleotide chains. We propose a structure&#8208;based mechanistic model that accounts for the observed cleavage patterns and the inhibitory effect of zeatin, a nucleoside analog, on the ribonuclease activity of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;guided&#160;Redesign of an Omega&#8208;transaminase from  Bacillus megaterium &#160;for the&#160;Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) are attractive biocatalysts asymmetrically catalyzing ketones to chiral amines. However, poor non&#8208;native catalytic activity and substrate promiscuity severely hamper its wide application in industrial production. Protein engineering efforts have generally focused on reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pockets of &#969;&#8208;TAs. However, hotspots around the substrate tunnel as well as distant sites outside the pockets may also affect its activity. In this study, the &#969;&#8208;TA from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTA) was selected for engineering. The tunnel mutation Y164F synergy with distant mutation A245T which was acquired through a multiple sequence alignment showed improved soluble expression, a 3.7&#8208;fold higher specific activity and a 19.9&#8208;fold longer half&#8208;life at 45&#8451;. Molecule Dynamics simulation explains the mechanism of improved catalytic activity, enhanced thermostability and improved soluble expression of BmeTAY164F/A245T(2M). Finally, the resting cells of 2M were used for biocatalytic processes. 450 mM of S&#8208;methoxyisopropylamine (S&#8208;MOIPA) was obtained with an ee value of 97.3% and a conversion rate of 90%, laying the foundation for its industrial production. Mutant 2M was also found to be more advantageous in catalyzing the transamination of various ketones. These results demonstrated that sites that are far away from the active center also play an important role in the redesign of &#969;&#8208;TAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry of Strigolactones, Key Players in Plant Communication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural strigolactones (SLs), plant hormones and allelochemicals are reviewed here as analogs, mimics and probes developed to study their biological activities. All stable isotope&#8208;labeled SLs, essential for the quantification of their corresponding SLs are also reviewed. The syntheses of all these compounds are presented. The knowledge about the perception of SL is reviewed as well as different inhibitors of their receptors.







Abstract
Today, the use of artificial pesticides is questionable and the adaptation to global warming is a necessity. The promotion of favorable natural interactions in the rhizosphere offers interesting perspectives for changing the type of agriculture. Strigolactones (SLs), the latest class of phytohormones to be discovered, are also chemical mediators in the rhizosphere. We present in this review the diversity of natural SLs, their analogs, mimics, and probes essential for the biological studies of this class of compounds. Their biosynthesis and access by organic synthesis are highlighted especially concerning noncanonical SLs, the more recently discovered natural SLs. Organic synthesis of analogs, stable isotope&#8208;labeled standards, mimics, and probes are also reviewed here. In the last part, the knowledge about the SL perception is described as well as the different inhibitors of SL receptors that have been developed.

         <title>Nonlinear Impact of Electrolyte Solutions on Protein Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein dynamics is insensitive to the stronger hydrophobic effect at high salt concentration. Instead, high salt concentrations may increase (red) or decrease (blue) the dynamics of flexible protein sections, because of electrostatic screening of unlike&#8208;charges (red arrows) or like&#8208;charges (black arrows). Rigid protein sections are insensitive (white) to changes in salt concentration.







Abstract
Halophilic organisms have adapted to multi&#8208;molar salt concentrations, their cytoplasmic proteins functioning despite stronger attraction between hydrophobic groups. These proteins, of interest in biotechnology because of decreasing fresh&#8208;water resources, have excess acidic amino acids. It has been suggested that conformational fluctuations &#8211; critical for protein function &#8211; decrease in the presence of a stronger hydrophobic effect, and that an acidic proteome would counteract this decrease. However, our understanding of the salt&#8208; and acidic amino acid dependency of enzymatic activity is limited. Here, using solution NMR relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations for in total 14 proteins, we show that salt concentration has a limited and moreover non&#8208;monotonic impact on protein dynamics. The results speak against the conformational&#8208;fluctuations model, instead indicating that maintaining protein dynamics to ensure protein function is not an evolutionary driving force behind the acidic proteome of halophilic proteins.

         <title>Using Capillary Electrophoresis to Investigate Protein Conformational and Compositional Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free&#8208;solution capillary electrophoresis (CE) can separate proteins via their electrophoretic mobilities providing unique information on protein conformational and compositional heterogeneity. Analysis of three proteins by CE provides complementary and orthogonal data to SEC&#8208;MALS. Novel analysis, including calculation of sample dispersity, provides further insights into sample heterogeneity and thereby more robust protein characterization by CE.







Abstract
Detailed insights into protein structure/function relationships require robust characterization methodologies. Free&#8208;solution capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a unique separation technique which is sensitive to the conformation and/or composition of proteins, and therefore provides information on the heterogeneity of these properties. Three unrelated, conformationally/compositionally&#8208;altered proteins were separated by CE. An electrophoretic mobility distribution was determined for each protein along with its conformational and/or compositional heterogeneity. The CE results were compared with molar mass distributions obtained from size&#8208;exclusion chromatography coupled to light scattering (SEC&#8208;MALS). Bovine serum albumin multimers and two monomeric species were separated, highlighting variations in conformational/compositional heterogeneity among the multimers. Analysis of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase resolved two monomeric conformers and various tetrameric species, illustrating the impact of zinc ion removal and disulfide bond reduction on the protein's heterogeneity. The apo (calcium&#8208;free) and holo forms of bovine &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin were separated and differences in the species&#8217; heterogeneity were measured; by contrast, the SEC&#8208;MALS profiles were identical. Comparative analysis of these structurally unrelated proteins provided novel insights into the interplay between molar mass and conformational/compositional heterogeneity. Overall, this study expands the utility of CE by demonstrating its capacity to discern protein species and their heterogeneity, properties which are not readily accessible by other analytical techniques.

         <title>From the design of innovative Ti&#8208;Pt heterometallic complexes to the development of highly anti&#8208;proliferative water&#8208;soluble cationic titanocenes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two innovative early/late Ti&#8208;Pt&#8208;heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized, characterized, and screened in cell&#8208;based assays using several human (SW480 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and murine cancer cell lines (CT26 and EMT6) as well as a non&#8208;cancerous cell line (HMEC). The combination of the two metals &#8211; titanium(IV) and platinum (IV) &#8211; in a single molecule led to a synergistic biological activity (higher anti&#8208;proliferative properties than a mixture of each of the corresponding monometallic complexes). This study also investigated the benefits of associating a metal&#8208;free terpyridine moiety (with intrinsic biological activity) with a water&#8208;soluble titanocene fragment. The present work reveals that these combinations results in water&#8208;soluble titanocene compounds displaying an anti&#8208;proliferative activity down to the submicromolar level. &#160;One of these complexes induced an antitumor effect in vivo in CT26 tumor bearing BALB/C mice. The terpyridine moiety was also used to track the complex in vitro by multiphoton microscopy imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization Assisted Dynamic Kinetic Resolution for the Synthesis of (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of enzymatic synthesis with in&#8197;situ product crystallization (ISPC) is used to convert 2&#8208;phenylpropanal to (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine. Product concentrations of up to 250&#8197;mM and enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% are reached in a DKR&#8208;based reaction. The source of substrate decomposition during the reaction is investigated and the byproduct formation is reduced to insignificant levels.







Abstract
This study explores a combination of the concept of enantioselective enzymatic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;chiral amines through transamination with in&#8197;situ product crystallization (ISPC) to overcome product inhibition. Using 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a readily available and easily racemizing substrate of choice, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine ((R)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;amine) concentrations of up to 250&#8197;mM and enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% are achieved when using a commercially available transaminase from Ruegeria pomeroyi in a fed&#8208;batch based dynamic kinetic resolution reaction on preparative scale. The source of substrate decomposition during the reaction is also investigated and the resulting unwanted byproduct formation is successfully reduced to insignificant levels.

         <title>Reading and Writing the Ubiquitin Code Using Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deciphering the ubiquitin code and the function of ubiquitin proteoforms has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in the field. This review discusses the use of genetic code expansion towards genetically directed ubiquitination strategies, small chemical modifications on ubiquitin, and tools to survey ubiquitin&#8208;protein interactions. Collectively, it strives to bring attention to a unique approach to address a widespread ubiquitin proteoform problem.







Abstract
Deciphering ubiquitin proteoform signaling and its role in disease has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in the field. The effects of ubiquitin modifications, its relation to ubiquitin&#8208;related machineries, and its signaling output has been particularly limited by its reconstitution and means of characterization. Advances in genetic code expansion have contributed towards addressing these challenges by precision incorporation of unnatural amino acids through site selective codon suppression. This review discusses recent advances in studying the &#8216;writers&#8217;, &#8216;readers&#8217;, and &#8216;erasers&#8217; of the ubiquitin code using genetic code expansion. Highlighting strategies towards genetically encoded protein ubiquitination, ubiquitin phosphorylation, acylation, and finally surveying ubiquitin interactions, we strive to bring attention to this unique approach towards addressing a widespread proteoform problem.

         <title>Bora&#8208;diaza&#8208;indacene based fluorescent probes for simultaneous visualisation of lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organelle selective fluorescent probes, especially those capable of concurrent detection of specific organelles, are of benefit to the research community in delineating the interplay between various organelles and the impact of such interaction in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its disruption in the diseased state.

         <title>Engineering of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase to improve substrate scope, stereoselectivity and regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases belong to a family of flavin&#8208;binding proteins that catalyze the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger (BV) oxidation of ketones to produce lactones or esters, which are important intermediates in pharmaceuticals or sustainable materials. Phenylacetone monooxygenase (PAMO) from Thermobifida fusca with moderate thermostability catalyzes the oxidation of aryl ketone substrates, but is limited by high specificity and narrow substrate scope. In the present study, we applied loop optimization by loop swapping followed by focused saturation mutagenesis in order to evolve PAMO mutants capable of catalyzing the regioselective BV oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclobutanone derivatives with formation of either normal or abnormal esters or lactones. We further modulated PAMO to increase enantioselectivity. Crystal structure studies indicate that rotation occurs in the NADP&#8208;binding domain and that the high B&#8208;factor region is predominantly distributed in the catalytic pocket residues. Computational analyses further revealed dynamic character in the catalytic pocket and reshaped hydrogen bond interaction networks, which is more favorable for substrate binding. Our study provides useful insights for studying enzyme&#8208;substrate adaptations.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Driving Forces in the Self&#8208;Association of Silaffin Peptide R5 from MD Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript explores molecular scale driving forces that stabilize association of biomineralizing peptides in the presence of various ions and key post translational modifications (serine phosphorylation). We explain the role of phosphate or phosphoserine in the dimerization process providing new insights into mechanisms of mineralization.







Abstract
The 19&#8208;residue silaffin&#8208;R5 peptide has been widely studied for its ability to precipitate uniform SiO2 particles through mild temperature and pH pathways, in the absence of any organic solvents. There is consensus that post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of side chains has a large impact on the biomineralization process. Thus, it is imperative to understand the precise mechanisms that dictate the formation of SiO2 from R5 peptide, including the effects of PTM on peptide aggregation and peptide&#8208;surface adsorption. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the aggregation of R5 dimer with multiple PTMs, with the presence of different ions in solution. Since this system has strong interactions with deep metastable states, we use parallel bias metadynamics with partitioned families to efficiently sample the different states of the system. We find that peptide aggregation is a prerequisite for biomineralization. We observe that the electrostatic interactions are essential in the R5 dimer aggregation; for wild type R5 that only has positively charged residues, phosphate ions HPO42&#8722; in the solution form a bridge between two peptides and are essential for peptide aggregation.

         <title>Monomeric Far&#8208;red and Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescent Biliproteins of Ultrahigh Brightness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem fusion of optimized dimeric far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent phycobiliproteins (BDFPs) yields monomeric proteins that greatly improve their photostability and effective brightness. All constructed and optimized tandem BDFPs were able to be fused a variety of tagged proteins and stably expressed in mammalian cells, and have enabled super&#8208;resolution imaging.







Abstract
Far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins have regions of maximum transmission in most tissues and can be widely used as fluorescent biomarkers. We report that fluorescent phycobiliproteins originating from the phycobilisome core subunit ApcF2 can covalently bind biliverdin, named BDFPs. To further improve BDFPs, we conducted a series of studies. Firstly, we mutated K53Q and T144A of BDFPs to increase their effective brightness up to 190&#8201;% in&#8197;vivo. Secondly, by homochromatic tandem fusion of high&#8208;brightness BDFPs to achieve monomerization, which increases the effective brightness by up to 180&#8201;% in&#8197;vivo, and can effectively improve the labeling effect. By combining the above two approaches, the brightness of the tandem BDFPs was much improved compared with that of the previously reported fluorescent proteins in a similar spectral range. The tandem BDFPs were expressed stably while maintaining fluorescence in mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans. They were also photostable and resistant to high temperature, low pH, and chemical denaturation. The tandem BDFPs advantages were proved in applications as biomarkers for imaging in super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>Production of 1,4&#8208;Butanediol from Succinic Acid Using Escherichia Coli Whole&#8208;Cell Catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a dual&#8208;pathway approach for 1,4&#8208;BDO production from succinic acid was developed. Optimization of the expression levels of the pathway enzymes led to a significant 318&#8201;% increase in 1,4&#8208;BDO titer. Additionally, the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme MmCAR was engineered to enhance the kcat/KM values by 50&#8201;% and increase 1,4&#8208;BDO titer by 46.7&#8201;%. An NADPH and ATP cycling system was established, resulting in a 48.9&#8201;% increase in 1,4&#8208;BDO production.







Abstract
The widespread attention towards 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) as a key chemical raw material stems from its potential in producing biodegradable plastics. However, the efficiency of its biosynthesis via current bioprocesses is limited. In this study, a dual&#8208;pathway approach for 1,4&#8208;BDO production from succinic acid was developed. Specifically, a double&#8208;enzyme catalytic pathway involving carboxylic acid reductase and ethanol dehydrogenase was proposed. Optimization of the expression levels of the pathway enzymes led to a significant 318&#8201;% increase in 1,4&#8208;BDO titer. Additionally, the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme MmCAR was engineered to enhance the kcat/KM values by 50&#8201;% and increase 1,4&#8208;BDO titer by 46.7&#8201;%. To address cofactor supply limitations, an NADPH and ATP cycling system was established, resulting in a 48.9&#8201;% increase in 1,4&#8208;BDO production. Ultimately, after 48&#8197;hours, 1,4&#8208;BDO titers reached 201&#8197;mg/L and 1555&#8197;mg/L in shake flask and 5&#8197;L fermenter, respectively. This work represents a significant advancement in 1,4&#8208;BDO synthesis from succinic acid, with potential applications in the organic chemical and food industries.

         <title>DNA Aptamer Integrated Hydrogel Nanocomposites on Screen Printed Gold Electrodes for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Detection of Testosterone in Human Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the development and evaluation of a novel electrochemical aptasensor for testosterone detection. The sensor utilizes a specifically designed DNA immobilized on a screen&#8208;printed gold electrode (SPGE) modified with a conductive hydrogel and gold nanoparticles (HG/NP) composite. The aptasensor exhibited a dose&#8208;dependent response to testosterone (0.05 to 50 ng/mL) with a detection limit of 0.14 ng/mL and a good sensitivity of 0.23 &#956;A ng&#8208;1 mL cm&#8208;2. The sensor displayed excellent selectivity towards testosterone compared to structurally similar steroid hormones. Importantly, the incorporation of HG/NP not only improved the sensor's conductivity but also acted as an antifouling layer, minimizing signal interference from non&#8208;specific biomolecule interactions in complex biological samples like human serum. The results obtained from the aptasensor showed good correlation with a standard ELISA method, demonstrating its effectiveness in real&#8208;world scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Chemical Reactions&#160;for Studying Nucleic Acids and Their Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids are genetic information&#8208;carrying molecules inside cells. Apart from basic nucleotide building blocks, there exist various naturally occurring chemical modifications on nucleobase and ribose moieties, which greatly increase the encoding complexity of nuclei acids, contribute to the alteration of nucleic acid structures, and play versatile regulation roles in gene expression. To study the functions of certain nucleic acids in various biological contexts, robust tools to specifically label and identify these macromolecules and their modifications, and to illuminate their structures are highly necessary. In this review, we summarize recent technique advances of using chemical and enzyme&#8208;mediated chemical reactions to study nucleic acids and their modifications and structures. By highlighting the chemical principles of these techniques, we aim&#160;to&#160;present a perspective&#160;on the advancement of the field as well as to offer&#160;insights into&#160;developing specific chemical reactions and precise enzyme catalysis utilized for nucleic acids and their modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated tags to study protein conformation and interactions using&#160;19F NMR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of fluorine atoms into a biomacromolecule provides a background&#8208;free and environmentally sensitive reporter of structure, conformation and interactions using&#160;19F NMR. There are several methods to introduce the&#160;19F reporter &#8211; either by synthetic incorporation&#160;via&#160;solid phase peptide synthesis; by suppressing the incorporation or biosynthesis of a natural amino acid and supplementing the growth media with a fluorinated counterpart during protein expression; and by genetic code expansion to add new amino acids to the amino acid alphabet. This review aims to discuss progress in the field of introducing fluorinated handles into biomolecules for NMR studies by post&#8208;translational bioconjugation or &#8216;fluorine&#8208;tagging&#8217;. We will discuss the range of chemical tagging &#8216;warheads&#8217; that have been used, explore the applications of fluorine tags, discuss ways to enhance reporter sensitivity and how the signal to noise&#160;ratios&#160;can be boosted. Finally, we consider some key challenges of the field and offer some ideas for future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalysis with in&#8208;situ product removal improves p&#8208;coumaric acid production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural and pure p&#8208;coumaric acid has valuable applications, and it can be produced via bioprocessing. However, fermentation processes have so far been unable to provide sufficient production metrics, while a biocatalytic process decoupling growth and production historically showed much promise. This biocatalytic process is revisited in order to tackle product inhibition of the key enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase. In situ product removal is proposed as a possible solution, and a polymer/salt aqueous two&#8208;phase system is identified as a suitable system for extraction of p&#8208;coumaric acid from an alkaline solution, with a partition coefficient of up to 13. However, a 10% salt solution was found to reduce tyrosine ammonia lyase activity by 19%, leading to the need for a more dilute system. The cloud points of two aqueous two&#8208;phase systems at 40&#176;C and pH 10 were found to be 3.8% salt and 9.5% polymer, and a 5% potassium phosphate and 12.5% poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;ran&#8208;propylene glycol) mW~2500 system was selected for in situ product removal. An immobilized tyrosine ammonia lyase biocatalyst in this aqueous two&#8208;phase system produced up to 33 g/L p&#8208;coumaric acid within 24 hours, a 1.9&#8208;fold improvement compared to biocatalysis without in situ product removal.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Protein Corona Formation and Polystyrene Nanoparticle&#160;Functionalisationon the Interaction with Dynamic Biomimetic Membranes Comprising of Integrin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics, omnipresent in the environment, have become a global concern due to their durability and limited biodegradability, especially in the form of microparticles and nanoparticles. Polystyrene (PS), a key plastic type, is susceptible to fragmentation and surface alterations induced by environmental factors or industrial processes. With widespread human exposure through pollution and diverse industrial applications, understanding the physiological impact of PS, particularly in nanoparticle form (PS&#8208;NPs), is crucial. This study focuses on the interaction of PS&#8208;NPs with model blood proteins, emphasising the formation of a protein corona, and explores the subsequent contact with platelet membrane mimetics using experimental and theoretical approaches. The investigation involves &#945;IIb&#946;3&#8208;expressing cells and biomimetic membranes, enabling real&#8208;time and label&#8208;free nanoscale precision. By employing quartz&#8208;crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring studies, the concentration&#8208;dependent cytotoxic effects of differently functionalised ~210 nm PS&#8208;NPs on HEK293 cells overexpressing &#945;IIb&#946;3 are evaluated in detail. The study unveils insights into the molecular details of PS&#8208;NP interaction with supported lipid bilayers, demonstrating that a protein corona formed in the presence of exemplary blood proteins offers protection against membrane damage, mitigating PS&#8208;NP cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Quality Control of mRNA Vaccines by Synthetic Ribonucleases: Analysis of the Poly&#8208;A&#8208;Tail</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effectivity and safety of mRNA vaccines critically depends on the presence of correct 5&#8217; caps and poly&#8208;A tails. Due to the high molecular mass of full&#8208;size mRNAs, however, the direct analysis by mass spectrometry is hardly possible. Here we describe the use of synthetic ribonucleases to cleave off 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; terminal fragments which can be further analyzed by HPLC or by LC&#8208;MS. Compared to existing methods (e.g. RNase H), the new approach uses robust catalysts, is free of sequence limitations, avoids metal ions and combines fast sample preparation with high precision of the cut.</dc:description>

         <title>14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions: From Mechanistic Understanding to their Small&#8208;molecule Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are of utmost importance for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Herein, a central role can be found for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins. These hub&#8208;proteins are known to bind hundreds of interaction partners, thereby regulating their activity, localization, and/or stabilization. Due to their ability to bind a large variety of client proteins, studies of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes flourished over the last decades, aiming to gain greater molecular understanding of these complexes and their role in health and disease.&#160; Because of their crucial role within the cell, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes are recognized as&#160; highly interesting therapeutic targets, encouraging the discovery of small molecule modulators of these PPIs. We discuss various examples of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated regulation of its binding partners on a mechanistic level, highlighting the versatile and multi&#8208;functional role of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 within the cell. Furthermore, an overview is given on the development of stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes, from initially used natural products to fragment&#8208;based approaches. These studies show the potential of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilizers as novel agents in drug discovery and as tool compounds to gain greater molecular understandings of the role of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;based protein regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>5&#8217;&#8208;Methoxyarmillane, a Bioactive Sesquiterpenoid Aryl Ester from the Fungus Armillaria ostoyae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract
Higher fungi of the genus Armillaria belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota produce bioactive sesquiterpenoid aryl esters called melleolides. A bioactivity&#8208;guided discovery process led to the identification of the new melleolide 5&#8217;&#8209;methoxyarmillane (1) in organic extracts from the mycelium of Armillaria ostoyae.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Higher fungi of the genus Armillaria belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota produce bioactive sesquiterpenoid aryl esters called melleolides. A bioactivity-guided discovery process led to the identification of the new melleolide 5&#8217;&#8209;methoxyarmillane (1) in organic extracts from the mycelium of Armillaria ostoyae. Remarkably, supplementation of rapeseed oil to the culture medium potato dextrose broth increased the production of 1 by a factor of six during the course of the 35 days fermentation. Compound 1 was isolated and its structure elucidated by UHPLC-QTOF-HR-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. It showed toxicity against Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCK&#160;II, IC50 19.2&#160;mg/mL, 44.1&#160;mM) and human lung cancer Calu-3 cells (IC50 15.2&#160;mg/mL, 34.9&#160;mM) as well as moderate bioactivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC 8&#160;mg/mL, 18.4&#160;mM) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC&#160;16&#160;mg/mL, 36.8&#160;mM), but not against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Septoria tritici. No inhibitory effects of 1 against the influenza viruses H3N2, H1N1pdm, B/Malaysia, and B/Massachusetts were observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterizing the Conformational Dynamics of Human SUMO2: Insights into its Interaction with Metal Ions and SIMs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SUMO2 exhibits conformational flexibility in the &#945;1&#8208;helix region, potentially influencing its interactions with SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) on target molecules, crucial for SUMOylation. The SUMO2&#8208;SIM interaction is hindered in the presence of Cu2+ ions, possibly due to Cu2+&#8208;induced trimerization and subsequent aggregation of SUMO2.







Abstract
SUMO (Small Ubiquitin&#8208;like Modifiers) proteins are involved in a crucial post&#8208;translational modification commonly termed as SUMOylation. In this work, we have investigated the native&#8208;state conformational flexibility of human SUMO2 and its interaction with Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions using 15N&#8208;1H based 2D NMR spectroscopy. After SUMO1, SUMO2 is the most studied SUMO isoform in humans which shares 45&#8201;% and ~80&#8201;% similarity with SUMO1 in terms of sequence and structure, respectively. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that compared to SUMO1, several amino acids around the &#945;1&#8208;helix region of SUMO2 access energetically similar near&#8208;native conformations. These conformations could play a crucial role in SUMO2&#8217;s non&#8208;covalent interactions with SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) on other proteins. The C&#8208;terminal of SUMO2 was found to bind strongly with Cu2+ ions resulting in a trimeric structure as observed by gel electrophoresis. This interaction seems to interfere in its non&#8208;covalent interaction with a V/I&#8208;x&#8208;V/I&#8208;V/I based SIM in Daxx protein.

         <title>Wall&#8208;Immobilized Biocatalyst vs. Packed Bed in Miniaturized Continuous Reactors: Performances and Scale&#8208;Up</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous biocatalysis production is mainly performed using packed bed and wall&#8208;immobilized enzyme reactors. Maximization of the space&#8208;time&#8208;yield, STY, gives highest turnover numbers, TN, which tends to be increased with the use of wall&#8208;enzyme reactor due to improved specific productivities, Psp. This review also clarifies the strategies to be studied in the future to maximize the wall&#8208;enzyme reactor performances and allow its scalability.







Abstract
Sustainable biocatalysis syntheses have gained considerable popularity over the years. However, further optimizations &#8211; notably to reduce costs &#8211; are required if the methods are to be successfully deployed in a range of areas. As part of this drive, various enzyme immobilization strategies have been studied, alongside process intensification from batch to continuous production. The flow bioreactor portfolio mainly ranges between packed bed reactors and wall&#8208;immobilized enzyme miniaturized reactors. Because of their simplicity, packed bed reactors are the most frequently encountered at lab&#8208;scale. However, at industrial scale, the growing pressure drop induced by the increase in equipment size hampers their implementation for some applications. Wall&#8208;immobilized miniaturized reactors require less pumping power, but a new problem arises due to their reduced enzyme&#8208;loading capacity. This review starts with a presentation of the current technology portfolio and a reminder of the metrics to be applied with flow bioreactors. Then, a benchmarking of the most recent relevant works is presented. The scale&#8208;up perspectives of the various options are presented in detail, highlighting key features of industrial requirements. One of the main objectives of this review is to clarify the strategies on which future study should center to maximize the performance of wall&#8208;immobilized enzyme reactors.

         <title>Detoxification of V&#8208;Nerve Agents Assisted by a Microperoxidase: New Pathway Revealed by the Use of a Relevant VX Simulant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalyzed oxidative detoxification of the V&#8208;series simulant PhX with the microperoxidase AcMP11 affords the corresponding phosphonothioate as the prominent product instead of the classical P&#8722;S and P&#8722;O bond cleavage. These results highlight the efficacy of AcMP11 to efficiently detoxify V&#8208;series organophosphorus nerve agents and the necessity to use relevant simulants, such as PhX, to prevent false positive/negative results.







Abstract
The biocatalyzed oxidative detoxification of the V&#8208;series simulant PhX, by mean of the microperoxidase AcMP11, affords the corresponding phosphonothioate as the prominent product instead of the classical P&#8722;S and P&#8722;O bond cleavage. While PhX is structurally very close to the live agent VX (the methyl group is replaced by a phenyl), assessment with other surrogates missing the nucleophilic amino function displayed more resistance under the same conditions with no phosphonothioate observed. These encouraging results highlight 1) the efficacy of AcMP11 microperoxidase to efficiently detoxify V&#8208;series organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA), and 2) the necessity to use representative alkyl or aryl phosphonothioates simulants such as PhX bearing the appropriate side chain as well as the P&#8722;O and P&#8722;S cleavable bond to mimic accurately the V&#8208;series OPNA to prevent false positive or false negative results.

         <title>Allosteric Regulation and Inhibition of Coronavirus 3CLpro Revealed by HDX&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coronavirus (CoV) infections have caused contagious and fatal respiratory diseases in humans worldwide. CoV 3&#8208;chymotrypsin&#8208;like proteases (3CLpro or Mpro) play an important role in viral maturation, and maintenance of their dimeric conformation is crucial for viral activity. Therefore, allosterically regulated dimerization of 3CLpro can be employed as a drug development target. Here, we investigated the allosteric regulatory mechanism of 3CLpro dimerization by using hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX&#8208;MS) technology. We found that the FLAG tag directly coupled to the N&#8208;finger of 3CLpro significantly increased HDX kinetics at the dimer interface, and 3CLpro transformed from a dimer to a monomer. The 3CLpro mutants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which are monomeric, also exhibited increased deuterium exchange. Binding of the allosteric inhibitor Gastrodenol to most betacoronavirus 3CLpros led to increased allosteric deuterium exchange, resulting in the monomeric conformation of the CoV 3CLpro upon binding. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis further indicated the molecular mechanism of action of Gastrodenol on CoV 3CLpro: binding of Gastrodenol to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CLpro destroyed the hydrogen bond in the dimer interface. These results suggest that Gastrodenol may be a potential broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;betacoronavirus drug.</dc:description>

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis further indicated the molecular mechanism of action of Gastrodenol on CoV 3CLpro: binding of Gastrodenol to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro destroyed the hydrogen bond in the dimer interface. These results suggest that Gastrodenol may be a potential broad-spectrum anti-betacoronavirus drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) have garnered popularity over the last decade as immunotherapeutic agents, which activates the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway to trigger an immune response. Many analogs of 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP, c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP, and c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP have been developed and shown as effective cancer vaccines and immunomodulators for the induction of both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these CDNs is limited by their chemical and enzymatic instability. We recently introduced 5&#8217;&#8208;endo&#8208;phosphorothoiate 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP analogs as potent STING agonist with improved resistance to cleavage by clinically relevant phosphodiesterases. We herein report the synthesis of locked nucleic acid&#8208;functionalized (LNA) endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDNs and evaluate their ability to activate STING in THP1 monocytes. Interestingly, some of our synthesized LNA 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDNs can moderately activate hSTING REF haplotype (R232H), which exhibit diminished response to both 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP and ADU&#8208;S100. Also, we show that one of our most potent endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDNs has remarkable chemical (oxidants I2 and H2O2) and phosphodiesterase stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal proteome profiling reveals insight to antiproliferative and pro&#8208;apoptotic effects of Lagunamide A in the modulation of DNA damage repair</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lagunamide A is a biologically active natural product with a yet unidentified molecular mode of action. Cellular studies revealed that lagunamide A is a potent inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis and causes mitochondrial dysfunction. To decipher the cellular mechanism responsible for these effects, we utilized thermal protein profiling (TPP) and identified EYA3 as a stabilized protein in cells upon lagunamide A treatment. EYA3, involved in the DNA damage repair process, was functionally investigated via siRNA based knockdown studies and corresponding effects of lagunamide A on DNA repair were confirmed. Furthermore, we showed that lagunamide A sensitized tumor cells to treatment with the drug doxorubicin highlighting a putative therapeutic strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>In vivo Labeling and Intravital Imaging of Bacterial Infection using a Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescent D&#8208;Amino Acid Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections still pose a severe threat to public health, necessitating novel tools for real&#8208;time analysis of microbial behaviors in living organisms. While genetically engineered strains with fluorescent or luminescent reporters are commonly used in tracking bacteria, their in vivo uses are often limited. Here, we report a near&#8208;infrared fluorescent D&#8208;amino acid (FDAA) probe, Cy7ADA, for in situ labeling and intravital imaging of bacterial infections in mice. Cy7ADA probe effectively labels various bacteria in vitro and pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus in mice after intraperitoneal injection. Because of Cy7&#8217;s high tissue penetration and the quick excretion of free probes via urine, real&#8208;time visualization of the pathogens in a liver abscess model via intravital confocal microscopy is achieved. The biodistributions, including their intracellular localization within Kupffer cells, are revealed. Monitoring bacterial responses to antibiotics also demonstrates Cy7ADA's capability to reflect the bacterial load dynamics within the host. Furthermore, Cy7ADA facilitates three&#8208;dimensional pathogen imaging in tissuecleared liver samples, showcasing its potential for studying the biogeography of microbes in different organs. Integrating nearinfrared FDAA probes with intravital microscopy holds promise for wide applications in studying bacterial infections in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of PNA Sequence and Target Site Selection on Function of a 4.5S Non&#8208;Coding RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence, length, and target site of antisense PNA matters: This study highlights the contrasting requirement for target specificity and cellular internalization of antisense PNA in bacteria leading to a lack of expected correlation in antibacterial activity and PNA length.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) based antisense strategy is a promising therapeutic approach to specifically inhibit target gene expression. However, unlike protein coding genes, identification of an ideal PNA binding site for non&#8208;coding RNA is not straightforward. Here, we compare the inhibitory activities of PNA molecules that bind a non&#8208;coding 4.5S RNA called SRP RNA, a key component of the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP). A 9&#8208;mer PNA (PNA9) complementary to the tetraloop region of the RNA was more potent in inhibiting its interaction with the SRP protein, compared to an 8&#8208;mer PNA (PNA8) targeting a stem&#8208;loop. PNA9, which contained a homo&#8208;pyrimidine sequence could form a triplex with the complementary stretch of RNA in&#8197;vitro as confirmed using a fluorescent derivative of PNA9 (F&#8208;PNA13). The RNA&#8208;PNA complex formation resulted in inhibition of SRP function with PNA9 and F&#8208;PNA13, but not PNA8 highlighting the importance of target site selection. Surprisingly, F&#8208;PNA13 which was more potent in inhibiting SRP function in&#8197;vitro, showed weaker antibacterial activity compared to PNA9 likely due to poor cell penetration of the longer PNA. Our results underscore the importance of suitable target site selection and optimum PNA length to develop better antisense molecules against non&#8208;coding RNA.

         <title>A Quantitative Method to Distinguish Cytosolic from Endosome&#8208;Trapped Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence protocol to determine the quantity of a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide internalized at 37&#8201;&#176;C either by direct translocation across the cell membrane or endocytosis. The protocol can be used with any cell type and only requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides. Its application to tetra&#8208; and hexaarginines highlights their difference of internalization.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are known to penetrate cells through endocytosis and translocation. The two pathways are hardly distinguished in current cell assays. We developed a reliable, simple and robust method to distinguish and quantify independently the two routes. The assay requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides. When the labeled peptide is intact, the fluorescence signal is weak thanks to the dark quenching property of DABCYL. A 10&#8208;fold higher fluorescence signal is measured when the labeled peptide is degraded. By referring to a standard fluorescent curve according to the concentration of the hydrolyzed peptide, we have access to the internalized peptide quantity. Therefore, cell lysis after internalization permits to determine the total quantity of intracellular peptide. The molecular state of the internalized peptide (intact or degraded), depends on its location in cells (cytosol vs endo&#8208;lysosomes), and can be blocked by boiling cells. This boiling step results indeed in denaturation and inhibition of the cellular enzymes. The advantage of this method is the possibility to quantify translocation at 37&#8201;&#176;C and to compare it to the 4&#8201;&#176;C condition, where all endocytosis processes are inhibited. We found that ranking of the translocation efficacy is DABCYL&#8208;R6&#8208;(&#1013;CF)K&#8811;DABCYL&#8208;R4&#8208;(&#1013;CF)K&#8805;CF&#8208;R9.

         <title>The Development and Opportunities of Predictive Biotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept study on predictive biotechnology, which can be employed to map and optimize biological systems and processes through to technological implementation. A new tool for the resource&#8208;saving (future) development of biotechnological processes.







Abstract
Recent advances in bioeconomy allow a holistic view of existing and new process chains and enable novel production routines continuously advanced by academia and industry. All this progress benefits from a growing number of prediction tools that have found their way into the field. For example, automated genome annotations, tools for building model structures of proteins, and structural protein prediction methods such as AlphaFold2TM or RoseTTAFold have gained popularity in recent years. Recently, it has become apparent that more and more AI&#8208;based tools are being developed and used for biocatalysis and biotechnology. This is an excellent opportunity for academia and industry to accelerate advancements in the field further. Biotechnology, as a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field, stands to benefit greatly from these developments.

         <title>REPROGRAMMING FILAMENTOUS FD VIRUSES TO CAPTURE COPPER IONS</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;terminal truncated variants (A, VA, NVA, ANVA, FANVA and GFANVA) of our recently identified Cu(II) specific peptide &#8220;HGFANVA&#8221; were displayed on filamentous fd phages. Wild type fd&#8208;tet and engineered virus variants were treated with 100 mM Cu(II) solution at a final phage concentration of 1011&#160;vir/ml and 1012&#160;vir/ml. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging before Cu(II) exposure showed&#160;&#187;&#160;6&#8208;8 nm thick filamentous virus layer formation. Cu(II) treatment resulted in aggregated bundle&#8208;like assemblies with mineral deposition. HGFANVA phage formed aggregates with an excessive mineral coverage. As the virus concentration was 10&#8208;fold decreased, nanowire&#8208;like assemblies were observed for shorter peptide variants A, NVA and ANVA. Wild type fd phages did not show any mineral formation. Energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses revealed the presence of C and N peaks on phage organic material. Cu peak was only detected for engineered viruses. Metal ion binding of viruses was next investigated by enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses. Engineered viruses were able to bind Cu(II) forming mineralized intertwined structures although no His (H) unit was displayed. Such genetically reprogrammed virus based biological materials can be further applied for bioremediation studies to achieve a circular economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationally Designed Peptoid Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Oligomerization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While plaques comprised of fibrillar A&#946; aggregates are hallmarks of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, soluble A&#946; oligomers present higher neurotoxicity. Thus, one therapeutic approach is to prevent the formation of A&#946; oligomers and reduce their associated harmful effects. We have proposed a peptoid mimic of the A&#946; hydrophobic KLVFF core as an ideal candidate aggregation inhibitor due to its ability to evade proteolytic degradation via repositioning of the side chain from the &#945;&#8208;carbon to the amide nitrogen. This peptoid, JPT1, utilizes chiral sidechains to achieve a helical structure, while C&#8208;terminal addition of two phenylalanine residues places aromatic groups on two sides of the helix with spacing designed to facilitate interaction with amyloid &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. We have previously shown that JPT1 modulates A&#946; fibril formation. Here, we demonstrate that JPT1 also modulates A&#946; oligomerization, and we explore the role of the charge on the linker between the KLVFF mimic and the extended aromatic residues. Additionally, we demonstrate that peptoid&#8208;induced changes in A&#946; oligomerization correlate with attenuation of oligomer&#8208;induced nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B activation in SH&#8208;SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. These findings support the therapeutic potential of peptoids to target early stages of A&#946; aggregation and impact the associated A&#946;&#8208;induced cellular response.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Production of Cytotoxic Bispecific Antibodies Using the Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for the treatment of several conditions, most importantly cancer. Based on the combination of two different antigen&#8208;binding motifs in a single macromolecule; bsAbs can either display the combined characteristics of their parent antibodies, or new therapeutic features, inaccessible by the sole combination of two distinct antibodies. While bsAbs are traditionally produced by molecular biology techniques, the chemical development of bsAbs holds great promises and strategies have just begun to surface. In this context, we took advantage of a chemical strategy based on the use of the Ugi reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of whole antibodies and coupled the resulting conjugates in a bioorthogonal manner with Fab fragments, derived from various antibodies. We thus managed to produce five different bsAbs with 2:1 valency, with yields ranging from 20% to 48%, and showed that the affinity of the parent antibody was preserved in all bsAbs. We further demonstrated the interest of our strategy by producing two other bsAbs behaving as cytotoxic T cell engagers with IC50 values in the picomolar range in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of RNA Phosphodiester Backbone Cleavage in the Presence of Organic Cations of Different Sizes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living cells contain various types of organic cations that may interact with nucleic acids.&#160;In order to understand the&#160;nucleic acid&#8211;binding properties of&#160;organic cations of different sizes, we investigated the ability of&#160;simple organic cations to inhibit the RNA phosphodiester bond cleavage promoted by Mg2+, Pb2+, and RNA&#8208;cleaving serum proteins. Kinetic analysis using chimeric DNA&#8211;RNA oligonucleotides showed that the cleavage at ribonucleotide sites was inhibited in the presence of monovalent cations comprising alkyl chains or benzene rings. The comparison of the&#160;cleavage rates in the presence of&#160;quaternary ammonium and phosphonium ions&#160;indicated that&#160;the steric hindrance effect of organic cations on their binding to&#160;the RNA backbone&#160;is significant when the cation size is larger than the phosphate&#8211;phosphate distance of a single&#8208;stranded nucleic acid.&#160;The cleavage inhibition was also observed for ribonucleotides located in long loops but not in short loops&#160;of oligonucleotide structures, indicating less efficient binding of bulky cations&#160;to structurally constrained regions.&#160;These&#160;results reveal&#160;the&#160;unique nucleic acid&#8211;binding properties of bulky cations distinct from those of metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplification&#8208; and Enzyme&#8208;Free Magnetic Diagnostics Circuit for Whole&#8208;Genome Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) requires thermal cycling and enzymatic reactions for sequence amplification, hampering their applications in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) settings. Magnetic bioassays based on magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are isothermal, wash&#8208;free, and can be quantitative. Realizing them amplification&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;free on a benchtop device, they will become irreplaceable for POC applications. Here we demonstrate a first&#8208;in&#8208;class magnetic signal amplification circuit (MAC) that enables detection of whole genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by combining the specificity of toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement with the magnetic response of MNPs to declustering processes. Using MAC, we detect the N gene of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 samples at a concentration of 104 RNA copies/&#181;l as determined by droplet digital PCR. Further, we demonstrate that MAC can reliably distinguish between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other human coronaviruses. Being a wash&#8208;, amplification&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;free biosensing concept and working at isothermal conditions (25 &#176;C) on a low&#8208;cost benchtop MPS device, our MAC biosensing concept offers several indispensable features for translating nucleic acid detection to POC applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Glycerolipid Metabolism using a Caged Clickable Glycerol&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphate Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the probe SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3 as a novel tool for metabolic labeling of glycerolipids (GLs) to investigate lipid metabolism in yeast cells. By introducing a clickable azide handle onto the glycerol backbone, this probe enables general labeling of glycerolipids. Additionally, this probe contains a caged phosphate moiety at the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position to not only facilitate probe uptake by masking negative charge but also to bypass the phosphorylation step crucial for initiating phospholipid synthesis, thereby enhancing phospholipid labeling. The metabolic labeling activity of the probe was thoroughly assessed through cellular fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and thin&#8208;layer chromatography (TLC) experiments. Fluorescence microscopy analysis demonstrated successful incorporation of the probe into yeast cells, with labeling predominantly localized at the plasma membrane. LCMS analysis confirmed metabolic labeling of various phospholipid species (PC, PS, PA, PI, and PG) and neutral lipids (MAG, DAG, and TAG), and GL labeling was corroborated by TLC. These results showcased the potential of the SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3 probe in studying GL metabolism, offering a versatile and valuable approach to explore the intricate dynamics of lipids in yeast cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotide&#8208;Based Photoaffinity Probes: Chemical Tools and Applications for Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of proteins interact with DNA and RNA, including polymerases, histones, ribosomes, transcription factors, and repair enzymes. However, the transient non&#8208;covalent nature of these interactions poses challenges for analysis. Introducing a covalent bond between proteins and DNA via photochemical activation of a photosensitive functional group introduced onto nucleic acids offers a means to stabilize these often weak interactions without significantly altering the binding interface. Consequently, photoactivatable oligonucleotides are powerful tools for investigating nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions involved in numerous biological and pathological processes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the chemical tools developed so far and the different strategies used for incorporating the most commonly used photoreactive reagents into oligonucleotides probes or nucleic acids. Furthermore, we illustrate their application with several examples including protein binding site mapping, identification of protein binding partners, and in cell studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized DNA Origami&#8208;Enabled Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomarkers are crucial physiological and pathological indicators in the host. Over the years, numerous detection methods have been developed for biomarkers, given their significant potential in various biological and biomedical applications. Among these, the detection system based on functionalized DNA origami has emerged as a promising approach due to its precise control over sensing modules, enabling sensitive, specific, and programmable biomarker detection. We summarize the advancements in biomarker detection using functionalized DNA origami, focusing on strategies for DNA origami functionalization, mechanisms of biomarker recognition, and applications in disease diagnosis and monitoring. These applications are organized into sections based on the type of biomarkers&#8212;nucleic acids, proteins, small molecules, and ions&#8212;and concludes with a discussion on the advantages and challenges associated with using functionalized DNA origami systems for biomarker detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional DNA Nanoflower Applied for High Specific Photodynamic Cancer Therapy in vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a newly emerged strategy for disease treatment. One challenge of the application of PDT drugs is the side&#8208;effect caused by the non&#8208;specificity of the photosensitive molecules. Most of the photosensitizers may invade not only the pathogenic cells but also the normal cells. In recent, people tried to use special cargoes to deliver the drugs into target cells. DNA nanoflowers (NFs) are a kind of newly&#8208;emerged nanomaterial which constructed through DNA rolling cycle amplification (RCA) reaction. It is reported that the DNA NFs were suitable materials which have been widely applied as nanocargos for drug delivery in cancer chemotherapeutic treatment. In this paper, we have introduced a new multifunctional DNA NF which could be prepared through an one&#8208;pot RCA reaction. This proposed DNA NF contained a versatile AS1411 G&#8208;quadruplex moiety, which plays key roles not only for specific recognition of cancer cells but also for near&#8208;infrared ray based photodynamic therapy when conjugating with a special porphyrin molecule. We demonstrated that the DNA NF showed good selectivity toward cancer cells, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, the in vivo experiment results suggested this DNA NF is a promising nanomaterial for clinical PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Using LanM Enzymes to Modify Glycagon&#8208;Like Peptides 1 and 2 in E.coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective modification of peptides is often exploited to improve pharmaceutically relevant properties of bioactive peptides like stability, circulation time, and potency. In Nature, natural products belonging to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are known to install a number of highly attractive modifications with high selectivity. These modifications are installed by enzymes guided to the peptide by corresponding leader peptides that are removed as the last step of biosynthesis. Here, we exploit leader peptides and their matching enzymes to investigate the installation of D&#8208;Ala post&#8208;translationally in a critical position in the hormones, glucagon&#8208;like peptides (GLP) 1 and 2. We also offer insight into how precursor peptide design can modulate the modification pattern achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Improvement of heterologous soluble expression of L&#8208;amino acid oxidase using logistic regression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Successful implementation of enzymes in practical application hinges on the development of efficient mass production techniques. However, in a heterologous expression system, the protein is often unable to fold correctly and, thus, forms inclusion bodies, resulting in the loss of its original activity. In this study, we present a new and more accurate model for predicting amino acids associated with an increased L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAO) solubility. Expressing LAO from Rhizoctonia solani in Escherichia coli and combining random mutagenesis and statistical logistic regression, we modified 108 amino acid residues by substituting hydrophobic amino acids with serine and hydrophilic amino acids with alanine. Our results indicated that specific mutations in Euclidean distance, glycine, methionine, and secondary structure increased LAO expression. Furthermore, repeated mutations were performed for LAO based on logistic regression models. The mutated LAO displayed a significantly increased solubility, with the 6&#8208;point and 58&#8208;point mutants showing a 2.64&#8208; and 4.22&#8208;fold increase, respectively, compared with WT&#8208;LAO. Ultimately, using recombinant LAO in the biotransformation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids indicates its great potential as a biocatalyst in industrial production.</dc:description>

         <title>PET Ligands for Imaging Mutant Huntingtin Aggregates: A Case Study in Non&#8208;For&#8208;Profit Scientific Management</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As part of the EFMC Collection: Mutually Rewarding Academia&#8208;Industry Collaborations in Chemical Biology, this perspective profiles the development of a PET radiotracer targeting the mutant huntingtin fibrils, which are hallmarks of Huntington's disease in a manner akin to that of amyloid&#8208;beta and tau fibrils in Alzheimer's disease. The authors discuss medicinal chemistry efforts to develop an mHTT&#8211;specific radiotracer to date, and outline opportunities for further improvement of this radiotracer class.







Abstract
Positron emission tomography imaging of misfolded proteins with high&#8208;affinity and selective radioligands has played a vital role in expanding our knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The pathogenesis of Huntington's disease, a CAG trinucleotide repeat disorder, is similarly linked to the presence of protein fibrils formed from mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. Development of mHTT fibril&#8211;specific radioligands has been limited by the lack of structural knowledge around mHTT and a dearth of available hit compounds for medicinal chemistry refinement. Over the past decade, the Cure Huntington's Disease Initiative (CHDI), a non&#8208;for&#8208;profit scientific management organisation has orchestrated a large&#8208;scale screen of small molecules to identify high affinity ligands of mHTT, with lead compounds now reaching clinical maturity. Here we describe the mHTT radioligands developed to date and opportunities for further improvement of this radiotracer class.

Here we describe the mHTT radioligands developed to date and opportunities for further improvement of this radiotracer class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;vitro Clinical Diagnostics using RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We review the use of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes (RCDs) as molecular tools for the development of clinical diagnostics, covering both the selection of RCDs and the development of RCD&#8208;based assays and sensors, and provide several examples of the use of such tests for evaluation of spiked biological samples or patient samples related to both chronic and infectious diseases.







Abstract
Over the last three decades, significant advancements have been made in the development of biosensors and bioassays that use RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes (RCDs) as molecular recognition elements. While early examples of RCDs were primarily responsive to metal ions, the past decade has seen numerous RCDs reported for more clinically relevant targets such as bacteria, cancer cells, small metabolites, and protein biomarkers. Over the past 5&#8197;years several RCD&#8208;based biosensors have also been evaluated using either spiked biological matrixes or patient samples, including blood, serum, saliva, nasal mucus, sputum, urine, and faeces, which is a critical step toward regulatory approval and commercialization of such sensors. In this review, an overview of the methods used to generate RCDs and the properties of key RCDs that have been utilized for in&#8197;vitro testing is first provided. Examples of RCD&#8208;based assays and sensors that have been used to test either spiked biological samples or patient samples are then presented, highlighting assay performance in different biological matrixes. A summary of current prospects and challenges for development of in&#8197;vitro diagnostic tests incorporating RCDs and an overview of future directions of the field is also provided.

         <title>Biological Demands and Toxicity of Isoprenoid Precursors in Bacillus Subtilis Through Cell&#8208;Permeant Analogs of Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate and Dimethylallyl Pyrophosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) are the five&#8208;carbon precursors for all terpenes and are cell impermeant due to the negatively charged pyrophosphate. We report the delivery of cell permeant IPP and DMAPP into Bacillus subtilis and demonstrate growth rescue after inhibition with fosmidomycin. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalent toxicity of IPP and DMAPP.







Abstract
Bacterial isoprenoids are necessary for many biological processes, including maintaining membrane integrity, facilitating intercellular communication, and preventing oxidative damage. All bacterial isoprenoids are biosynthesized from two five carbon structural isomers, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are cell impermeant. Herein, we demonstrate exogenous delivery of IPP and DMAPP into Bacillus subtilis by utilizing a self&#8208;immolative ester (SIE)&#8208;caging approach. We initially evaluated native B. subtilis esterase activity, which revealed a preference for short straight chain esters. We then examined the viability of the SIE&#8208;caging approach in B. subtilis and demonstrate that the released caging groups are well tolerated and the released IPP and DMAPP are bioavailable, such that isoprenoid biosynthesis can be rescued in the presence of pathway inhibitors. We further show that IPP and DMAPP are both toxic and inhibit growth of B. subtilis at the same concentration. Lastly, we establish the optimal ratio of IPP to DMAPP (5&#8201;:&#8201;1) for B. subtilis growth and find that, surprisingly, DMAPP alone is insufficient to rescue isoprenoid biosynthesis under high concentrations of fosmidomycin. These findings showcase the potential of the SIE&#8208;caging approach in B. subtilis and promise to both aid in novel isoprenoid discovery and to inform metabolic engineering efforts in bacteria.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Based Site&#8211;Directed Mutagenesis of Hydroxynitrile Lyase from Cyanogenic Millipede, Oxidus gracilis for Hydrocyanation and Henry Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) from the cyanogenic millipede Oxidus gracillis (OgraHNL) showed high specific activity and enantioselectivity a toward the synthesis of (R)&#8208;2&#8208;chloromandelonitrile ((R)&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8722;Man), an important intermediate in pharmaceuticals, and (R)&#8208;2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol in Henry reactions. We showed that the crystal structural properties of OgraHNL complexed with various substrates and an engineering strategy based on the protein structure serve as useful approaches for millipede HNLs.

Abstract
Hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) from the cyanogenic millipede Oxidus gracillis (OgraHNL) is a crucial enzyme in the cyanogenesis pathway. Here, the crystal structures of OgraHNL complexed with sulfate, benzaldehyde (BA), (R)&#8208;mandelonitrile ((R)&#8208;Man), (R)&#8208;2&#8208;chloromandelonitrile ((R)&#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8722;Man), and acetone cyanohydrin (ACN) were solved at 1.6, 1.7, 2.3, 2.1, and 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolutions, respectively. The structure of OgraHNL revealed that it belonged to the lipocalin superfamily. Based on this structure, positive variants were designed to further improve the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity of the enzyme for asymmetric hydrocyanation and Henry reactions.
