         <title>Recent Advances on the Selection Methods of DNA&#8208;encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) has come of age and become a major technology platform for ligand discovery in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Technological maturation in the past two decades and the recent explosive developments of DEL&#8208;compatible chemistries have greatly improved the chemical diversity of DELs and fuelled its applications in drug discovery. A relatively less&#8208;covered aspect of DELs is the selection method. Typically, DEL selection is considered as a binding assay and the selection is conducted with purified protein targets immobilized on a matrix, and the binders are separated from the non&#8208;binding background via physical washes. However, the recent innovations in DEL selection methods have not only expanded the target scope of DELs, but also revealed the potential of the DEL technology as a powerful tool in exploring fundamental biology. In this Review, we first cover the &#8220;classic&#8221; DEL selection methods with purified proteins on solid phase, and then we discuss the strategies to realize DEL selections in solution phase. Finally, we focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.</dc:description>

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) and methyl iodide. Characterisation of a range of naturally occurring HMTs and subsequent protein engineering led to HMT variants capable of synthesising ethyl, propyl, and allyl analogues of SAM. Notably, HMTs do not depend on chemical synthesis of methionine analogues, as required by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). However, at the moment MATs have a much broader substrate scope than the HMTs. Herein we provide an overview on the discovery and engineering of promiscuous HMTs and how these strategies will pave the way towards a toolbox of HMT variants for versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.</dc:description>

         <title>Marine Polysaccharides: Occurrence, Enzymatic Degradation and Utilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroalgae species are fast growing and their polysaccharides are already used as food ingredients due to their properties as hydrocolloids or they have potential high value bioactivity. The degradation of these valuable polysaccharides to access the sugar components remained mostly unexplored so far. One reason is the high structural complexity of algal polysaccharides, but also the need for suitable enzyme cocktails to obtain oligo&#8208; and monosaccharides. Among them, there are several rare sugars with high value. Recently, considerable progress was made in the discovery of highly specific carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes able to decompose complex marine carbohydrates such as carrageenan, laminarin, agar, porphyran and ulvan. This minireview summarizes these achievements and highlights potential applications of the now accessible abundant renewable resource of marine polysaccharides</dc:description>

         <title>A H2S&#8208;Specific Ultrasensitive Fluorogenic Probe Reveals TMV&#8208;Induced H2S Production to Limit Virus Replication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the role of H  2  S in host defense mechanisms against RNA viruses may provide opportunities for the development of antivirals to combat viral infections. Here, we have developed a green&#8208;emitting fluorogenic probe, which exhibits a large fluorescence response at 520 nm (&gt; 560&#8208;fold) when treated with 100 &#181;M H  2  S for 1 h. It is highly selective for H  2  S over biothiols (&gt; 400&#8208;fold  F  /  F  0  ) and has a detection limit of 12.9 nM. We demonstrate the application of the probe for endogenous H  2  S detection  in vivo  for the understanding of its roles in antiviral host defense. Such virus&#8208;induced H  2  S inhibits viral replication by reducing gene expression of RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase  (  RdRp) and coat protein (CP). Additionally, a H  2  S donor GYY4137 showed significantly antiviral activity as ribavirin, a broad&#8208;spectrum drug against RNA viruses. Furtherly, we propose a possible molecular mechanism for the TMV&#8208;induced H  2  S biogenesis. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in support of further studies identifying endogenous H  2  S and its donors as potential antivirals toward RNA viruses.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria growing in complex, multicellular enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Recently, a zwitterionic cellulose derivatives&#160;produced in  Escherichia coli  (  E. coli  ) was determined to play an important role in the formation and assembly of bacterial biofilms. In order to access a minimal, yet structurally defined tool compound to probe the biology of the naturally occurring polymer, we have synthesized a zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose (pEtN cellobiose) and evaluated its biofilm activity in the gram&#8208;negative bacterium  E. coli  , a pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of UTIs. The impact of synthetic pEtN cellobiose on bacterial biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays which revealed an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic surface compared to an untreated samples. Additionally, Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing  E. coli  in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo red binding to bacterial cells. These results reveal new opportunities to study the impact that zwitterionic cellulose has on cellular adhesion in gram&#8208;negative pathogens via a minimal synthetic tool.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic RNA Production from NTPs Synthesized from Nucleosides and Trimetaphosphate**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of the reaction of nucleosides with cyclic trimetaphosphate under mild aqueous conditions produces nucleoside triphosphates at concentrations sufficient to sustain RNA synthesis by ribozyme and protein RNA polymerases.







Abstract
A mechanism of nucleoside triphosphorylation would have been critical in an evolving &#8220;RNA world&#8221; to provide high&#8208;energy substrates for reactions such as RNA polymerization. However, synthetic approaches to produce ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) have suffered from conditions such as high temperatures or high pH that lead to increased RNA degradation, as well as substrate production that cannot sustain replication. Previous reports have demonstrated that cyclic trimetaphosphate (cTmp) can react with nucleosides to form rNTPs under prebiotically&#8208;relevant conditions, but their reaction rates were unknown and the influence of reaction conditions not well&#8208;characterized. Here we established a sensitive assay that allowed for the determination of second&#8208;order rate constants for all four rNTPs, ranging from 1.7&#215;10&#8722;6 to 6.5&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The ATP reaction shows a linear dependence on pH and Mg2+, and an enthalpy of activation of 88&#177;4&#8197;kJ/mol. At millimolar nucleoside and cTmp concentrations, the rNTP production rate is sufficient to facilitate RNA synthesis by both T7 RNA polymerase and a polymerase ribozyme. We suggest that the optimized reaction of cTmp with nucleosides may provide a viable connection between prebiotic nucleotide synthesis and RNA replication.

         <title>Chemoproteomic Profiling of Covalent XPO1 Inhibitors to Assess Target Engagement and Selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Target engaged? We report clickable probes based on the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor and eltanexor for the labeling of XPO1 in live cells to assess target engagement and selectivity. We used mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic workflows to profile the proteome&#8208;wide selectivity of selinexor and eltanexor and show that they are highly selective for XPO1.







Abstract
Selinexor, a covalent XPO1 inhibitor, is approved in the USA in combination with dexamethasone for penta&#8208;refractory multiple myeloma. Additional XPO1 covalent inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for multiple diseases including hematologic malignancies, solid tumor malignancies, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is important to measure the target engagement and selectivity of covalent inhibitors to understand the degree of engagement needed for efficacy, while avoiding both mechanism&#8208;based and off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we report clickable probes based on the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor and eltanexor for the labeling of XPO1 in live cells to assess target engagement and selectivity. We used mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic workflows to profile the proteome&#8208;wide selectivity of selinexor and eltanexor and show that they are highly selective for XPO1. Thermal profiling analysis of selinexor further offers an orthogonal approach to measure XPO1 engagement in live cells. We believe these probes and assays will serve as useful tools to further interrogate the biology of XPO1 and its inhibition in cellular and in&#8197;vivo systems.

         <title>A Mutation&#8208;Based Method for Pinpointing a DNA N6&#8208;Methyladenine Methyltransferase Modification Site at Single Base Resolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) substrate modification site at single&#8208;base resolution is described.







Abstract
DNA N6&#8208;methyladenine (6mA) has recently received notable attention due to an increased finding of its functional roles in higher eukaryotes. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) substrate modification site at single base resolution. A designed allyl&#8208;substituted MTase cofactor was applied in the catalytic transfer reaction, and the allyl group was installed to the N6&#8208;position of adenine within a specific DNA sequence to form N6&#8208;allyladenine (6aA). The iodination of 6aA allyl group induced the formation of 1, N6&#8208;cyclized adenine which caused mutations during DNA replication by a polymerase. Thus the modification site could be precisely detected by a mutation signal. We synthesized 6aA deoxynucleoside and deoxynucleotide model compounds and a 6aA&#8208;containing DNA probe, and screened nine DNA polymerases to define an optimal system capable of detecting the substrate modification site of a DNA 6mA MTase at single&#8208;base resolution.

         <title>Development of NanoBRET&#8208;binding assays for FKBP&#8208;ligand profiling in living cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>FK506&#8208;binding proteins (FKBPs) are promising targets for a variety of disorders and infectious diseases. High FKBP occupancy is thought to be necessary for ligands to effectively compete with the endogenous intracellular functions of FKBPs. Here, we report the development of NanoBRET assays for the most prominent cytosolic FKBPs, FKBP12, 12.6, 51 and 52. These assays allowed rapid profiling of FKBP ligands for target engagement and selectivity in living cells. These assays confirmed the selectivity of SAFit&#8208;type ligands for FKBP51 over FKBP52 but revealed a substantial offset for the intracellular activity of these ligands compared to bicyclic ligands or natural products. Our results stress the importance to control for intracellular FKBP occupancy and provide the assays to guide further FKBP ligand optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;amyloid Targeting with Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: Multi&#8208;Scale In&#8208;Silico Dissection of Nano&#8208;Biointerface</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytotoxic aggregation of misfolded &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) proteins is the main culprit suspected to be behind the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). In this study, A&#946; interactions with the novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as therapeutic options for avoiding &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation have been investigated. The results from multi&#8208;scale atomistic simulations suggest that amine&#8208;functionalized COFs with a large surface area (more than 1000 m2/gr) have the potential to prevent A&#946; aggregation. Gibb&#8217;s free energy analysis confirmed that COFs could prevent protofibril self&#8208;assembly in addition to inhibiting &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation. Additionally, it was observed that the amine functional group and high contact area could improve the inhibitory effect of COFs on A&#946; aggregation and enhance the diffusivity of COFs through the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). In addition, microsecond coarse&#8208;grained (CG) simulations with three hundred amyloids reveal that the presence of COFs creates instability in the structure of amyloids and consequently prevents the fibrillation. These results suggest promising applications of engineered COFs in the treatment of AD and provide a new perspective on future experimental researches.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a need of a non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway reporter system that facilitates screening and discovery of NHEJ chemical inhibitors. In this study, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 based luciferase turn&#8208;on system as a NHEJ pathway reporter. By substituting nucleotide 205C with ATC, we introduced a reading&#8208;frame shift and a pre&#8208;stop codon into the luciferase coding region and thereby generated a bioluminescent signal mute HEK293T reporter cell line. Then, a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 plasmid expressing a guide RNA targeting luciferase coding region was introduced into the reporter cell line to generate NHEJ&#8208;associated indel to restore the reading frame and subsequently turn on the bioluminescent signal. We observed over three&#8208;thousand fold increase in signal after CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 vector transfection. Different known chemical inhibitors of the NHEJ pathway, such as NU7441, KU0060648, and KU55933, could significantly inhibit the bioluminescent signal generated by CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting. In addition, we validated our system by high throughput sequencing.</dc:description>

         <title>High regio&#8208; and stereoselective multi&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of all phenylpropanolamine stereoisomers from &#946;&#8208;methylstyrene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for the synthesis of phenylpropanolamines (PPAs) in high optical purities (er and dr up to &gt;99.5%) and yields (up to 95%) by using 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols as key intermediates. This bioamination entails the combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;TA) and an alanine dehydrogenase to create a redox&#8208;neutral network, which harnesses the exquisite and complementary regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities of the selected ADHs and &#969;TAs. The requisite 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol intermediates were obtained from trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylstyrene by combining a styrene monooxygenase with epoxide hydrolases.

         <title>Flexible assembly of engineered Tetrahymena ribozymes forming polygonal RNA nanostructures with catalytic ability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribozymes with modular architecture constitute an attractive class of structural platforms for design and construction of nucleic acid nanostructures with biological functions. Through modular engineering of the  Tetrahymena  ribozyme, we have designed unit RNAs (L&#8208;RNAs), assembly of which formed ribozyme&#8208;based closed trimers and closed tetramers. Their catalytic activity was dependent on oligomer formation. In this study, the structural variety of L&#8208;RNA oligomers was extended by tuning their structural elements, yielding closed pentamers and closed hexamers. Their assembly properties were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).</dc:description>

         <title>Cryo&#8208;kinetics reveal dynamic effects on the chemistry of human dihydrofolate reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effects of isotopic substitution on the rate constants of human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR), an important target for anti&#8208;cancer drugs, have not previously been characterized due to its complex fast kinetics. Here, we report the results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the HsDHFR catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE&#160;(kHLE/kHHE)&#160;close to unity above 0&#160;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE&#160;was increased to&#160;1.72 &#177; 0.15 at &#8208;20 &#176;C, indicating&#160;that the coupling of protein motions to the&#160;chemical step&#160;is minimized under optimal conditions&#160;but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures. The presented cryogenic approach provides an opportunity to probe the kinetics of mammalian DHFRs, thereby laying the foundation for characterising their transition state structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence properties of a novel isoquinoline derivative tested in an invertebrate chordate, Ciona intestinalis</title>

         <dc:description>3&#8208;Hydroxyisoquinolines (ISOs) and their tautomeric isoquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are heterocycles with attractive biological properties. Here we reported the revisited synthesis of a highly functionalized ISO that showed blue fluorescence and the characterization of its biological properties in an invertebrate animal model, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Larvae exposed to ISO at concentrations higher than 1 &#181;M showed an intense fluorescence localized in the cell nuclei of all tissues. Moreover, exposure to ISO interfered with larval ability to swim; this neuromuscular effect was reversible. Overall, these results suggested that ISOs can have promising applications as novel fluorescent dyes of the cell nuclei.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel D&#8208;A&#8208;D photosensitizer for efficient NIR imaging and photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted great interest in cancer theranostics owing to its minimal invasiveness and low side effect. In PDT, photosensitizers are indispensable components that generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to optimizing the photosensitizer with enhanced ROS efficiency. However, to improve the precision and controllability for PDT, developing NIR imaging&#8208;guided photosensitizers are still urgent and challenging. Here, we designed a novel photosensitizer 2Cz&#8208;BTZ which integrated with intense NIR emission and photoinduced singlet oxygen  1  O  2  generation capabilities. Moreover, after loading the photosensitizers 2Cz&#8208;BTZ into biocompatible amphiphilic polymers F127, the formed 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited good photoinduced therapy as well as long&#8208;term  in vivo  imaging capabilities. By virtue of these merits, the 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 NPs showed NIR imaging&#8208;guided PDT, which paved a promising way for spatiotemporally precise tumor theranostics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sulfonyl&#8208;triazoles have emerged as a new reactive group for covalent modification of tyrosine sites on proteins through sulfur&#8208;triazole exchange (SuTEx) chemistry. The extent to which this sulfur electrophile can be tuned for developing ligands with cellular activity remains largely underexplored. Here, we performed fragment&#8208;based ligand discovery in live cells to identify SuTEx compounds capable of liganding tyrosine sites on diverse protein targets. We verified our quantitative chemical proteomic findings by demonstrating concentration dependent activity of SuTEx ligands but not inactive counterparts against recombinant protein targets directly in live cells.

         <title>Targeting the Surface of the Protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 by Ultrasmall (1.5&#8197;nm) Gold Nanoparticles Carrying the Specific Peptide CRaf</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1456-1463, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny, but targeted: The protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 is targeted by 18 CRaf peptide ligands on the surface of an ultrasmall gold nanoparticle (ca. 115 gold atoms). ITC and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy demonstrate an efficient supramolecular binding between nanoparticle and protein. The easy uptake of nanoparticles by cells opens up the possibility of targeting proteins inside cells.







Abstract
The surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.55&#8197;nm was conjugated with a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;binding peptide derived from CRaf. Each particle carries 18 CRaf peptides, leading to an overall stoichiometry of Au(115)Craf(18). The binding to the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 was probed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy (FP). The dissociation constant (KD) was measured as 5.0&#8197;&#956;M by ITC and 0.9&#8197;&#956;M by FP, which was close to the affinity of dissolved CRaf to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963;. In contrast to dissolved CRaf, which alone did not enter HeLa cells, CRAF&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles were well taken up by HeLa cells, opening the opportunity to target the protein inside a cell.

For availability and atom economy, hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant. Due to its diverse roles, the lack of a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed an efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide based on enzyme promiscuity with p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters as substrates.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in view of its availability, atom economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling physiological processes, but its unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to preventing the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide with the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the formation of peracid. To our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting hydrogen peroxide in aqueous media.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis of Selenoproteins in High Yield and Purity for Selective Protein Tagging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1480-1486, April 16, 2021. </description>

34Se&#8208;lective protein tagging: Cell&#8208;free protein synthesis is used to produce selenoproteins in high yield and purity. Selenocysteine has long been recognized as offering an exquisitely reactive chemical handle for chemical modifications of proteins, and we show that the alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenol groups with a chloro&#8208;alkyl group proceeds quickly under conditions that leaves cysteine residues unchanged.







Abstract
The selenol group of selenocysteine is much more nucleophilic than the thiol group of cysteine. Selenocysteine residues in proteins thus offer reactive points for rapid post&#8208;translational modification. Herein, we show that selenoproteins can be expressed in high yield and purity by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis by global substitution of cysteine by selenocysteine. Complete alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenocysteine residues was achieved in 10 minutes with 4&#8208;chloromethylene dipicolinic acid (4Cl&#8208;MDPA) under conditions that left cysteine residues unchanged even after overnight incubation. GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured by double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments of maltose binding protein (MBP) containing two selenocysteine residues tagged with 4Cl&#8208;MDPA&#8208;GdIII were indistinguishable from GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured of MBP containing cysteine reacted with 4Br&#8208;MDPA tags.

         <title>Ligand Induced CuII Transport Restricts Cancer and Mycobacterial Growth: Towards a Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Select Ion Channel Scaffold</title>

A hole in more than one: A peptide scaffold with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII across simple and complex lipid membranes. The peptide forms stables pores in the membranes and transports ions by an antiport mechanism. Such peptides could facilitate Cu transport across mycobacterial or cancer cell membranes as an effective anti&#8208;infective strategy or to induce cell death.







Abstract
Synthetic channels with high ion selectivity are attractive drug targets for diseases involving ion dysregulation. Achieving selective transport of divalent ions is highly challenging due their high hydration energies. A small tripeptide amphiphilic scaffold installed with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII ions across membranes. The peptide forms stable dimeric pores in the membrane and transports ions by a Cu2+/H+ antiport mechanism. The ligand&#8208;induced excellent CuII selectivity as well as high membrane permeability of the peptide is exploited to promote cancer cell death. The peptide's ability to restrict mycobacterial growth serves as seeds to evolve antibacterial strategies centred on selectively modulating ion homeostasis in pathogens. This simple peptide can potentially function as a universal, yet versatile, scaffold wherein the ion selectivity can be precisely controlled by modifying the ligand at the C terminus.

         <title>Use of Copper as a Trigger for the in Vivo Activity of E. coli Laccase CueO: A Simple Tool for Biosynthetic Purposes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1470-1479, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient: The endogenous E. coli laccase CueO was activated by the addition of copper ions to cells, which were subsequently used for oxidative phenolic coupling. As a proof of concept, CueO&#8208;catalyzed dimerization of coniferyl alcohol was integrated into a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade in E. coli to produce the plant lignan (&#8722;)&#8208;matairesinol.







Abstract
Laccases are multi&#8208;copper oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of various electron&#8208;rich substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The multi&#8208;copper oxidase/laccase CueO of Escherichia coli is responsible for the oxidation of Cu+ to the less harmful Cu2+ in the periplasm. CueO has a relatively broad substrate spectrum as laccase, and its activity is enhanced by copper excess. The aim of this study was to trigger CueO activity in&#8197;vivo for the use in biocatalysis. The addition of 5&#8197;mM CuSO4 was proven effective in triggering CueO activity at need with minor toxic effects on E. coli cells. Cu&#8208;treated E. coli cells were able to convert several phenolic compounds to the corresponding dimers. Finally, the endogenous CueO activity was applied to a four&#8208;step cascade, in which coniferyl alcohol was converted to the valuable plant lignan (&#8722;)&#8208;matairesinol.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Semi&#8208;synthesis Enables Efficient Production of Isotopically Labeled &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Site&#8208;Specific Tyrosine Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1440-1447, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies for producing &#945;&#8208;synuclein phosphorylated at Tyr39 (&#945;S&#8208;pY39) are compared, and the value of a chemoenzymatic strategy with one&#8208;pot ligation is demonstrated, in particular for producing 15N&#8208;labeled protein for NMR studies.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) can affect the normal function and pathology of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S), an amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;forming protein linked to Parkinson's disease. Phosphorylation of &#945;S Tyr39 has recently been found to display a dose&#8208;dependent effect on fibril formation kinetics and to alter the morphology of the fibrils. Existing methods to access site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated &#945;S for biochemical studies include total or semi&#8208;synthesis by native chemical ligation (NCL) as well as chemoenzymatic methods to phosphorylate peptides, followed by NCL. Here, we investigated a streamlined method to produce large quantities of phosphorylated &#945;S by co&#8208;expressing a kinase with a protein fragment in Escherichia coli. We also introduced the use of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) to enable one&#8208;pot NCL and desulfurization. We compare our optimized methods to previous reports and show that we can achieve the highest yields of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated protein through chemoenzymatic methods using MTG, and that our strategy is uniquely well suited to producing 15N&#8208;labeled, phosphorylated protein for NMR studies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several strategies&lt;/b&gt; for producing &#945;&#8208;synuclein phosphorylated at Tyr39 (&#945;S&#8208;pY39) are compared, and the value of a chemoenzymatic strategy with one&#8208;pot ligation is demonstrated, in particular for producing &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&#8208;labeled protein for NMR studies.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) can affect the normal function and pathology of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S), an amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;forming protein linked to Parkinson's disease. Phosphorylation of &#945;S Tyr39 has recently been found to display a dose&#8208;dependent effect on fibril formation kinetics and to alter the morphology of the fibrils. Existing methods to access site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated &#945;S for biochemical studies include total or semi&#8208;synthesis by native chemical ligation (NCL) as well as chemoenzymatic methods to phosphorylate peptides, followed by NCL. Here, we investigated a streamlined method to produce large quantities of phosphorylated &#945;S by co&#8208;expressing a kinase with a protein fragment in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We also introduced the use of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) to enable one&#8208;pot NCL and desulfurization. We compare our optimized methods to previous reports and show that we can achieve the highest yields of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated protein through chemoenzymatic methods using MTG, and that our strategy is uniquely well suited to producing &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&#8208;labeled, phosphorylated protein for NMR studies.&lt;/p&gt;

Gie it LALDI! The derivatisation of (bio)molecules with laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancers allows their selective detection by label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI&#8208;MS). We have developed and characterised pyrene&#8208;based LDI enhancers (LALDI tags) for the labelling and LALDI&#8208;MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates, highlighting the compatibility of LALDI&#8208;MS with complex biological samples.







Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) is widely used for the analysis of biomolecules. Label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI&#8208;MS) is a matrix&#8208;free variant of MALDI&#8208;MS, in which only analytes covalently attached to a laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancer are detected. LALDI&#8208;MS has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of MALDI&#8208;MS in terms of sample preparation and MS analysis. In this work, we have developed a series of pyrene&#8208;based LDI reagents (LALDI tags) that can be used for labelling and LALDI&#8208;MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates from complex (biological) samples without the need for additional chemical derivatisation or purification. We have systematically explored the suitability of four pyrene&#8208;based LDI enhancers and three aldehyde&#8208;reactive handles, optimised sample preparation, and demonstrated the use of LALDI tags for the detection of lactose. We have also exemplified the potential of LALDI tags for labelling carbohydrates in biological samples by direct detection of lactose in cow's milk. These results demonstrate that LALDI&#8208;MS is a promising technique for the analysis of reducing carbohydrates in biological samples, and pave the way for the development of LALDI&#8208;MS for glycomics and diagnostics.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter&#8208;Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper&#8208;Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>

Going for the triple: Copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from the remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer from Glu113 to an intermediate H2O or from Lys128 to His260.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide; key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron&#8208;/proton&#8208;transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton&#8208;transfer channels, the high&#8208;pH proton channel and the primary proton channel, by using two&#8208;layered ONIOM calculations. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanism. In the high&#8208;pH proton channel, the water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel, the transfer is from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton&#8208;transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase and could extend our understanding of the diverse proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms in complicated proteins.

         <title>Synthetic Phenolic Glycolipids for Application in Diagnostic Tests for Leprosy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1487-1493, April 16, 2021. </description>

Getting to the point of care: Trisaccharides of phenolic glycolipids (PGL) originating from M. leprae were evaluated for their diagnostic potential as neoglycoproteins in ELISA and an up&#8208;converting particle lateral flow assay (UCP&#8208;LFA). Two naturally occurring trisaccharides were found to be suitable for this purpose and can thus be used for future field studies in leprosy endemic areas.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative pathogen of leprosy, represent efficient tools to guide therapeutic and prophylactic treatment strategies in leprosy control programs, thus positively contributing to clinical outcome and reducing transmission of this infectious disease. Levels of antibodies directed against the M. leprae&#8208;specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL&#8722;I) closely correlate with an individual's bacterial load and a higher risk of developing leprosy. We describe herein the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns. The PGL trisaccharides were applied to construct neoglycoproteins that were used to detect anti&#8208;PGL IgM antibodies in leprosy patients. ELISAs and quantitative lateral&#8208;flow assays based on up&#8208;converting nanoparticles (UCP&#8208;LFAs) showed that the generated PGL&#8722;I and PGL&#8208;II trisaccharide neoglycoconjugates can be applied for the detection of anti M. leprae IgM antibodies in POC tests.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling of Bile Salt Hydrolysis in the Human Gut Microbiome with Beta&#8208;Lactam or Acrylamide&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1448-1455, April 16, 2021. </description>

More than a gut feeling: The salts in bile, which aids digestion, can be modified by gut microbes. Bile salts act as signaling molecules, so structural modifications can impact host physiology. The microbial &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; for bile salt modification is bile salt hydrolase (BSH). To uncover the molecular links between BSH and host health, novel activity&#8208;based probes for BSH were developed.







Abstract
Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Therefore, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases by using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.

To uncover the molecular links between BSH and host health, novel activity&#8208;based probes for BSH were developed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Therefore, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases by using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>

Where is thy sting? Wasp venom&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;helical peptides and analogues were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The analogues were less toxic to cells and could accumulate inside cancer cells. Protonectin&#8208;F kills cancer cells and bacteria whereas neuroVAL is a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide.







Abstract
Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp Parachartergus fraternus that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F, were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined by using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.

         <title>Ferritin as a Platform for Creating Antiviral Mosaic Nanocages: Prospects for Treating COVID&#8208;19</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1371-1378, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling bottlenecks: Antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement of infection and low or narrow efficacy against strains of a virus are two bottlenecks to antibody therapy and vaccines. To tackle them, I propose using ferritin to develop novel antiviral mosaic nanocages that could deliver a cocktail of antibodies, nanobodies, or a combination of therapeutics, deceive a virus, or elicit a broad neutralizing antibody response.







Abstract
Infectious diseases are a continues threat to human health and the economy worldwide. The latest example is the global pandemic of COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Antibody therapy and vaccines are promising approaches to treat the disease; however, they have bottlenecks: they might have low efficacy or narrow breadth due to the continuous emergence of new strains of the virus or antibodies could cause antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. To address these bottlenecks, I propose the use of 24&#8208;meric ferritin for the synthesis of mosaic nanocages to deliver a cocktail of antibodies or nanobodies alone or in combination with another therapeutic, like a nucleotide analogue, to mimic the viral entry process and deceive the virus, or to develop mosaic vaccines. I argue that available data showing the effectiveness of ferritin&#8208;antibody conjugates in targeting specific cells and ferritin&#8208;haemagglutinin nanocages in developing influenza vaccines strongly support my proposals.

The landmark building of our school is the place where we started to solve the first full&#8208;length crystal structure of a self&#8208;sufficient cytochrome P450 (CYP116B46). The building has three main parts that are in an alignment similar to that of the three&#8208;domain CYP116B46. Cytochrome P450s are powerful biocatalysts with potential in many biotechnological applications. The majority of P450s demand redox equivalents that travel from pyridine nucleotides through the electron&#8208;transfer path to the catalytic center, like the lightning descending. In our review, we summarize the current understanding of the P450 electron&#8208;transfer route, with particular focus on the recently reported structures of two types of self&#8208;sufficient P450s. This information should provide important insights into the P450 mechanism studies and engineering. More information can be found in the review by X. Yu, R.&#8208;T. Guo, et&#8197;al.

Sorting out sortases: The bacterial transpeptidase sortase A has entered center stage as a versatile tool for protein bioconjugation and semisynthesis. Sortase A of Staphylococcus is widely used, but suffers from slow kinetics and a narrow specificity profile. Recent protein engineering campaigns aiming to improve these shortcomings have been successful and delivered enhanced sortase mutants with enhanced catalytic properties.







Abstract
The transpeptidase sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa&#8208;SrtA) is a valuable tool in protein chemistry. The native enzyme anchors surface proteins containing a highly conserved LPxTG sorting motif to a terminal glycine residue of the peptidoglycan layer in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This reaction is exploited for sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML), allowing the site&#8208;specific linkage of synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins by a native peptide bond. However, the moderate catalytic efficiency and specificity of Sa&#8208;SrtA fueled the development of new biocatalysts for SML, including the screening of sortase A variants form microorganisms other than S. aureus and the directed protein evolution of the Sa&#8208;SrtA enzyme itself. Novel display platforms and screening formats were developed to isolate sortases with altered properties from mutant libraries. This yielded sortases with strongly enhanced catalytic activity and enzymes recognizing new sorting motifs as substrates. This minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of directed sortase evolution and applications of these tailor&#8208;made enzymes in biochemistry.

         <title>Chemical Labeling of Protein 4&#8242;&#8208;Phosphopantetheinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1357-1367, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally diverse chemical probes have been used to label protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation. Herein, we review how CoA analogs could be incorporated by highly promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) and used for in&#8197;situ labeling of the membrane proteins fused with acceptor tags. These cell&#8208;permeable pantetheine analogs facilitated the metabolic labeling of the endogenous substrates in both bacterial and mammalian cells.







Abstract
Nature uses a diverse array of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) to regulate protein structure, activity, localization, and function. Among them, protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation derived from coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential PTM for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To explore its functions, various chemical probes mimicking the natural structure of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation have been developed. In this minireview, we summarize these chemical probes and describe their applications in direct and metabolic labeling of proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structurally diverse chemical probes&lt;/b&gt; have been used to label protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation. Herein, we review how CoA analogs could be incorporated by highly promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) and used for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; labeling of the membrane proteins fused with acceptor tags. These cell&#8208;permeable pantetheine analogs facilitated the metabolic labeling of the endogenous substrates in both bacterial and mammalian cells.

         <title>Advanced Understanding of the Electron Transfer Pathway of Cytochrome P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1317-1328, April 16, 2021. </description>

Versatile P450s catalyze various reactions upon acquiring electrons from redox partners. Electrons transferred from the cofactor to heme are of central importance to P450 action, but the route electrons travel remains unveiled. This issue might be probed under the guidance of recent structural studies of self&#8208;sufficient P450s.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s are heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that participate in carbon source assimilation, natural compound biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism in all kingdoms of life. P450s can catalyze various reactions by using a wide range of organic compounds, thus exhibiting great potential in biotechnological applications. The catalytic reactions of P450s are driven by electron equivalents that are sourced from pyridine nucleotides and delivered by cognate or matching redox partners (RPs). The electron transfer (ET) route from RPs to P450s involves one or more redox center&#8208;containing domains. As the rate of ET is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural studies of the two main types of self&#8208;sufficient P450 will also be summarized.

         <title>Engineered Microbes for Producing Anticholinergics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1368-1370, April 16, 2021. </description>

The Smolke group recently developed yeast strains producing the tropane alkaloids scopolamine and hyoscyamine to enable a possible alternative supply of these compounds by metabolic engineering. Such a tour&#8208;de&#8208;force notably required the identification of a missing enzyme of the pathway, invalidation of yeast endogenous genes and relocation of enzymes to restore a synthesis activity.







Abstract
The tropane alkaloids (TAs) hyoscyamine and scopolamine function as acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are used clinically as parasympatholytics to treat neuromuscular disorders in humans. While TAs are synthesized in a small subset of plant families, these specialized metabolites are only accumulated in limited quantities in plant organs. The complex chemical structures of these compounds make their industrial production by chemical synthesis very challenging, Therefore, the supply of these TAs still relies on intensive farming of Duboisia shrubs in tropical countries. Many adverse factors such as climate fluctuations and pandemics can thus influence annual world production. Based on the landmark microbial production of the antimalarial semi&#8208;synthetic artemisinin, the Smolke group recently developed a yeast cell factory capable of de novo synthesizing hyoscyamine and scopolamine, thus paving the way for an alternative production of these compounds.

         <title>Chemical Properties Determine Solubility and Stability in &#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins of the Eye Lens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1329-1346, April 16, 2021. </description>

Clear as crystallin? &#946;&#947;&#8208;crystallins serve as structural and refractive proteins in the vertebrate lens. Mutations in these proteins are associated with cataracts. Herein, we review recent developments toward understanding the biophysical properties and chemical reactivity of monomeric and oligomeric &#946;&#947; crystallins, including a discussion of the common techniques used to study crystallin structure and stability.







Abstract
&#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins are the primary structural and refractive proteins found in the vertebrate eye lens. Because crystallins are not replaced after early eye development, their solubility and stability must be maintained for a lifetime, which is even more remarkable given the high protein concentration in the lens. Aggregation of crystallins caused by mutations or post&#8208;translational modifications can reduce crystallin protein stability and alter intermolecular interactions. Common post&#8208;translational modifications that can cause age&#8208;related cataracts include deamidation, oxidation, and tryptophan derivatization. Metal ion binding can also trigger reduced crystallin solubility through a variety of mechanisms. Interprotein interactions are critical to maintaining lens transparency: crystallins can undergo domain swapping, disulfide bonding, and liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, all of which can cause opacity depending on the context. Important experimental techniques for assessing crystallin conformation in the absence of a high&#8208;resolution structure include dye&#8208;binding assays, circular dichroism, fluorescence, light scattering, and transition metal FRET.

         <title>Prelabeling Expansion Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy with Minimal Linkage Error</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1396-1399, April 16, 2021. </description>

Keeping it all together: Single&#8208;molecule expansion microscopy can reach a resolution on the molecular scale that is challenged by labeling density and linkage error. We introduce a biotinylizable peptide tag and gel&#8208;linkable fluorescent streptavidin that enable a fixed 5&#8208;nm linkage between a fluorophore and a protein of interest in a cell.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy combined with single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (ExSMLM) has a potential for approaching molecular resolution. However, ExSMLM faces multiple challenges such as loss of fluorophores and proteins during polymerization, digestion or denaturation, and an increase in linkage error arising from the distance between the fluorophore and the target molecule. Here, we introduce a trifunctional streptavidin to link the target, fluorophore and gel matrix via a biotinylizable peptide tag. The resultant ExSMLM images of vimentin filaments demonstrated high labeling efficiency and a minimal linkage error of &#8764;5&#8197;nm. Our ExSMLM provides a simple and practical means for fluorescence imaging with molecular resolution.

         <title>Efficient Incorporation of Clickable Unnatural Amino Acids Enables Rapid and Biocompatible Labeling of Proteins in Vitro and in Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1379-1384, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
All about the numbers: We report the evolution of translation machinery for incorporation of an alkyne&#8208;bearing unnatural amino acid (uAA) into proteins, and show that it enables efficient multisite uAA incorporation in recoded and wild&#8208;type bacteria. Using this approach, we demonstrate rapid and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of uAA&#8208;containing elastin&#8208;like polypeptides.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) bearing a bioorthogonal group has enabled the attachment &#8211; typically at a single site or at a few sites per protein &#8211; of chemical groups at precise locations for protein and biomaterial labeling, conjugation, and functionalization. Herein, we report the evolution of chromosomal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the alkyne&#8208;bearing uAA, 4&#8208;propargyloxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pPR), with &#8764;30&#8208;fold increased production of green fluorescent protein containing three instances of pPR compared with a previously described M. jannaschii&#8208;derived aaRS for pPR, when expressed from a single chromosomal copy. We show that when expressed from multicopy plasmids, the evolved aaRSs enable the production &#8211; using a genomically recoded Escherichia coli and the non&#8208;recoded BL21 E. coli strain &#8211; of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) containing multiple pPR residues in high yields. We further show that the multisite incorporation of pPR in ELPs facilitates the rapid, robust, and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of these proteins in bacteria. The evolved variants described in this work can be used to produce a variety of protein and biomaterial conjugates and to create efficient minimal tags for protein labeling.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All about the numbers&lt;/b&gt;: We report the evolution of translation machinery for incorporation of an alkyne&#8208;bearing unnatural amino acid (uAA) into proteins, and show that it enables efficient multisite uAA incorporation in recoded and wild&#8208;type bacteria. Using this approach, we demonstrate rapid and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of uAA&#8208;containing elastin&#8208;like polypeptides.

         <title>Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1400-1404, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed phenoxy radical biotinylation, an increasingly important tool in biotechnology and molecular biology applications, is here shown to label guanosine bases in RNA, but not in DNA, under defined conditions. Remarkably, common fluorescein conjugates of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides are found to undergo facile biotinylation on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence. This convenient observation points to a variety of practical applications of peroxidase&#8208;catalyzed chemistry for analysis of DNA conjugates in vitro and in cells.







Abstract
Recent advances in peroxidase&#8208;mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high&#8208;resolution and subcellular compartment&#8208;specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence&#8208;independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.

         <title>The Peculiar Case of the Hyper&#8208;thermostable Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 8, Page 1385-1390, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
What? The pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is an outlier among its peers. The enzyme is extremely stable and performs remarkably well in near&#8208;boiling, cosolvent&#8208;heavy media, but an apparent inhibition by nucleobases renders its performance in preparative applications rather subpar.







Abstract
The poor solubility of many nucleosides and nucleobases in aqueous solution demands harsh reaction conditions (base, heat, cosolvent) in nucleoside phosphorylase&#8208;catalyzed processes to facilitate substrate loading beyond the low millimolar range. This, in turn, requires enzymes that can withstand these conditions. Herein, we report that the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is active over an exceptionally broad pH (4&#8211;10), temperature (up to 100&#8201;&#176;C) and cosolvent space (up to 80&#8201;% (v/v) nonaqueous medium), and displays tremendous stability under harsh reaction conditions with predicted total turnover numbers of more than 106 for various pyrimidine nucleosides. However, its use as a biocatalyst for preparative applications is critically limited due to its inhibition by nucleobases at low concentrations, which is unprecedented among nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases.

         <title>An Economical High&#8208;Throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; Assay for Screening Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors**

High performance, low cost: A wash&#8208;free, low&#8208;cost fluorescent&#8208;polarization&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput assay has been developed for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase. Such an assay is &#8220;catalytic&#8221;, thus only needing minimal amounts of enzymes and could potentially identify inhibitors targeting both the acceptor and donor binding&#8208;sites.







Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is involved in many cellular processes, and selective OGT inhibitors are valuable tools to investigate O&#8208;GlcNAcylation functions, and could potentially lead to therapeutics. However, high&#8208;throughput OGT assays that are suitable for large&#8208;scale HTS and can identify inhibitors targeting both acceptor, donor sites, and allosteric binding&#8208;sites are still lacking. Here, we report the development of a high&#8208;throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; OGT assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a low&#8208;cost and superior &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221;. With this assay, 2&#8208;methyleurotinone was identified as a low&#8208;micromolar OGT inhibitor. This type of assay with BSA as &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; would find more applications with other glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Construction of a CRISPR&#8208;Biolayer Interferometry Platform for Real&#8208;Time, Sensitive, and Specific DNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threefold detection: A CRISPR biosensor is immobilized on a biolayer to construct a CRISPR&#8208;BLI platform for DNA detection. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI chip is rapid, label&#8208;free, and real&#8208;time, and has high sequence affinity and specificity due to the properties of BLI and the CRISPR probe. Coupling with PCR improves the sensitivity to 1.34&#8197;pg, revealing promising applications in dsDNA detection.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been widely applied for nucleic acid detection because of its high specificity. By using the highly specific and irreversible bond between HaloTag and its alkane chlorine ligand, we modified dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR/Cas9) with biotin as a biosensor to detect nucleic acids. The CRISPR biosensor was facilely prepared to adequately maintain its DNA&#8208;recognition capability. Furthermore, by coupling biolayer interferometry (BLI) with the CRISPR biosensor, a real&#8208;time, sensitive, and rapid digital system called CRISPR&#8208;BLI was established for the detection of double&#8208;stranded DNA. The CRISPR biosensor immobilised on the biolayer could recruit the target DNA onto the biosensor surface and change its optical thickness, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern and responding signal of the BLI. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system was further applied to detect the ALP gene of Escherichia coli DH5&#945; combined with a polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated a linear range from 20 to 20&#8201;000&#8197;pg and a low detection limit (1.34&#8197;pg). The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system is a promising approach for rapid and sensitive detection of target DNA analytes.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing metal&#8208;based drugs that can be activated by red light is the &#8220;holy grail&#8220; of photodynamic therapy (PDT) research. This highlight summarizes current research on RuII&#8208;polypyridyl complexes with red&#8208;shifted absorption to achieve in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo photo&#8208;cytotoxicity with 540&#8211;600&#8197;nm light. The huge potential of judicial ligand modification and in&#8208;silico optimization to achieve red&#8208;light, metal&#8208;based PDT drugs are indicated.







Abstract
In the field of cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) research, development of metal&#8208;based PDT drugs that can be used under red light exposure is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; to achieve. This highlight highlighted few current literatures on polypyridyl&#8208;based Ru(II) complexes with significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption to achieve in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo PDT effect in 540&#8211;600 nm light. The enormous potential of judicial ligand choice and in&#8208;silico optimization to achieve the red light, metal&#8208;based PDT drugs are discussed.

         <title>Expanding the substrate scope of nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE by active site engineering of a reductase fusion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic nitration reactions are a cornerstone of organic chemistry, but are challenging to scale due to corrosive reagents and elevated temperatures. The cytochrome P450 TxtE nitrates the indole 4&#8208;position of L&#8208;tryptophan at room temperature using NO, O  2  and NADPH, and has potential to be developed into a useful aromatic nitration biocatalyst. However, its narrow substrate scope (requiring both the alpha&#8208;amino acid and indole functionalities) have hindered this. Screening of an R59 mutant library of a TxtE&#8208;reductase fusion protein identified a variant (R59C) that nitrates tryptamine, which is not accepted by native TxtE. This variant exhibits a broader substrate scope than the wild type enzyme and is able to nitrate a range of tryptamine analogues, with significantly alterations to the aromatic and aminoethyl moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Asparaginyl Ligases: New Enzymes for the Protein Engineer's Toolbox</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intents and (re)purposes: Asparaginyl ligases are highly efficient transpeptidases. These enzymes naturally catalyse the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation of small plant peptides, but recently have been repurposed for the modification of diverse proteins. This minireview describes the current state of protein engineering with asparaginyl ligases.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalysed site&#8208;specific protein modifications enable the precision manufacture of conjugates for the study of protein function and/or for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Asparaginyl ligases are a class of highly efficient transpeptidases with the capacity to modify proteins bearing only a tripeptide recognition motif. Herein, we review the types of protein modification that are accessible using these enzymes, including N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal protein labelling, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation, and protein&#8208;protein conjugation. We describe the progress that has been made to engineer highly efficient ligases as well as efforts to chemically manipulate the enzyme reaction to favour product formation. These enzymes are powerful additions to the protein engineer&#8216;s toolbox.

         <dc:description>Abstract.  G&#8208;quadruplexes have attracted growing interest in recent years due to their occurrence  in vivo  and their possible biological functions. In addition to being promising targets for drug design, these four&#8208;stranded nucleic acid structures have also been recognized as versatile tools for various technological applications. Whereas a large number of studies have yielded insight into their remarkable structural diversity, our current knowledge on G&#8208;quadruplex stabilities as a function of sequence and environmental factors only gradually emerges with an expanding collection of thermodynamic data. This minireview provides an overview of general rules that may be used to better evaluate quadruplex thermodynamic stabilities but also discusses present challenges in predicting most stable folds for a given sequence and environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Degradation of PARP14 Using a Heterobifunctional Small Molecule</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PARP14 is an interferon&#8208;stimulated gene that is overexpressed in multiple tumor types, influencing pro&#8208;tumor macrophage polarization as well as suppressing the antitumor inflammation response by modulating IFN&#8208;&#947; and IL&#8208;4 signaling.&#160; PARP14 is a 203 kDa protein that possesses a catalytic domain responsible for the transfer of mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose to its substrates.&#160; PARP14 also contains three macrodomains and a WWE domain which are binding modules for mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose and poly&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose, respectively, in addition to two&#160;RNA recognition motifs.&#160; Catalytic inhibitors of PARP14 have been shown to reverse IL&#8208;4 driven pro&#8208;tumor gene expression in macrophages, however it is not clear what roles the non&#8208;enzymatic biomolecular recognition motifs play in PARP14&#8208;driven immunology and inflammation.&#160;  To further understand this, we have discovered a heterobifunctional small molecule designed based on a catalytic inhibitor of PARP14 that binds in the enzyme&#8217;s NAD  +  &#8208;binding site and recruits the E3 ligase cereblon to ubiquitinate it and selectively target it for degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sirtuin 2 Regulates Protein LactoylLys Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) alter the structure and function of enzymes and are often regulated by enzymatic removal by &#8220;erasers&#8221;. The nonenzymatically derived PTM lactoylLys was recently identified in states of elevated glycolytic flux. Herein, we report the deacylase sirtuin 2 as the first known &#8220;eraser&#8221; for lactoylLys, expanding the knowledge of enzymatic regulation of nonenzymatically derived protein PTMs.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play roles in both physiological and pathophysiological processes through the regulation of enzyme structure and function. We recently identified a novel PTM, lactoylLys, derived through a nonenzymatic mechanism from the glycolytic by&#8208;product, lactoylglutathione. Under physiologic scenarios, glyoxalase 2 prevents the accumulation of lactoylglutathione and thus lactoylLys modifications. What dictates the site&#8208;specificity and abundance of lactoylLys PTMs, however, remains unknown. Here, we report sirtuin 2 as a lactoylLys eraser. Using chemical biology and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, we show that SIRT2 controls the abundance of this PTM both globally and on chromatin. These results address a major gap in our understanding of how nonenzymatic PTMs are regulated and controlled.

Using chemical biology and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, we show that SIRT2 controls the abundance of this PTM both globally and on chromatin. These results address a major gap in our understanding of how nonenzymatic PTMs are regulated and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Metallodrugs: An Untapped Source of Artificial Gene Editing Technology</title>

Kinking the duplex and other alterations: This review describes the rational design of metal complexes with nucleic acid recognition properties and how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions is opening up new avenues in the fields of gene engineering and targeted therapies.







Abstract
DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or noncovalent binding modes. Several recognition modes &#8211; including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation &#8211; are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes, which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This Review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.

         <title>Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenases from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter brockii as Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scope and selectivity: Recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of secondary ADHs from T. pseudoethanolicus and T. brockii by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution are reviewed. Moreover, the thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion in other interesting reactions to produce optically active alcohols and amines.







Abstract
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are an important type of enzyme that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus (TeSADH) and Thermoanaerobacter brockii (TbSADH) are well&#8208;known as robust catalysts. However, like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.&#8201;e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This minireview discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of TeSADH and TbSADH by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, TeSADH has been used in quantitative non&#8208;stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to deracemize alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in the racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.

         <title>Harnessing Multiple, Nonproteogenic Substitutions to Optimize CSP:ComD Hydrophobic Interactions in Group&#8197;1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unnaturally optimized: The use of unnatural amino acids allowed the optimization of hydrophobic interactions between CSP1 and the cognate ComD1 receptor by assessing how multiple, coordinated substitutions in the CSP1 amino acid sequence can affect CSP1 binding.







Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence&#8208;stimulating peptide (CSP)&#8208;mediated quorum&#8208;sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in S. pneumoniae can therefore be used to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility to resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and nonproteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure&#8211;activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP&#8208;based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.

         <title>Can Precision Electrophile Signaling Make a Meaningful and Lasting Impression in Drug Design?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medicinal chemists have uncovered that the incorporation of an electrophilic appendage into a non&#8208; covalent pharmacophore can confer important benefits, such as improved selectivity. Studies on electrophile signaling have shown that when a matched electrophile engages with its protein target, unexpected phenotypic responses can ensue. Such responses are above and beyond what has been typically reported for covalent pharmacophore&#8208;protein target interactions. So, can we blend these concepts together to make better drugs?







Abstract
For several years, drugs with reactive electrophilic appendages have been developed. These units typically confer prolonged residence time of the drugs on their protein targets, and may assist targeting shallow binding sites and/or improving the drug&#8211;protein target spectrum. Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.

Here we report the self&#8208;aggregation of truncated tau segment R3R4 peptide without requiring heparin for aggregation induction. We used NMR and other biophysical methods to monitor the self&#8208;aggregation of R3R4.

The solid&#8208;state NMR of self&#8208;aggregated R3R4 fibrils demonstrated that in addition to R3 residues, residues of R4 were also part of the fibril filaments. The presence of both R3 and R4 residues in the aggregation process and the core of fibril filaments suggest that the aggregation of R3R4 might resemble the &lt;italic&gt;in vivo &lt;/italic&gt;aggregation process.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

The presence of both R3 and R4 residues in the aggregation process and the core of fibril filaments suggest that the aggregation of R3R4 might resemble the &amp;lt;italic&amp;gt;in vivo &amp;lt;/italic&amp;gt;aggregation process.&amp;lt;o:p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/o:p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two Triterpene Synthases from Imperata cylindrica Catalyzing the Formation of a Pair of Diastereoisomers through Boat or Chair Cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling conformation during cyclization: I. cylindrica produces the diastereomeric triterpenes isoarborinol and fernenol depending on whether the B&#8208;ring of oxidosqualene was in a boat or chair conformation during cyclization. Mutational studies on the two enzymes resulted in partial conversion of the products. Placing a histidine residue at a critical site resulted in the production of a rare triterpene.







Abstract
Imperata cylindrica is known to produce a pair of triterpenes, isoarborinol and fernenol, that exhibit identical planar structures but possess opposite stereochemistry at six of the nine chiral centers. These differences arise from a boat or a chair cyclization of the B&#8208;ring of the substrate. Herein, we report the characterization of three OSC genes from I. cylindrica. IcOSC1 and IcOSC5 were identified as isoarborinol and fernenol synthases, respectively, while IcOSC3 was characterized as a multifunctional enzyme that produces glutinol and friedelin as its major products. Mutational studies of isoarborinol and fernenol synthases revealed that the residues surrounding the DCTAE motif partially affected the conformation of the B&#8208;ring during cyclization. Additionally, the IcOSC1&#8208;W255H mutant produced the rare triterpene boehmerol. The introduced histidine residue presumably abstracted a proton from the intermediary carbocation at C18 during the 1,2&#8208;rearrangement. Expression analysis indicated that all OSC genes were highly expressed in stems.

         <title>Probing the Interaction of Huntingtin Exon&#8208;1 Polypeptides with the Chaperonin Nanomachine GroEL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyglutamine expansion within the region of huntingtin encoded by exon&#8208;1 of the htt gene results in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We show that the chaperonin GroEL, the bacterial homolog of human mitochondrial Hsp60, inhibits fibril formation of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 peptides and probe the interaction using NMR relaxation&#8208;based experiments designed to explore short&#8208;lived sparsely populated states.







Abstract
Huntington's disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon&#8208;1 region of huntingtin (httex1), resulting in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various httex1 constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy, we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of httex1 constructs with intact GroEL and a mini&#8208;chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation&#8208;based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100 to 400&#8197;&#956;s with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of &#8764;1&#8211;2&#8197;mM. The binding interface is formed by the N&#8208;terminal amphiphilic region of httex1 (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric httex1 by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right spot for white spot: A G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence identified within the DNA genome of white spot syndrome virus folds into a major and a thermodynamically less stable minor loop isomer. The parallel quadruplex scaffold might constitute a potential target for viral drug development against white spot disease.







Abstract
White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G&#8594;T substitutions in the third G4 tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild&#8208;type sequence into a three&#8208;tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and a minor 1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.

         <title>Variety of nucleotide polymerase mutants aiming to synthesize modified RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic RNA aptamers that exploit synthetic RNA to capture target molecules. However, ensuring RNA aptamers are resistant against intrinsic nucleases remains an issue and restricts their use as therapeutics. Introduction of chemical modifications to the 2' sugar moiety of RNA improves their stability effectively and can be achieved by chemical synthesis using modified phosphoramidites; however, this approach is not suitable for preparing long RNA molecules. Although recombinant nucleotide polymerases can transcribe RNA, these polymerases cannot synthesize modified RNA because they do not recognize 2' modified nucleoside triphosphates. In this review, we focused on several polymerase mutants that tolerate substrates containing modifications of the 2' sugar moiety to synthesize RNA, and the problems that must be overcome to prepare chemically modified RNA with high efficacy by in vitro transcription.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Interaction of Molecular Cage and &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase: Application in Enzymatic Inhibition, Drug Delivery and Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme inhibitor plays a crucial role in diagnosis of a wide spectrum of diseases related to bacterial infections. We report here the effect of a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled Pd  II  8  molecular cage towards &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase enzyme activity. The molecular cage is composed of a tetrapyridyl donor (  L  ) and  cis  &#8208;[(en)Pd(NO  3  )  2  ] (en = ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) acceptor and it has a hydrophobic internal cavity. We have observed that the acceptor moiety mainly possesses the ability to inactivate the &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase enzyme activity. Kinetic investigation has revealed that the mode of inhibition is competitive in nature. This inhibition strategy was extended to control the growth of methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  bacteria. The internalization of the Pd(II) cage inside the bacteria was confirmed when bacterial solutions were incubated with curcumin loaded cage. The intrinsic green fluorescence of curcumin made the bacteria glow when put under an optical microscope. Furthermore, this curcumin loaded molecular cage shows an enhanced antibacterial activity. Thus, Pd  II  8  molecular cage is quite attractive due to its dual role as enzyme inhibitor and drug carrier.</dc:description>

         <title>A bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade pathway towards optically pure FAHFAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently discovered endogenous mammalian lipids fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), proved to have anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;diabetic effects. Due to their extremely low abundancies in vivo , forging a feasible scenario for FAHFA synthesis is critical for their use in uncovering biological mechanism or clinical trials. Here, we showcase a fully enzymatic approach, a novel in vitro bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade system, enabling an effective conversion of nature&#8208;abundant fatty acids into FAHFAs. Two hydratases from L. acidophilus were used for converting unsaturated fatty acids to various enantiomeric hydroxy fatty acids, followed by esterification with another fatty acid catalyzed by C. antarctica lipase A (CALA). Various FAHFAs were synthesized in a semi&#8208;preparative scale using this bi&#8208;enzymatic approach in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step operation mode. In all, we demonstrate that hydratase&#8208;CALA system offers a promising route for synthesis of optically pure structure&#8208;diverse FAHFAs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reconstructed Common Ancestor of the Fatty Acid Photo&#8208;decarboxylase Clade Shows Photo&#8208;decarboxylation Activity and Increased Thermostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme resurrection strikes again: Ancestral sequence reconstruction was applied to a putative photo&#8208;decarboxylases clade. One common ancestor showed up to 12&#8208;fold production yield, a 15&#8201;&#176;C increase in thermostability and up to 20&#8208;fold improvement in residual activity when incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C. Ancestral sequence reconstruction proved to be a valuable tool to introduce valid mutations to a little understood fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase.







Abstract
Light&#8208;dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520&#8197;nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose&#8208;methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photo&#8208;decarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15&#8201;&#176;C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12&#8208;fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of the Interaction of pICln, RioK1 and COPR5 with the PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determination of a PPI interface: The adaptor protein binding site of PRMT5 has been identified and studied by using synthetic peptides. A cocrystal structure of the PRMT5 TIM&#8208;barrel domain and a RioK1&#8208;derived peptide highlights the site of interaction.







Abstract
The PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein&#8211;protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins that recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for the methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5, we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report the characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identify the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.

         <dc:description>
Ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, bioinspired catalysts possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these systems have high activity, enantioselectivity, and aqueous solubility. Recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.







Abstract
Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency. This review outlines important developments and future prospects for the design and application of bioinspired and biohybrid systems at multiple length scales for important, biologically relevant, clean energy transformations.

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools To Investigate Malaria Parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ghost hunting: Malaria tropica has been haunting mankind for centuries, but investigating the biology of the causative agent, the protozoan parasite P. falciparum, remains challenging. Herein, we describe ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, non&#8208;genetic, small molecular probes from the field of chemical biology that have been, or may be, used to interrogate the complex infection cycle, with an emphasis on infected red blood cells.







Abstract
Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite's biology is pivotal to deciphering unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensure the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small&#8208;molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance research into this parasite in the future. We anticipate that the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of P. falciparum and we hope that researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge &#8211; with the aim of ending this devastating disease.

         <title>Optimized Biocatalytic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Selenopyrimidine Nucleosides by Transglycosylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se for yourself: We present a biocatalytic synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing pyrimidine nucleosides. Optimization of the reaction conditions improved the solubility and stability of the sensitive starting materials as well as previously observed low conversions. This approach offers a concise alternative to traditionally employed multistep routes to these compounds.







Abstract
Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The widespread application of 2&#8208;selenopyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Herein, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80&#8201;&#176;C and at pH&#8197;9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10, and therefore differ by an order of magnitude from the equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, and this complicates their synthesis significantly. A tenfold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48&#8201;% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40&#8201;% isolated yield, which compares favorably to established chemical routes.

     alt="Optimized Biocatalytic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Selenopyrimidine Nucleosides by Transglycosylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Se for yourself&lt;/b&gt;: We present a biocatalytic synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing pyrimidine nucleosides. Optimization of the reaction conditions improved the solubility and stability of the sensitive starting materials as well as previously observed low conversions. This approach offers a concise alternative to traditionally employed multistep routes to these compounds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The widespread application of 2&#8208;selenopyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Herein, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80&#8201;&#176;C and at pH&#8197;9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10, and therefore differ by an order of magnitude from the equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, and this complicates their synthesis significantly. A tenfold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48&#8201;% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40&#8201;% isolated yield, which compares favorably to established chemical routes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Manufacture of Multilayered Artificial Cell Membranes through Sequential Bilayer Deposition on Emulsion Templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Running rings around vesicles: We describe a droplet&#8208;based technology to manufacture cell&#8208;sized multilamellar lipid vesicles. Individual membranes are assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, giving control over the number of induvial layers and their molecular content. We investigated how the biomechanical properties of the structures change with each added layer.







Abstract
Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes, are multilamellar. Due to a lack of technologies available for their controlled construction, multilayered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell&#8208;mimetic motifs used in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. To address this, we developed emulsion&#8208;based technologies that allow cell&#8208;sized multilayered vesicles to be produced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, with compositional control over each layer, thus enabling studies that would otherwise remain inaccessible. We discovered that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter&#8208;bilayer registration between coexisting liquid&#8211;liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multilayered membrane structures, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple bilayers.

         <title>A comparison of two DNA aptamers for dopamine using homogeneous binding assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter and its detection is important for bioanalytical chemistry. Two very different DNA aptamers have been reported for dopamine, one derived from an RNA aptamer (named Apt1) and other obtained via direct aptamer selection (named Apt2). In this study, we used four homogeneous binding assays to compare these two DNA dopamine aptamers. Thiazole orange (TO) fluorescence assay indicated that the Apt2 specifically bound with dopamine with a  K  d  of 2.37 &#181;M, which was consistent with that from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. However, Apt1 had much less TO fluorescence change and also no signal from ITC. By labeling the two ends of the two aptamers by a fluorophore and a quencher, the aptamer beacons showed binding of dopamine only for Apt2. Finally, the label&#8208;free AuNP&#8208;based colorimetric assay showed no difference between these two aptamer sequences, and even non&#8208;binding random DNA showed the same response, indicating the AuNPs were not a good probe for detecting dopamine. Taken the data together, Apt1 does not appear to be able to bind dopamine specifically, while Apt2 showed specific binding and is recommended for developing related biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Probes for Photoaffinity Labelling of Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light up the kinome. Probes for photoaffinity labelling of kinases are powerful research tools for detecting (off&#8208;)targets of kinase inhibitors, imaging kinases within the cell or identifying binding partners. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available kinase photoaffinity probes and discuss how such probes are designed. We illustrate the applicability with various examples.







Abstract
Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for the photoaffinity labelling of kinases are important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several areas of application of these probes, including the identification of targets and off&#8208;targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, the development of inhibitor screening assays, the imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.

         <title>Intrinsic Fluorescence of the Active and the Inactive Functional Forms of Human Thymidylate Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of form: The active and the inactive functional forms of human thymidylate synthase, a long&#8208;known anticancer target, exhibit different intrinsic fluorescence spectra, quantum yields, lifetime profiles and anisotropies. These differences are connected to the conformational changes occurring in the active &#8211; inactive interconversion and provide tools for real&#8208;time identification and quantitation of the two protein forms in solution.







Abstract
The observables associated with protein intrinsic fluorescence &#8211; spectra, time decays, anisotropies &#8211; offer opportunities to monitor in real time and non&#8208;invasively a protein&#8216;s functional form and its interchange with other forms with different functions. We employed these observables to sketch the fluorometric profiles of two functional forms of human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a homodimeric enzyme crucial for cell proliferation and thus targeted by anticancer drugs. The protein takes an active and an inactive form. Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.

         <title>Approaches to Evaluate the Impact of a Small&#8208;Molecule Binder to a Noncatalytic Site of the Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the impact of small molecules: There are a number of essential protein&#8211;protein interactions between the 19S regulatory particle and 20S core particle to form the full 26S proteasome. We investigated whether a small&#8208;molecule binder to Rpn&#8208;6, a 19S subunit, could disrupt 26S proteasome activity.







Abstract
Proteasome activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. In recent years, small molecules have been discovered that can affect the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Rather than targeting the active sites of the proteasome, it might be possible to affect ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of proteins by limiting the association of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) with the 20S core particle (20S CP) of the proteasome. We recently described the discovery of TXS&#8208;8, a peptoid that binds to Rpn&#8208;6. Rpn&#8208;6 is a proteasome&#8208;associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Herein, we present a general workflow to evaluate the impact of a small&#8208;molecule binder on proteasome activity by using TXS&#8208;8 as an example. This workflow contains three steps in which specific probes or overexpressed proteins in cells are used to determine whether the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome is affected. Although, in our case, TXS&#8208;8 did not affect proteasome activity, our workflow is highly amenable to studying a variety of small&#8208;molecule&#8211;proteasome subunit interactions.

Rpn&#8208;6 is a proteasome&#8208;associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Herein, we present a general workflow to evaluate the impact of a small&#8208;molecule binder on proteasome activity by using TXS&#8208;8 as an example. This workflow contains three steps in which specific probes or overexpressed proteins in cells are used to determine whether the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome is affected. Although, in our case, TXS&#8208;8 did not affect proteasome activity, our workflow is highly amenable to studying a variety of small&#8208;molecule&#8211;proteasome subunit interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Application of Neuron&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe, NeuA, To Identify Mouse Retinal Degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As far as the eye can be seen: Developed fluorescent probe, NeuA (NeuO with an acrylamide group), stained healthy mouse retinal neuron cells and discriminated between healthy retina and retina with degenerating photoreceptors by confocal and fluorescent fundus microscopy. These imaging probes can be used as diagnostic and prognostic tools for retinitis pigmentosa in a clinical domain.







Abstract
The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe&#8208;NeuA&#8208;for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined in&#8197;vitro, ex vivo and in&#8197;vivo using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.

         <title>Isopenicillin&#8197;N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thousand words: Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase drives the central step in penicillin biosynthesis, oxidative cyclisation of a linear tripeptide to form the bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactam core. Crystal structures of the protein with its substrate, product, trapped reaction intermediates, and diverse substrate analogues paint a rich mechanistic picture of the enzyme in action and deepen our understanding of non&#8208;heme iron enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase (IPNS) is a non&#8208;heme iron oxidase (NHIO) that catalyses the cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;l&#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;d&#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin&#8197;N (IPN). Over the last 25&#8197;years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of Fe at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme&#8208;substrate complex IPNS&#8722;Fe&#8722;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co&#8208;substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction by using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover in crystallo. In this way, X&#8208;ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, thereby answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution&#8208;phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have, in turn, informed computational experiments that have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.

         <title>Exchange of Proteins in Liposomes through Streptolysin O Pores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a pore view of bioreactors: Streptolysin O creates pores in liposome membranes allowing proteins to permeate them. Enzymes including RNA polymerase can be supplied through these pores, allowing RNA to be synthesized in liposomes. The method could broaden the application of liposomes as biochemical reactors.







Abstract
Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. However, one of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. We used the toxic protein streptolysin O (SLO); this forms pores in membranes made of phospholipids containing cholesterol that can be closed by the addition of calcium ions. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9&#8201;% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98&#8208;kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in &#8764;8&#8201;% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.

         <title>Increased valency improves inhibitory activity of peptides targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a clinically validated target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 inhibitors have attracted pharmaceutical interest, but the effect of multivalency on bioactivity is poorly understood. Here we designed bivalent and tetravalent dendrimers, decorated with the PCSK9 inhibitory peptides Pep2&#8208;8[RRG] or P9&#8208;38, to study relationships between peptide binding affinity, peptide valency, and PCSK9 inhibition. Increased valency resulted in improved PCSK9 inhibition for both peptides, with activity improvements of up to 100&#8208;fold achieved for the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers compared to monomeric P9&#8208;38 in  in vitro  competition binding assays. Furthermore, the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers showed improved potency at restoring functional low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels and internalizing LDL in the presence of PCSK9, demonstrating significant cell&#8208;based activity at picomolar concentrations. This study demonstrates the potential of increasing valency as a strategy for increasing the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibacterial and Anti&#8208;biofilm Activity of the Human Breast Milk Glycoprotein Lactoferrin against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maternal antimicrobial: Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial glycoprotein that is abundant in human breast milk. Lactoferrin has potent antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against Group B Streptococcus, a bacterial pathogen that causes severe perinatal infections. Additionally, lactoferrin can inhibit streptococcal adherence to human gestational tissues, underscoring its potential utility as an antimicrobial intervention during pregnancy.







Abstract
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an encapsulated Gram&#8208;positive human pathogen that causes invasive infections in pregnant hosts and neonates, as well as immunocompromised individuals. Colonization of the human host requires the ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces and circumnavigate the nutritional challenges and antimicrobial defenses associated with the innate immune response. Biofilm formation is a critical process to facilitate GBS survival and establishment of a replicative niche in the vertebrate host. Previous work has shown that the host responds to GBS infection by producing the innate antimicrobial glycoprotein lactoferrin, which has been implicated in repressing bacterial growth and biofilm formation. Additionally, lactoferrin is highly abundant in human breast milk and could serve a protective role against invasive microbial pathogens. This study demonstrates that human breast milk lactoferrin has antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and inhibits its adherence to human gestational membranes. Together, these results indicate that human milk lactoferrin could be used as a prebiotic chemotherapeutic strategy to limit the impact of bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on GBS&#8208;associated disease outcomes.

Additionally, lactoferrin is highly abundant in human breast milk and could serve a protective role against invasive microbial pathogens. This study demonstrates that human breast milk lactoferrin has antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and inhibits its adherence to human gestational membranes. Together, these results indicate that human milk lactoferrin could be used as a prebiotic chemotherapeutic strategy to limit the impact of bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on GBS&#8208;associated disease outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Novel Pet&#8208;Degrading Enzymes: Structure&#8208;Function from a Computational Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Life and death cycle of plastics: In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of the PETase&#8208;MHETase system for PET depolymerization to make it more suitable for industrial applications are described emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments.







Abstract
The bacterium strain Ideonella sakaiensis 201&#8208;F6 is able to hydrolyze low&#8208;crystallinity PET films at 30&#8201;&#176;C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to elucidating the structure and features of those two enzymes, and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts so as to make them more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups to investigate the structure and functionality of both PETase and MHETase in depth are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by I. sakaiensis enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging a prioritization of efforts in this prolific research field.

         <title>Genomic and Targeted Approaches Unveil the Cell Membrane as a Major Target of the Antifungal Cytotoxin Amantelide A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on chemogenomic profiling coupled with phenotypic responses, we propose the cell membrane and integrated sterols as major targets of amantelide A and hypothesize a putative role of actin in the mechanism of action. Targeted approaches including biophysical measurement of membrane binding activities in the presence and absence of sterols and actin polymerization assays established the mechanism of action.







Abstract
Amantelide A, a polyhydroxylated macrolide isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, displays broad&#8208;spectrum activity against mammalian cells, bacterial pathogens, and marine fungi. We conducted comprehensive mechanistic studies to identify the molecular targets and pathways affected by amantelide A. Our investigations relied on chemical structure similarities with compounds of known mechanisms, yeast knockout mutants, yeast chemogenomic profiling, and direct biochemical and biophysical methods. We established that amantelide A exerts its antifungal action by binding to ergosterol&#8208;containing membranes followed by pore formation and cell death, a mechanism partially shared with polyene antifungals. Binding assays demonstrated that amantelide A also binds to membranes containing epicholesterol or mammalian cholesterol, thus suggesting that the cytotoxicity to mammalian cells might be due to its affinity to cholesterol&#8208;containing membranes. However, membrane interactions were not completely dependent on sterols. Yeast chemogenomic profiling suggested additional direct or indirect effects on actin. Accordingly, we performed actin polymerization assays, which suggested that amantelide A also promotes actin polymerization in cell&#8208;free systems. However, the C&#8208;33 acetoxy derivative amantelide B showed a similar effect on actin dynamics in vitro but no significant activity against yeast. Overall, these studies suggest that the membrane effects are the most functionally relevant for amantelide A mechanism of action.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Sinapigladioside, an Antifungal Isothiocyanate from Burkholderia Symbionts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sinapigladioside is a rare isothiocyanate&#8208;bearing natural product from beetle&#8208;associated bacteria (  Burkholderia gladioli  ) that may protect the beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. The biosynthetic origin of sinapigladioside has been elusive, and little is known about bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis in general. On the basis of stable&#8208;isotope labeling, bioinformatics, and mutagenesis we identified the sinapigladioside biosynthesis gene cluster in the symbiont and found that an isonitrile synthase plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining and network analyses indicate that related gene clusters are distributed across various bacterial phyla including producers of both nitriles and isothiocyanates. Our findings support a model for bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis by sulfur transfer onto isonitrile precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting TRIM Proteins: A Quest towards Drugging an Emerging Protein Class</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It can be hard to get TRIM: TRIM proteins, the largest subfamily of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases, are currently gaining attention as targets for drug development. However, developing effective targeting options for TRIMs is challenged by their multidomain scaffolding nature correlating with multifunctional biological roles. Herein, we highlight our current understanding of TRIMs and discuss potential targeting options.







Abstract
The ubiquitylation machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases, with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named tri&#8208;partite motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein&#8211;protein interactions, whose multidomains and adapter&#8208;like nature make their druggability very challenging. Herein, we give an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.

         <title>Arylphosphonate&#8208;Tethered Porphyrins: Fluorescence Silencing Speaks a Metal Language in Living Enterocytes**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pinpointing metals: Arylphosphonic acid fluorophores with a porphyrin core produced unique fluorescent behavior in response to each of the biologically significant metal ions studied. Thus they provide an expandable and engineerable platform for the development of improved, targeted fluorescence sensors suitable for in&#8197;vivo applications to determine and visualize metals in tissues during disease progression.







Abstract
We report the application of a highly versatile and engineerable novel sensor platform to monitor biologically significant and toxic metal ions in live human Caco&#8208;2 enterocytes. The extended conjugation between the fluorescent porphyrin core and metal ions through aromatic phenylphosphonic acid tethers generates a unique turn off and turn on fluorescence and, in addition, shifts in absorption and emission spectra for zinc, cobalt, cadmium and mercury. The reported fluorescent probes p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA can monitor a wide range of metal ion concentrations via fluorescence titration and also via fluorescence decay curves. Cu&#8208; and Zn&#8208;induced turn off fluorescence can be differentially reversed by the addition of common chelators. Both p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA readily pass the mammalian cellular membrane due to their amphipathic character as confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging of living enterocytes.

         <title>Structural Insights into Malic Enzyme Variants Favoring an Unnatural Redox Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From A to C: Structural rules for engineering NAD&#8208;dependent malic enzymes to favor the unnatural redox cofactor NCD are revealed. The residues at positions 346 and 401 act as &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;, determining the volume of the adenine moiety binding cavity and playing an important role in cofactor recognition. These rules could help to engineer a variety of NCD&#8208;favoring enzymes.







Abstract
The use of nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD), a biocompatible nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) analogue, is of great scientific and biotechnological interest. Several redox enzymes have been devised to favor NCD, and have been successfully applied in creating NCD&#8208;dependent redox systems. However, molecular interactions between cofactor and protein have still to be disclosed in order to guide further engineering efforts. Here we report the structural analysis of an NCD&#8208;favoring malic enzyme (ME) variant derived from Escherichia coli. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure data revealed that the residues located at position 346 and 401 in ME acted as the &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; of the adenine moiety binding cavity. When Arg346 was substituted with either acidic or aromatic residues, the corresponding mutants showed substantially reduced NCD preference. Inspired by these observations, we generated Lactobacillus helveticus derived d&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase variants at Ile177, the counterpart to Arg346 in ME, and found a similar trend in terms of cofactor preference changes. As many NAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases share key structural features, our results provide guidance for protein engineering to obtain more NCD&#8208;favoring variants.

         <title>Tuning the Transglycosylation Reaction of a GH11 Xylanase by a Delicate Enhancement of its Thumb Flexibility</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shifting the balance: Glycoside hydrolases are attractive tools for the enzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates. We used the xylanase from B. circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and the transglycosylation reaction. A point mutation that enhances the flexibility and dynamics of BCX active site shifts the balance of the enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are attractive tools for multiple biotechnological applications. In conjunction with their hydrolytic function, GHs can perform transglycosylation under specific conditions. In nature, oligosaccharide synthesis is performed by glycosyltransferases (GTs); however, the industrial use of GTs is limited by their instability in solution. A key difference between GTs and GHs is the flexibility of their binding site architecture. We have used the xylanase from Bacillus circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and transglycosylation. Residues of the BCX &#8220;thumb&#8221; were substituted to increase the flexibility of the enzyme binding site. Replacement of the highly conserved residue P116 with glycine shifted the balance of the BCX enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation. The effects of this point mutation on the structure and dynamics of BCX were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The P116G mutation induces subtle changes in the configuration of the thumb and enhances the millisecond dynamics of the active site. Based on our findings, we propose the remodelling of the GH enzymes glycon site flexibility as a strategy to improve the transglycosylation efficiency of these biotechnologically important catalysts.

         <title>Production of the Carboxylate Reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a Soluble, Active Form for in&#8197;vitro Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic reduction of carboxylates: Optimization of cultivation parameters and host strain selection were fundamental to decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies and enhancing the production of NoCAR, which was able to reduce up to 65&#8197;mM sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde in 24&#8197;h with integrated in&#8197;vitro recycling of NADPH and ATP.







Abstract
Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over&#8208;reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (NoCAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post&#8208;translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of Escherichia coli tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110&#8208;fold increase in the specific activity of NoCAR. This highly active NoCAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an in&#8197;vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30&#8197;mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2&#8197;h of reaction.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Hydrocarbon Conjugation and Cyclisation in Synthetic Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strength in weakness: Selective and high&#8208;yielding late&#8208;stage modifications to unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins are enabled by S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine by using weakly electrophilic alkyl halides and zinc complexes. Under neutral conditions, iodoalkanes do not compromise selectivity for cysteine: Zn2+ can bind other amino acids but only Cys is alkylated.







Abstract
The conventional S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine relies upon using activated electrophiles. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;yielding and selective S&#8208;alkylation and S&#8208;lipidation of cysteines in unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins by using weak electrophiles and a Zn2+ promoter. Linear or branched iodoalkanes can S&#8208;alkylate cysteine in an unprotected 38&#8208;residue Myc peptide fragment and in a 91&#8208;residue miniprotein Omomyc, thus highlighting selective late&#8208;stage synthetic modifications. Metal&#8208;assisted cysteine alkylation is also effective for incorporating dehydroalanine into unprotected peptides and for peptide cyclisation via aliphatic thioether crosslinks, including customising macrocycles to stabilise helical peptides for enhanced uptake and delivery to proteins inside cells. Chemoselective and efficient late&#8208;stage Zn2+&#8208;promoted cysteine alkylation in unprotected peptides and proteins promises many useful applications.

         <title>Recent Advances of DNA Tetrahedra for Therapeutic Delivery and Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nanodevices: DNA tetrahedra represent a versatile construct that can be functionalized for numerous purposes including the delivery of small molecules and oligonucleotide therapeutics to the cell as well as a range of applications for biosensing. In this minireview, a number of exciting recent advances in functional nanodevices based on this intriguing structure are highlighted.







Abstract
The chemical and self&#8208;assembly properties of nucleic acids make them ideal for the construction of discrete structures and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices for a diverse array of applications. Amongst the various three&#8208;dimensional assemblies, DNA tetrahedra are of particular interest, as these structures have been shown to be readily taken up by the cell, by the process of caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, without the need for transfection agents. Moreover, these structures can be readily modified with a diverse range of pendant groups to confer greater functionality. This minireview highlights recent advances related to applications of this interesting DNA structure including the delivery of therapeutic agents ranging from small molecules to oligonucleotides in addition to its use for sensing and imaging various species within the cell.

         <title>Fluorophosphonates on&#8208;Demand: A General and Simplified Approach toward Fluorophosphonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not too demanding: A robust and purification&#8208;free, one&#8208;step synthesis has been developed to enable the on&#8208;demand preparation of structurally diverse fluorophosphonates from a stable, and storable &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of readily accessible p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. Additionally, a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay protocol is highlighted that further facilitates the rapid screening of these valuable activity&#8208;based probes.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general and simplified synthesis of fluorophosphonates directly from p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. This FP on&#8208;demand reaction is mediated by a commercially available polymer&#8208;supported fluoride reagent that produces a variety (25 examples) of fluorophosphonates in high yields while only requiring reagent filtration for pure fluorophosphonate isolation. This reaction protocol facilitates the rapid profiling of serine hydrolases with diverse and novel sets of activated phosphonates with differential proteome reactivity. Moreover, slight modification of the procedure into a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay format has enabled additional screening efficiency.

         <title>Co&#8208;occurring Congeners Reveal the Position of Enantiomeric Amino Acids in Nonribosomal Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The position of enantiomeric amino acid residues in some nonribosomal peptides can be revealed by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners. This concept does not rely on genome sequencing and is an alternative to laborious approaches based on partial peptide hydrolysis or the synthesis of diastereomers.







Abstract
The absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined by Marfey's method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A challenge to structure elucidation arises when both d and l enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are present. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality that governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The information on configuration provided by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners can reveal unequivocally the stereochemical sequence of the whole peptide family.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapour pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of  in situ  physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL,  in situ  microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Reversed&#8208;Phase Flash Chromatography Purification of Peptides and Chemically Modified Insulins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purification of peptides made easy: Automated flash chromatography using reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance columns and low&#8208;to&#8208;medium pressure is an alternative to HPLC. It enables the purification of peptides that are poorly soluble or very hydrophobic.







Abstract
Preparative reversed&#8208;phase HPLC is the established method for the purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for the purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including the choice of columns, eluents, and gradients. We believe that HPFC is a valuable alternative to HPLC purification of peptides and small proteins.

         <title>Effect of Methionine Sulfoxide on the Synthesis and Purification of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ox and red: A synthesis and purification method for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and aggregation&#8208;prone peptides that exploits the reversibility of methionine oxidation is reported. Incorporating methionine sulfoxide rather than methionine reduces aggregation during peptide synthesis and significantly facilitates peptide purification due to the increased peptide polarity. Final reduction to methionine proceeds smoothly and quantitatively.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step synthesis for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation&#8208;prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields the crude peptide, with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine&#8208;rich Tar&#8208;DNA&#8208;binding protein 43 (307&#8211;347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated by the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation&#8208;prone peptides from the human prion protein.

         <title>Artificial Organelles: Towards Adding or Restoring Intracellular Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoreactors meet living systems. Artificial organelles, synthetic analogues of natural organelles, are gaining interest for the correction of dysfunctional intracellular processes and the addition of novel functionalities to living systems. This review outlines the different strategies via which these mostly nanosized catalytic compartments are produced and integrated with living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is one of the main characteristics that define living systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nanoreactors meet living systems&lt;/b&gt;. Artificial organelles, synthetic analogues of natural organelles, are gaining interest for the correction of dysfunctional intracellular processes and the addition of novel functionalities to living systems. This review outlines the different strategies via which these mostly nanosized catalytic compartments are produced and integrated with living cells.

         <title>Ligand Binding to Dynamically Populated G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Returning to the fold: We reveal the molecular mechanisms of binding of a small&#8208;molecule ligand to dynamically populated G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4). Upon ligand binding, a large G4 conformational redistribution occurs. This is driven by a combination of two distinct phenomena: ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and ligand&#8208;induced trapping of folded G4 conformations.







Abstract
Several small&#8208;molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered to be promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures of varying stability, and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA by using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 and a combination of single&#8208;molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopies. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre&#8208;folded G4 structures and that Phen&#8208;DC3 also induces G4 formation in unfolded single strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions that do not involve direct ligand&#8208;induced G4 conformational interconversion. On the contrary, the redistribution is driven by ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short&#8208;lived conformation states. Thus, ligand&#8208;induced stabilization does not necessarily require the initial presence of stably folded G4s.

         <title>Inorganic Enzyme Mimics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making a difference: Inorganic enzyme mimics, mainly consisting of inorganic complexes and nanozymes, have attracted much interest and found widespread applications in healthcare, energy, and environmental fields. Because of their splendid properties, such as high stability, tailorable activity and low cost, these enzyme mimics are making and will continue to make a big difference in future science and technology.







Abstract
Enzyme mimics (or artificial enzymes) have emerged as valuable alternatives to natural enzymes since the pioneering work of Ronald Breslow. They have numerous advantages over natural enzymes, such as high stability, low cost, and tailorable activity. Among varieties of materials explored to mimic enzymes, the inorganic ones, including inorganic complexes and nanomaterials, have attracted increasing interest over the last decade and have the potential to address the current challenges in energy, environment, health, etc.

         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silent treatment: Glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. We report the largest subset of glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors, which are produced and identified after the silent biosynthetic gene cluster plu1881&#8211;1877 is activated in the native host P. laumondii.







Abstract
The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin&#8197;A and cepafungin&#8197;I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) plu1881&#8211;1877 is present in entomopathogenic Photorhabdus laumondii but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in Escherichia coli. Their chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Biological Applications of O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar modifications on proteins enable cells to respond quickly to environmental cues. We review the plethora of chemical strategies to access precise glycoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc peptides and full proteins and explore the translational use of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptides and glycoproteins as biomarkers, mechanistic probes, and therapeutics. Synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycobiology is poised to rapidly identify roles in chronic and infectious disease.







Abstract
All human cells use O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modifications (O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists in defining precise roles for specific O&#8208;GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non&#8208;genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of O&#8208;GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this review details the state of the art of two strategies for O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modification: advances in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; installation of O&#8208;GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure&#8211;function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational O&#8208;GlcNAc biology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Two&#8208;Photon AIEgens and Their Application in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving potential: Two&#8208;photon AIEgen probes have attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages of large penetration depth, little light damage, dark field imaging and target excitation. This paper reviews the most representative two&#8208;photon imaging technology of the past five years, and discusses its great application potential in the field of biological imaging.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, little light damage, and high spatiotemporal resolution, which make it a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easily reduced or disappears completely, and is not conducive to optimal application. The concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides a solution to the problem of aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption properties can readily be improved just by increasing the loading content of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probes based on AIEgen to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in&#8197;vitro/in&#8197;vivo has become a major research hotspot.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improving potential&lt;/b&gt;: Two&#8208;photon AIEgen probes have attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages of large penetration depth, little light damage, dark field imaging and target excitation. This paper reviews the most representative two&#8208;photon imaging technology of the past five years, and discusses its great application potential in the field of biological imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, little light damage, and high spatiotemporal resolution, which make it a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easily reduced or disappears completely, and is not conducive to optimal application. The concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides a solution to the problem of aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption properties can readily be improved just by increasing the loading content of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probes based on AIEgen to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in&#8197;vitro/in&#8197;vivo has become a major research hotspot. This review aims to summarize representative two&#8208;photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene, quinoline, naphthalene and other new structures from the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>IsPETase Is a Novel Biocatalyst for Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottle: IsPETase is receiving increased attention for its ability to degrade crystalline PET, a major cause of plastic pollution. This review summarizes the current state of investigation into IsPETase and puts forward the necessity of utilizing and engineering IsPETase for industrial applications.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic polyesters, but also a major cause of plastic pollution. Because the chemical degradation of PET would be uneconomical and rather burdensome, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring enzymatic processes for the disposal of PET waste. Many PET&#8208;hydrolyzing enzymes have been reported in recent decades, some of which demonstrate excellent potential for industrial applications. This review sets out to summarize the state of investigation into IsPETase, a cutinase&#8208;like enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis possessing ability to degrade crystalline PET, and to gain further insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of IsPETase. Benefiting from the continuing identification of novel cutinase&#8208;like proteins and growing availability of the engineered IsPETase, we may anticipate future developments in this type of enzyme would generate suitable biocatalyst for industrial use.

         <title>Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 Transcriptional Systems for Sensing and Genome Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transforming transcription: Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcription systems that rely on exogenous and endogenous cues to conditionally control the function of dCas9 proteins or gRNAs have provided pioneering platforms for genome engineering, cell&#8208;specific sensing and therapies.







Abstract
The clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats&#8208;associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR&#8208;Cas9) and the nuclease&#8208;deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized our ability to precisely engineer and regulate genomes. Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein using exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for the spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing, and so on. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in conditionally controlling CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcriptional systems through gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.

         <title>Investigation of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D  2  (VD  2  ) and vitamin D  3  (VD  3  ) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain,  Kutzneria albida  , was identified, showing the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  2  and 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  . To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  and 10&#8208;fold higher concentrations of 25&#8209;OH&#8208;D  2  after addition of 5% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single hydroxylation products, the human double hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  2  and 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  3  and various other potential single and double hydroxylation products were detected. Thus,  K. albida  represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD  2  and VD  3  metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence microscopy imaging provides information about the localization and trafficking of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. To visualize these proteins, reporter groups must be introduced on the surface of live cells. This review discusses live&#8208;cell protein labelling by small, genetically encoded peptide tags serving as enzyme substrates or recognition sites for interactions with proteins, coiled&#8208;coil peptides and metal reagents.







Abstract
Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site&#8208;specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live&#8208;cell labeling of peptide&#8208;tagged cell&#8208;surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme&#8208;mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled&#8208;coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide&#8208;templated labeling chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Transition Metal Complexes for Medicine: Translational in Situ Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Drugs from Bench to in Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control and select: Novel metal&#8208;based drugs for treating diverse diseases have recently been under the spotlight. Fine control of off&#8208;targeted toxic effects was achieved by using a variety of stabilized coordination ligands along with different metal centers. Herein, we highlight the versatile, effective and valuable use of transition metals in medicine, namely for in&#8197;situ activation of metal&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs has been hampered, among other reasons, by their lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In a recent article, Zou and co&#8208;workers presented the successful intracellular activation of organogold(I) complexes for potential cancer treatment through Pd(II)&#8208;mediated transmetallation, overcoming some off&#8208;target activity of novel gold&#8208;based drugs. This unique strategy builds the perfect bridge between metallodrug usage and bioorthogonal intracellular catalysis for more advanced and selective therapies. Such an approach will hopefully pave the way for forthcoming studies in medicinal inorganic chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Control of Gelatin Hydrogel Stiffness by Using DNA Crosslinkers**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going soft: We report a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel crosslinked with DNA. The stiffness of the gel can be switched by a factor of &#8764;2, over two cycles, by using displacement strands, with no degradation of gel performance. Using two DNA sequences allows orthogonal control of gel stiffness and ligand presentation.







Abstract
Biomaterials with dynamically tunable properties are critical for a range of applications in regenerative medicine and basic biology. In this work, we show the reversible control of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel stiffness through the use of DNA crosslinkers. We replaced some of the inter&#8208;GelMA crosslinks with double&#8208;stranded DNA, allowing for their removal through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. The crosslinks could be restored by adding fresh dsDNA with complementary handles to those on the hydrogel. The elastic modulus (G&#8217;) of the hydrogels could be tuned between 500 and 1000&#8197;Pa, reversibly, over two cycles without degradation of performance. By functionalizing the gels with a second DNA strand, it was possible to control the crosslink density and a model ligand in an orthogonal fashion with two different displacement strands. Our results demonstrate the potential for DNA to reversibly control both stiffness and ligand presentation in a protein&#8208;based hydrogel, and will be useful for teasing apart the spatiotemporal behavior of encapsulated cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution DNA Dual&#8208;Rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branch line: Precise DNA rulers were developed to investigate the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. Based on super&#8208;resolution force spectroscopy, they revealed nucleic acid motion with subnucleotide resolution. New intermediate states were identified, one of which differed from the conventional state by less than a single nucleotide. Our work contributes towards understanding branching among different reading frames during protein synthesis.







Abstract
Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis that involves mRNA translocation of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with subnucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with current techniques. We report a method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA7G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8722;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near&#8208;&#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; intermediate the Post(&#8722;1*) state because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Action and Peptide&#8208;Membrane Interactions of Aib&#8208;Rich Peptides: Multitechnique Experimental and Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sit up or lie down: Linear dichroism, circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore how mimics of peptaibol antibiotics (Aib foldamers) interact with membranes. These studies revealed all peptides partitioned well into the bilayers, with orientation dependent upon peptide length, as well as chiral interactions between peptides and the phospholipids.







Abstract
The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered by their mechanism of action not being clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, linear dichroism, Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, the Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All the peptides studied quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes, and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.

         <title>The Antimicrobial Peptide Gad&#8208;1 Clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms under Cystic Fibrosis Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a metal&#8208;mediated mode of action, the metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gad&#8208;1 can effectively clear P. aeruginosa biofilms. In the presence of Cu2+ ions, Gad&#8208;1 rapidly cleaves the exogenous DNA that allows biofilms to thrive. Anti&#8208;biofilm activity was observed at a range of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of exogenous DNA, conditions relevant to cystic fibrosis.







Abstract
Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are an emerging health issue and lead to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates a thick mucus in the lungs that is prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin&#8208;1 (Gad&#8208;1) eradicates established P. aeruginosa biofilms through a combination of modes of action that includes nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad&#8208;1 exhibits synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, thus making Gad&#8208;1 a new lead compound for the potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.

         <title>Cleavage of an RNA Model Compound by an Arylmercury Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble, but not so speedy: The potential of an water&#8208;soluble arylmercury compound to cleave RNA has been explored. The somewhat low catalytic activity compared to free HgII was attributed to the relatively low affinity of the arylmercury catalyst for the RNA model compound. This suggests that improved derivatives could be obtained by covalent tethering to an appropriate targeting group.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble arylmercury complex has been synthesized, and its ability to catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage of the RNA model compound adenylyl&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyleneadenosine) has been assessed over a pH range of 3&#8211;8.5 and a catalyst concentration range of 0&#8211;7&#8197;mM. In the presence of 1&#8197;mM catalyst, the observed pH&#8211;rate profile featured a new pH&#8208;independent region between pH&#8197;6 and 7, the catalyzed reaction being as much as eight times faster than the background reaction. At pH&#8197;7, the acceleration increased linearly from three&#8208; to 17&#8208;fold upon increasing the catalyst concentration from 1 to 7&#8197;mM. The linear dependence indicates a relatively low affinity of the catalyst for the substrate and, hence, the potential for considerable improvement on tethering to an appropriate targeting group, such as an oligonucleotide.

         <title>DNA Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Driven by Base Stacking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open and shut case: A new system of DNA supramolecular polymerization driven by DNA base stacking together with a sequence symmetry design strategy is demonstrated. In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self&#8208;healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Stable Hairpin Structures Formed by Xylose&#8208;Based Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ladder: Thermal and spectroscopic analyses of xylose (XyNA) and deoxyxylose nucleic acids (dXyNA) indicate the formation of stable hairpin structures. The solution structure of a fully modified dXyNA hairpin indicates the structural preference for a ladder&#8208;like stem with a noncanonical loop.







Abstract
Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo&#8208; and deoxyxylo&#8208;nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3&#8217; epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered to be potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analyses show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem into a stable ladder&#8208;like duplex with marginal right&#8208;handed helicity. The reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures described so far.

         <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand&#8208;Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bigger cage, bigger effect: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo by using guest&#8208;molecule&#8208;modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5&#8242; terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.







Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)&#8208;induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNA Thresholder Controlled by Concentrations of miRNA Cancer Marker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On a high: We have developed a deoxyribozyme&#8208;based thresholder (DTh) that distinguishes the high levels of miR markers found in cancer cells from the low levels found in healthy cells and cleaves another, vital RNA. The DTh constructs showed the expected response to different concentrations of a neuroblastoma marker, exhibiting efficient cleavage of long RNA molecules with high selectivity.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents suppress specific mRNAs in cells and thus reduce the expression of targeted genes. The ability to unambiguously distinguish cancer from healthy cells can solve the low selectivity problem of OGT agents. Cancer RNA markers are expressed in both healthy and cancer cells with a higher expression level in cancer cells. We have designed a DNA&#8208;based construct, named DNA thresholder (DTh) that cleaves targeted RNA only at high concentrations of cancer marker RNA and demonstrates low cleavage activity at low marker concentrations. The RNA&#8208;cleaving activity can be adjusted within one order of magnitude of the cancer marker RNA concentration by simply redesigning DTh. Importantly, DTh recognizes cancer marker RNA, while cleaving targeted RNA; this offers a possibility to suppress vital genes exclusively in cancer cells, thus triggering their death. DTh is a prototype of computation&#8208;inspired molecular device for controlling gene expression and cancer treatment.

         <title>Tagged Benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones as Novel Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;step synthesis, 2&#8208;step labeling: Alkyne&#8208;conjugated benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones are easily accessible in a 1&#8208;step synthesis from substituted anthranilic acid derivatives. They make novel activity&#8208;based probes that covalently react with serine proteases and allow read&#8208;out by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne&#8208;substituted benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne&#8208;tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be used in two&#8208;step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre&#8208;functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
