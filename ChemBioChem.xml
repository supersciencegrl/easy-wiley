         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silent treatment: Glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. We report the largest subset of glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors, which are produced and identified after the silent biosynthetic gene cluster plu1881&#8211;1877 is activated in the native host P. laumondii.







Abstract
The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin&#8197;A and cepafungin&#8197;I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) plu1881&#8211;1877 is present in entomopathogenic Photorhabdus laumondii but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in Escherichia coli. Their chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Biological Applications of O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar modifications on proteins enable cells to respond quickly to environmental cues. We review the plethora of chemical strategies to access precise glycoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc peptides and full proteins and explore the translational use of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptides and glycoproteins as biomarkers, mechanistic probes, and therapeutics. Synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycobiology is poised to rapidly identify roles in chronic and infectious disease.







Abstract
All human cells use O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modifications (O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists in defining precise roles for specific O&#8208;GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non&#8208;genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of O&#8208;GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this review details the state of the art of two strategies for O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modification: advances in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; installation of O&#8208;GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure&#8211;function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational O&#8208;GlcNAc biology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Two&#8208;Photon AIEgens and Their Application in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving potential: Two&#8208;photon AIEgen probes have attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages of large penetration depth, little light damage, dark field imaging and target excitation. This paper reviews the most representative two&#8208;photon imaging technology of the past five years, and discusses its great application potential in the field of biological imaging.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, little light damage, and high spatiotemporal resolution, which make it a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easily reduced or disappears completely, and is not conducive to optimal application. The concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides a solution to the problem of aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption properties can readily be improved just by increasing the loading content of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probes based on AIEgen to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in&#8197;vitro/in&#8197;vivo has become a major research hotspot. This review aims to summarize representative two&#8208;photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene, quinoline, naphthalene and other new structures from the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.

         <title>IsPETase Is a Novel Biocatalyst for Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottle: IsPETase is receiving increased attention for its ability to degrade crystalline PET, a major cause of plastic pollution. This review summarizes the current state of investigation into IsPETase and puts forward the necessity of utilizing and engineering IsPETase for industrial applications.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic polyesters, but also a major cause of plastic pollution. Because the chemical degradation of PET would be uneconomical and rather burdensome, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring enzymatic processes for the disposal of PET waste. Many PET&#8208;hydrolyzing enzymes have been reported in recent decades, some of which demonstrate excellent potential for industrial applications. This review sets out to summarize the state of investigation into IsPETase, a cutinase&#8208;like enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis possessing ability to degrade crystalline PET, and to gain further insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of IsPETase. Benefiting from the continuing identification of novel cutinase&#8208;like proteins and growing availability of the engineered IsPETase, we may anticipate future developments in this type of enzyme would generate suitable biocatalyst for industrial use.

         <title>Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 Transcriptional Systems for Sensing and Genome Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transforming transcription: Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcription systems that rely on exogenous and endogenous cues to conditionally control the function of dCas9 proteins or gRNAs have provided pioneering platforms for genome engineering, cell&#8208;specific sensing and therapies.







Abstract
The clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats&#8208;associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR&#8208;Cas9) and the nuclease&#8208;deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized our ability to precisely engineer and regulate genomes. Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein using exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for the spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing, and so on. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in conditionally controlling CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcriptional systems through gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Rich Peptides: Hyperstable Scaffolds for Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides are being used as stable scaffolds to produce bioactive grafted peptides with either a single epitope (first generation), two identical epitopes (second generation), or two distinct epitopes (third generation). The spatial grid is a metaphor for the tridimensional design one needs to consider when combining a scaffold with one or more epitopes. More information can be found in the minireview by F. Plisson et&#8197;al. Picture by R. G.&#8208;C.

         <title>Stepwise Strategy for One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Rings from Multiple Short Fragments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent products are assembled step by step: When more than three kinds of parts are used to prepare thousands of big molecules with a specific structure, the procedure has to be carefully designed. For example, when ligating ssDNA strands to a long circular ssDNA, each group should contain only two or three stands to give a high yield. This rule has to be obeyed until the final product is obtained, otherwise, the materials will be used up before it is ready. This design is suitable for preparing any other complex molecule. More information can be found in the full paper by X. G. Liang et&#8197;al.

         <title>Characterization of New DNA Aptamers for Anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 Reverse Transcriptase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 915-923, March 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA aptamers are the new approach for anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT. These aptamers were isolated by the use of a DNA library complexed to WT HIV&#8208;1 RT. The selected DNA aptamers showed an inhibitory effect on the polymerase reaction of HIV&#8208;1 RTs (WT and KY mutant). NMR spectroscopy showed that the aptamer induced a conformational change in HIV&#8208;1 RT&#8242;s structure.







Abstract
HIV&#8208;1 RT is a necessary enzyme for retroviral replication, which is the main target for antiviral therapy against AIDS. Effective anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT drugs are divided into two groups; nucleoside inhibitors (NRTI) and non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI), which inhibit DNA polymerase. In this study, new DNA aptamers were isolated as anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT inhibitors. The selected DNA aptamer (WT62) presented with high affinity and inhibition against wild&#8208;type (WT) HIV&#8208;1 RT and gave a KD value of 75.10&#177;0.29&#8197;nM and an IC50 value of 84.81&#177;8.54&#8197;nM. Moreover, WT62 decreased the DNA polymerase function of K103&#8197;N/Y181&#8197;C double mutant (KY) HIV&#8208;1 RT by around 80&#8201;%. Furthermore, the ITC results showed that this aptamer has small binding enthalpies with both WT and KY HIV&#8208;1 RTs through which the complex might form a hydrophobic interaction or noncovalent bonding. The NMR result also suggested that the WT62 aptamer could bind with both WT and KY mutant HIV&#8208;1 RTs at the connection domain.

         <title>RAPTA&#8208;Decorated Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles: Exploring their Synthesis, Physical Properties and Effect on Cell Viability</title>

Nanomedicine: We present a novel nanomedicine consisting of a RAPTA metal&#8208;based drug immobilised onto the surface of polyacrylamide nanoparticles. Our conjugates have been well characterised, and their effects on cell viability evaluated through in&#8197;vitro MTT cytotoxicity assays against HT&#8208;29 colorectal adenocarcinomas. Our conjugate offers a significant 100&#8208;fold increase in performance compared to the RAPTA compound alone.







Abstract
In this study, we report the first successful immobilisation of a known cytoactive [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(C2O4)PTA] (RAPTA) complex to a biologically inert polyacrylamide nanoparticle support. The nanoparticles have been characterised by zetasizer analysis, UV/Vis, ATR&#8208;FTIR, TGA and ICP&#8208;MS to qualitatively and quantitatively confirm the presence of the metallodrug on the surface of the carrier. The native RAPTA complex required a concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;M to produce a cell viability of 47.1&#177;2.1&#8201;% when incubated with human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma cells for 72&#8197;h. Under similar conditions a cell viability of 45.1&#177;1.9&#8201;% was obtained with 0.5&#8197;&#956;M of RAPTA complex in its immobilised form. Therefore, conjugation of the RAPTA metallodrug to our nanoparticle carriers resulted in a significant 100&#8208;fold decrease in effective concentration of ruthenium required for a near identical biological effect on cell viability.

         <title>Programmed and Sequential Disassembly of Multi&#8208;responsive Supramolecular Protein Nanoassemblies: A Detailed Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 876-887, March 2, 2021. </description>

##: Custom&#8208;designed construction of artificial, multi&#8208;responsive protein nanoassemblies at molecular scale is considered to be of paramount importance. Herein, we report a chemical strategy for the construction of multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular protein nanoassemblies using amphiphilic, monodisperse protein&#8208;dendron based macromolecular synthons.







Abstract
The rational design of a multi&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based supramolecular system that can predictably respond to more than one stimulus remains an essential but highly challenging goal in biomolecular engineering. Herein, we report a novel chemical method for the construction of multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoassemblies using custom&#8208;designed facially amphiphilic monodisperse protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The macromolecular synthons contain a globular hydrophilic protein domain site&#8208;specifically conjugated to photo&#8208;responsive hydrophobic benzyl&#8208;ether dendrons of different generations through oligo(ethylene glycol) linkers of defined length. The size of the protein nanoassemblies can be systematically tuned by choosing an appropriate dendron or linker of defined length. Exposure of protein nanoassemblies to light results in partial rather than complete disassembly of the complex. The newly formed protein nanoparticle no longer responds to light but could be disassembled into constitutive monomers under acidic conditions or by further treatment with a small molecule. More interestingly, the distribution ratio of the assembled versus disassembled states of protein nanoassemblies after photochemical reaction does not depend on dendron generation, the nature of the linker functionality or the identity of the protein, but is heavily influenced by the linker length. In sum, this work discloses a new chemical method for the rational design of a monodisperse multi&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based supramolecular system with exquisite control over the disassembly process.

         <title>Hybridization Networks of mRNA and Branched RNA Hybrids</title>

Branched oligoribonucleotide hybrids that hybridize to two different loci of mRNA were used to produce a biomaterial that may become useful for vaccination.







Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is emerging as an attractive biopolymer for therapy and vaccination. To become suitable for vaccination, mRNA is usually converted to a biomaterial, using cationic peptides, polymers or lipids. An alternative form of converting mRNA into a material is demonstrated that uses branched oligoribonucleotide hybrids with the ability to hybridize with one or more regions of the mRNA sequence. Two such hybrids with hexamer arms and adamantane tetraol as branching element were prepared by solution&#8208;phase synthesis. When a rabies mRNA was treated with the branched hybrids at 1&#8197;M NaCl concentration, biomaterials formed that contained both of the nucleic acids. These results show that branched oligoribonucleotides are an alternative to the often toxic reagents commonly used to formulate mRNA for medical applications.

         <title>Why Does the Novel Coronavirus Spike Protein Interact so Strongly with the Human ACE2? A Thermodynamic Answer</title>

The receptor binding domain (RBD) from coronavirus&#8217; spike protein recognizes human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), making it an important drug target. This in silico study compares RBD interactions from SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with the hACE2, revealing an intricate pattern of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, and a free energy of binding consistently stronger for the later virus.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic is the biggest health concern today, but until now there is no treatment. One possible drug target is the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus&#8217; spike protein, which recognizes the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Our in silico study discusses crucial structural and thermodynamic aspects of the interactions involving RBDs from the SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with the hACE2. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations explain why the chemical affinity of the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 for hACE2 is much higher than in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV, revealing an intricate pattern of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and estimating a free energy of binding, which is consistently much more negative in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This work presents a chemical reason for the difficulty in treating the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with drugs targeting its spike protein and helps to explain its infectiousness.

Control of the T7 promoter system: TALE selectively suppresses protein expression through target&#8208;site&#8208;specific DNA recognition and DNA binding. As competitive inhibition of TALE binding restored protein synthesis levels, our results show that TALE can regulate the expression of the T7 promoter system by DNA recognition.







Abstract
The aim of this study was to develop a transcription activator&#8208;like effector (TALE)&#8208;based technology to regulate protein synthesis in cell&#8208;free systems. We attempted to regulate the T7 promoter system, which has no natural mechanism of expression control, and sought to arbitrarily induce protein expression through the formation and dissociation of TALE and target DNA complexes. Protein synthesis was performed in a cell&#8208;free system in the presence of TALE, which recognized and bound to a sequence upstream of the T7 promoter, and protein expression was suppressed by approximately 80&#8201;% compared to in the absence of TALE. This suggests that masking part of the promoter region strongly suppresses protein synthesis. Additionally, competitive inhibition of TALE binding to the target DNA template led to protein synthesis levels that were equivalent to the levels in the absence of TALE. Our results demonstrate that DNA recognition by TALE can regulate the expression of the T7 promoter system.

         <title>Quinone Methide&#8208;Based Organophosphate Hydrolases Inhibitors: Trans Proximity Labelers versus Cis Labeling Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>

Internal affairs: Phosphoester substrates that release electrophilic quinone&#8208;methides were applied as activity&#8208;based probes in three phosphotriesterases that differ in mechanism and level of activity. Their substrates&#8242; reactivity, and mode of labeling, were systematically investigated with the aim of achieving specific cis labeling rather than trans.







Abstract
Quinone methide (QM) chemistry is widely applied including in enzyme inhibitors. Typically, enzyme&#8208;mediated bond breaking releases a phenol product that rearranges into an electrophilic QM that in turn covalently modifies protein side chains. However, the factors that govern the reactivity of QM&#8208;based inhibitors and their mode of inhibition have not been systematically explored. Foremost, enzyme inactivation might occur in cis, whereby a QM molecule inactivates the very same enzyme molecule that released it, or by trans if the released QMs diffuse away and inactivate other enzyme molecules. We examined QM&#8208;based inhibitors for enzymes exhibiting phosphoester hydrolase activity. We tested different phenolic substituents and benzylic leaving groups, thereby modulating the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis, phenolate&#8208;to&#8208;QM rearrangement, and the electrophilicity of the resulting QM. By developing assays that distinguish between cis and trans inhibition, we have identified certain combinations of leaving groups and phenyl substituents that lead to inhibition in the cis mode, while other combinations gave trans inhibition. Our results suggest that cis&#8208;acting QM&#8208;based substrates could be used as activity&#8208;based probes to identify various phospho&#8208; and phosphono&#8208;ester hydrolases, and potentially other hydrolases.

A quick learner: Machine learning based on the innov'SAR algorithm leads to efficient selection of highly robust limonene epoxide hydrolase mutants with enhanced unfolding stability and resistance to aggregation by recognizing epistatic mutational interactions.







Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has pervaded most areas of protein engineering, including stability and stereoselectivity. Using limonene epoxide hydrolase as the model enzyme and innov'SAR as the ML platform, comprising a digital signal process, we achieved high protein robustness that can resist unfolding with concomitant detrimental aggregation. Fourier transform (FT) allows us to take into account the order of the protein sequence and the nonlinear interactions between positions, and thus to grasp epistatic phenomena. The innov'SAR approach is interpolative, extrapolative and makes outside&#8208;the&#8208;box, predictions not found in other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ML or deep learning approaches. Equally significant is the finding that our approach to ML in the present context, flanked by advanced molecular dynamics simulations, uncovers the connection between epistatic mutational interactions and protein robustness.

Turn it on: Efficacy of traditional small molecules/inhibitors relies on achieving optimal target/ligand occupancy. New concepts, such as gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, are beginning to break these shackles. Discussed herein is the current knowledge about small molecule&#8208;induced gain&#8208;of&#8208;function and how emerging data and paradigms could prove useful in harnessing this powerful concept.







Abstract
The pressing need for innovation in drug discovery is spurring the emergence of drugs that turn on protein function, as opposed to shutting activity down. Several pharmacophores usher protein target gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, for instance: PROTACs promote protein target degradation; other drug candidates have been reported to function through dominant&#8208;negative inhibition of their target enzyme. Such classes of molecules are typically active at low target occupancy and display numerous advantages relative to canonical inhibitors, whose function is intrinsically tied to achieving, or exceeding a threshold occupancy. However, our ability to generally tap into gain&#8208;of&#8208;function processes through small molecule interventions is overall in its infancy. Herein, I outline how chemical biology is poised to help us bring this powerful idea to fruition. I further outline means through which gain&#8208;of&#8208;function events can be identified and harnessed.

         <title>Courses Based on iGEM/BIOMOD Competitions Are the Ideal Format for Research&#8208;Based Learning of Xenobiology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 818-825, March 2, 2021. </description>

Competition experiments: &#8220;iGEM&#8208;Synthetic Biology&#8221; is a student&#8208;centered, research&#8208;based teaching format for xenobiology. Students conduct their own experiments in an interdisciplinary team with a focus on participation in an international competition. Such formats motivate students to show the highest performance and are possibly the best way to teach novel emerging research fields within the Humboldtian model of higher education.







Abstract
Synthetic biology and especially xenobiology, as emerging new fields of science, have reached an intellectual and experimental maturity that makes them suitable for integration into the university curricula of chemical and biological disciplines. Novel scientific fields that include laboratory work are perfect playgrounds for developing highly motivating research&#8208;based teaching modules. We believe that research&#8208;based learning enriched by digital tools is the best approach for teaching new emerging essentials of academic education. This is especially true when the scientific field as such is still not canonized with text books and best&#8208;practice examples. Our experience shows that iGEM/BIOMOD competitions represent an excellent basis for designing research&#8208;based courses in xenobiology. Therefore, we present a report on &#8220;iGEM&#8211;Synthetic Biology&#8221; offered at the Technische Universit&#228;t Berlin as an example.

Last piece of the puzzle in biomolecular NMR spectroscopy: The central theme of the design is the four &#8220;jigsaw puzzle pieces&#8221;, which signify the fact that our 17O NMR work represents the &#8220;last piece of the puzzle&#8221; in the field of biomolecular NMR. On the left is shown the ribbon structure of the protein studied in this work. On the right hand side is the design drawing of a series&#8208;connected hybrid (SCH) 35.2&#8208;T magnet (the most powerful NMR magnet in the world) on which we recorded the first set of 17O NMR spectra for proteins.

         <dc:description>
Saxitoxins are neurotoxic alkaloids produced by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. Due to their antagonism of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels, they are desirable candidates for drug development as anaesthetics and muscle relaxants. We describe the heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of the first enzyme in the saxitoxin pathway, SxtA, in E.&#8197;coli. This unusual polyketide synthase&#8208;like enzyme is able to condense multiple acid&#8208;CoA substrates with arginine and could potentially be exploited for the production of novel compounds of biomedical value.

         <title>Zn2+&#8208;Dependent DNAzymes: From Solution Chemistry to Analytical, Materials and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 779-789, March 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being a Lewis acid, Zn2+ can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. This article reviews DNAzymes that use Zn2+ as a cofactor with an emphasis on the hydrolysis of Zn2+. Various applications of the DNAzymes are also discussed.







Abstract
Since 1994, deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes have been in&#8197;vitro selected to catalyze various types of reactions. Metal ions play a critical role in DNAzyme catalysis, and Zn2+ is a very important one among them. Zn2+ has good biocompatibility and can be used for intracellular applications. Chemically, Zn2+ is a Lewis acid and it can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. Zn2+ undergoes hydrolysis even at neutral pH, and the partially hydrolyzed polynuclear complexes can affect the interactions with DNA. These features have made Zn2+ a unique cofactor for DNAzyme reactions. This review summarizes Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes with an emphasis on RNA&#8208;/DNA&#8208;cleaving reactions. A key feature is the sharp Zn2+ concentration and pH&#8208;dependent activity for many of the DNAzymes. The applications of these DNAzymes as biosensors for Zn2+, as therapeutic agents to cleave intracellular RNA, and as chemical biology tools to manipulate DNA are discussed. Future studies can focus on the selection of new DNAzymes with improved performance and detailed biochemical characterizations to understand the role of Zn2+, which can facilitate practical applications of Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being a Lewis acid&lt;/b&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. This article reviews DNAzymes that use Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor with an emphasis on the hydrolysis of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Various applications of the DNAzymes are also discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1994, deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes have been in&#8197;vitro selected to catalyze various types of reactions. Metal ions play a critical role in DNAzyme catalysis, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is a very important one among them. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has good biocompatibility and can be used for intracellular applications. Chemically, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is a Lewis acid and it can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; undergoes hydrolysis even at neutral pH, and the partially hydrolyzed polynuclear complexes can affect the interactions with DNA. These features have made Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; a unique cofactor for DNAzyme reactions. This review summarizes Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;dependent DNAzymes with an emphasis on RNA&#8208;/DNA&#8208;cleaving reactions. A key feature is the sharp Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and pH&#8208;dependent activity for many of the DNAzymes. The applications of these DNAzymes as biosensors for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, as therapeutic agents to cleave intracellular RNA, and as chemical biology tools to manipulate DNA are discussed. Future studies can focus on the selection of new DNAzymes with improved performance and detailed biochemical characterizations to understand the role of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which can facilitate practical applications of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;dependent DNAzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

Light'em up! The combination of photo&#8208;chemocatalytic and biocatalytic transformations represents an elegant strategy to extend the photo&#8208;biocatalytic toolbox for the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. This review presents recent achievements in the field and highlights promising strategies to overcome incompatibility issues.







Abstract
In the field of green chemistry, light &#8211; an attractive natural agent &#8211; has received particular attention for driving biocatalytic reactions. Moreover, the implementation of light to drive (chemo)enzymatic cascade reactions opens up a golden window of opportunities. However, there are limitations to many current examples, mostly associated with incompatibility between the enzyme and the photocatalyst. Additionally, the formation of reactive radicals upon illumination and the loss of catalytic activities in the presence of required additives are common observations. As outlined in this review, the main question is how to overcome current challenges to the exploitation of light to drive (chemo)enzymatic transformations. First, we highlight general concepts in photo&#8208;biocatalysis, then give various examples of photo&#8208;chemoenzymatic (PCE) cascades, further summarize current synthetic examples of PCE cascades and discuss strategies to address the limitations.

Partial release mechanism of exocytosis: This minireview highlights the recent progress in amperometric measurement for monitoring exocytosis from single cells, and electrochemical cytometry measurement of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Evidence from several studies supports the hypothesis that partial release is the primary mechanism during regular exocytosis.







Abstract
Exocytosis plays an essential role in the communication between cells in the nervous system. Understanding the regulation of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis and the amount of neurotransmitter content that is stored in vesicles is of importance, as it provides fundamental insights to understand how the brain works and how neurons elicit a certain behavior. In this minireview, we summarize recent progress in amperometric measurements for monitoring exocytosis in single cells and electrochemical cytometry measurements of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Important steps have increased our understanding of the different mechanisms of exocytosis. Increasing evidence is firmly establishing that partial release is the primary mechanism of release in multiple cell types.

It all began with 2D and 3D designs, but now DNA nanotechnology along with DNA origami has expanded into diverse areas of application like scaffolds for nanoscale matter organization, bioimaging, super&#8208;resolution imaging, therapeutics delivery, etc. This review covers design principles in DNA nanotechnology, bio&#8208; and biomedical applications and provides a perspective for future ventures in DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
The broad field of structural DNA nanotechnology has diverged into various areas of applications ranging from computing, photonics, synthetic biology, and biosensing to in&#8208;vivo bioimaging and therapeutic delivery, to name but a few. Though the field began to exploit DNA to build various nanoscale architectures, it has now taken a new path to diverge from structural DNA nanotechnology to functional or applied DNA nanotechnology. More recently a third sub&#8208;branch has emerged&#8208;biologically oriented DNA nanotechnology, which seeks to explore the functionalities of combinatorial DNA devices in various biological systems. In this review, we summarize the key developments in DNA nanotechnology revealing a current trend that merges the functionality of DNA devices with the specificity of biomolecules to access a range of functions in biological systems. This review seeks to provide a perspective on the evolution and biological applications of DNA nanotechnology, where the integration of DNA structures with biomolecules can now uncover phenomena of interest to biologists and biomedical scientists. Finally, we conclude with the challenges, limitations, and perspectives of DNA nanodevices in fundamental and applied research.

         <title>Structural Insights into the Interaction of Heme with Protein Tyrosine Kinase JAK2**

Where it&#8242;s happening: JAK2 is of paramount importance in erythropoietic precursor cells and its dysfunction drives myeloid cancers. Heme is accumulated by these cells in order to produce hemoglobin. Here we show that heme can drive JAK2 phosphorylation in K562 myeloid tumor cells. We identify two possible interaction sites based on distinct heme&#8208;binding motifs, that is, cysteine&#8208;proline and histidine&#8208;X&#8208;tyrosine. Structural insights into the interaction of heme with protein tyrosine kinase JAK2 (Imhof @UniBonn)







Abstract
Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is the most important signal&#8208;transducing tyrosine kinase in erythropoietic precursor cells. Its malfunction drives several myeloproliferative disorders. Heme is a small metal&#8208;ion&#8208;carrying molecule that is incorporated into hemoglobin in erythroid precursor cells to transport oxygen. In addition, heme is a signaling molecule and regulator of various biochemical processes. Here, we show that heme exposure leads to hyperphosphorylation of JAK2 in a myeloid cancer cell line. Two peptides identified in JAK2 are heme&#8208;regulatory motifs and show low&#8208;micromolar affinities for heme. These peptides map to the kinase domain of JAK2, which is essential for downstream signaling. We suggest these motifs to be the interaction sites of heme with JAK2, which drive the heme&#8208;induced hyperphosphorylation. The results presented herein could facilitate the development of heme&#8208;related pharmacological tools to combat myeloproliferative disorders.

         <title>Revision of the Cyclisation Mechanism for the Diterpene Spiroviolene and Investigations of Its Mass Spectrometric Fragmentation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 850-854, March 2, 2021. </description>

Second thoughts: After the structural revision of the bacterial diterpene spiroviolene its biosynthesis is revisited and can now be integrated into a unified scheme with related fungal compounds such as the cyclopiane&#8208;type diterpenes and spirograterpene&#8197;A. An isotopic labelling study giving insights into the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation mechanism of spiroviolene is presented.







Abstract
The diterpene spiroviolene, its diterpene synthase from Streptomyces violens and the experimentally determined terpene cyclisation mechanism were reported in 2017. Recently, the structure of spiroviolene was revised based on a total synthesis, with consequences for the cyclisation mechanism. Herein, a reinvestigation of the terpene cyclisation to spiroviolene and the mass spectrometric fragmentation mechanism investigated by 13C&#8208;labelling experiments are presented.

Herein, a reinvestigation of the terpene cyclisation to spiroviolene and the mass spectrometric fragmentation mechanism investigated by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8208;labelling experiments are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>17O NMR Studies of Yeast Ubiquitin in Aqueous Solution and in the Solid State</title>

Last piece of the puzzle: We report amino acid&#8208;type specific incorporation of 17O isotope into yeast ubiquitin with an auxotrophic E. coli strain. We show that 17O NMR signals from 17O&#8208;labeled proteins can be observed both in aqueous solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
We report a general method for amino acid&#8208;type specific 17O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. In particular, we have prepared several [1&#8208;13C,17O]&#8208;labeled yeast ubiquitin (Ub) samples including Ub&#8208;[1&#8208;13C,17O]Gly, Ub&#8208;[1&#8208;13C,17O]Tyr, and Ub&#8208;[1&#8208;13C,17O]Phe using the auxotrophic E. coli strain DL39 GlyA &#955;DE3 (aspC&#8722; tyrB&#8722; ilvE&#8722; glyA&#8722; &#955;DE3). We have also produced Ub&#8208;[&#951;&#8208;17O]Tyr, in which the phenolic group of Tyr59 is 17O&#8208;labeled. We show for the first time that 17O NMR signals from protein terminal residues and side chains can be readily detected in aqueous solution. We also reported solid&#8208;state 17O NMR spectra for Ub&#8208;[1&#8208;13C,17O]Tyr and Ub&#8208;[1&#8208;13C,17O]Phe obtained at an ultrahigh magnetic field, 35.2 T (1.5&#8197;GHz for 1H). This work represents a significant advance in the field of 17O NMR studies of proteins.

         <title>Chemically Diverse Multifunctional Peptide Platforms with Antimicrobial and Cell Adhesive Properties</title>

Better biomaterials: A multifunctional platform containing a cyclic RGD motif and an antimicrobial peptide, presented using finely tuned spacing units, was found to achieve optimal cell adhesive and bacterial inhibition properties. Anchorage to a biomaterial surface through catechol groups enabled a straightforward functionalization of an implant surface.







Abstract
Bacterial infections and incomplete biomaterial integration are major problems that can lead to the failure of medical implants. However, simultaneously addressing these two issues remains a challenge. Here, we present a chemical peptide library based on a multifunctional platform containing the antimicrobial peptide LF1&#8208;11 and the cell&#8208;adhesive motif RGD. The scaffolds were customized with catechol groups to ensure straightforward functionalization of the implant surface, and linkers of different length to assess the effect of peptide accessibility on the biological response. The peptidic platforms significantly improved the adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells and showed antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus. Of note is that peptides bearing spacers that were too long displayed the lowest efficiency. Subsequently, we designed a platform replacing linear RGD by cyclic RGD; this further enhanced eukaryotic cell adhesion while retaining excellent antimicrobial properties, thus being a suitable candidate for tissue engineering applications.

         <title>Heterologous Expression of an Unusual Ketosynthase, SxtA, Leads to Production of Saxitoxin Intermediates in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 845-849, March 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paralytic analgesics? A polyketide synthase&#8208;like enzyme from the saxitoxin biosynthesis pathway of R. raciborskii was heterologously expressed in E. coli. SxtA had relaxed substrate activity giving rise to 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;guanidinoheptane (ethyl ketone) and methyl ketone. Manipulating the growth medium gave different ratios of the intermediates. The promiscuity of SxtA could lead to saxitoxin variants and other compounds of biomedical value.







Abstract
Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are neurotoxic alkaloids produced by freshwater cyanobacteria and marine dinoflagellates. Due to their antagonism of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in excitable cells, certain analogues are of significant pharmacological interest. The biosynthesis of the parent compound, saxitoxin, is initiated with the formation of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;guanidinoheptane (ethyl ketone) by an unusual polyketide synthase&#8208;like enzyme, SxtA. We have heterologously expressed SxtA from Raphidiopsis raciborskii T3 in Escherichia coli and analysed its activity in&#8197;vivo. Ethyl ketone and a truncated analogue, methyl ketone, were detected by HPLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;HRMS analysis, thus suggesting that SxtA has relaxed substrate specificity in&#8197;vivo. The chemical structures of these products were further verified by tandem mass spectrometry and labelled&#8208;precursor feeding with [guanidino&#8208;15N2] arginine and [1,2&#8208;13C2] acetate. These results indicate that the reactions catalysed by SxtA could give rise to multiple PST variants, including analogues of ecological and pharmacological significance.

         <title>Magnetic Resonance Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange of Selective PyFALGEA Oligopeptide Ligands Towards Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 855-860, March 2, 2021. </description>

SABRE hyperpolarization of complex molecules with crucial biological activity: The PyFALGEA oligopeptide is a highly selective ligand towards the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, the SABRE hyperpolarization of the PyFALGEA molecule was demonstrated. This research indicated that SABRE can be employed to enhance the NMR signals of very complex biorelevant molecules.







Abstract
The biorelevant PyFALGEA oligopeptide ligand, which is selective towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been successfully employed as a substrate in magnetic resonance signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) experiments. It is demonstrated that PyFALGEA and the iridium catalyst IMes form a PyFALGEA:IMes molecular complex. The interaction between PyFALGEA:IMes and H2 results in a ternary SABRE complex. Selective 1D EXSY experiments reveal that this complex is labile, which is an essential condition for successful hyperpolarization by SABRE. Polarization transfer from parahydrogen to PyFALGEA is observed leading to significant enhancement of the 1H NMR signals of PyFALGEA. Different iridium catalysts and peptides are inspected to discuss the influence of their molecular structures on the efficiency of hyperpolarization. It is observed that PyFALGEA oligopeptide hyperpolarization is more efficient when an iridium catalyst with a sterically less demanding NHC ligand system such as IMesBn is employed. Experiments with shorter analogues of PyFALGEA, that is, PyLGEA and PyEA, show that the bulky phenylalanine from the PyFALGEA oligopeptide causes steric hindrance in the SABRE complex, which hampers hyperpolarization with IMes. Finally, a single&#8208;scan 1H NMR SABRE experiment of PyFALGEA with IMesBn revealed a unique pattern of NMR lines in the hydride region, which can be treated as a fingerprint of this important oligopeptide.

Trp the light fantastic: FRET&#8208;based detection is described for a protein&#8211;protein interaction between Q18W&#8208;MDM2 and probe p73&#8208;TAD. Adding MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin&#8208;3 to the Q18W&#8208;MDM2/p73&#8208;TAD mixture diminished the FRET signal between the Trp residues of MDM2 and naphthylalanine of p73&#8208;TAD, thereby demonstrating that this system can be used for high&#8208;throughput screening of MDM2 inhibitors.







Abstract
The protein p73 acts as a transcription factor, resulting in tumour suppression. MDM2, an oncogenic protein, can negatively influence p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis by binding to p73 transactivation domains (TAD). Inhibition of the protein&#8208;protein interaction between p73 and oncogenic proteins is an attractive strategy for promoting p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Herein, we describe the use of a modified p73&#8208;TAD peptide for the FRET&#8208;based assay of the binding of p73&#8208;TAD to MDM2. The FRET probe, equipped with 1&#8208;naphthylamine (&#955;ex=330&#8197;nm, &#955;em=445&#8197;nm), serves as a FRET acceptor, and the tryptophan of the protein acts as FRET donor (&#955;ex=280&#8197;nm, &#955;em=340&#8197;nm). Sensitized emission from the FRET probe was observed upon excitation of the protein&#8208;FRET&#8208;probe complex at the excitation wavelength of Trp. Furthermore, addition of the MDM2 inhibitor Nutiln&#8208;3 drastically reduced the FRET signal, thus indicating that the FRET probe competes with Nutiln&#8208;3 for MDM2 binding. The developed FRET binding assay might be applicable in high&#8208;throughput screening of novel drugs that inhibit interactions between p73 and MDM2.

         <title>Towards Dissecting the Mechanism of Protein Phosphatase&#8208;1 Inhibition by Its C&#8208;Terminal Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 5, Page 834-838, March 2, 2021. </description>

Interrogating a mechanistic black box: Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is among the major serine/threonine phosphatases and is involved in numerous pathways. Autoinhibition by phosphorylation of Thr320 at the C&#8208;terminus leads to cell&#8208;cycle arrest and neuronal defects. However, the mechanism underlying this regulatory phosphorylation site is unknown. Herein, we investigate potential mechanisms.







Abstract
Phosphoprotein phosphatase&#8208;1 (PP1) is a key player in the regulation of phospho&#8208;serine (pSer) and phospho&#8208;threonine (pThr) dephosphorylation and is involved in a large fraction of cellular signaling pathways. Aberrant activity of PP1 has been linked to many diseases, including cancer and heart failure. Besides a well&#8208;established activity control by regulatory proteins, an inhibitory function for phosphorylation (p) of a Thr residue in the C&#8208;terminal intrinsically disordered tail of PP1 has been demonstrated. The associated phenotype of cell&#8208;cycle arrest was repeatedly proposed to be due to autoinhibition of PP1 through either conformational changes or substrate competition. Here, we use PP1 variants created by mutations and protein semisynthesis to differentiate between these hypotheses. Our data support the hypothesis that pThr exerts its inhibitory function by mediating protein complex formation rather than by a direct mechanism of structural changes or substrate competition.

         <title>Investigation of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D  2  (VD  2  ) and vitamin D  3  (VD  3  ) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain,  Kutzneria albida  , was identified, showing the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  2  and 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  . To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  and 10&#8208;fold higher concentrations of 25&#8209;OH&#8208;D  2  after addition of 5% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single hydroxylation products, the human double hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  2  and 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  3  and various other potential single and double hydroxylation products were detected. Thus,  K. albida  represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD  2  and VD  3  metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the interaction of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 polypeptides with the chaperonin nanomachine GroEL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Huntington&#8217;s disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon&#8208;1 region of huntingtin (htt  ex1  ), resulting in an aggregation prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various htt  ex1  constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of htt  ex1  constructs with intact GroEL and a mini&#8208;chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation&#8208;based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100&#8208;400 m s with equilibrium dissociation constants (  K  D  ) of &#160;~1&#8208;2 mM. The binding interface is formed by the N&#8208;terminal amphiphilic region of htt  ex1  (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric htt  ex1  by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing multiple, non&#8208;proteogenic substitutions to optimize CSP:ComD hydrophobic interactions in group1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pneumoniae  (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) &#8208; mediated quorum sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in  S. pneumoniae  can therefore be utilized to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility for resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure&#8208;activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP&#8208;based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence microscopy imaging provides information about the localization and trafficking of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. To visualize these proteins, reporter groups must be introduced on the surface of live cells. This review discusses live&#8208;cell protein labelling by small, genetically encoded peptide tags serving as enzyme substrates or recognition sites for interactions with proteins, coiled&#8208;coil peptides and metal reagents.







Abstract
Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site&#8208;specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live&#8208;cell labeling of peptide&#8208;tagged cell&#8208;surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme&#8208;mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled&#8208;coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide&#8208;templated labeling chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Transition Metal Complexes for Medicine: Translational in Situ Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Drugs from Bench to in Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control and select: Novel metal&#8208;based drugs for treating diverse diseases have recently been under the spotlight. Fine control of off&#8208;targeted toxic effects was achieved by using a variety of stabilized coordination ligands along with different metal centers. Herein, we highlight the versatile, effective and valuable use of transition metals in medicine, namely for in&#8197;situ activation of metal&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs has been hampered, among other reasons, by their lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In a recent article, Zou and co&#8208;workers presented the successful intracellular activation of organogold(I) complexes for potential cancer treatment through Pd(II)&#8208;mediated transmetallation, overcoming some off&#8208;target activity of novel gold&#8208;based drugs. This unique strategy builds the perfect bridge between metallodrug usage and bioorthogonal intracellular catalysis for more advanced and selective therapies. Such an approach will hopefully pave the way for forthcoming studies in medicinal inorganic chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Control of Gelatin Hydrogel Stiffness by Using DNA Crosslinkers**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going soft: We report a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel crosslinked with DNA. The stiffness of the gel can be switched by a factor of &#8764;2, over two cycles, by using displacement strands, with no degradation of gel performance. Using two DNA sequences allows orthogonal control of gel stiffness and ligand presentation.







Abstract
Biomaterials with dynamically tunable properties are critical for a range of applications in regenerative medicine and basic biology. In this work, we show the reversible control of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel stiffness through the use of DNA crosslinkers. We replaced some of the inter&#8208;GelMA crosslinks with double&#8208;stranded DNA, allowing for their removal through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. The crosslinks could be restored by adding fresh dsDNA with complementary handles to those on the hydrogel. The elastic modulus (G&#8217;) of the hydrogels could be tuned between 500 and 1000&#8197;Pa, reversibly, over two cycles without degradation of performance. By functionalizing the gels with a second DNA strand, it was possible to control the crosslink density and a model ligand in an orthogonal fashion with two different displacement strands. Our results demonstrate the potential for DNA to reversibly control both stiffness and ligand presentation in a protein&#8208;based hydrogel, and will be useful for teasing apart the spatiotemporal behavior of encapsulated cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution DNA Dual&#8208;Rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branch line: Precise DNA rulers were developed to investigate the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. Based on super&#8208;resolution force spectroscopy, they revealed nucleic acid motion with subnucleotide resolution. New intermediate states were identified, one of which differed from the conventional state by less than a single nucleotide. Our work contributes towards understanding branching among different reading frames during protein synthesis.







Abstract
Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis that involves mRNA translocation of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with subnucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with current techniques. We report a method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA7G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8722;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near&#8208;&#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; intermediate the Post(&#8722;1*) state because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Action and Peptide&#8208;Membrane Interactions of Aib&#8208;Rich Peptides: Multitechnique Experimental and Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sit up or lie down: Linear dichroism, circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore how mimics of peptaibol antibiotics (Aib foldamers) interact with membranes. These studies revealed all peptides partitioned well into the bilayers, with orientation dependent upon peptide length, as well as chiral interactions between peptides and the phospholipids.







Abstract
The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered by their mechanism of action not being clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, linear dichroism, Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, the Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All the peptides studied quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes, and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.

         <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where is thy sting? Wasp venom&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;helical peptides and analogues were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The analogues were less toxic to cells and could accumulate inside cancer cells. Protonectin&#8208;F kills cancer cells and bacteria whereas neuroVAL is a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide.







Abstract
Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp Parachartergus fraternus that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F, were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined by using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where is thy sting&lt;/b&gt;? Wasp venom&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;helical peptides and analogues were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The analogues were less toxic to cells and could accumulate inside cancer cells. Protonectin&#8208;F kills cancer cells and bacteria whereas neuroVAL is a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp &lt;i&gt;Parachartergus fraternus&lt;/i&gt; that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F, were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined by using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Antimicrobial Peptide Gad&#8208;1 Clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms under Cystic Fibrosis Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a metal&#8208;mediated mode of action, the metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gad&#8208;1 can effectively clear P. aeruginosa biofilms. In the presence of Cu2+ ions, Gad&#8208;1 rapidly cleaves the exogenous DNA that allows biofilms to thrive. Anti&#8208;biofilm activity was observed at a range of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of exogenous DNA, conditions relevant to cystic fibrosis.







Abstract
Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are an emerging health issue and lead to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates a thick mucus in the lungs that is prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin&#8208;1 (Gad&#8208;1) eradicates established P. aeruginosa biofilms through a combination of modes of action that includes nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad&#8208;1 exhibits synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, thus making Gad&#8208;1 a new lead compound for the potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.

         <title>Cleavage of an RNA Model Compound by an Arylmercury Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble, but not so speedy: The potential of an water&#8208;soluble arylmercury compound to cleave RNA has been explored. The somewhat low catalytic activity compared to free HgII was attributed to the relatively low affinity of the arylmercury catalyst for the RNA model compound. This suggests that improved derivatives could be obtained by covalent tethering to an appropriate targeting group.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble arylmercury complex has been synthesized, and its ability to catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage of the RNA model compound adenylyl&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyleneadenosine) has been assessed over a pH range of 3&#8211;8.5 and a catalyst concentration range of 0&#8211;7&#8197;mM. In the presence of 1&#8197;mM catalyst, the observed pH&#8211;rate profile featured a new pH&#8208;independent region between pH&#8197;6 and 7, the catalyzed reaction being as much as eight times faster than the background reaction. At pH&#8197;7, the acceleration increased linearly from three&#8208; to 17&#8208;fold upon increasing the catalyst concentration from 1 to 7&#8197;mM. The linear dependence indicates a relatively low affinity of the catalyst for the substrate and, hence, the potential for considerable improvement on tethering to an appropriate targeting group, such as an oligonucleotide.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of the Interaction of pICln, RioK1 and COPR5 with the PRMT5&#8208;MEP50 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The PRMT5&#8208;MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein&#8208;protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins which recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5 we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identified the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Driven by Base Stacking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open and shut case: A new system of DNA supramolecular polymerization driven by DNA base stacking together with a sequence symmetry design strategy is demonstrated. In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self&#8208;healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Stable Hairpin Structures Formed by Xylose&#8208;Based Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ladder: Thermal and spectroscopic analyses of xylose (XyNA) and deoxyxylose nucleic acids (dXyNA) indicate the formation of stable hairpin structures. The solution structure of a fully modified dXyNA hairpin indicates the structural preference for a ladder&#8208;like stem with a noncanonical loop.







Abstract
Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo&#8208; and deoxyxylo&#8208;nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3&#8217; epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered to be potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analyses show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem into a stable ladder&#8208;like duplex with marginal right&#8208;handed helicity. The reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures described so far.

         <title>Application of neuron&#8208;selective fluorescent probe, NeuA, to identify mouse retinal degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe &#8211; NeuA &#8211; for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined  in vitro  ,  ex vivo  and  in vivo  using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Manufacture of multi&#8208;layered artificial cell membranes through sequential bilayer deposition on emulsion templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes are multi&#8208;lamellar, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes. Due to a lack of technologies available for their construction, multi&#8208;layered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell&#8208;mimetic motifs used in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. To address this, we develop emulsion&#8208;based technologies that allow cell&#8208;sized multi&#8208;layered vesicles to be produced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, with compositional control over each layer, enabling studies that otherwise remain inaccessible. We discover that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter&#8208;bilayer registration between coexisting liquid&#8208;liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multi&#8208;layered membrane structure, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand&#8208;Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bigger cage, bigger effect: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo by using guest&#8208;molecule&#8208;modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5&#8242; terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.







Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)&#8208;induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNA Thresholder Controlled by Concentrations of miRNA Cancer Marker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On a high: We have developed a deoxyribozyme&#8208;based thresholder (DTh) that distinguishes the high levels of miR markers found in cancer cells from the low levels found in healthy cells and cleaves another, vital RNA. The DTh constructs showed the expected response to different concentrations of a neuroblastoma marker, exhibiting efficient cleavage of long RNA molecules with high selectivity.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents suppress specific mRNAs in cells and thus reduce the expression of targeted genes. The ability to unambiguously distinguish cancer from healthy cells can solve the low selectivity problem of OGT agents. Cancer RNA markers are expressed in both healthy and cancer cells with a higher expression level in cancer cells. We have designed a DNA&#8208;based construct, named DNA thresholder (DTh) that cleaves targeted RNA only at high concentrations of cancer marker RNA and demonstrates low cleavage activity at low marker concentrations. The RNA&#8208;cleaving activity can be adjusted within one order of magnitude of the cancer marker RNA concentration by simply redesigning DTh. Importantly, DTh recognizes cancer marker RNA, while cleaving targeted RNA; this offers a possibility to suppress vital genes exclusively in cancer cells, thus triggering their death. DTh is a prototype of computation&#8208;inspired molecular device for controlling gene expression and cancer treatment.

         <title>Tagged Benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones as Novel Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;step synthesis, 2&#8208;step labeling: Alkyne&#8208;conjugated benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones are easily accessible in a 1&#8208;step synthesis from substituted anthranilic acid derivatives. They make novel activity&#8208;based probes that covalently react with serine proteases and allow read&#8208;out by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne&#8208;substituted benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne&#8208;tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be used in two&#8208;step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre&#8208;functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.

         <title>SP3&#8208;FAIMS Chemoproteomics for High&#8208;Coverage Profiling of the Human Cysteinome**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile verification: A new cysteine chemoproteomic method enables rapid and high&#8208;coverage analysis of the human cysteinome. By combining enhanced cysteine biotinylation with SP3 sample decontamination and FAIMS on&#8208;line fraction, we identified in aggregate 34225 unique cysteines found on 7243 proteins. Integration with the isoTOP&#8208;ABPP workflow enabled the high&#8208;throughput discovery of cysteines labeled by electrophilic compounds.







Abstract
Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome&#8208;wide discovery of functional, redox&#8208;sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample&#8208;preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample&#8208;preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single&#8208;pot, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;enhanced sample&#8208;preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, even from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with on&#8208;line high&#8208;field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labeled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of &gt;14000 unique cysteines in a single&#8208;shot 70&#8197;min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small&#8208;molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis&#8211;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP). In aggregate, our analysis of 18 samples from seven cell lines identified 34225 unique cysteines using only &#8764;28&#8197;h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Versatile verification&lt;/b&gt;: A new cysteine chemoproteomic method enables rapid and high&#8208;coverage analysis of the human cysteinome. By combining enhanced cysteine biotinylation with SP3 sample decontamination and FAIMS on&#8208;line fraction, we identified in aggregate 34225 unique cysteines found on 7243 proteins. Integration with the isoTOP&#8208;ABPP workflow enabled the high&#8208;throughput discovery of cysteines labeled by electrophilic compounds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome&#8208;wide discovery of functional, redox&#8208;sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample&#8208;preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample&#8208;preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single&#8208;pot, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;enhanced sample&#8208;preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, even from small sample sizes.

         <title>Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenases from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter brockii as Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) represent an important type of enzymes that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus ( Te SADH) and from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ( Tb SADH) are well&#8208;known as robust catalysts. However, and like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This review discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune enantioselectivity of Te SADH and Tb SADH using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, Te SADH has been used in quantitative non&#8208;stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to accomplish deracemization of alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized biocatalytic synthesis of 2&#8208;Seleno pyrimidine nucleosides via transglycosylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The wide&#8208;spread application of 2&#8208;seleno pyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Here, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60&#160;or 80&#160;&#176;C and at pH 9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10 and therefore differ by an order of magnitude compared to equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, which complicates their synthesis significantly. A ten&#8208;fold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40% isolated yield which compares favorably to established chemical routes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.

         <title>An Artificial Cofactor Catalyzing the Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction with Designed Streptavidin as Protein Host**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A story in pictures: An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst was embedded in streptavidin to catalyze the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction. The following protein design process was described by solved crystal structures for every design step, and the outcome of the chemical reaction was represented by using DFT calculations and MD simulations.







Abstract
An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst embedded in a protein has been used to conduct the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction in a buffered system. As protein host, we chose streptavidin, as it can be easily crystallized and thereby supports the design process. The protein host around the cofactor was rationally designed on the basis of high&#8208;resolution crystal structures obtained after each variation of the amino acid sequence. Additionally, DFT&#8208;calculated intermediates and transition states were used to rationalize the observed activity. Finally, repeated cycles of structure determination and redesign led to a system with an up to one order of magnitude increase in activity over the bare cofactor and to the most active proteinogenic catalyst for the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction known today.

         <title>Organomercury Nucleic Acids: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organomercury renaissance: Research on the synthesis and applications of organomercury nucleic acids and their constituents is reviewed, with a focus on recent developments, such as efforts to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes through HgII&#8208;mediated base pairing of covalently mercurated base moieties.







Abstract
Synthetic efforts towards nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides and nucleic acids covalently mercurated at one or more of their base moieties are summarized, followed by a discussion of the proposed, realized and abandoned applications of this unique class of compounds. Special emphasis is given to fields in which active research is ongoing, notably the use of HgII&#8208;mediated base pairing to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes. Finally, this minireview attempts to anticipate potential future applications of organomercury nucleic acids.

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Screen against a Regulator of G Protein Signaling Identifies a Binding &#8220;Hot Spot&#8221;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altered expression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in G&#8197;protein signaling, eventually altering the transcription of cancer&#8208;promoting proteins. Therefore, inhibiting RGS17 has potential as an anticancer therapy. We used an NMR FBLD approach to identify fragments capable of binding RGS17. Chemical&#8208;shift mapping of the 15N/1H HSQC spectra of 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH identified a previously unknown putative fragment binding site on RGS17.







Abstract
Regulator of G&#8197;protein signaling (RGS) proteins have attracted attention as a result of their primary role in directing the specificity as well as the temporal and spatial aspects of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor signaling. In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. In this area, RGS17 is of particular interest. It has been demonstrated that, while RGS17 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it has been found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G&#8197;protein signaling and an overproduction of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types. Suppressing RGS17 expression with RNA interference (RNAi) has been found to decrease tumorigenesis and sufficiently prevents cancer cell migration, leading to the hypothesis that pharmacological blocking of RGS17 function could be useful in anticancer therapies. We have identified small&#8208;molecule fragments capable of binding the RGS homology (RH) domain of RGS17 by using a nuclear magnetic resonance fragment&#8208;based screening approach. By chemical shift mapping of the two&#8208;dimensional 15N,1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the backbone&#8208;assigned 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH, we determined the fragment binding sites to be distant from the G&#945; interface. Thus, our study identifies a putative fragment binding site on RGS17 that was previously unknown.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Altered expression&lt;/b&gt; of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in G&#8197;protein signaling, eventually altering the transcription of cancer&#8208;promoting proteins. Therefore, inhibiting RGS17 has potential as an anticancer therapy. We used an NMR FBLD approach to identify fragments capable of binding RGS17. Chemical&#8208;shift mapping of the &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H HSQC spectra of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH identified a previously unknown putative fragment binding site on RGS17.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulator of G&#8197;protein signaling (RGS) proteins have attracted attention as a result of their primary role in directing the specificity as well as the temporal and spatial aspects of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor signaling. In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. In this area, RGS17 is of particular interest. It has been demonstrated that, while RGS17 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it has been found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G&#8197;protein signaling and an overproduction of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types.

         <title>Exchange of proteins in liposomes through streptolysin O pores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. One of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. To this end, we used streptolysin O (SLO), a toxic protein that forms pores in lipid membranes made of phospholipids with cholesterol, that can be closed by the addition of calcium ion. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98 kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in ~8% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;targeted metallodrugs: an untapped source of artificial gene editing technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or non&#8208;covalent binding modes. Several recognition modes&#8212;including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation&#8212;are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8208;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8208;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;glycosylation Modification of Sugar Moieties in Kanamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step by step: A dehydrogenase KanQ oxidizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;OH of kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxykanaymycin C or paromamine before introduction of C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2, thus suggesting that the kanosamine moiety with C&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;NH2 is strictly recognized by KanQ. Furthermore, oxygenase KanJ recognizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2 of the pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide for deamination of C&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;NH2; this suggests that these modifications mainly occur in a stepwise manner.







Abstract
Kanamycin&#8197;A is the major 2&#8208;deoxystreptamine (2DOS)&#8208;containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose (6ADG) at O&#8208;4 and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose at O&#8208;6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C&#8208;2 and introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase, KanQ, and an aminotransferase, KanB, are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than the 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino derivative. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of an oxygenase, KanJ, that is responsible for deamination at C&#8208;2 of the GlcN moiety was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 is important for substrate recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C&#8208;2 by KanJ.

         <title>Discovery of an Allosteric Ligand Binding Site in SMYD3 Lysine Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of an allosteric ligand binding site in SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase (@BioChemInf, @HelenaDanielson, @UUBiochem, @UU&#8194;University)From a distance: SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase is an epigenetic enzyme with multiple cellular functions and the ability to recognize broad range of substrates from histones to cytosolic proteins. An SPR biosensors&#8208;based biophysical strategy for screening SMYD3 ligands was developed and revealed an allosteric binding site. Subsequent crystallographic studies provided a structural description of the novel binding site of SMYD3.







Abstract
SMYD3 is a multifunctional epigenetic enzyme with lysine methyltransferase activity and various interaction partners. It is implicated in the pathophysiology of cancers but with an unclear mechanism. To discover tool compounds for clarifying its biochemistry and potential as a therapeutic target, a set of drug&#8208;like compounds was screened in a biosensor&#8208;based competition assay. Diperodon was identified as an allosteric ligand; its R and S enantiomers were isolated, and their affinities to SMYD3 were determined (KD=42 and 84&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that both enantiomers bind to a previously unidentified allosteric site in the C&#8208;terminal protein binding domain, consistent with its weak inhibitory effect. No competition between diperodon and HSP90 (a known SMYD3 interaction partner) was observed although SMYD3&#8211;HSP90 binding was confirmed (KD=13&#8197;&#956;M). Diperodon clearly represents a novel starting point for the design of tool compounds interacting with a druggable allosteric site, suitable for the exploration of noncatalytic SMYD3 functions and therapeutics with new mechanisms of action.

         <title>Luminescent Amphiphilic Aminoglycoside Probes to Study Transfection</title>

Transfection tracker: Conjugates of luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties linked to the aminoglycoside tobramycin are reported. These compounds reveal an emission &#8220;on&#8221; behavior upon plasmid&#8208;DNA binding and are able to transfect different mammalian cell lines. The cellular uptake was investigated using the emission properties of the formed plasmid DNA&#8208;vector assemblies.







Abstract
We report the characterization of amphiphilic aminoglycoside conjugates containing luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties as transfection reagents. These inherently luminescent transfection vectors are capable of binding plasmid DNA through electrostatic interactions; this binding results in an emission &#8220;on&#8221; signal due to restriction of intramolecular motion of the luminophore core. The luminescent cationic amphiphiles effectively transferred plasmid DNA into mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293T), as proven by expression of a red fluorescent protein marker. The morphologies of the aggregates were investigated by microscopy as well as &#950;&#8208;potential and dynamic light&#8208;scattering measurements. The transfection efficiencies using luminescent cationic amphiphiles were similar to that of the gold&#8208;standard transfection reagent Lipofectamine&#174; 2000.

         <title>Chemical biology tools to investigate malaria parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite&#8217;s biology is pivotal to decipher unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensures the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite&#160;  Plasmodium falciparum  . We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance the research of this parasite in the future. We anticipate the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of&#160;  P. falciparum  &#160;and we hope researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge &#8211;&#160;with the aim of ending this devastating disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties Determine Solubility and Stability in &#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins of the Eye Lens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clear as crystallin? &#946;&#947;&#8208;crystallins serve as structural and refractive proteins in the vertebrate lens. Mutations in these proteins are associated with cataracts. Herein, we review recent developments toward understanding the biophysical properties and chemical reactivity of monomeric and oligomeric &#946;&#947; crystallins, including a discussion of the common techniques used to study crystallin structure and stability.







Abstract
&#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins are the primary structural and refractive proteins found in the vertebrate eye lens. Because crystallins are not replaced after early eye development, their solubility and stability must be maintained for a lifetime, which is even more remarkable given the high protein concentration in the lens. Aggregation of crystallins caused by mutations or post&#8208;translational modifications can reduce crystallin protein stability and alter intermolecular interactions. Common post&#8208;translational modifications that can cause age&#8208;related cataracts include deamidation, oxidation, and tryptophan derivatization. Metal ion binding can also trigger reduced crystallin solubility through a variety of mechanisms. Interprotein interactions are critical to maintaining lens transparency: crystallins can undergo domain swapping, disulfide bonding, and liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, all of which can cause opacity depending on the context. Important experimental techniques for assessing crystallin conformation in the absence of a high&#8208;resolution structure include dye&#8208;binding assays, circular dichroism, fluorescence, light scattering, and transition metal FRET.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling of Bile Salt Hydrolysis in the Human Gut Microbiome with Beta&#8208;Lactam or Acrylamide&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than a gut feeling: The salts in bile, which aids digestion, can be modified by gut microbes. Bile salts act as signaling molecules, so structural modifications can impact host physiology. The microbial &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; for bile salt modification is bile salt hydrolase (BSH). To uncover the molecular links between BSH and host health, novel activity&#8208;based probes for BSH were developed.







Abstract
Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Therefore, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases by using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.

         <title>Synthetic Phenolic Glycolipids for Application in Diagnostic Tests for Leprosy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting to the point of care: Trisaccharides of phenolic glycolipids (PGL) originating from M. leprae were evaluated for their diagnostic potential as neoglycoproteins in ELISA and an up&#8208;converting particle lateral flow assay (UCP&#8208;LFA). Two naturally occurring trisaccharides were found to be suitable for this purpose and can thus be used for future field studies in leprosy endemic areas.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative pathogen of leprosy, represent efficient tools to guide therapeutic and prophylactic treatment strategies in leprosy control programs, thus positively contributing to clinical outcome and reducing transmission of this infectious disease. Levels of antibodies directed against the M. leprae&#8208;specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL&#8722;I) closely correlate with an individual's bacterial load and a higher risk of developing leprosy. We describe herein the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns. The PGL trisaccharides were applied to construct neoglycoproteins that were used to detect anti&#8208;PGL IgM antibodies in leprosy patients. ELISAs and quantitative lateral&#8208;flow assays based on up&#8208;converting nanoparticles (UCP&#8208;LFAs) showed that the generated PGL&#8722;I and PGL&#8208;II trisaccharide neoglycoconjugates can be applied for the detection of anti M. leprae IgM antibodies in POC tests.

         <title>Comparative Biochemistry of Four Polyester (PET) Hydrolases**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass&#8208;action kinetics for enzymatic PET hydrolysis: Four PET hydrolases have been tested within a kinetic framework for comparing enzymes hydrolysing the insoluble polymer PET. Analysis provided kinetic parameters in units of M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, as well as values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface. This makes Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics possible for plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes.







Abstract
The potential of bioprocessing in a circular plastic economy has strongly stimulated research into the enzymatic degradation of different synthetic polymers. Particular interest has been devoted to the commonly used polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and a number of PET hydrolases have been described. However, a kinetic framework for comparisons of PET hydrolases (or other plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes) acting on the insoluble substrate has not been established. Herein, we propose such a framework, which we have tested against kinetic measurements for four PET hydrolases. The analysis provided values of kcat and KM, as well as an apparent specificity constant in the conventional units of M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. These parameters, together with experimental values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface, enabled comparative analyses. A variant of the PET hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis was the most efficient enzyme at ambient conditions; it relied on a high kcat rather than a low KM. Moreover, both soluble and insoluble PET fragments were consistently hydrolyzed much faster than intact PET. This suggests that interactions between polymer strands slow down PET degradation, whereas the chemical steps of catalysis and the low accessibility associated with solid substrate were less important for the overall rate. Finally, the investigated enzymes showed a remarkable substrate affinity, and reached half the saturation rate on PET when the concentration of attack sites in the suspension was only about 50&#8197;nM. We propose that this is linked to nonspecific adsorption, which promotes the nearness of enzyme and attack sites.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mass&#8208;action kinetics for enzymatic PET hydrolysis&lt;/b&gt;: Four PET hydrolases have been tested within a kinetic framework for comparing enzymes hydrolysing the insoluble polymer PET. Analysis provided kinetic parameters in units of M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface. This makes Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics possible for plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential of bioprocessing in a circular plastic economy has strongly stimulated research into the enzymatic degradation of different synthetic polymers. Particular interest has been devoted to the commonly used polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and a number of PET hydrolases have been described. However, a kinetic framework for comparisons of PET hydrolases (or other plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes) acting on the insoluble substrate has not been established. Herein, we propose such a framework, which we have tested against kinetic measurements for four PET hydrolases. The analysis provided values of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as an apparent specificity constant in the conventional units of M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These parameters, together with experimental values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface, enabled comparative analyses. A variant of the PET hydrolase from &lt;i&gt;Ideonella sakaiensis&lt;/i&gt; was the most efficient enzyme at ambient conditions; it relied on a high &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; rather than a low &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, both soluble and insoluble PET fragments were consistently hydrolyzed much faster than intact PET. This suggests that interactions between polymer strands slow down PET degradation, whereas the chemical steps of catalysis and the low accessibility associated with solid substrate were less important for the overall rate. Finally, the investigated enzymes showed a remarkable substrate affinity, and reached half the saturation rate on PET when the concentration of attack sites in the suspension was only about 50&#8197;nM. We propose that this is linked to nonspecific adsorption, which promotes the nearness of enzyme and attack sites.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Perturbed Free&#8208;Energy Landscape: Linking Ligand Binding to Biomolecular Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New approaches to drug design and systems biology: The link between ligand binding and biomolecular folding can be understood as arising from perturbation of the free energy landscapes (FEL). Traditional visual descriptions of ligand binding mechanisms are reinterpreted in terms of the perturbed FEL. Recent experimental and computational studies characterizing the pFEL for various biomolecular interactions are reviewed.







Abstract
The effects of ligand binding on biomolecular conformation are crucial in drug design, enzyme mechanisms, the regulation of gene expression, and other biological processes. Descriptive models such as &#8220;lock and key&#8221;, &#8220;induced fit&#8221;, and &#8220;conformation selection&#8221; are common ways to interpret such interactions. Another historical model, linked equilibria, proposes that the free&#8208;energy landscape (FEL) is perturbed by the addition of ligand binding energy for the bound population of biomolecules. This principle leads to a unified, quantitative theory of ligand&#8208;induced conformation change, building upon the FEL concept. We call the map of binding free energy over biomolecular conformational space the &#8220;binding affinity landscape&#8221; (BAL). The perturbed FEL predicts/explains ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes conforming to all common descriptive models. We review recent experimental and computational studies that exemplify the perturbed FEL, with emphasis on RNA. This way of understanding ligand&#8208;induced conformation dynamics motivates new experimental and theoretical approaches to ligand design, structural biology and systems biology.

         <dc:description>
RNA under the spotlight: Chemical reactions used to probe RNA structure combined with deep sequencing helps us towards obtaining a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be used to control RNA biology. This review looks at how advances in chemical methods merged with transcriptome&#8208;wide RNA probing could extend our understanding of RNA structure and function in normal cells and disease.







Abstract
RNA molecules can fold into complex two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are critical for their function. Chemical probes have long been utilized to interrogate RNA structure and are now considered invaluable resources in the goal of relating structure to function. Recently, the power of deep sequencing and careful chemical probe design have merged, permitting researchers to obtain a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be utilized to control RNA biology transcriptome&#8208;wide. Within this review, we outline the recent advancements in chemical probe design for interrogating RNA structures inside cells and discuss the recent advances in our understanding of RNA biology through the lens of chemical probing.

         <title>Intrinsic Fluorescence of the Active and the Inactive Functional Forms of Human Thymidylate Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The observables associated with protein intrinsic fluorescence &#8208; spectra, time decays, anisotropies &#8208; offer opportunities to monitor in real time and non&#8208;invasively a protein functional form and its interchange with other forms with different functions. We employ these observables to sketch the fluorometric profiles of two functional forms of human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a homodimeric enzyme crucial for cell proliferation and thus targeted by anticancer drugs. The protein takes an active and an inactive forms. Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate&#160;the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylphosphonate&#8208;tethered porphyrins: Fluorescence silencing speaks a metal language in living enterocytes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the application of a highly versatile and engineerable novel sensor platform to monitor biologically significant and toxic metal ions in live human Caco&#8208;2 enterocytes. The extended conjugation between the fluorescent porphyrin core and metal ions via aromatic phenylphosphonic acid tethers generates a unique turn off and turn on fluorescence and, in addition, shifts in absorption and emission spectra for zinc, cobalt, cadmium and mercury. The reported fluorescent probes p&#8208;H 8 TPPA and m&#8208;H 8 TPPA can monitor a wide range of metal ion concentrations via fluorescence titration and also via fluorescence decay curves. Cu and Zn&#8208;induced turn off fluorescence can be differentially reversed by the addition of common chelators. Both p&#8208;H 8 TPPA and m&#8208;H 8 TPPA readily pass the mammalian cellular membrane due to their amphipathic character as confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging of living enterocytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Probes for Photoaffinity Labeling of Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for photoaffinity labeling of kinases represent important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several application areas of these probes, which include identification of targets and off&#8208;targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, development of inhibitor screening assays, imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.</dc:description>

The review provides the requisites and implications of mutually exclusive or simultaneous formation of G&#8208;Quadruplex and i&#8208;motif structures in human genome. The comprehensive discussion on the spatiotemporal formation of G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif structures gives the insight on their integrated effect in gene&#8208;regulatory functions and cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
G&#8208;Quadruplex (GQ) and i&#8208;motif structures are the paradigmatic examples of nonclassical tetrastranded nucleic acids having multifarious biological functions and widespread applications in therapeutics and material science. Recently, tetraplexes emerged as promising anticancer targets due to their structural robustness, gene&#8208;regulatory roles, and predominant distribution at specific loci of oncogenes. However, it is arguable whether the i&#8208;motif evolves in the complementary single&#8208;stranded region after GQ formation in its opposite strand and vice versa. In this review, we address the prerequisites and significance of the simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive formation of GQ and i&#8208;motif structures at complementary and sequential positions in duplexes in the cellular milieu. We discussed how their dynamic interplay Sets up cellular homeostasis and exacerbates carcinogenesis. The review gives insights into the spatiotemporal formation of GQ and i&#8208;motifs that could be harnessed to design different types of reporter systems and diagnostic platforms for potential bioanalytical and therapeutic intervention.

&lt;p&gt;G&#8208;Quadruplex (GQ) and i&#8208;motif structures are the paradigmatic examples of nonclassical tetrastranded nucleic acids having multifarious biological functions and widespread applications in therapeutics and material science. Recently, tetraplexes emerged as promising anticancer targets due to their structural robustness, gene&#8208;regulatory roles, and predominant distribution at specific loci of oncogenes. However, it is arguable whether the i&#8208;motif evolves in the complementary single&#8208;stranded region after GQ formation in its opposite strand and vice versa. In this review, we address the prerequisites and significance of the simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive formation of GQ and i&#8208;motif structures at complementary and sequential positions in duplexes in the cellular milieu. We discussed how their dynamic interplay Sets up cellular homeostasis and exacerbates carcinogenesis. The review gives insights into the spatiotemporal formation of GQ and i&#8208;motifs that could be harnessed to design different types of reporter systems and diagnostic platforms for potential bioanalytical and therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>N3&#8208;Kethoxal&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Intracellular RNA Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small, membrane&#8208;permeable probe N3&#8208;kethoxal has low toxicity and highly selectivity for reaction with guanine allowing it to introduce azido groups into RNA within a cellular environment. This N3K&#8208;assisted bioorthogonal intracellular RNA strategy provides a great prospect for in&#8197;vivo RNA labeling to develop various RNA tools for RNA functional research.







Abstract
There is growing interest in developing intracellular RNA tools. Herein, we describe a strategy for N3&#8208;kethoxal (N3K)&#8208;based bioorthogonal intracellular RNA functionalization. With N3K labeling followed by an in&#8197;vivo click reaction with DBCO derivatives, RNA can be modified with fluorescent or phenol groups. This strategy provides a new way of labeling RNA inside cells.

         <title>Ligand Induced CuII Transport Restricts Cancer and Mycobacterial Growth: Towards a Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Select Ion Channel Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hole in more than one: A peptide scaffold with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII across simple and complex lipid membranes. The peptide forms stables pores in the membranes and transports ions by an antiport mechanism. Such peptides could facilitate Cu transport across mycobacterial or cancer cell membranes as an effective anti&#8208;infective strategy or to induce cell death.







Abstract
Synthetic channels with high ion selectivity are attractive drug targets for diseases involving ion dysregulation. Achieving selective transport of divalent ions is highly challenging due their high hydration energies. A small tripeptide amphiphilic scaffold installed with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII ions across membranes. The peptide forms stable dimeric pores in the membrane and transports ions by a Cu2+/H+ antiport mechanism. The ligand&#8208;induced excellent CuII selectivity as well as high membrane permeability of the peptide is exploited to promote cancer cell death. The peptide's ability to restrict mycobacterial growth serves as seeds to evolve antibacterial strategies centred on selectively modulating ion homeostasis in pathogens. This simple peptide can potentially function as a universal, yet versatile, scaffold wherein the ion selectivity can be precisely controlled by modifying the ligand at the C terminus.

         <title>Peptide Vectors Carry Pyrene to Cell Organelles Allowing Real&#8208;Time Quantification of Free Radicals in Mitochondria by Time&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On and off ROS formation detected. Two pyrene butyric acid isomers, and their respective derivatives produced by grafting them onto a peptide vector, demonstrated outstanding real&#8208;time quantification of intracellular and mitochondrial free radicals and oxygen. The four fluorescent probes work well inside living cells for detection by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time quantification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (ROS) in cells is of paramount importance as they are essential for cellular functions. Their excessive formation contributes to the dysfunction of cells and organisms, ultimately leading to cell death. As ROS are mostly produced in the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time&#8208;resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non&#8208;radical species such as H2O2.

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Alkylating Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamides for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be specific! We review the recent research on DNA&#8208;alkylating pyrrole&#8208;imidazole (PI) polyamides that show sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activity. Their application to targeting cancer&#8208;related sequences, such as human telomere repeat sequences, KRAS mutated sequences and RUNX binding sequences, are described to show the possibility of these conjugates as chemotherapeutic drugs.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole (PI) polyamides, which target specific DNA sequences, have been studied as a class of DNA minor&#8208;groove&#8208;binding molecules. To investigate the potential of compounds for cancer treatment, PI polyamides were conjugated with DNA&#8208;alkylating agents, such as seco&#8208;CBI and chlorambucil. DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides have attracted attention because of their sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activities, which contribute to reducing the severe side effects of current DNA&#8208;damaging drugs. Many of these types of conjugates have been developed as new candidates for anticancer drugs. Herein, we review recent progress into research on DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides and their sequence&#8208;specific action on targets associated with cancer development.

         <title>Use of Copper as a Trigger for the in Vivo Activity of E. coli Laccase CueO: A Simple Tool for Biosynthetic Purposes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient: The endogenous E. coli laccase CueO was activated by the addition of copper ions to cells, which were subsequently used for oxidative phenolic coupling. As a proof of concept, CueO&#8208;catalyzed dimerization of coniferyl alcohol was integrated into a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade in E. coli to produce the plant lignan (&#8722;)&#8208;matairesinol.







Abstract
Laccases are multi&#8208;copper oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of various electron&#8208;rich substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The multi&#8208;copper oxidase/laccase CueO of Escherichia coli is responsible for the oxidation of Cu+ to the less harmful Cu2+ in the periplasm. CueO has a relatively broad substrate spectrum as laccase, and its activity is enhanced by copper excess. The aim of this study was to trigger CueO activity in&#8197;vivo for the use in biocatalysis. The addition of 5&#8197;mM CuSO4 was proven effective in triggering CueO activity at need with minor toxic effects on E. coli cells. Cu&#8208;treated E. coli cells were able to convert several phenolic compounds to the corresponding dimers. Finally, the endogenous CueO activity was applied to a four&#8208;step cascade, in which coniferyl alcohol was converted to the valuable plant lignan (&#8722;)&#8208;matairesinol.

         <title>Efficient Incorporation of Clickable Unnatural Amino Acids Enables Rapid and Biocompatible Labeling of Proteins in Vitro and in Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All about the numbers: We report the evolution of translation machinery for incorporation of an alkyne&#8208;bearing unnatural amino acid (uAA) into proteins, and show that it enables efficient multisite uAA incorporation in recoded and wild&#8208;type bacteria. Using this approach, we demonstrate rapid and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of uAA&#8208;containing elastin&#8208;like polypeptides.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) bearing a bioorthogonal group has enabled the attachment &#8211; typically at a single site or at a few sites per protein &#8211; of chemical groups at precise locations for protein and biomaterial labeling, conjugation, and functionalization. Herein, we report the evolution of chromosomal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the alkyne&#8208;bearing uAA, 4&#8208;propargyloxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pPR), with &#8764;30&#8208;fold increased production of green fluorescent protein containing three instances of pPR compared with a previously described M. jannaschii&#8208;derived aaRS for pPR, when expressed from a single chromosomal copy. We show that when expressed from multicopy plasmids, the evolved aaRSs enable the production &#8211; using a genomically recoded Escherichia coli and the non&#8208;recoded BL21 E. coli strain &#8211; of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) containing multiple pPR residues in high yields. We further show that the multisite incorporation of pPR in ELPs facilitates the rapid, robust, and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of these proteins in bacteria. The evolved variants described in this work can be used to produce a variety of protein and biomaterial conjugates and to create efficient minimal tags for protein labeling.

         <title>Subcellular Localisation of a Quinoline&#8208;Containing Fluorescent Cyclometallated IrIII Complex in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lighting the way: We have explored the subcellular localisation of an antimalarial hybrid quinoline&#8208;triazole cyclometallated iridium(III) complex containing an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore, with a view to gaining insight into a possible mechanism of action of antimalarials exemplified by this structure.







Abstract
A fluorescent analogue of a previously synthesised N,N&#8208;chelated IrIII complex was prepared by coordination of the organic ligand to an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore. This cyclometallated IrIII complex in itself displays good, micromolar activity against the chloroquine&#8208;sensitive NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy found negligible localisation of the fluorescent complex within the digestive vacuole of the parasite. This eliminated the haem detoxification pathway as a potential mechanism of action. Similarly, no localisation of the complex within the parasitic nucleus was found, thus suggesting that this complex probably does not interfere with the DNA replication process. A substantial saturation of fluorescence from the complex was found near phospholipid structures such as the plasma and nuclear membranes but not in neutral lipid bodies. This indicates that an association with these membranes, or organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or branched mitochondrion, could be essential to the efficacies of these types of antimalarial compounds.

         <title>A reconstructed common ancestor of the fatty acid photodecarboxylase clade shows photodecarboxylation activity and increased thermostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520 nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose&#8208;methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photodecarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15 &#176;C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12&#8208;fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photodecarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Sortases in Peptide and Protein Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorting out sortases: The bacterial transpeptidase sortase A has entered center stage as a versatile tool for protein bioconjugation and semisynthesis. Sortase A of Staphylococcus is widely used, but suffers from slow kinetics and a narrow specificity profile. Recent protein engineering campaigns aiming to improve these shortcomings have been successful and delivered enhanced sortase mutants with enhanced catalytic properties.







Abstract
The transpeptidase sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa&#8208;SrtA) is a valuable tool in protein chemistry. The native enzyme anchors surface proteins containing a highly conserved LPxTG sorting motif to a terminal glycine residue of the peptidoglycan layer in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This reaction is exploited for sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML), allowing the site&#8208;specific linkage of synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins by a native peptide bond. However, the moderate catalytic efficiency and specificity of Sa&#8208;SrtA fueled the development of new biocatalysts for SML, including the screening of sortase A variants form microorganisms other than S. aureus and the directed protein evolution of the Sa&#8208;SrtA enzyme itself. Novel display platforms and screening formats were developed to isolate sortases with altered properties from mutant libraries. This yielded sortases with strongly enhanced catalytic activity and enzymes recognizing new sorting motifs as substrates. This minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of directed sortase evolution and applications of these tailor&#8208;made enzymes in biochemistry.

         <title>Tuning the transglycosylation reaction of a GH11 xylanase by a delicate enhancement of its thumb flexibility</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoside hydrolases (GH) are attractive tools for multiple biotechnological applications. In conjunction with their hydrolytic function, GH can perform transglycosylation reaction under specific conditions. In nature, oligosaccharides synthesis is performed by glycosyltransferase (GT). However, the industrial utilization of GT is limited by their instability in solution. A key difference between GT and GH is the flexibility of their binding sites architecture. In this report, we used the xylanase from&#160;  Bacillus circulans  &#160;(BCX) to study the interplay between active site flexibility and the transglycosylation reaction. Residues of the BCX thumb were substituted to increase the flexibility of the enzyme binding site. Replacement of the highly conserved residue P116 with glycine shifted the balance of the BCX enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation. The effects of this point mutation on the structure and dynamics of BCX were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The P116G mutation induces subtle changes in the configuration of the thumb and enhances the millisecond dynamics of the active site. Based on our findings, we propose the remodeling of the GH enzymes glycon site flexibility as a strategy to improve the transglycosylation efficiency of these biotechnologically important catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a soluble, active form for in vitro applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature, that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over&#8208;reduction towards the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Herein, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum ( No CAR) was optimized by a combination of ( i ) optimized cultivation conditions, ( ii ) post&#8208;translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and ( iii ) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of E.coli Tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110&#8208;fold increase of the specific activity of No CAR. This highly active No CAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde and it was successfully assembled with an in vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30 mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2&#160;h of reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Genomic and Targeted Approaches Unveil the Cell Membrane as a Major Target of the Antifungal Cytotoxin Amantelide A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amantelide A, a polyhydroxylated macrolide isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, displayed broad&#8208;spectrum activity against mammalian cells, bacterial pathogens and marine fungi. We conducted comprehensive mechanistic studies to identify the molecular targets and pathways affected by amantelide A. Our investigations relied on chemical structure similarities with compounds of known mechanisms, yeast knockout mutants, yeast chemogenomic profiling, and direct biochemical and biophysical methods. We established that amantelide A exerts its antifungal action via binding to ergosterol&#8208;containing membranes followed by pore formation and cell death, a mechanism partially shared with polyene antifungals. Binding assays demonstrated that amantelide A also binds to membranes containing epicholesterol or mammalian cholesterol, suggesting that the cytotoxicity to mammalian cells might be due to its affinity to cholesterol&#8208;containing membranes. However, membrane interactions were not completely dependent on sterols. Yeast chemogenomic profiling suggested additional direct or indirect effects on actin. Actin polymerization assays suggested that amantelide A also promotes actin polymerization in cell&#8208;free systems. However, the C&#8208;33 acetoxy derivative amantelide B showed similar effect on actin dynamics in vitro but no significant activity against yeast. Overall, these studies suggest that the membrane effects are the most functionally relevant interactions for the mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Malic Enzyme Variants Favoring a Non&#8208;natural Redox Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Implementation of nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD), a biocompatible nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) analogue, is of great scientific and biotechnological interest. Several redox enzymes have been devised to favor NCD, and have been successfully applied in creating NCD&#8208;dependent redox systems. However, molecular interactions between cofactor and protein remain to be disclosed to guide further engineering efforts. Here we report the structural analysis of an  Escherichia coli  derived NCD&#8208;favoring malic enzyme (ME) variant. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure data revealed that the residues located at position 346 and 401 in ME acted as the &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; of the adenine moiety binding cavity. When Arg346 was substituted with either acidic or aromatic residues, the corresponding mutants showed substantially reduced NCD preference. Inspired by these observations, we generated  Lactobacillus helveticus  derived D&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase variants at Ile177, the counterpart of Arg346 in ME, and found a similar trend in terms of cofactor preference changes. As many NAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases share key structural features, our results provide guidance for protein engineering to obtain more NCD&#8208;favoring variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Prelabeling Expansion Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy with Minimal Linkage Error</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping it all together: Single&#8208;molecule expansion microscopy can reach a resolution on the molecular scale that is challenged by labeling density and linkage error. We introduce a biotinylizable peptide tag and gel&#8208;linkable fluorescent streptavidin that enable a fixed 5&#8208;nm linkage between a fluorophore and a protein of interest in a cell.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy combined with single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (ExSMLM) has a potential for approaching molecular resolution. However, ExSMLM faces multiple challenges such as loss of fluorophores and proteins during polymerization, digestion or denaturation, and an increase in linkage error arising from the distance between the fluorophore and the target molecule. Here, we introduce a trifunctional streptavidin to link the target, fluorophore and gel matrix via a biotinylizable peptide tag. The resultant ExSMLM images of vimentin filaments demonstrated high labeling efficiency and a minimal linkage error of &#8764;5&#8197;nm. Our ExSMLM provides a simple and practical means for fluorescence imaging with molecular resolution.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Semi&#8208;synthesis Enables Efficient Production of Isotopically Labeled &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Site&#8208;Specific Tyrosine Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies for producing &#945;&#8208;synuclein phosphorylated at Tyr39 (&#945;S&#8208;pY39) are compared, and the value of a chemoenzymatic strategy with one&#8208;pot ligation is demonstrated, in particular for producing 15N&#8208;labeled protein for NMR studies.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) can affect the normal function and pathology of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S), an amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;forming protein linked to Parkinson's disease. Phosphorylation of &#945;S Tyr39 has recently been found to display a dose&#8208;dependent effect on fibril formation kinetics and to alter the morphology of the fibrils. Existing methods to access site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated &#945;S for biochemical studies include total or semi&#8208;synthesis by native chemical ligation (NCL) as well as chemoenzymatic methods to phosphorylate peptides, followed by NCL. Here, we investigated a streamlined method to produce large quantities of phosphorylated &#945;S by co&#8208;expressing a kinase with a protein fragment in Escherichia coli. We also introduced the use of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) to enable one&#8208;pot NCL and desulfurization. We compare our optimized methods to previous reports and show that we can achieve the highest yields of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated protein through chemoenzymatic methods using MTG, and that our strategy is uniquely well suited to producing 15N&#8208;labeled, phosphorylated protein for NMR studies.

         <title>Targeting the Surface of the Protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 by Ultrasmall (1.5&#8197;nm) Gold Nanoparticles Carrying the Specific Peptide CRaf</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny, but targeted: The protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 is targeted by 18 CRaf peptide ligands on the surface of an ultrasmall gold nanoparticle (ca. 115 gold atoms). ITC and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy demonstrate an efficient supramolecular binding between nanoparticle and protein. The easy uptake of nanoparticles by cells opens up the possibility of targeting proteins inside cells.







Abstract
The surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.55&#8197;nm was conjugated with a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;binding peptide derived from CRaf. Each particle carries 18 CRaf peptides, leading to an overall stoichiometry of Au(115)Craf(18). The binding to the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 was probed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy (FP). The dissociation constant (KD) was measured as 5.0&#8197;&#956;M by ITC and 0.9&#8197;&#956;M by FP, which was close to the affinity of dissolved CRaf to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963;. In contrast to dissolved CRaf, which alone did not enter HeLa cells, CRAF&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles were well taken up by HeLa cells, opening the opportunity to target the protein inside a cell.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter&#8208;Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper&#8208;Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going for the triple: Copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from the remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer from Glu113 to an intermediate H2O or from Lys128 to His260.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide; key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron&#8208;/proton&#8208;transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Going for the triple&lt;/b&gt;: Copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from the remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer from Glu113 to an intermediate H2O or from Lys128 to His260.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide; key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron&#8208;/proton&#8208;transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton&#8208;transfer channels, the high&#8208;pH proton channel and the primary proton channel, by using two&#8208;layered ONIOM calculations. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanism. In the high&#8208;pH proton channel, the water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel, the transfer is from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton&#8208;transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase and could extend our understanding of the diverse proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms in complicated proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis of Selenoproteins in High Yield and Purity for Selective Protein Tagging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
34Se&#8208;lective protein tagging: Cell&#8208;free protein synthesis is used to produce selenoproteins in high yield and purity. Selenocysteine has long been recognized as offering an exquisitely reactive chemical handle for chemical modifications of proteins, and we show that the alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenol groups with a chloro&#8208;alkyl group proceeds quickly under conditions that leaves cysteine residues unchanged.







Abstract
The selenol group of selenocysteine is much more nucleophilic than the thiol group of cysteine. Selenocysteine residues in proteins thus offer reactive points for rapid post&#8208;translational modification. Herein, we show that selenoproteins can be expressed in high yield and purity by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis by global substitution of cysteine by selenocysteine. Complete alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenocysteine residues was achieved in 10 minutes with 4&#8208;chloromethylene dipicolinic acid (4Cl&#8208;MDPA) under conditions that left cysteine residues unchanged even after overnight incubation. GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured by double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments of maltose binding protein (MBP) containing two selenocysteine residues tagged with 4Cl&#8208;MDPA&#8208;GdIII were indistinguishable from GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured of MBP containing cysteine reacted with 4Br&#8208;MDPA tags.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage hydrocarbon conjugation and cyclization in synthetic peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine relies upon using activated electrophiles. Here we demonstrate high yielding and selective S&#8208;alkylation and S&#8208;lipidation of cysteines in unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins using weak electrophiles and a Zn2+ promoter. Linear or branched iodoalkanes can S&#8208;alkylate cysteine in an unprotected 38&#8208;residue Myc peptide fragment and in a 91&#8208;residue mini&#8208;protein Omomyc, highlighting selective late&#8208;stage synthetic modifications. Metal&#8208;assisted cysteine alkylation is also effective for incorporating dehydroalanine into unprotected peptides and for peptide cyclization via aliphatic thioether&#8208;crosslinks, including customising macrocycles to stabilize helical peptides for enhanced uptake and delivery to proteins inside cells. Chemoselective and efficient late&#8208;stage Zn2+&#8208;promoted cysteine alkylation in unprotected peptides and proteins promises many useful applications.</dc:description>

Amongst the various three&#8208;dimensional assemblies, DNA tetrahedra are of particular interest as these structures have been shown to be readily taken up by the cell without the need for transfecting agents via the process of caveolin mediated endocytosis. Moreover, these structures can be readily modified with a diverse range of pendant groups to confer greater functionality. This minireview highlights recent examples of advances related to applications of this interesting DNA structure including the delivery of therapeutic agents ranging from small molecules to oligonucleotides in addition to its utilization for sensing and imaging of various species within the cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed phenoxy radical biotinylation, an increasingly important tool in biotechnology and molecular biology applications, is here shown to label guanosine bases in RNA, but not in DNA, under defined conditions. Remarkably, common fluorescein conjugates of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides are found to undergo facile biotinylation on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence. This convenient observation points to a variety of practical applications of peroxidase&#8208;catalyzed chemistry for analysis of DNA conjugates in vitro and in cells.







Abstract
Recent advances in peroxidase&#8208;mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high&#8208;resolution and subcellular compartment&#8208;specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence&#8208;independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.

         <title>The Peculiar Case of the Hyper&#8208;thermostable Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What? The pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is an outlier among its peers. The enzyme is extremely stable and performs remarkably well in near&#8208;boiling, cosolvent&#8208;heavy media, but an apparent inhibition by nucleobases renders its performance in preparative applications rather subpar.







Abstract
The poor solubility of many nucleosides and nucleobases in aqueous solution demands harsh reaction conditions (base, heat, cosolvent) in nucleoside phosphorylase&#8208;catalyzed processes to facilitate substrate loading beyond the low millimolar range. This, in turn, requires enzymes that can withstand these conditions. Herein, we report that the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is active over an exceptionally broad pH (4&#8211;10), temperature (up to 100&#8201;&#176;C) and cosolvent space (up to 80&#8201;% (v/v) nonaqueous medium), and displays tremendous stability under harsh reaction conditions with predicted total turnover numbers of more than 106 for various pyrimidine nucleosides. However, its use as a biocatalyst for preparative applications is critically limited due to its inhibition by nucleobases at low concentrations, which is unprecedented among nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases.

         <title>Chemical Labeling of Protein 4&#8242;&#8208;Phosphopantetheinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally diverse chemical probes have been used to label protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation. Herein, we review how CoA analogs could be incorporated by highly promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) and used for in&#8197;situ labeling of the membrane proteins fused with acceptor tags. These cell&#8208;permeable pantetheine analogs facilitated the metabolic labeling of the endogenous substrates in both bacterial and mammalian cells.







Abstract
Nature uses a diverse array of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) to regulate protein structure, activity, localization, and function. Among them, protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation derived from coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential PTM for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To explore its functions, various chemical probes mimicking the natural structure of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation have been developed. In this minireview, we summarize these chemical probes and describe their applications in direct and metabolic labeling of proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells.

         <title>Effect of methionine sulfoxide on the synthesis and purification of aggregation&#8208;prone peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step synthesis for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation&#8208;prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields of the crude peptide with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine&#8208;rich Tar&#8208;DNA&#8208;binding protein 43 (307&#8208;347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated with the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation&#8208;prone peptides from the human prion protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophosphonates on&#8208;Demand: A General and Simplified Approach Toward Fluorophosphonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a general and simplified synthesis of fluorophosphonates directly from p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. This FP on&#8208;Demand reaction is mediated by a commercially available polymer&#8208;supported fluoride reagent, which produces a variety (25 examples) of fluorophosphonates in high yields while only requiring reagent filtration for pure fluorophosphonate isolation. This reaction protocol facilitates rapid profiling of serine hydrolases with diverse and novel sets of activated phosphonates with differential proteome reactivity. Moreover, slight modification of the procedure into&#160;a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay format has enabled additional screening efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Assay for the Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide by Estimating Enzyme Promiscuous Activity in the Perhydrolysis Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For availability and atom economy, hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant. Due to its diverse roles, the lack of a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed an efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide based on enzyme promiscuity with p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters as substrates.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in view of its availability, atom economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling physiological processes, but its unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to preventing the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide with the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the formation of peracid. To our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting hydrogen peroxide in aqueous media.

         <title>Targeting TRIM Proteins: A quest towards drugging an emerging protein class</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitination machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signalling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named Tri&#8208;Partite Motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein&#8208;protein interactions, whose multi&#8208;domains and adapter&#8208;like nature make their druggability very challenging. Here we report an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.</dc:description>

         <title>An Economical High&#8208;Throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; Assay for Screening Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High performance, low cost: A wash&#8208;free, low&#8208;cost fluorescent&#8208;polarization&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput assay has been developed for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase. Such an assay is &#8220;catalytic&#8221;, thus only needing minimal amounts of enzymes and could potentially identify inhibitors targeting both the acceptor and donor binding&#8208;sites.







Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is involved in many cellular processes, and selective OGT inhibitors are valuable tools to investigate O&#8208;GlcNAcylation functions, and could potentially lead to therapeutics. However, high&#8208;throughput OGT assays that are suitable for large&#8208;scale HTS and can identify inhibitors targeting both acceptor, donor sites, and allosteric binding&#8208;sites are still lacking. Here, we report the development of a high&#8208;throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; OGT assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a low&#8208;cost and superior &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221;. With this assay, 2&#8208;methyleurotinone was identified as a low&#8208;micromolar OGT inhibitor. This type of assay with BSA as &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; would find more applications with other glycosyltransferases.

         <title>NOVEL PET&#8208;DEGRADING ENZYMES: STRUCTURE&#8208;FUNCTION FROM A COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bacterium strain  Ideonella sakaiensis  201&#8208;F6 is able to hydrolyze low&#8208;crystallinity PET films a 30&#176;C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to the elucidation of the structure and features of those two enzymes and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure, in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts with the purpose to make it more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, strategies adopted by different research groups to deeply investigate the structure and the functionality on both PETase and MHETase are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by  Ideonella sakaiensis  enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging to prioritize the efforts in this prolific research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand binding to dynamically populated G&#8208;quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several small molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered as promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures with varying stability and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA, using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 and a combination of single&#8208;molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopy. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre&#8208;folded G4 structures and that Phen&#8208;DC3 also induces G4 folding from unfolded single&#8208;strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions, which do not involve direct ligand&#8208;induced G4 conformational interconversion. In contrast, the redistribution is driven by ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short&#8208;lived conformational states. Thus, ligand&#8208;induced stabilization does not necessarily require initial presence of stably folded G4s.</dc:description>

         <title>Trypsiligase&#8208;Catalyzed Labeling of Proteins on Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent fusion proteins: Herein, we describe a biocatalytic approach for the site&#8208;specific bioconjugation of cell&#8208;surface bound proteins by trypsiligase. The reactions are fast, irreversible, without side reactions and completely nontoxic to living cells. Importantly, recognition of the target membrane protein by trypsiligase only requires the introduction of a simple dipeptide sequence at its N terminus.







Abstract
Fluorescent fusion proteins are powerful tools for studying biological processes in living cells, but universal application is limited due to the voluminous size of those tags, which might have an impact on the folding, localization or even the biological function of the target protein. The designed biocatalyst trypsiligase enables site&#8208;directed linkage of small&#8208;sized fluorescence dyes on the N&#8197;terminus of integral target proteins located in the outer membrane of living cells through a stable native peptide bond. The function of the approach was tested by using the examples of covalent derivatization of the transmembrane proteins CD147 as well as the EGF receptor, both presented on human HeLa cells. Specific trypsiligase recognition of the site of linkage was mediated by the dipeptide sequence Arg&#8208;His added to the proteins&#8217; native N&#8197;termini, pointing outside the cell membrane. The labeling procedure takes only about 5 minutes, as demonstrated for couplings of the fluorescence dye tetramethyl rhodamine and the affinity label biotin as well.

         <title>Artificial organelles: towards adding or restoring intracellular activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization is one of the main characteristics that defines living systems. Creating a physically separated microenvironment allows nature a better control over biological processes, as is clearly specified by the role of organelles in living cells. Inspired by this phenomenon, researchers have developed a range of different approaches to create artificial organelles; compartments with catalytic activity that add new function to living cells.&#160; In this review we will discuss three complementary lines of investigation. First, orthogonal chemistry approaches are discussed which are based on the incorporation of catalytically active transition metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles in living cells. The second approach involves the usage of premade hybrid nanoreactors which show transient function when taken up by living cells. The third approach utilizes mostly genetic engineering methods to create bio&#8208;based structures that can be ultimately integrated with the cell&#8217;s genome to make them constitutively active. The current state of the art and the scope and limitations of the field will be highlighted with selected examples from the three approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography purification of peptides and chemically modified insulins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparative reversed&#8208;phase HPLC is the established method for purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium&#8208;length, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to a final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including choice of columns, eluents, and gradients. We believe that HPFC is a valuable alternative to HPLC purification of peptides and small proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;occurring congeners reveal the position of enantiomeric amino acids in nonribosomal peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#945; absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined using Marfey&#8217;s method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A structural elucidation challenge arises when both D/L&#8208; enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are encountered. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even the total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality which governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The information on configuration provided by Marfey&#8217;s analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners can reveal unequivocally the stereochemical sequence of the whole peptide family</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for the Directed Evolution of Hydroxynitrile Lyase towards Cyanohydrin Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making biohydrocyanation measurable: Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyze the enantioselective cleavage/formation of cyanohydrins. However, current methods for determining hydrocyanation are not suitable for mass screening of mutants for protein engineering of these biocatalysts. We demonstrate herein a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening method for cyanohydrin synthesis that is validated by either substrate profiling or the directed evolution of HNLs.







Abstract
Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. However, currently available methods for demonstrating hydrocyanation are still stalled at precise, but low&#8208;throughput, GC or HPLC analyses. Herein, we report a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method that is feasible for the cyanohydrin synthesis reaction. This method was highly anti&#8208;interference and sensitive, and could be used to directly profile the substrate scope of HNLs either in cell&#8208;free extract or fermentation clear broth. This HTS method was also validated by generating new variants of PcHNL5 that presented higher catalytic efficiency and stronger acidic tolerance in variant libraries.

A cool look at hot spots: A review of different intracellular thermometry techniques reveals the multidisciplinary approaches within the field. Recent developments have made these promising tools for biological studies, including the potential to investigate the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) aggregation, a prevailing characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract
Temperature is a fundamental physical parameter that influences biological processes in living cells. Hence, intracellular temperature mapping can be used to derive useful information reflective of thermodynamic properties and cellular behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A cool look at hot spots&lt;/b&gt;: A review of different intracellular thermometry techniques reveals the multidisciplinary approaches within the field. Recent developments have made these promising tools for biological studies, including the potential to investigate the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) aggregation, a prevailing characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature is a fundamental physical parameter that influences biological processes in living cells. Hence, intracellular temperature mapping can be used to derive useful information reflective of thermodynamic properties and cellular behaviour. Herein, existing publications on different thermometry systems, focusing on those that employ fluorescence&#8208;based techniques, are reviewed. From developments based on fluorescent proteins and inorganic molecules to metal nanoclusters and fluorescent polymers, the general findings of intracellular measurements from different research groups are discussed. Furthermore, the contradiction of mitochondrial thermogenesis and nuclear&#8208;cytoplasmic temperature differences to current thermodynamic understanding are highlighted. Lastly, intracellular thermometry is proposed as a tool to quantify the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid&#8208;&#946;42 (A&#946;42) aggregation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isopenicillin N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron oxidase (NHIO) which catalyses cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(  l  &#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;  l  &#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;  d  &#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin N (IPN). Over the last 25 years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of iron at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme&#8208;substrate complex IPNS&#8208;Fe&#8208;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co&#8208;substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover  in crystallo  . In this way, X&#8208;ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution&#8208;phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have in turn informed computational experiments which have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Bridged Somatostatin Hybrid Probe for Multimodal SSTR2 Imaging in Vitro and in Vivo: Synthesis and Evaluation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional cyanine dyes: Multimodal imaging agents can be built up based on an asymmetric cyanine dye connecting the radionuclide and targeting unit. Insertion of a cyanine dye into the clinically approved radiopharmaceutical 68Ga&#8208;DOTATATE allowed the identification of cancer tissue in&#8197;vivo and ex vivo by using radionuclear and fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging probes have attracted the interest of ongoing research, for example, for the surgical removal of tumors. Modular synthesis approaches allow the construction of hybrid probes consisting of a radiotracer, a fluorophore and a targeting unit. We present the synthesis of a new asymmetric bifunctional cyanine dye that can be used as a structural and functional linker for the construction of such hybrid probes. 68Ga&#8208;DOTATATE, a well&#8208;characterized radiopeptide targeting the overexpressed somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) in neuroendocrine tumors, was labeled with our cyanine dye, thus providing additional information along with the data obtained from the radiotracer. We tested the SSTR2&#8208;targeting and imaging properties of the resulting probe 68Ga&#8208;DOTA&#8208;ICC&#8208;TATE in&#8197;vitro and in a tumor xenograft mouse model. Despite the close proximity between dye and pharmacophore, we observed a high binding affinity towards SSTR2 as well as elevated uptake in SSTR2&#8208;overexpressing tumors in the positron emission tomography (PET) scan and histological examination.

         <title>Pyrene Tags for the Detection of Carbohydrates by Label&#8208;Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Mass Spectrometry**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Gie it LALDI! The derivatisation of (bio)molecules with laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancers allows their selective detection by label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI&#8208;MS). We have developed and characterised pyrene&#8208;based LDI enhancers (LALDI tags) for the labelling and LALDI&#8208;MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates, highlighting the compatibility of LALDI&#8208;MS with complex biological samples.







Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) is widely used for the analysis of biomolecules. Label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI&#8208;MS) is a matrix&#8208;free variant of MALDI&#8208;MS, in which only analytes covalently attached to a laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancer are detected. LALDI&#8208;MS has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of MALDI&#8208;MS in terms of sample preparation and MS analysis. In this work, we have developed a series of pyrene&#8208;based LDI reagents (LALDI tags) that can be used for labelling and LALDI&#8208;MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates from complex (biological) samples without the need for additional chemical derivatisation or purification. We have systematically explored the suitability of four pyrene&#8208;based LDI enhancers and three aldehyde&#8208;reactive handles, optimised sample preparation, and demonstrated the use of LALDI tags for the detection of lactose. We have also exemplified the potential of LALDI tags for labelling carbohydrates in biological samples by direct detection of lactose in cow's milk. These results demonstrate that LALDI&#8208;MS is a promising technique for the analysis of reducing carbohydrates in biological samples, and pave the way for the development of LALDI&#8208;MS for glycomics and diagnostics.

         <title>Release of Soybean Isoflavones by Using a &#946;&#8208;Glucosidase from Alicyclobacillus herbarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough guy: Enzymatic characterisation showed that a &#946;&#8208;glycosidase from Alicyclobacillus herbarius was stable over a broad range of pH values and temperatures, also exhibiting excellent tolerance to sugars and organic solvents, specially to ethanol. The enzyme was applied in the hydrolysis of isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour with outstanding results.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Glucosidases are used in the food industry to hydrolyse glycosidic bonds in complex sugars, with enzymes sourced from extremophiles better able to tolerate the process conditions. In this work, a novel &#946;&#8208;glycosidase from the acidophilic organism Alicyclobacillus herbarius was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). AheGH1 was stable over a broad range of pH values (5&#8211;11) and temperatures (4&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C). The enzyme exhibited excellent tolerance to fructose and good tolerance to glucose, retaining 65&#8201;% activity in the presence of 10&#8201;% (w/v) glucose. It also tolerated organic solvents, some of which appeared to have a stimulating effect, in particular ethanol with a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in activity at 10&#8201;% (v/v). The enzyme was then applied for the cleavage of isoflavone from isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour, to produce soy isoflavones, which constitute a valuable food supplement, full conversion was achieved within 15&#8197;min at 30&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>How To Quantify a Genetic Firewall? A Polarity&#8208;Based Metric for Genetic Code Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying the distance: If two organisms operate under different genetic codes, how likely is that they could still properly interpret each other's genes? We introduce a versatile metric to quantify the distance between the different genetic codes. It can calculate the distance (dissimilarity) between genetic codes and can be applied with the 20 canonical but also noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Genetic code engineering aims to produce organisms that translate genetic information in a different way from that prescribed by the standard genetic code. This endeavor could eventually lead to genetic isolation, where an organism that operates under a different genetic code will not be able to transfer functional genes with other living species, thereby standing behind a genetic firewall. It is not clear however, how distinct the code should be, or how to measure the distance. We have developed a metric (&#916;code) where we assigned polarity indices (clog&#8197;D7) to amino acids to calculate the distances between pairs of genetic codes. We then calculated the distance between a set of 204 genetic codes, including the 24 known distinct natural codes, 11 extreme&#8208;distance codes created computationally, nine theoretical special purpose codes from literature and 160 codes in which canonical amino acids were replaced by noncanonical chemical analogues. The metric can be used for building strategies towards creating semantically alienated organisms, and testing the strength of genetic firewalls. This metric provides the basis for a map of the genetic codes that could guide future efforts towards novel biochemical worlds, biosafety and deep barcoding applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantifying the distance&lt;/b&gt;: If two organisms operate under different genetic codes, how likely is that they could still properly interpret each other's genes? We introduce a versatile metric to quantify the distance between the different genetic codes. It can calculate the distance (dissimilarity) between genetic codes and can be applied with the 20 canonical but also noncanonical amino acids.

&lt;p&gt;Genetic code engineering aims to produce organisms that translate genetic information in a different way from that prescribed by the standard genetic code. This endeavor could eventually lead to genetic isolation, where an organism that operates under a different genetic code will not be able to transfer functional genes with other living species, thereby standing behind a genetic firewall. It is not clear however, how distinct the code should be, or how to measure the distance. We have developed a metric (&#916;&lt;sub&gt;code&lt;/sub&gt;) where we assigned polarity indices (clog&#8197;&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) to amino acids to calculate the distances between pairs of genetic codes. We then calculated the distance between a set of 204 genetic codes, including the 24 known distinct natural codes, 11 extreme&#8208;distance codes created computationally, nine theoretical special purpose codes from literature and 160 codes in which canonical amino acids were replaced by noncanonical chemical analogues. The metric can be used for building strategies towards creating semantically alienated organisms, and testing the strength of genetic firewalls.

         <title>Advanced Understanding of the Electron Transfer Pathway of Cytochrome P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile P450s catalyze various reactions upon acquiring electrons from redox partners. Electrons transferred from the cofactor to heme are of central importance to P450 action, but the route electrons travel remains unveiled. This issue might be probed under the guidance of recent structural studies of self&#8208;sufficient P450s.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s are heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that participate in carbon source assimilation, natural compound biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism in all kingdoms of life. P450s can catalyze various reactions by using a wide range of organic compounds, thus exhibiting great potential in biotechnological applications. The catalytic reactions of P450s are driven by electron equivalents that are sourced from pyridine nucleotides and delivered by cognate or matching redox partners (RPs). The electron transfer (ET) route from RPs to P450s involves one or more redox center&#8208;containing domains. As the rate of ET is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural studies of the two main types of self&#8208;sufficient P450 will also be summarized.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
