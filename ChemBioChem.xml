         <title>Characterization of ActVI&#8208;ORF3 and ActVI&#8208;ORF4 as Lactonizing and Delactonizing Enzymes in Relation to Metabolic Flux in Actinorhodin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is an aromatic polyketide antibiotic with a benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) skeleton. Although actVI&#8208;ORF3 and actVI&#8208;ORF4 are not&#160;essential for ACT biosynthesis, homologous genes to these are present in the biosynthetic gene clusters of BIQ lactones. In this study, ActVI&#8208;ORF3 was identified as a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme with lactonization activity, using ACT as a substrate. ActVI&#8208;ORF3 recognized dihydrokalafungin and 8&#8208;hydroxykalafafungin, which share the same pyran&#8208;ring configuration as ACT, but not nanaomycin A, which has an opposite configuration. In contrast, ActVI&#8208;ORF4 functioned as an NAD(P)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, catalyzing the delactonization of BIQ lactones. Conversion experiments using isotopically labeled compounds revealed that both lactonization and delactonization reactions of these enzymes yielded products in which the carboxyl oxygen at the C1 position was retained. Subsequently, we reexamined the accumulation of ACT&#8208;related compounds in the actVI&#8208;ORF3 and actVI&#8208;ORF&#8208;4 disruptants. The results suggested that ACT intermediates are predominantly pooled in the bacteria as (S)&#8208;DNPA rather than in lactone&#8208;form. The contribution of ActVI&#8208;ORF4 to metabolic flux is not significant, and endogenous reductases can convert these intermediates to the dihydro form, which subsequently&#160;re&#8208;enters the ACT biosynthetic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetically Encoded Fluorescent and Bioluminescent Probes for HDAC8</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based probes constructed via genetically encoding acetyl lysine (AcK) or its close analogs represent an important way to detect protein lysine deacetylases. Existing reported probes exhibit excellent sensitivity to NAD+&#8208;dependent sirtuins but lack responsiveness to Zn2+&#8208;dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs). Herein, we reformed the probe design by replacing the genetically encoded AcK with trifluoroacetyl lysine (TfAcK) and generated fluorescent and bioluminescent probes that could respond specifically to HDAC8 recombinantly expressed in E. coli and to endogenous HDACs in mammalian cells. We believe these probes would benefit the biological investigation of HDAC8 and promisingly some other HDACs, as well as the discovery of innovative HDAC inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8211;acceptor (perylenethienyl)ethylenes as singlet oxygen&#8208;photogenerating viral inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral drugs effective against a wide variety of viruses is of significant practical importance. Derivatives of perylene, a pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, demonstrate pronounced antiviral activity. These compounds primarily act as membrane&#8208;active singlet oxygen photogenerators, disrupting virions and inhibiting their fusion with a host cell membrane. Modifying the perylene core allows for chemical diversification of antiviral photosensitizers. Additionally, achieving a bathochromic shift in absorbance is crucial for effective treatment of superficial lesions, as it facilitates deeper tissue penetration of therapeutic light. In this work, donor&#8211;acceptor perylenylethylenes and (perylenethienyl)ethylenes were synthesized and evaluated for their spectral properties, singlet oxygen photogeneration and inhibition activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a representative enveloped virus. The incorporation of a thiophene unit into the molecule significantly enhanced both the singlet oxygen generation ability and the antiviral activity. These findings provide useful insights into the relationship between the structure, spectral/photochemical properties and biological activity of perylene&#8208;based photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Concept and Development of Metal&#8208;Framework Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing principle, precisely programmable metal framework nucleic acids (mFNA) have evolved from one&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale structures, a technological advancement attributed to progress in DNA nanotechnology.&#160;mFNA are a new type of nanomaterial formed by using FNAs as precise templates to guide the ordered assembly and self&#8208;assembly of metal ions, metal salts (such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, etc.), metal nanoclusters,&#160;metal nanoparticles, or metal oxide nanoparticles.&#160;Compared to traditional FNAs, mFNA not only inherits the powerful programmed self&#8208;assembly capabilities of nucleic acids but also incorporates the unique physicochemical properties of inorganic metal nanomaterials. This intersection of organic and inorganic chemistry presents broad application prospects in fields such as biology, chemistry, materials science, and energy science. This review, based on the principles related to FNAs, introduces the concept of mFNA for the first time, aiming to explore the fundamental connections between nanoscale FNAs and metal materials. Additionally, the article focuses on the construction methods and functional characteristics of mFNA. Finally, the current challenges faced by mFNA are reviewed, and their future development is anticipated, providing detailed information for a comprehensive understanding of the research progress in mFNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Recognition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain N&#8208;Glycans by an Antiviral Synthetic Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycan&#8208;binding agents may be a key asset in the development of new antivirals against enveloped viruses. Using a combination of glycoengineering and mass spectrometry techniques, we present here direct evidence of biomimetic recognition of the N&#8208;glycans exposed on the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the wild&#8208;type spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by a synthetic receptor targeting mannose and acting as antiviral.







Abstract
Recognition of glycans by simple synthetic receptors is a key issue in supramolecular chemistry, endowed with relevant implications in glycobiology and medicine. In this context, glycoproteins featuring N&#8208;glycans represent an important biological target, because they are often exploited by enveloped viruses in adhesion and infection processes. However, a direct evidence for their recognition by a synthetic receptor targeting N&#8208;glycans is still missing in the literature. Using a combination of glycoengineering and mass spectrometry techniques, we present here the direct evidence of biomimetic recognition of complex&#8208;type N&#8208;glycans exposed on the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the wild&#8208;type spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by a biologically active, synthetic receptor.

         <title>Glyoxalase 2 Coordinates de Novo Serine Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and rate&#8208;limiting enzyme of de novo Ser biosynthesis, 3&#8208;phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), is modified by the non&#8208;enzymatically derived post&#8208;translational modification (PTM), lactoylLys.







Abstract
Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is the first enzyme in de novo Ser biosynthesis. Numerous metabolic pathways rely on Ser as a precursor, most notably one&#8208;carbon metabolism, glutathione biosynthesis, and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. To facilitate proliferation, many cancer cells shunt glycolytic flux through this pathway, placing PHGDH as a metabolic liability and feasible therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. Herein, we demonstrate the post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of PHGDH by lactoylLys. These PTMs are generated through a non&#8208;enzymatic acyl transfer from the glyoxalase cycle intermediate, lactoylglutathione (LGSH). Knockout of the primary LGSH regulatory enzyme, glyoxalase 2 (GLO2), results in increased LGSH and resulting lactoylLys modification of PHGDH. These PTMs reduce enzymatic activity, resulting in a marked reduction in intracellular Ser. Using stable isotope tracing, we demonstrate reduced flux through the de novo Ser biosynthetic pathway. Collectively, these data identify PHGDH as a target for modification by lactoylLys, resulting in reduced enzymatic activity and reduced intracellular Ser.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is the first enzyme in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; Ser biosynthesis. Numerous metabolic pathways rely on Ser as a precursor, most notably one-carbon metabolism, glutathione biosynthesis, and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; nucleotide biosynthesis. To facilitate proliferation, many cancer cells shunt glycolytic flux through this pathway, placing PHGDH as a metabolic liability and feasible therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. Herein, we demonstrate the post-translational modification (PTM) of PHGDH by lactoylLys. These PTMs are generated through a non-enzymatic acyl transfer from the glyoxalase cycle intermediate, lactoylglutathione (LGSH). Knockout of the primary LGSH regulatory enzyme, glyoxalase 2 (GLO2), results in increased LGSH and resulting lactoylLys modification of PHGDH. These PTMs reduce enzymatic activity, resulting in a marked reduction in intracellular Ser. Using stable isotope tracing, we demonstrate reduced flux through the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; Ser biosynthetic pathway. Collectively, these data identify PHGDH as a target for modification by lactoylLys, resulting in reduced enzymatic activity and reduced intracellular Ser.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silencing of O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Attenuated O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and Metastatic Potentials of Melanoma Cells Through Suppression of Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B Signaling Pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in the metastasis of melanoma. O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes are elevated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors and normal tissues. Suppression of OGT by siRNA showed that O&#8208;GlcNAcylation regulates melanoma metastasis via Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway, consequence in the expression of metastatic related genes.







Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is an important biological process in regulating the function of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins in cells. Enhancement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation was associated with cancer development and progression. Here, we demonstrated the involvement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in melanoma metastasis. Using the data from GEO database, we found that O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes, including glutamine fructose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and O&#8208;GlcNAcase (OGA); were elevated in metastatic melanoma compared with primary tumors and normal tissues. Functional analyses in melanoma cell lines &#8211; MNT&#8208;1, SK&#8208;MEL&#8208;28, and A&#8208;375 showed that suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation by siRNA against OGT significantly reduces the migration and invasion abilities of the cells. Phosphorylation of Akt and NF&#954;B was drastically suppressed after the knockdown of OGT, suggesting the role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating the Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway. In addition, we found that the NF&#954;B target genes, such as ZEB&#8208;2 and MCT&#8208;1, were significantly upregulated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors. MCT&#8208;1 expression in melanoma tissues was also correlated with the O&#8208;GlcNAcylation level. Taken together, we have demonstrated in this study the possible role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in controlling melanoma metastasis via upregulating MCT&#8208;1 expression through activation of the Akt&#8208;NF&#954;B signaling pathway.

         <title>Apparent Reversal of Allosteric Response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis MenD Reveals Links to Half&#8208;of&#8208;Sites Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of computational, biochemical and structural studies on allostery mutants of Mtb&#8208;MenD, a menaquinone (vitamin K2) biosynthesis enzyme from a human pathogen, yields insight into the interrelationship between allosteric and half&#8208;of&#8208;sites reactivity mechanisms. As Mtb&#8208;MenD is a promiscuous ThDP&#8208;dependent enzyme from a core bacterial biosynthetic pathway, our findings have potential biocatalysis and drug discovery applications.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active molecules play critical roles in various biological functions, including cellular respiration. In bacterial electron transport chains, menaquinones serve as key electron carriers. The first committed enzyme in the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), MenD, is allosterically inhibited by 1,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic acid (DHNA), the first redox&#8208;active metabolite in the pathway. Structural asymmetries in Mtb&#8208;MenD suggest that this enzyme operates via a half&#8208;of&#8208;sites mechanism for catalysis. Here, we investigate the interplay between its catalytic and allosteric mechanisms. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, mutagenesis, kinetic and binding assays, and structural analyses, we identified and characterised mutants of two residues, D141 and D306, involved in stabilising asymmetric conformations associated with allostery. These mutations had complex effects on Mtb&#8208;MenD's reaction kinetics, with the D306 mutants showing an apparent reversal of the allosteric response to DHNA. Our findings indicate that asymmetric active site conformations may facilitate optimal binding of cofactors and substrates, while the transition between alternating active site conformations is essential for the catalytic cycle. DHNA binding stabilises asymmetry in the tetramer, likely promoting the binding of cofactors, substrates, or reaction intermediates. However, DHNA interferes with the transition between alternating conformations, ultimately impairing turnover and catalytic cycling in Mtb&#8208;MenD.

The first full&#8208;length three&#8208;dimensional structure of human fibrinogen was obtained through homology modelling, coarse&#8208;grained and all&#8208;atoms molecular dynamics simulations. Large sections that play important roles in fibrin assembly (coloured) and whose structures were missing in the crystallographic structure (grey) and therefore were unknown, were in silico modelled and analysed. This will allow the construction of a protofibril to shed light on the polymerization process.







Abstract
Fibrinogen is a protein involved in the haemostasis process playing a central role by forming the fibrin clot. An understanding of protein structure is vital to determining biological function. Despite many studies on the fibrin polymerization process, its molecular mechanism remains elusive mainly due to the absence of a full&#8208;length three&#8208;dimensional model of human fibrinogen. Amino&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;terminal regions of the three pairs of chains that form this molecule are missing in the crystallographic structure, being the carboxyl&#8208;terminal of the A&#945; chain the most affected with a section of more than 400 amino acids missing. To have a full structure of the fibrinogen molecule would allow the creation of a model of protofibril, shedding light into the fibrin formation process through computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations. Absent regions were explored using homology modelling and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations. Later on, the model was refined and stabilized with atomistic molecular dynamic simulations. In the present study, we obtained the first realistic full&#8208;length structure of fibrinogen, with features in accordance with previous results obtained by experimental techniques.

This review summarizes the recent progress on fluorescence probes for GST, including design principle, sensing mechanism and biological application of probes. This review might be a helpful to explore the chemical biological function of GST and the related fields.







Abstract
Cytoplasmic glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GST) is a key enzyme in cellular detoxification, catalysing the nucleophilic attack of glutathione (GSH) with toxic electrophilic substrates to produce less harmful compounds, thus aiding cellular detoxification. Studies have shown that GST is closely associated with the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, pesticides, herbicides and antibiotics, and the development of drug resistance in organisms poses new challenges in areas such as environmental protection and tumour therapy. In order to clarify the mechanism of GST in the development of drug resistance and detect the content of GST more accurately, this paper summarized the mechanism of GST on the development of drug resistance in different organisms, the types and research progress of organic small molecule fluorescence probes for GST imaging detection are introduced.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Turn Mimicking Crosslinking Provides Hyperstability and Fast Folding Kinetics for Short Collagen Triple Helices</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating stabilized peptide mimics of the collagen triple helix is challenging, especially for collagen heterotrimers. Interstrand sidechain crosslinking offers a useful approach, though this strategy can suffer from destabilizing structural perturbations, sequence limitations and synthetic complexity. Herein, we show that the geometry of hydrogen bonding in the collagen triple helix is compatible with installation of terminal &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;mimicking linkers at the N&#8208;terminal and C&#8208;terminal ends of the triple helix. These double&#8208;turn&#8208;containing collagen peptide mimics fold into highly stable, intramolecular triple helical structures, providing access to profoundly miniaturized triple helix mimics. Intramolecular triple helix formation exhibits significantly accelerated folding kinetics. Comprehensive kinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;limiting step of folding is distinct at low and high temperatures, affording unique insight into the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Coelenterazine&#8208;dependent Bioluminescence in the Cyclopoid Copepod, Triconia conifera</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Species in the cyclopoid copepod Triconia are known to be bioluminescent, emitting blue light by mechanical stimulus. In this study in Triconica conifera, we identified the presence of luciferase activity to coelenterazine, a substrate for the bioluminescence in various marine taxa such as luminous cnidarians, fishes, and crustaceans including calanoid copepods. The molecular size estimated by gel&#8208;filtration chromatography and pH dependency of the luciferase activity were similar to those in calanoid copepods. On the other hand, the reaction rate and inhibitory effect by magnesium ion were much different between them. The presence of coelenterazine in the specimen was confirmed by LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS. Taken together with the phylogenetically distant relationship between Cyclopoida and Calanoida, our findings suggested that coelenterazine&#8208;dependent bioluminescence was evolved parallelly at least twice in copepod lineages.</dc:description>

The ultrasmall tip size of nanopipettes bridges the gap between the macro&#8208; and nano worlds, which can be attributed to the capability of nanopipettes to transport ultrasmall volumes of liquids, ions, and solutes. In this review, we discuss the fabrication, characterization, and modification of nanopipettes to provide an overview of the recent developments of nanopipette&#8208;based sensors and strategies.

         <title>Identification and Characterization of a Novel d&#8208;Branched&#8208;Chain Amino Acids Importer from Lactobacillus Fermentum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain lactic acid bacteria produce d&#8208;branched&#8208;chain amino acids (d&#8208;BCAA) and encode isoleucine 2&#8208;epimerase (ILEP) and an uncharacterized transporter (AAP). We demonstrate that the transporter is a novel, non&#8208;stereospecific BCAA importer. The ILEP&#8208;AAP operon likely aids in storing and utilizing BCAA in a form less accessible to other organisms.







Abstract
Various lactic acid bacteria synthesize d&#8208;branched&#8208;chain amino acids (d&#8208;BCAA) during growth, but their physiological function remains largely elusive. The pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme isoleucine 2&#8208;epimerase (ILEP) has been identified as the key enzyme responsible for d&#8208;BCAA biosynthesis. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that genes encoding ILEP and an uncharacterized amino acid&#8208;polyamine&#8208;organocation (APC) family transporter are adjacent in several d&#8208;BCAA&#8208;producing bacteria, suggesting a functional link between these two proteins in d&#8208;BCAA metabolism. In this study, we investigated the function of the APC family transporter from Lactobacillus fermentum (LfAAP). Using heterologous expression systems in Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis, we demonstrated that LfAAP functions as a non&#8208;stereospecific BCAA importer. Mutational analysis revealed that Ala119 and Met331 play critical roles in substrate recognition. Heterologous expression of LfAAP and/or LfILEP in a L. lactis strain, which lacks the ILEP&#8208;AAP genes operon, revealed that ILEP functions as both synthetic and catabolic enzyme for d&#8208;BCAA. Our findings suggest that the ILEP&#8208;AAP system contribute to storage and subsequent utilization of BCAA in a form that is less accessible by other organisms, providing a potential competitive advantage in microbial environments.

Heterologous expression of &lt;i&gt;Lf&lt;/i&gt;AAP and/or &lt;i&gt;Lf&lt;/i&gt;ILEP in a &lt;i&gt;L. lactis&lt;/i&gt; strain, which lacks the ILEP-AAP genes operon, revealed that ILEP functions as both synthetic and catabolic enzyme for &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-BCAA. Our findings suggest that the ILEP-AAP system contribute to storage and subsequent utilization of BCAA in a form that is less accessible by other organisms, providing a potential competitive advantage in microbial environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification and Protein Engineering of Galactosidases for the Conversion of Blood Type B to Blood Type O</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The supply of blood products such as red blood cells poses a challenge due to rising demand and declining donor numbers. Careful matching of blood products of different types is required. Only type O of the blood types A, B, AB and O can be received by any patient without transfusion incompatibilities. Therefore, O&#8208;type blood can be considered &#8220;universal blood&#8221; and is especially needed in emergency situations. In this study, we focused on the conversion of the B antigen by enzymatic deglycosylation to generate the H antigen determining O&#8208;type blood. For this, we characterized several previously unstudied &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactosidases belonging to the GH110 family. Our findings revealed that the &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactosidase from Pedobacter panaciterrae (PpaGal) exhibits superior efficiency compared to previously described galactosidases. We further increased the activity of PpaGal by 2.5&#8208;fold using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. Moreover, we solved two crystal structures of PpaGal, one in the apo&#8208;state and another in complex with d&#8208;galactose. The combination of our mutagenesis study with the solved crystal structures provides valuable information to guide further optimization of PpaGal or other B antigen converting enzymes paving the way for the easier production of universal blood from B&#8208;type blood.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Chemical Biology Insights Towards Reversible Stapled Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides are increasingly recognized for their advantages over small molecules in the modulation of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs), particularly in terms of potency and selectivity. &#8220;Staples&#8221; can be coupled to the amino acid residues of linear peptides to limit their conformation, improving the stability, membrane permeability, and resistance to proteolysis of peptides. However, the addition of staples can sometimes lead to the complete inactivation of the original peptide or result in extensive interactions that complicate biophysical analysis. Besides, reversible peptide probes are also indispensable tools for thoroughly investigating PPIs. Consequently, the development of diverse reversible stapling techniques for stapled peptides is crucial for broadening the applications of peptide molecules in drug discovery, drug delivery, and as tools in chemical biology research. This review aims to summarize representative chemical design strategies for reversible stapled peptides, focusing on reversible chemical stapling methods involving sulfhydryl, amino, and methylthio groups, as well as reversible modulation of the conformational states of stapled peptides. Additionally, we demonstrate some intriguing biological applications of stapled peptides and, finally, suggest future research directions in the field that will serve as references for related researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Viscoelastic Supramolecular Hydrogel Co&#8208;Assembled from Gatifloxacin and Deoxyguanosine for the Treatment of Bacterial Keratitis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular D&#8208;Gat gel fabricated from antibiotics and nucleotides exhibits viscoelasticity and low cohesion, enabling uniform ocular coverage, rapid recovery, and minimal tissue adhesion. Compared to traditional ocular gels, it enhances therapeutic efficacy, prolongs retention, and improves bioavailability. Additionally, it offers simplified preparation, high transparency, and excellent biocompatibility, making it ideal for the treatment of ocular infections.







Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is the most prevalent ocular surface infection, causing significant inconvenience to patients&#8217; lives and posing a risk of blindness if mismanaged. The application of antibiotic gels has been a principal clinic therapeutic intervention due to the retarded ocular surface medication retention. However, current clinical gel formulations rely on high viscosity polymer matrices to improve retention, which often results in uneven gel layers, causing sticky sensation and prone to adhesion to periocular tissues during blinking, leading to clearance. In this study, we propose a supramolecular hydrogel assembled from antibiotic and natural nucleotide molecules with viscoelastic rheology and low cohesion texture. These features enabled it spread to uniformly on the ocular surface, recover deformation after blinking, and are less likely to adhere to periocular tissues, significantly improving drug retention on the ocular surface and achieving better therapeutic effects in the treatment of bacterial keratitis. Additionally, the hydrogel is easy to prepare, has good visibility and safety, offering a new strategy for the development of ophthalmic gels.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Temozolomide Probe for Overcoming MGMT&#8208;Mediated Resistance in Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted temozolomide (mtTmz) using peptide&#8208;based delivery vector has been shown to overcome direct DNA repair and resistance by O6&#8208;methylgunaine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. This has been demonstrated through viability assays using MGMT&#8208;positive and negative cell lines, and the effect of mtTmz on MGMT subcellular localization and expression was analysed using Proteinase K digestion assays and RT&#8208;qPCR, respectively.







Abstract
Temozolomide (Tmz) is a DNA methylating agent used for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Resistance to Tmz in GBM is caused by the DNA direct repair enzyme O6&#8208;methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which is expressed in ~50&#8201;% of GBM tumours. It has yet to be confirmed that MGMT acts within mitochondria to repair mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and in this report we discuss the development of a novel mitochondria&#8208;targeted temozolomide probe (mtTmz) for evading MGMT&#8208;mediated resistance. Through conjugation of Tmz to a mitochondria&#8208;penetrating peptide (MPP), exclusive mitochondrial localization was achieved, and the probe retained alkylation activity demonstrated by chemical and DNA&#8208;based assays. Absence of nuclear DNA damage was assessed by detecting &#947;H2AX foci. mtTmz demonstrated efficient cell killing capabilities independent of MGMT status in GBM cells as determined by cell viability assays. It was determined using a Proteinase K digestion assay that MGMT does not translocate to mitochondria in response to mtTmz treatment, and RT&#8208;qPCR analysis demonstrated that mtTmz does not induce MGMT gene expression compared to Tmz. The results reported highlight both the potential of mitochondrial targeting of Tmz and mitochondria as a therapeutic target in MGMT&#8208;expressing GBM.

         <title>Design of Zn&#8208;Binding Peptide(s) from Protein Fragments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a short zinc&#8208;binding peptide by taking fragments from proteins with known structure. We have measured the binding affinity with isothermal calorimetry and the structure of the peptide using CD and NMR spectroscopies. These results were computationally supported by molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
We designed a minimalistic zinc(II)&#8208;binding peptide featuring the Cys2His2 zinc&#8208;finger motif. To this aim, several tens of thousands of (His/Cys)&#8208;Xn&#8208;(His/Cys) protein fragments (n=2&#8211;20) were first extracted from the 3D protein structures deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB). Based on geometrical constraints positioning two Cys (C) and two His (H) side chains at the vertices of a tetrahedron, approximately 22 000 sequences of the (H/C)&#8208;Xi&#8208;(H/C)&#8208;Xj&#8208;(H/C)&#8208;Xk&#8208;(H/C) type, satisfying Nmetal&#8211;binding H=Nmetal&#8208;binding C=2, were processed. Several other criteria, such as the secondary structure content and predicted fold stability, were then used to select the best candidates. To prove the viability of the computational design experimentally, three peptides were synthesized and subjected to isothermal calorimetry (ITC) measurements to determine the binding constants with Zn2+, including the entropy and enthalpy terms. For the strongest Zn2+ ions binding peptide, P1, the dissociation constant was shown to be in the nanomolar range (KD=~220&#8197;nM; corresponding to &#916;Gbind=&#8722;9.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). In addition, ITC showed that the [P1&#8201;:&#8201;Zn2+] complex forms in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry and two protons are released upon binding, which suggests that the zinc coordination involves both cysteines. NMR experiments also indicated that the structure of the [P1&#8201;:&#8201;Zn2+] complex might be quite similar to the computationally predicted one. In summary, our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study highlights the usefulness of our computational protocol for designing novel metal&#8208;binding peptides.

For the strongest Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions binding peptide, &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;, the dissociation constant was shown to be in the nanomolar range (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=~220&#8197;nM; corresponding to &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bind&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;9.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, ITC showed that the [&lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] complex forms in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry and two protons are released upon binding, which suggests that the zinc coordination involves both cysteines. NMR experiments also indicated that the structure of the [&lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] complex might be quite similar to the computationally predicted one. In summary, our proof-of-principle study highlights the usefulness of our computational protocol for designing novel metal-binding peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linker Ratio&#8208;Dependent Physicochemical Properties of ZIF&#8208;8 Encapsulated Mini Protein 20 Mimicking Uricase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the effect of varying Zn to 2&#8208;HmIm molar ratios on the synthesis of nanoporous ZIF&#8208;8 for encapsulating the mini protein mimicking uricase (mp20) as a model biomolecule. The results reveal that a 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 ratio exhibits high encapsulation efficiency and thermal stability, while a 1&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio yields well&#8208;crystallized biocomposites with optimal particle size and surface area, enhancing their structural integrity and surface interactions for intended applications.







Abstract
Despite a growing interest in zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8), notably for their potential as a host for various bio&#8208; and molecules, including peptides, the critical factors affecting their physicochemical properties and encapsulation efficiency are relatively unknown, limiting their widespread use. Herein, mini protein 20 (mp20), biomolecule mimicking uricase was used as a model to be hosted within ZIF&#8208;8 (mp20@ZIF&#8208;8) biocomposites. ZIF&#8208;8 were synthesized over a range of molar ratio of Zn to 2&#8208;methylimidazole(2&#8208;HmIm). By systematically exploring the impacts of various linker ratios, we found that a Zn to 2&#8208;HmIm ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 offers the highest encapsulation efficiency and thermal stability, making it particularly suitable for applications where these properties are critical. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio, on the other hand, makes biocomposites with the most crystallized and a well&#8208;balanced combination of particle size and surface area, which are advantageous for applications requiring high structural integrity and surface interaction. This approach not only advances our understanding of protein encapsulation in MOFs but also provides new insights into how the linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio can be optimized for different applications. Subsequent studies could expand upon these findings by implementing the enhanced biocomposites in practical applications, examining the encapsulation of biomolecules, or assessing the durability the long&#8208;term stability and functionality of these materials in various conditions.

         <title>Effects of D&#8208;Amino Acid Replacements on the Conformational Stability of Miniproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We probed the effects of L&#8208;to&#8208;D amino acid substitutions on protein stability using far&#8208;UV CD. Comparison of the &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich villin headpiece subdomain and the &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich WW domain revealed that L&#8208;to&#8208;D substitutions generally destabilize proteins.







Abstract
For many proteins, proper function requires adoption of a specific tertiary structure. This study explores the effects of L&#8208;to&#8208;D amino acid substitutions on tertiary structure stability for two well&#8208;known miniproteins, a single&#8208;site variant of the chicken villin headpiece subdomain (VHP) and the human Pin1 WW domain (WW). For VHP, which features an &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich tertiary structure, substitutions led to significant destabilization, as detected by variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) measurements. For WW, which has a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich tertiary structure, most single L&#8208;to&#8208;D changes seemed to cause complete unfolding at room temperature, according to CD measurements. These findings suggest that amino acid residue configuration changes at a single site will often prove to be deleterious in terms of tertiary structure stability, and in some cases dramatically destabilizing.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Neoplastic Gallium&#8208;Based PROTAC for PDI Degradation Triggers Autophagy and Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium (III)&#8208;based PROTACs facilitate the formation of a ternary complex between the target protein (PDI), the PROTAC, and an E3/E2 ligase, ultimately leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the proteasome. This, in turn, can trigger the autophagy of cells and immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a family of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases, is one of the most abundant soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is responsible for protein folding. Increasing evidence suggests that PDI is overexpressed in multiple types of cancer, positioning it as a promising target for tumor therapy. We have designed and synthesized a series of gallium complex&#8208;based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which exhibited effective targeting and degradation of PDI in&#8197;vitro. After analyzing the relationship between structure and function, we have identified M&#8208;2 as the compound that most efficiently degrades PDI. Our research shows that M&#8208;2&#8208;induced degradation of PDI can trigger the unfolded protein response, leading to cell autophagy and initiating immunogenic cell death (ICD), as demonstrated in mouse models. This study suggests a potential opportunity for combining PDI targeting and immunotherapy.

         <title>Impact of DNA Nick on the Self&#8208;Assembly of Single&#8208;Tile&#8208;Based Polyhedra</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of DNA nick on the tile&#8208;based assembly of three&#8208;dimensional wireframe polyhedra is systematically investigated. Interestingly, the tile concentration and the valence of metal cations play significant roles in how DNA nick influences the self&#8208;assembly of DNA tiles. Besides, there is a threshold percentage of intact tiles above which the nick would not have obvious impact.







Abstract
Tile&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly is a simple yet highly efficient bottom&#8208;up nanofabrication strategy, which has been widely applied in many fields such as structural DNA nanotechnology. The self&#8208;assembly of DNA tile is determined by not only the sequence design, but also the existing nick in the tile, as it would influence the flexibility and the symmetry of the tile. Herein, we systematically investigated the impact of nick on the tile&#8208;based assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA polyhedra in various conditions. A series of tile concentrations, four different sticky ends, two annealing approaches, buffers with different metal cations, and different molar percentages of intact tiles, were all tested. It was found that the tile concentration and the valence of metal cations played significant roles in how DNA nick influenced the assembly of DNA polyhedra. Besides, when the molar percentage of intact tiles was higher than the threshold of about two&#8208;thirds, the impact of nick on the assembly of DNA polyhedra would not be obvious. Our work provides an insightful understanding of the role of nick in the fabrication of high&#8208;quality structures from single&#8208;tile&#8208;based assembly.

         <title>Biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates from sucrose by recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sucrose&#8208;utilization pathway was developed in Pseudomonas putida using sacC from Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which encodes a &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Excretion of &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase into the culture medium was confirmed via western blot analysis. In nitrogen&#8208;limited cultivation, P. putida expressing SacC produced 10.52 wt% medium&#8208;chain&#8208;length polyhydroxyalkanoate (MCL&#8208;PHA), while P. putida expressing SacC along with poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] biosynthesis genes produced 9.16 wt% P(3HB) from sucrose. Batch and fed&#8208;batch cultures of recombinant P. putida suggested that the glucose and fructose derived from sucrose can be completely utilized for cell growth and P(3HB) production. In fed&#8208;batch cultures, sucrose supplied into the fermentor to maintain its concentration around 20 g/L was rapidly hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose supporting the production of 30.2 g/L P(3HB) with 38.1 wt%. The engineered P. putida reported herein can facilitate the production of PHAs from sucrose, an abundant and inexpensive carbon source.</dc:description>

Batch and fed-batch cultures of recombinant P. putida suggested that the glucose and fructose derived from sucrose can be completely utilized for cell growth and P(3HB) production. In fed-batch cultures, sucrose supplied into the fermentor to maintain its concentration around 20 g/L was rapidly hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose supporting the production of 30.2 g/L P(3HB) with 38.1 wt%. The engineered P. putida reported herein can facilitate the production of PHAs from sucrose, an abundant and inexpensive carbon source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the diversity of nitroxide&#8208;based paramagnetic probes conjugated to non&#8208;canonical amino acids for SDSL&#8208;EPR applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding protein structure requires studying its dynamics, which is critical to elucidating its functional role. Over time, biophysical techniques have revolutionized this field, offering remarkable insights into the structure&#8208;function relationship. Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) is a powerful method delivering structural data at the residue level, irrespective of protein size or environment. Nitroxide labels, which target cysteine residues, often face limitations when cysteines are essential for protein structure or function. To address this, alternatives have been proposed as the use of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncaa) coupled with specific nitroxide labels. This study introduces 14N&#8208;HO&#8208;5223, a novel nitroxide label specific to the pAzPhe ncaa, alongside its 15N&#8208;derivative. These labels were grafted at two sites of the model protein, the diflavin Cytochrome P450 reductase. For comparative purpose, two already reported labels were also used. Continuous wave EPR spectroscopy validated the HO&#8208;5223 label as an effective reporter of protein dynamics. Additionally, Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance measurements provided distance distributions between the semi&#8208;quinone FMNH&#9679; state of the CPR and nitroxide labels. These results expand the toolkit of the ncaa&#8208;nitroxide pairs, enabling EPR&#8208;based structural studies of proteins where cysteine modification is impractical, further advancing our ability to decode protein dynamics and function.</dc:description>

         <title>A Silicon Rhodamine&#8208;fused Glibenclamide to Label and Detect Malaria&#8208;infected&#160;Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum affects the lives of millions of people worldwide every year. The detection of replicating parasites within human red blood cells is of paramount importance, requiring appropriate diagnostic tools. Herein, we design and apply a silicon rhodamine&#8208;fused glibenclamide (SiR&#8208;glib). We first test this far&#8208;red fluorescent, fluorogenic and endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting sulfonylurea in mammalian cells and pancreatic tissues, before characterizing its labeling performance in red blood cells infected with the asexual developmental stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We further combine SiR&#8208;glib with a portable smartphone&#8208;based microscope to easily and rapidly identify parasitized red blood cells, providing proof of principle for diagnostic use in rural endemic areas without major healthcare facilities.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA switches regulated by specific inducer molecules have become a powerful synthetic biology tool for precise gene regulation in mammalian systems. The engineered RNA switches can be integrated with natural RNA&#8208;mediated gene regulatory functions as a modular and customizable approach to probe and control cellular behavior. RNA switches have been used to advance synthetic biology applications, including gene therapy, bio&#8208;production, and cellular reprogramming. This review explores recent progress in the design and functional implementation of synthetic riboswitches in mammalian cells based on diverse RNA regulation mechanisms by highlighting recent studies and emerging technologies. We also discuss challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, system stability, and ligand delivery in complex biological environments. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of synthetic riboswitches as a platform for customizable gene regulation in diverse biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage of Structured RNAs Is Accelerated by High Affinity DNAzyme Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept paper, we argue that the efficiency of RNA cleavage by DNAzymes might be limited by accessibility of cleaving sites in folded RNA and propose several strategies to solve the problem. The concept article is compelemented with a multiple&#8208;choice quiz on DNAzymes as therapeutic agens, which can be used for educational purposes.







Abstract
DNAzymes (Dz) have been suggested as sequence&#8208;specific agents for cleaving RNA for therapeutic purposes. This concept paper discusses the challenges of Dz 10&#8208;23 design to effciently cleave folded RNA substrates. Dz with traditionally designed RNA binding arms (Tm~37&#8201;&#176;C) have low affinity to the folded RNA substrates, which limits the overall cleavage rate. The RNA cleavage can be facilitated using Dz with high&#8208;affinity arms. However, this strategy is efficient only for cleaving RNA into folded RNA products. The unfolded products inhibit multiple substrate turnover. In a more general approach, Dz should be equipped with additional RNA binding arms to achieve tight RNA binding. This can be accomplished by bivalent and multivalent Dz constructs that have multiple catalytic cores. In all cases, high selectivity toward single nucleotide variations can be achieved in addition to multiple turnovers. The presence of RNase H, which plays a role in the antisense effect of oligonucleotide gene therapy agents, stabilizes the Dz:RNA complex and reduces its selectivity but significantly increases RNA cleavage efficiency. This work proposes changes in the algorithms of Dz design, which can help in constructing potent Dz agents for RNA inhibition both in cell cultures and in&#8197;vivo. The concept article is supplemented with a quiz, which tests knowledge of the main concepts discussed in this work.

         <title>Structural Study of DNA in Simulated Crowded Fluids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short, double stranded DNA shows similar synchrotron radiation circular dichroism profiles in dilute buffers and in crowded solutions containing polyethylene glycol (10,000) and sucrose. On one hand, DNA duplexes are stabilized by polyethylene glycol, on the other hand, DNA strand exchange is promoted by polyethylene glycol, but not by sucrose.







Abstract
This work studied the structure and hybridization properties of DNA in simulated crowded media containing polyethylene glycol 10,000 and sucrose. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism revealed that the overall CD profiles of a 21&#8208;mer and a d(CG)9 duplex remain similar in the simulated crowded fluids compared with those in Tris buffer, but the amplitude ratios of individual maxima and minima vary with the concentration of DNA and the media, suggesting possible conformational changes. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, this work confirmed that hairpin and duplex formations are not affected by the crowding condition. On the other hand, the duplex dynamics is affected by the crowding condition, where strand exchanges were promoted by the presence of PEG, but unaffected by sucrose.

         <title>Quantification of propargylated RNA nucleosides after metabolic labeling via the methylation pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA modifications are involved in numerous biological processes and vary in different cell types. Methylation is the most widespread type of RNA modification and occurs via S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM). We recently developed a metabolic labeling approach based on intracellular formation of a clickable SAM analog (SeAdoYn) and demonstrated its use in mapping methyltransferase (MTase) target sites in mRNA from HeLa cells. Here we investigate how metabolic labeling via the clickable SAM analog modifies four different nucleosides in RNA of HEK293T in comparison to HeLa cells. We find that HEK293T cells retain higher cell viability upon feeding the clickable metabolic SAM precursor. In poly(A)+ RNA we find high Aprop/A levels (0.04%) and in total RNA (but not poly(A)+ RNA) we detect prop3C, which was not detected previously in HeLa cells. We discuss the findings in the context of data from the literature with respect to mRNA half&#8208;lives in cancer and non&#8208;cancer cell lines and suggest that CMTr2 is most likely responsible for the high Aprop level in poly(A)+ RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>From Genes to Molecules: The Fusarium PKS16 Gene Cluster facilitates the biosynthesis of proliferapyrones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ascomycete fungi of the genus Fusarium are found in manifold ecological niches and thus pursue several lifestyles. On average, individual Fusarium species have the genetic capability to produce 50 natural products (NPs), which are in general thought to improve the fungus's fitness in defined environments. This also includes NPs with toxic potential (mycotoxins) contaminating food and feed sources. Recent research has shown that the production of NPs is tightly regulated on the transcriptional level and depends on the delicate balance between the deposition and removal of histone marks. Within this study, we show that the expression of the prior cryptic Fusarium PKS16 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) greatly depends on modifications at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27). By combining molecular&#8208;, chemical&#8208;, and bioinformatic analyses we show that the PKS16 BGC from F. fujikuroi B14 (FfB14) consists of nine genes, including a positively acting pathway&#8208;specific transcription factor, which although absent in some fusaria, functions in activating other PKS16 cluster genes. Moreover, we linked the PKS16 BGC to the biosynthesis of proliferapyrone (PRO) B, an isomer of the recently isolated PRO A.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Functional Information of Human Hemoglobin Subunit &#956;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hb subunit: The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human subunit &#956; C49S/C104S mutant was determined, which adopts the typical protein fold of globins, whereas the distal Met62 is self&#8208;oxidized to the sulfoxide form (Met&#8208;SO).







Abstract
The human hemoglobin subunit &#956; (Hb&#8208;&#956;) has been identified as a potential biomarker for &#945;&#8208;thalassemia. However, little structural and functional information is available for this subunit. Here, we have overexpressed and purified a double mutant of C49S/C104S Hb&#8208;&#956; and solved its X&#8208;ray crystal structure. It adopts a typical protein fold of the globins, similar to that of the &#945;&#8208;subunit. The structure also reveals that the protein undergoes self&#8208;oxidation of Met62 in the heme distal site, producing the form of sulfoxide (Met&#8208;SO). The property and function have also been studied by spectroscopy, which shows that the protein has considerable peroxidase activity due to the presence of a catalytic His&#8208;Arg pair in the heme distal site. The structure&#8208;function relationship of Hb&#8208;&#956; obtained in this study may provide useful insights into Hb&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Trapping and Hydroperoxide&#8208;Decomposing Benzoselenazole Antioxidants with Potential Biological Applications against Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoselenazoles carrying an anilide group in a very close proximity to the Se atom are found to be very good radical&#8208;trapping as well as hydroperoxide&#8208;decomposing antioxidants. They also exhibited the antimicrobial activity against B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa with minimum inhibitory concentration.







Abstract
The synthesis of phenolic benzoselenazoles has been described. These were synthesized from their corresponding diselenides and aldehydes using acetic acid as a catalyst. All compounds have been tested for glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like antioxidant activity in thiophenol assay. Radical&#8208;trapping antioxidant (RTA) activity of benzoselenazoles towards ROO&#8901; radicals has been studied for the inhibition of autoxidation of cumene in chlorobenzene from the O2&#8208;consumption during the inhibited period. Compound 13&#8201;c was found to inhibit azo&#8208;initiated oxidation of cumene with a stoichiometric factor (n) &#8771;2.2. This study also suggested some insights into the substitution&#8208;dependent activity of anilides over phenols as effective radical&#8208;trapping antioxidants. Moreover, the zone of inhibition study corroborated the antimicrobial potential of benzoselenazole antioxidants against Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Anti&#8208;biofilm activities were portrayed against the production of biofilms by B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa. MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line was selected for triple&#8208;negative breast carcinoma for in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity of all antioxidants using the MTT assay. Additionally, the interaction patterns of antioxidants with target proteins of B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa were demonstrated using molecular docking study. Molecular dynamics simulations were deployed to investigate the structural dynamics and the stability of the complex.

         <title>Expanding the Enzymatic Toolbox for Carboligation: Increasing the Diversity of the &#8216;Split&#8217; Transketolase Sequence Space</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several putative split transketolases were retrieved via (meta)genome mining, increasing our understanding of this type of prokaryotic TK, whose domains are located on two separate subunits. Ten split TKs were purified and tested for erythrulose production, with the best&#8208;performing enzyme kinetically characterized. Evaluation of their thermostability led to the identification of promising candidates for potential use in biocatalysis.







Abstract
Transketolases (TKs) are thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two&#8208;carbon units in a stereoselective manner, making them valuable biocatalysts for sustainable processes. Most known TKs are about 650 amino acids long; however, a second type found in Archaea and many Bacteria consists of two proteins, each of about 300 amino acids. Exploring the unique features and differences of split TKs may help in assessing their potential use in biocatalysis and for uncovering new reactivities. Additionally, it could provide valuable information on how their structure relates to their function, especially compared to full&#8208;length TKs. In this study, we significantly expanded the known repertoire of split TKs approximately 14&#8208;fold to the best of our knowledge, by identifying and providing accessions of nearly 500 putative split&#8208;TK subunit pairs. Moreover, we doubled the number of experimentally produced and tested split TKs by cloning, purifying, and testing ten candidates retrieved from genomes and in&#8208;house metagenomes. Interestingly, pQR2809 and pQR2812, derived from hyperthermophilic organisms, showed enhanced thermostability compared to other TK examples in the literature, maintaining partial activity after heating at 90&#8201;&#176;C or 100&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;hour, respectively.

         <title>Mutagenesis to Orient Conjugation and Preserve Self&#8208;adjuvant Properties of Flagellin in Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guide to control: Rational replacement of surface&#8208;exposed residues of flagellin with cysteines directs conjugation to specific residues while preserving the critical TLR5 binding domains D0 and D1 and potentiates the use of flagellin as self&#8208;adjuvanting carrier in conjugate vaccines.







Abstract
Bacterial flagellins are unique for their capacity to activate both the innate and the adaptive immune response through a Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 (TLR5) signaling cascade. Used as a carrier protein in conjugate vaccines, it is crucial to preserve their self&#8208;adjuvant properties during the conjugation step. Considering the absence of cysteine in the Salmonella enterica flagellin FliC sequence, we have investigated the impact of five mutations (A2&#8197;C, K180&#8197;C, T240&#8197;C, D251&#8197;C and S306&#8197;C) alone or in combination on TLR5 activation. The FliC mutated at the four positions K180&#8197;C, T240&#8197;C, D251&#8197;C and S306&#8197;C displayed much the same activity as native flagellin whether the cysteine residues were free or conjugated. These results pave the way for the preparation of self&#8208;adjuvanting conjugate vaccines based on cysteine&#8208;mutated FliC as a carrier protein.

         <title>Structural Biology of RNA and Protein&#8208;RNA Complexes after AlphaFold3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlphaFold is a great research accelerator and hypothesis generator for structural biology and beyond. With the release of AlphaFold3, RNA and protein&#8208;RNA complex structure prediction is readily possible. This review assesses the reliability of these predictions. For the moment, care needs to be taken when AlphaFold3 RNA/protein&#8208;RNA complex structure predictions are used as research hypotheses.







Abstract
Recent breakthroughs in AI&#8208;mediated protein structure prediction have significantly accelerated research and generated valuable hypotheses within the field of structural biology and beyond. Notably, AlphaFold2 has facilitated the determination of larger protein complexes for which only limited experimental data are available. De novo predictions can now be experimentally validated with relative ease compared to the pre&#8208;AlphaFold2 era. In May 2024, AlphaFold3 was launched with high expectations, promising the capability to accurately predict RNA structures and protein&#8208;RNA complexes &#8208; features that were absent in AlphaFold2. This review evaluates the extent to which AlphaFold3 fulfills this promise through specific examples. At present, AlphaFold3 falls short in reliably predicting RNA and protein&#8208;RNA complex structures, particularly for non&#8208;canonical interactions where training data remain scarce. As a result, users should exercise caution when using AlphaFold3 predictions as hypotheses generators for RNA and protein&#8208;RNA complex structures. In the interim, integrating AI&#8208;based predictors with data&#8208;driven docking tools is recommended to address these limitations. This approach can help bridge the gap until sufficient training data are available to enable the development of more reliable predictive algorithms.

         <title>Interactive 3D Objects Enhance Scientific Communication of Structural Data</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, the enhancement of scientific communication through interactive 3D models is presented. In contrast to 2D figures, the use of augmented reality and GLTF files can provide readers with a more comprehensive perception of structural data, preserving the three&#8208;dimensional complexity of published structures. This method has the potential to have a transformative effect on the authors&#8217; efforts to present complex data and improve readers comprehension of molecular interactions at the same time.







Abstract
In scientific communication about three&#8208;dimensional structures, creating two&#8208;dimensional representations is standard practice. These representations often suffer from the drawback of losing potential information due to dimensionality reduction. Several options exist to present, share and publish 3D figures, however based on recent publications they are not widely utilized. Here we present simple ways to preserve the three&#8208;dimensionality of the structure by the creation of a custom&#8208;made model in GLTF format that is generated in the same workflow as the conventional figures. They can be published alongside a given manuscript with minimal additional effort to the authors, but a huge impact on the communicative power of the manuscript concerning the three&#8208;dimensional features of the reported structures. The scripts we adapted and published for this purpose open up new possibilities for the illustrator and allow the viewer to access the full three&#8208;dimensionality of the published structure. In future, this can simplify the publication process of protein structures or other models and be a valuable tool for scientific communication in digital or printed form.

         <title>Nucleic Acid Drugs in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the role of nucleic acid drugs (NADs) in optimizing radiotherapy. It outlines the primary classifications and mechanisms of radiotherapy, as well as the functional categories and applications of NADs. The synergistic effects of NADs and radiotherapy, along with their underlying mechanisms, are also discussed. Overall, NADs present a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes in cancer radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiotherapy remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment, using high&#8208;energy radiation to induce DNA damage in tumor cells, leading to cell death. However, its efficacy is often hindered by challenges such as radiation resistance and side effects. As a powerful class of functional molecules, nucleic acid drugs (NADs) present a promising solution to these limitations. Engineered to target key pathways like DNA repair and tumor hypoxia, NADs can enhance radiotherapy sensitivity. NADs can also serve as delivery vehicles for radiotherapy agents such as radionuclides, improving targeting accuracy and minimizing side effects. This review explores the role of NADs in optimizing radiotherapy, highlighting their mechanisms, clinical applications, and synergies with radiotherapy, ultimately offering a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes in cancer therapy.

         <title>A Practical Approach for Polarity and Quantity Controlled Assembly of Membrane Proteins into Nanoliposomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami was used as the internal skeleton of the liposomes to control the number and polarity of the modular adaptor&#8208;fused OmpF assembly in the membrane to achieve pH&#8208;responsive and size&#8208;selective permeability. This approach offers the potential to construct artificial compartments containing membrane proteins of defined number and polarity, allowing tunable substrate fluxes.







Abstract
Biological membranes achieve selectivity and permeability through protein transporters and channels. The design of artificial compartments with permeable membranes is essential to facilitate substrate and product transfer in enzymatic reactions. In this study, an E. coli outer membrane protein OmpF fused to a modular adaptor was integrated onto a DNA origami skeleton to control the number and polarity of the OmpF trimer. DNA origami skeleton&#8208;guided nanoliposomes reconstituted with functional OmpF exhibit pH&#8208;responsiveness and size&#8208;selective permeability. This approach highlights the potential to construct artificial compartments that incorporate membrane proteins of defined number and polarity, allowing tunable substrate fluxes.

         <title>Cyclization of Short Peptides Designed from Late Embryogenesis Abundant Protein to Improve Stability and Functionality</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late embryogenic abundant (LEA) peptides are short, disordered peptides that enhance Escherichia coli&#8242;s drought stress tolerance. Cyclization of LEA peptides can further improve their properties, such as anti&#8208;desiccation, thereby expanding their potential applications







Abstract
LEA peptides, which are designed based on late embryogenic abundant (LEA) protein sequences, have demonstrated chaperone&#8208;like functions, such as improving drought stress tolerance of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Previous studies have focused on the biological functions of linear LEA peptides. However, the function of cyclic LEA peptide still unknown. This study aimed to explore the cyclic LEA peptides&#8217; bio function like enhance the drought stress tolerance of E. coli by cyclizing the LEA peptide using SICLOPPS (Split Intein Circular Ligation of Peptides and Proteins). The results indicated that cyclization significantly improved the function and extended the potential applications. At the same time, we found that peptides containing numerous lysine residues exhibited reduced performance, which may be due to the exteins&#8217; residues affecting the SICLOPPS efficiency.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Linked Apo&#8208;Zinc Finger Protein for Ubiquitin Delivery in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minor modification to the side arm of a traditionally non&#8208;cell penetrating peptide, zinc finger protein, utilizing boronic acid, has transformed its characteristics into those of a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, as evidenced by the delivery of the protein Ubiquitin in live A549 cells.







Abstract
Delivering cargo into live cells has extensive applications in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) provide an ideal solution for cellular delivery. Enhancing CPPs with additional functional units can improve delivery efficiency. We investigate the conjugation of boronic acid modules to enhance internalization through interactions with cell surface glycans. The aim of this study is to determine whether adding boronic acid can transform a peptide that typically lacks CPP properties into one that functions as a CPP, enabling the delivery of crucial biological cargo like ubiquitin (Ub). The zinc finger protein in its apo state was selected as a &#8220;boronate&#8208;enabled&#8221; CPP. Results indicate that skeletal point mutations and post&#8208;synthetic modifications, combined with conjugated benzoboroxole derivatives, enable the apo&#8208;ZFP the ability to transport Ub within A549 cells, confirmed through microscopy and flow cytometry. This effective internalization of cargo offers valuable insights for advancing the development of boronic acid&#8208;mediated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.

We investigate the conjugation of boronic acid modules to enhance internalization through interactions with cell surface glycans. The aim of this study is to determine whether adding boronic acid can transform a peptide that typically lacks CPP properties into one that functions as a CPP, enabling the delivery of crucial biological cargo like ubiquitin (Ub). The zinc finger protein in its apo state was selected as a &#8220;boronate-enabled&#8221; CPP. Results indicate that skeletal point mutations and post-synthetic modifications, combined with conjugated benzoboroxole derivatives, enable the apo-ZFP the ability to transport Ub within A549 cells, confirmed through microscopy and flow cytometry. This effective internalization of cargo offers valuable insights for advancing the development of boronic acid-mediated cell-penetrating peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugation of Human N&#8208;Glycans Improves the Drug Properties of Existing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation is one of the most ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modifications observed in peptides and proteins. It affects the structural and functional characteristics of these macromolecules, thereby exerting a profound influence on a multitude of biological processes. N&#8208;Glycans are expected to be a beneficial modifier for increasing the solubility and in vivo half&#8208;life, and reducing the aggregation and immunogenicity of native bioactive peptides and proteins, which have seen limited clinical utility due to their short blood half&#8208;life and unsuitable physicochemical properties. Chemoselective glycosylation reactions that can be conducted post&#8208;synthesis and in aqueous conditions are a promising strategy for the high&#8208;throughput development of peptide/protein drugs. This &#8220;glycoconjugation&#8221; approach is particularly advantageous in that manipulation of glycan protecting groups is not necessary, thereby allowing conjugation reactions to be carried out between target molecules and unprotected glycans. By providing a single glycosylation profile, i.e., glycan structure, number, and position, glycoconjugation not only allows the beneficial properties of N&#8208;glycans to be exploited, but also facilitates the investigation of N&#8208;glycan function.</dc:description>

         <title>Wireframe DNA Origami Capable of Vertex&#8208;protruding Transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating dynamic behavior of the designed molecular structures provides a foundation for the construction of functional molecular devices. DNA nanotechnology allows conformational changes in two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional DNA origami nanostructures by introducing flexibility between the faces of the structures. However, dynamic transformations in wireframe DNA origami, composed solely of vertices and edges, remain challenging due to vertex&#8208;specific flexibility. We report a wireframe DNA origami capable of vertex&#8208;protruding transformation between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;form with eight protruding vertices. This reversible transformation is driven by DNA hybridization and a toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction. Spacer strands between vertices and edges were designed to introduce flexibility. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that a longer spacer increases conformational flexibility and can achieve the narrow angles required for the vertex&#8208;protruding transformation. The experimental results showed the successful assembly of the open&#8208;form structure under optimized salt conditions, as visualized through transmission electron microscopy images. Furthermore, the transformation between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;form structures was demonstrated by the sequential addition of signal strands. This vertex&#8208;protruding transformation mechanism will expand the design approach of dynamic DNA nanostructures and help develop functional molecular devices for artificial molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>d&#8208;Alanine, a circadian metabolite that regulates glucose metabolism and viral infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>d&#8208;Alanine, a rare d&#8208;amino acid, exhibits a clear circadian rhythm and is present in organs associated with glucose metabolism. Recent findings have revealed that d&#8208;alanine acts on the circadian rhythm, thereby regulating physiological processes related to circadian cycles that are essential for maintaining body homeostasis. The regulation of circadian rhythm by d&#8208;alanine is vital for correcting blood glucose levels in diabetic conditions. In viral infections, d&#8208;alanine serves as a sensitive biomarker that reflects the severity of the infection, as its level drastically decreases due to consumption. Supplementation with d&#8208;alanine is effective to alleviate the progression of viral infections, potentially through the maintenance of the circadian rhythm and its associated immune responses. In addition to its role as a circadian biomarker, d&#8208;alanine also functions as a circadian regulator and exerts a wide range of physiological effects. This review summarizes the physiological roles of d&#8208;alanine as a circadian metabolite.</dc:description>

         <title>Entrapment of Lipase from Candida antarctica in a Xerogel for the Production of Biodiesel from Waste Cooking Oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methodology to synthesize a silica&#8208;based xerogel and immobilize the lipase from Candida antarctica (CALB) by entrapment, keeping its stability and activity without leaching. The modified status of the xerogel, from solid bloc to solid powder, brings better reagent diffusion as shown in the production of biodiesel with repetitive reuse.







Abstract
The process to synthesize biodiesel is well&#8208;developed and optimized to overcome the disadvantages like the competition with agriculture using feedstock, and the problematics in the process. Oils from waste and enzymatic catalysis have proven to be good solutions to these problems. Lipases are currently the most commonly used enzymes in the transesterification of oils; nevertheless, enzymes have a high cost and must be immobilized to offer repetitive reuse. This work focuses on the synthesis and the optimization of the conditions of a xerogel where the lipase from Candida antarctica is immobilized by entrapment. The xerogel synthesized here, a glass&#8208;like material, proved to be very effective in maintaining the enzyme on its structure, with an immobilization yield of 96&#8201;% and an activity of 5.3&#8197;U/mg (free lipase=12.1&#8197;U/mg). By grinding this xerogel, the immobilization yield remained constant (94&#8201;%). Nevertheless, grinding the xerogel allowed better diffusion of reagents, and the activity reached 9.7&#8197;U/mg. Using this xerogel in biodiesel production had a positive effect on CALB efficiency by increasing the biodiesel yield, 46.1&#8201;% against 15.1&#8201;% with free CALB. Finally, the catalyst could be reused for five runs without loss of activity.

         <title>d&#8208;Galactose&#8208;Esterification of a Fungal Polyketide Catalyzed by a Carnitine Acyltransferase Domain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TrgA, a highly reducing polyketide synthase bearing a C&#8208;terminal carnitine acyltransferase domain (cAT), is heterologously reconstituted to biosynthesize trichogalactin. The cAT domain of TrgA offloads and esterifies the polyketide product with d&#8208;galactose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Dephosphorylation of TrgA product by an alkaline phosphatase completes the biosynthesis of the d&#8208;galactose&#8208;esterified polyketide.







Abstract
While sugar&#8208;containing natural products are commonly biosynthesized via glycosyltranferases using sugar&#8208;UDP as the electrophile, nature has evolved alternative strategies of glyco&#8208;modification to expand the diversity of natural products. Hydroxyl groups on sugars can serve as nucleophiles in the release of polyketide products from polyketide synthases. Herein, we demonstrate a highly reducing polyketide synthase (HRPKS) from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum T22, which is terminated with a carnitine acyltransferase (cAT) domain, catalyzes the biosynthesis of a d&#8208;galactose esterified polyketide named as trichogalactin. Structure&#8208;guided enzymatic assays showed that the sugar nucleophile in the esterification reaction catalyzed by cAT is &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;galactose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P) instead of free d&#8208;galactose. The released product, trichogalactin phosphate, is subsequently dephosphorylated by a host alkaline phosphatase to complete the biosynthesis of trichogalactin. The cAT domain is highly specific for Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P and does not accept &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate or &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Our study expands the inventory of natural products from an agriculturally important fungus and demonstrates the potential of mining cAT&#8208;containing HRPKSs to discover new glyco&#8208;esterified natural products.

TP&#8208;5 lipopeptide nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with OVA antigens were obtained by ultrasonic preparation based on the principle of charge interaction. Toll&#8208;like receptors (TLR) on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) recognized and phagocytosed the nanovaccine OVA/R1P4 NPs. Subsequently, TLR activation promoted the maturation of DCs and presentation of antigens to CD8+ T cells, which facilitated the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor site and secreted IFN&#8208;&#947; to directly kill the tumor cells, exerting anti&#8208;tumor immune effects.

Abstract
In clinical practice, thymopentin (TP&#8208;5) is a commonly utilized immunomodulatory peptide drug. The relatively short half&#8208;life of TP&#8208;5, however, significantly limits its applicability in immunotherapy. Inspired by the structure of the TLR2 ligand lipopeptide Pam3CSK4, fatty acid&#8208;modified TP&#8208;5 peptides were designed and synthesized in this study. Utilizing its amphiphilicity, they were sonicated to assemble into nanoparticles with the diameters of approximately 100&#8197;nm. Compared with TP&#8208;5, TP&#8208;5 monopalmitate&#8208;modified nanoparticle has immune&#8208;activating properties both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. It markedly increased TNF&#8208;&#945; secretion from RAW264.7 cells and aided in the maturation of DCs. The immunogenicity of OVA model antigen was increased in&#8197;vivo when capsulated by TP&#8208;5 lipopeptide nanoparticle, which considerably slowed the growth of B16&#8208;OVA melanoma. This fatty acid&#8208;modified TP&#8208;5 assembled nanoparticle offers a straightforward and useful delivery system for the design of innovative nanovaccine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Functional Proteins/Peptides Targeting to Clear Amyloid&#8208;&#946; for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clearance of toxic amyloid &#946;&#8208;protein (A&#946;) proteins from the brain has become the preferred therapeutic approach for reversing the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and delaying its clinical course. Anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs have been developed through various mechanisms. This article discussed the current development of anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs and their clinical progress, and then introduced potential drug development targets from both central and peripheral perspectives to develop safer and more effective anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting individuals over the age of 65. It is characterized by impairments in memory, thinking, analytical judgment, visuospatial recognition, and mood. In recent years, the development of protein and peptide drugs targeting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) has gained momentum, with several therapies entering clinical trials and even receiving marketing approval. Novel functional protein and peptide drugs, as the first&#8208;generation immunotherapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases, have pioneered cellular immunotherapy for AD. However, the currently available drugs are associated with toxicity issues, which can lead to serious complications such as cerebral hemorrhage or edema. Consequently, this study examines the potential for a new generation of A&#946;&#8208;targeting drugs to mitigate the side effects of existing treatments and offers innovative perspectives for the advancement of therapies for AD.

         <title>Advanced Synthesis of Spherical Nucleic Acids: A Limit&#8208;Pursuing Game with Broad Implications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, the synthesis of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), an important class of bionanomaterials with widespread uses, has been greatly advanced toward reduced time consumption and record&#8208;high DNA densities. Starting from the classical salt&#8208;aging method, this concept introduces the innovative strategies based on low&#8208;pH, freezing&#8208;thawing, and dehydration conditions toward high quality SNA synthesis, with a focus on their mechanistic understanding and wide implications to various future pursuits.







Abstract
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consist of DNA strands arranged radially and packed densely on the surface of nanoparticles. Due to their unique properties, which are not found in naturally occurring linear or circular DNA, SNAs have gained widespread attention in fields such as sensing, nanomedicine, and colloidal assembly. The rapidly evolving applications of SNAs have driven a modernization of their syntheses to meet different needs. Recently, several advanced approaches have emerged, enabling ultrafast, quantitative, and low&#8208;cost SNA synthesis with maximal DNA grafting through &#8220;counterintuitive&#8221; processes like freezing and dehydration. This concept paper discusses these critical developments from a synthetic perspective, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and broad implications, with a goal of inspiring future research in related fields.

         <title>HPPE Activates NRF2 Signaling by Liberating Heavy Metal Stores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported BACH1 inhibitor HPPE is found to drive an antioxidant gene program independently of BACH1. Instead, BACH1 is characterized here to activate NRF2 by acting as an ionophore, liberating heavy metals and inducing non&#8208;lethal levels of reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
The Cap'n'collar transcription factor BACH1 represses the transcription of gene products involved in oxidative stress protection. Accordingly, agents capable of inhibiting the activity of BACH1 would be of keen interest in treating several autoimmune and age&#8208;related diseases. Here, we report that a previously annotated BACH1 inhibitor, HPPE, does not inhibit BACH1 but instead activates a NRF2 driven transcription program that is dependent on the canonical cysteine sensors of NRF2 inhibitory protein KEAP1. Mechanistically, HPPE acts as an ionophore, liberating cellular Zn2+ stores and inducing non&#8208;lethal levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in KEAP1 inactivation. These data provide a surprising mechanism by which HPPE acts in cells and suggest that inducing small amounts of cellular stress may be a viable mechanism for activating NRF2 therapeutically.

         <title>Recombinant Production of The Cyclotide Kalata B1 by Conditional Split Inteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A workflow to generate cyclic peptides from easily obtainable precursor proteins was established. The peptide is embedded in a split intein system that can be expressed in E. coli and purified via IMAC. Simply mixing the two precursor proteins starts conversion at will, yielding cyclic peptides. The intein&#8208;made cyclic peptide kalata B1 is structurally and functionally identical to synthetic/native preparations.







Abstract
This study describes the design, production, and characterization of a novel conditional intein system for the recombinant production of cyclic peptides. The system is based on two key features: (1) a promiscuous extein recognition site allowing cyclization of virtually any peptide, and (2) a secondary split site within the intein itself enabling triggered splicing at will. Two intein precursors were recombinantly expressed, purified, and then self&#8208;assembled in&#8197;vitro to cyclize the model peptide kalata B1 (kB1). Cyclized kB1 was successfully purified, refolded, and characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR, demonstrating correct disulfide bond formation and identical structure to synthetic kB1. Importantly, the intein&#8208;derived kB1 retained full biological activity as evidenced by insect cell toxicity assays. This work establishes a versatile and efficient approach for intein&#8208;mediated protein cyclization with potential applications in bioengineering and peptide discovery.

Imine reductases (IREDs) offer promising synthesis routes for chiral amines. We have demonstrated reductive amination of diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines, catalyzed by Myxococcus stipitatus IRED. Incorporating a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system showcases the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlighting IREDs&#8217; biocatalytic potential.







Abstract
Imine reductases (IREDs) provide promising opportunities for the synthesis of various chiral amines. Initially, asymmetric imine reduction was reported, followed by reductive aminations of aldehydes and ketones via imines. Herein we present the reductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), catalyzed by the IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus. In analogy to IRED&#8208;catalyzed reductive aminations, various carbonyls and dicarbonyls could react with simple hydrazines to produce substituted acyclic and cyclic N&#8208;alkylhydrazines. By incorporating and scaling up a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system, we demonstrated the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of an H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlightling the potential of IREDs in biocatalysis.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Oxygen&#8208;Independent DNA Photodegradation by Pheophorbide a: Implications for Future Photodynamic Therapy Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the oxygen&#8208;independent photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA provides new insights into potential photodynamic therapy strategies. Our study highlights Phed a&#8217;s ability to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals under anoxic conditions, allowing for effective DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). This capability may enhance cancer treatment in hypoxic environments.







Abstract
This study explores the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA under anoxic conditions, emphasizing its potential for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in hypoxic tumor environments. We used electron spin resonance (ESR), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to assess the radical generation and DNA interaction capabilities of Phed a compared to Pyropheophorbide a (Pyro a) under both oxygenated and anoxic conditions. Our results reveal that Phed a effectively degrades G&#8208;quadruplex DNA in the absence of oxygen, whereas Pyro a does not. Under anoxic conditions, Phed a generates unique carbon&#8208;centered radicals, as indicated by distinctive ESR signals, which are not observed in aerobic environments or with Pyro a. These radicals facilitate DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phed a&#8217;s ability to degrade DNA independently of oxygen underscores its potential as a versatile and effective PDT agent, especially for hypoxic tumors where traditional photosensitizers are ineffective. This study paves the way for the development of new PDT agents that can operate under different oxygen levels. Phed a&#8217;s radical generation and oxygen&#8208;independent DNA degradation mechanisms make it a promising candidate for future PDT applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Sheet&#8208;Mediated Multivalent Capture of Cells with Enhanced Tunability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cell&#8208;capture surface is constructed by conjugating ligand&#8208;functionalized 2D peptide assemblies to an antifouling glass substrate. These sheet&#8208;like scaffolds allow non&#8208;uniform, patchy presentation of ligands with control over their identity, number, and spatial distribution. With this surface design, enhancements in multivalent cell&#8208;targeting affinity and selectivity are achieved.







Abstract
We report the creation of multivalent ligand surfaces for cell capture by conjugation of ligand&#8208;appended 2D peptide assemblies on an antifouling glass substrate. The sheet&#8208;like structures organize ligands into non&#8208;uniform, patchy patterns, enhancing multivalent cell targeting. A 155&#8201;% increase in captured cells was achieved compared to the presentation of the ligands on surfaces lacking the peptide sheets. Being orthogonal to the commonly used dendrimer&#8208; and cyclic organic molecular&#8208;based scaffolds, this peptide assembly&#8208;based approach offers a facile method to modulate the identity, number, and spatial distribution of ligands through controlled peptide coassembly. Using this method, we constructed a surface bearing two types of ligands, which demonstrates a 128&#8201;% enhancement in targeting selectivity between two model cells compared to the mono&#8208;ligand surface. These findings illustrate that integration of peptide assemblies into ligand substrates permits robust and effective manipulation of multivalent cell targeting, advancing the development of customizable cell&#8208;binding materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging&#8208;guided Photothermal Activated Pyroptosis For Precision Therapy Of Glioma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer therapy faces challenges with apoptosis resistance, steering focus towards alternative pathways like pyroptosis. Photothermal therapy (PTT) offers a precise, non&#8208;invasive method to reduce pyroptosis&#8208;related side effects by using NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging for glioma targeting. A polymer semiconductor PTT agent, coated by mesoporous silica, showed potential in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo pyroptosis induction, offering a promising method for glioma therapy.







Abstract
The resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis poses a significant challenge in cancer therapy, driving the exploration of alternative cell death pathways such as pyroptosis, known for its rapid and potent effects. While initial efforts focused on chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis, concerns about systemic inflammation highlight the need for precise activation strategies. Photothermal therapy emerges as a promising non&#8208;invasive technique, minimizing pyroptosis&#8208;related side effects by targeting tumors spatially and temporally. However, accurately pinpointing tumors to avoid collateral damage remains a challenge. Thus, we utilize NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging to achieve precise PTT&#8208;induced pyroptosis activation in glioma. A polymer semiconductor&#8208;based PTT agent was developed with high optical stability, integrated with mesoporous silica to enhance its biocompatibility. These nanoparticles, stabilized through PEG modification and targeted with cRGD peptides, effectively induced pyroptosis in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, this design facilitated precise tumor imaging guidance and subsequent pyroptosis activation in&#8197;vivo, presenting a promising strategy for glioma therapy with minimized adverse effects.

         <title>Oligoadenine Strand Functionalized Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Film Exhibiting pH&#8208;Triggered High&#8208;Degree Inverse Shape Deformations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the formation of parallel duplex A&#8208;motif structures under acidic conditions, oligoadenine strands (A&#8208;strands) functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films exhibited pH&#8208;responsive macroscopic reversal shape deformation.







Abstract
Smart shape&#8208;memory DNA hydrogels, which can respond to various types of external stimuli and undergo macroscopic shape deformations, have shown great potential in various applications. By constructing free&#8208;standing films, the deformation and response properties of these hydrogels can be further enhanced, and visualized deformation can be achieved. However, DNA hydrogels that can exhibit rapid and high&#8208;degree shape deformations, such as the inverse shape deformations, are still lacking. Herein, free&#8208;standing oligoadenine strand&#8208;functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films were developed that can exhibit reversible and high degree of inverse shape deformation upon cyclic pH changes. The oligoadenine strands exhibit a pH&#8208;stimulated reversible conformational transition between a flexible single&#8208;stranded state and parallel duplex A&#8208;motif structures, resulting in their role change in the film from negatively charged side chains to &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; crosslinking structures, driving a high degree of inverse shape deformation with a relative bending angle change of 223.7&#8201;% of the film, which is more than 5 times that of a film driven by pH&#8208;responsive i&#8208;motif structures, facilitating the development of bilayer hydrogel film actuators with potential in flexible sensors and robots.

     alt="Oligoadenine Strand Functionalized Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Film Exhibiting pH-Triggered High-Degree Inverse Shape Deformations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the formation of parallel duplex A-motif structures under acidic conditions, oligoadenine strands (A-strands) functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films exhibited pH-responsive macroscopic reversal shape deformation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart shape-memory DNA hydrogels, which can respond to various types of external stimuli and undergo macroscopic shape deformations, have shown great potential in various applications. By constructing free-standing films, the deformation and response properties of these hydrogels can be further enhanced, and visualized deformation can be achieved. However, DNA hydrogels that can exhibit rapid and high-degree shape deformations, such as the inverse shape deformations, are still lacking. Herein, free-standing oligoadenine strand-functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films were developed that can exhibit reversible and high degree of inverse shape deformation upon cyclic pH changes. The oligoadenine strands exhibit a pH-stimulated reversible conformational transition between a flexible single-stranded state and parallel duplex A-motif structures, resulting in their role change in the film from negatively charged side chains to &#8220;head-to-head&#8221; crosslinking structures, driving a high degree of inverse shape deformation with a relative bending angle change of 223.7&#8201;% of the film, which is more than 5 times that of a film driven by pH-responsive i-motif structures, facilitating the development of bilayer hydrogel film actuators with potential in flexible sensors and robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Cleavage with an Oligo&#8208;Ribonucleoprotein Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic sgRNA structure could be modified by adding oligo DNA. The assembly of oligo&#8208;sgRNA with Cas9 protein (oligo&#8208;RNP) could modulate the Cas9 cleavage on on&#8208;target and off&#8208;target DNA. The oligo&#8208;RNP could be further delivered into mammalian cells for improving genome editing specificity.







Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated protein Cas9 system has been widely used for genome editing. However, the editing or cleavage specificity of CRISPR Cas9 remains a major concern due to the off&#8208;target effects. The existing approaches to control or modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage include engineering Cas9 protein and development of anti&#8208;CRISPR proteins. There are also attempts on direct modification of sgRNA, for example, structural modification via truncation or hairpin design, or chemical modification on sgRNA such as partially replacing RNA with DNA. The above&#8208;mentioned strategies rely on extensive protein engineering and direct chemical or structural modification of sgRNA. In this study, we proposed an indirect method to modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage without modification on Cas9 protein or sgRNA. An oligonucleotide was used to form an RNA&#8208;DNA hybrid structure with the sgRNA spacer, creating steric hindrance during the Cas9 mediated DNA cleavage process. We first introduced a simple and robust method to assemble the oligo&#8208;ribonucleoprotein (oligo&#8208;RNP). Next, the cleavage efficiency of the assembled oligo&#8208;RNP was examined using different oligo lengths in&#8197;vitro. Lastly, we showed that the oligo&#8208;RNP directly delivered into cells could also modulate Cas9 activity inside cells using three model gene targets with reduced off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>A Novel Concept for Cleavable Linkers Applicable to Conjugation Chemistry &#8211; Design, Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiol selective reactivity of aryl sulfonamide and physiological thiol gradient between extra&#8208; and intracellular milieus set the foundation for developing novel non&#8208;disulfide based cleavable linkers, however the success of these linker designs was highly dependent on the electronic nature of the arylsulfonamide substituents.







Abstract
Linkers with disulfide bonds are the only cleavable linkers that utilize physiological thiol gradients as a trigger to initiate the intracellular drug release cascade. Herein, we present a novel concept exploiting the thiol gradient phenomena to design a new class of cleavable linker with no disulfide bond. To support the concept, an electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamide&#8208;based cleavable linker amenable to conjugation of drug molecules with targeting agents, was developed. Modulating the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl sulfonamide was critical to the balance between the stability and drug release. Favorable stability and payload release in human serum under physiologically relevant thiol concentrations was demonstrated with two potent cytotoxics. Intracellular payload release was further validated in cell&#8208;based assay in context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugate generated from monoclonal antibody and sulfonamide containing linker. To support the proposed release mechanism, possible downstream by&#8208;products formed from the drug&#8208;linker adduct were characterized.

         <title>Proteomic Profiling of Potential E6AP Substrates via Ubiquitin&#8208;based Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Assisted Affinity Enrichment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable E6AP&#8208;Ub conjugate equipped with diazirine moieties (Ub&#8208;DEA), which mimics an essential intermediate in HECT ligase catalyzed ubiquitination and allows covalent substrate trapping by photo&#8208;crosslinking (PCL). We validate our approach in PCL&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (PCL&#8208;AE&#8208;MS) experiments and argue for its general applicability.







Abstract
The ubiquitin (Ub) ligase E6AP, encoded by the UBE3A gene, has been causally associated with human diseases including cervical cancer and Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Yet, our knowledge about disease&#8208;relevant substrates of E6AP is still limited, presumably because at least some of these interactions are rather transient, a phenomenon observed for many enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions. Here, we introduce a novel approach to trap such potential transient interactions by combining a stable E6AP&#8208;Ub conjugate mimicking the active state of this enzyme with photo&#8208;crosslinking (PCL) followed by affinity enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry (AE&#8208;MS). To enable PCL, we equipped Ub with diazirine moieties at distinct positions. We validated our PCL assisted AE&#8208;MS approach by identification of known (e.&#8201;g. PSMD4, UCHL5) and potential new (e.&#8201;g. MSH2) substrates of E6AP. Our findings suggest that PCL assisted AE&#8208;MS is indeed suited to identify substrates of E6AP, thereby providing insights into E6AP&#8208;associated pathologies, and, potentially, of other enzymes of the Ub&#8208;conjugating system.

         <title>Dual Porphyrin&#8208;Loaded Scintillating Nanoparticles Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy in Hypoxic Cancer Cells under X&#8208;ray Irradiation</title>

Eu&#8208;doped NaYF4 scintillator loaded with dual porphyrins, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as a photosensitizer and hemin (Fe3+&#8208;PPIX) as an oxygen generator (Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin) enhances the activity of X&#8208;ray mediated photodynamic therapy in hypoxic cancer cells via catalase&#8208;like property of hemin in the presence of H2O2.







Abstract
Tumor hypoxia represents a major challenge to achieving successful therapy outcomes with photodynamic therapy (PDT). We hypothesized that systemic loading of dual porphyrins, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as a photosensitizer (PS) and hemin (Fe3+&#8208;PPIX) as an oxygen generator, onto Eu&#8208;doped NaYF4 scintillator (Sc), collectively terms as Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, could enhance the activity of X&#8208;ray mediated PDT. Catalase&#8208;like property of hemin in the presence of H2O2 facilitated the production of oxygen molecules (3O2) in hypoxic cancer cells. The produced 3O2 reacts with nearby excited PPIX molecules (PPIX*) in the Sc&#8208;PS pairs to produce singlet oxygen (1O2), as cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of ~60&#8197;nm efficiently produced oxygen in the presence of H2O2, which its concentration in tumor cells is higher than that in normal cells. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin generated similar amounts of ROS in hypoxic cultured cancer cells under low dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (0.5 Gy), compared to those in normoxic cancer cells. Notably, Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin exhibited similar cytotoxic effects in both hypoxic and normoxic cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Overall, the mutual Sc&#8208;PS performance between PPIX and Eu was synergistically enhanced by hemin in Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, which relieved hypoxia in the cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Various Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Derivatives in Enzyme Supramolecular Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin derivatives are produced and used to build a protective layer shielding surface&#8208;immobilized enzymes. These macrocycles act as artificial chaperones and support protein stability under thermal stress conditions. Along with providing protection to enzymes exposed to chaotropic stress, the macrocycles support protein refolding and activity recovery.







Abstract
Enzyme stability and activity are pivotal factors for their implementation in different industrial applications. Enzyme supramolecular engineering relies on the fabrication of a tailor&#8208;made enzyme nano&#8208;environment to ensure enzyme stability without impairing activity. Cyclodextrins (CDs), cyclic oligomers of glucose, act as protein chaperones and stabilize, upon interaction with hydrophobic amino acid residues exposed at the protein surface, its three&#8208;dimensional structure. When used to build an organosilica layer shielding an enzyme, they enhance the protective effect of this layer. In the present study, we systematically assessed the protective effects of three organosilane derivatives based on &#593;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CDs. A model lipase enzyme was immobilized at the surface of silica nanoparticles and shielded in an organosilica layer containing these organosilanes. Besides layer thickness optimization, the effect of different stressors (i.&#8201;e., temperature, SDS, urea) was tested. Our results showed that organosilica layers produced with CDs improve enzyme thermal stability. They also support enzyme refolding after denaturation under chaotic conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the protective effect of the smallest CD derivative tested, namely &#593;&#8208;CD, surpassed the other macrocycles studied for conferring the immobilized enzyme with higher resistance to stress conditions. This protection strategy was also applied to a thermostable &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme.

         <title>Front Cover: HPPE Activates NRF2 Signaling by Liberating Heavy Metal Stores (ChemBioChem 4/2025)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule ionophore, HPPE, is depicted as a magnet, acting to liberate cellular stores of Zn2+ and Cu2+. Increased levels of labile metal pools result in nonlethal of oxidative stress in cells, sensed by NRF2 repressor protein and oxidative stress sensor, KEAP1. Consequently, NRF2 is stabilized, resulting in the transcriptional activation of cytoprotective genes, illustrated as a shield with a medical cross. More details can be found in the article 10.1002/cbic.202400529 by Rebecca Freeman and Michael J. Bollong.

         <dc:description>
The imine reductase (IRED) from Myxococcus stipitatus catalyses the reductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), which are also known as rocket fuels. This efficient process produces acyclic and cyclic N&#8208;alkylhydrazines, demonstrating the scalability and potential of IREDs for sustainable &#8242;green&#8242; chemical synthesis using H&#8322; as the reducing agent.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the basic components of dynamic DNA nanostructures and discusses the application of DNA logic circuits based on these structures in cancer diagnosis and treatment. These logic circuits use cancer markers or external stimuli as input signals and achieve accurate diagnosis and treatment of tumors through logical operations, showing their potential in the field of precision cancer medicine.







Abstract
DNA logic gates with dynamic nanostructures have made a profound impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment. Through programming the dynamic structure changes of DNA nanodevices, precise molecular recognition with signal amplification and smart therapeutic strategies have been reported. This enhances the specificity and sensitivity of cancer theranostics, and improves diagnosis precision and treatment outcomes. This review explores the basic components of dynamic DNA nanostructures and corresponding DNA logic gates, as well as their applications for cancer diagnosis and therapies. The dynamic DNA nanostructures would contribute to cancer early detection and personalized treatment.

         <title>Engineering Gas&#8208;Releasing Nanomaterials for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 4, February 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, including NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, as well as synergistic therapeutic strategies with other treatment modalities such as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are discussed in wound repair.







Abstract
The escalating prevalence of tissue damage and its associated complications has elicited global apprehension. While nanomaterial&#8208;based wound healing exhibits significant potential in terms of curbing infections and surpassing conventional methods, unresolved concerns regarding nanomaterial controllability and precision remain unresolved, jeopardizing its practical applications. In recent years, a unique strategy for creating gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials for wound repair has been proposed, involving the creation of gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials to facilitate wound repair by generating gas donor moieties.

&lt;p&gt;Numerous gas-releasing nanomaterials, including NO, CO, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as synergistic therapeutic strategies with other treatment modalities such as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are discussed in wound repair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating prevalence of tissue damage and its associated complications has elicited global apprehension. While nanomaterial-based wound healing exhibits significant potential in terms of curbing infections and surpassing conventional methods, unresolved concerns regarding nanomaterial controllability and precision remain unresolved, jeopardizing its practical applications. In recent years, a unique strategy for creating gas-releasing nanomaterials for wound repair has been proposed, involving the creation of gas-releasing nanomaterials to facilitate wound repair by generating gas donor moieties. The operational spatiotemporal responsiveness and broad-spectrum antibacterial properties of these gases, combined with their inability to generate bacterial resistance like traditional antibiotics, establish their efficacy in addressing chronic non-healing wounds, specifically diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). In this review, we delve into the intricacies of wound healing process, emphasizing the chemical design, functionality, bactericidal activity, and potential of gas-release materials, encompassing NO, CO, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for effective wound healing. Furthermore, we explore the advancements in synergistic therapy utilizing these gases, aiming to enhance our overall comprehension of this field. The insights gleaned from this review will undoubtedly aid researchers and developers in the creation of promising gas-releasing nanomaterials, thus propelling efficient wound healing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Phenolics: Alternative Substrates for Type III Copper Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;containing metalloenzyme tyrosinase is well known for synthesis of melanin pigments and enzymatic browning of fruits and vegetables. These reactions proceed from phenolics, but tyrosinases can also convert aromatic amines. This perspective brings together the scarce data on the enzymatic conversion of non&#8208;phenolic substrates by these important enzymes.







Abstract
The type III copper enzyme family of tyrosinases (TYRs) catalyzes the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and oxidation of phenols as well as the two&#8208;electron oxidation of catechols to ortho&#8208;quinones. TYRs use copper ions as their tightly bound cofactors and utilize molecular oxygen as their cosubstrate. They are responsible for physiologically important reactions like the formation of melanin, the primary pigment animals apply for protection against UV light. While the reactivity of TYRs on substrates containing aromatic hydroxy groups (i.&#8201;e. phenols) is well recognized, reports clearly demonstrating that TYRs are active on aromatic amines as well have gone largely unnoticed. In this perspective we aim to bring together the sparse data on non&#8208;phenolic TYR substrates to illustrate the potential of TYRs for the oxidation of aminophenols and anilines. The activity of TYRs on aromatic amines extends the substance classes amenable to biotechnological production with TYRs from catechols to N&#8208;phenyl imines and phenoxazinone derivates and calls for the inclusion of TYRs among the candidates for oxidative modification of aromatic amines in metabolic pathways.

         <title>NMR Solution Structure of the N&#8208;terminal GSPII Domain from the Thermus thermophilus Traffic ATPase PilF and Reconstruction of its c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP Binding Capability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclic dinucleotide c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP is an important second messenger molecule in bacteria and interacts with a variety of receptor molecules including RNA and protein domains. An important class of c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding protein domains are the general secretory pathway type II (GSPII) domains as exemplified by the N&#8208;terminal domain of the ATPase MshE from Vibrio cholerae (MshEN). MshEN binds monomeric c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP via two consecutive copies of a 24&#8208;residue sequence motif, which form a compact 4&#8208;&#945;&#8208;helical bundle. The ATPase PilF from Thermus thermophilus regulates pilus formation, motility and DNA&#8208;uptake. Its N&#8208;terminal section contains three consecutive GSPII domains (GSPII&#8208;A &#8211; GSPII&#8208;C) all with considerable sequence homology to MshEN. While the GSPII&#8208;B and the GSPII&#8208;C domains bind c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP, the GSPII&#8208;A domain does not. To determine why it is incapable of c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding we determined the NMR&#8208;solution structure of this domain. Our structure shows how small deviations in the consensus motif sequence, a stabilizing N&#8208;terminal helical capping motif and intersubdomain interactions absent in MshEN cooperate to prevent c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding. By combining point mutations and truncations, we re&#8208;established the c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding capability. Our findings shed new light on the evolution and functional diversification of GSPII domains and the importance of sequence variations for protein activity in this domain family.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalently Mercurated 6&#8208;Phenylcarbazole Residues Promote Hybridization of Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organomercury derivatives of 6&#8208;phenylcarbazole can stabilize triple helices when placed at the termini of triplex&#8208;forming homothymine oligonucleotides. In some cases, this stabilization could be attributed to direct coordination of a Hg(II) ion to adenine&#8208;N7 or cytosine&#8208;N4. For Hg(II)&#8208;mediated interaction with both partners of a base pair, the carbazole scaffold would have to be further extended.







Abstract
Homothymidine DNA oligonucleotides bearing a 3'&#8208;terminal 6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole C&#8208;nucleoside, mercurated at position 1, 8 or both, were synthesized and tested for their potential to form triple helices with homoadenine&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;homothymine duplexes. The monomercurated triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides favored hybridization with fully matched double helices and in some cases considerable increase of the melting temperature could be attributed to Hoogsteen&#8208;type Hg(II)&#8208;mediated interaction with the homoadenine strand. The dimercurated one, on the other hand, favored hybridization with double helices placing a homo mispair opposite to the carbazole residue, suggesting that simultaneous coordination of each of the two Hg(II) ions to a different strand is only possible in the absence of competition from Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing.

         <title>Engineering Gizmos for Short Cancer Genetic Fragments Discrimination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny Gizmos, mixtures of nucleic acids and organic/inorganic materials, can quickly identify cancer&#8208;specific short base&#8208;sequence fragments and help suggest appropriate medications.







Abstract
Currently, mankind is fiercely struggling with cancer. Recently, we have been winning the battle against cancer through precision medicine and accompanying diagnostic methods, and we are raising many hopes with blockbuster drugs. It would be even better if we could read the cancer nucleotide sequence, identify them in advance, and suggest treatments simultaneously. However, this may be an impossible dream because it takes a lot of time and effort to diagnose and ensure all the long gene sequences of cancer at once. Thus, victory will be even closer if a rapid and accurate diagnosis of the cancer&#8208;specific gene biomarkers that will soon be imprinted can be made. With the advent of nanotechnology, a new short cancer diagnostic toolkit has been proposed to achieve the goal. This review presents a small diagnostic device that detects certain cancers&#8242; genetic fragments (simply &#8216;Gizmo&#8217;). The development of numerous diagnostic methods has focused on (1) directly detecting pre&#8208;selectively targeted genes using novel diagnostic systems, and (2) indirectly detecting substantial improvements in diagnostic sensitivity only through detection signal amplification without existing gene amplification steps. Our fight against cancer is not a dream, but the result of success, and it is assumed that victory will accelerate as soon as possible.

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Profiling of Olaparib Interactors Using a Biotinylated Photoaffinity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel interactors found for olaparib: Olaparib is an important anti&#8208;cancer drug in BRCA&#8208;mutated cancers. In this study, we identified novel interactors for olaparib using photoaffinity labeling. We designed a biotinylated photoaffinity probe and used it in a proteomic screening to discover a broad range of olaparib interactors, including previously unreported proteins, contributing to the current understanding of olaparib&#8216;s pharmacology.







Abstract
Olaparib is a widely used PARP inhibitor for the treatment of BRCA&#8208;mutated cancers. To comprehensively understand the drug&#8216;s clinical impact, measuring its interactions with intended on&#8208; and off&#8208;targets is crucial. In this study, olaparib&#8216;s on&#8208; and off&#8208;targets were profiled using photoaffinity labeling, a powerful, proteome&#8208;wide method for studying the direct interactions between a drug and its protein targets. A novel photoaffinity probe was designed and used in a proteomic screening to discover novel targets of olaparib in the human proteome. The probe, incorporating a pre&#8208;installed biotin group, bypasses the limitations of using a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed click reaction in cell lysates for reporter group conjugation and revealed a broad range of olaparib interactors, including previously unreported proteins, in a quantitative mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomic screening using HeLa whole cell lysate. This study contributes to our current understanding of the pharmacology of olaparib and provides a valuable tool for elucidating drug interactors within cell lysates, potentially guiding the development of more targeted therapeutics with fewer off&#8208;targets.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Sensitive Tracking of Peroxynitrite during Drug&#8208;Induced Hepatotoxicity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ratiometric fluorescent probe, PFVEI, has been rationally designed for the detection of ONOO&#8722;. This probe incorporates indole salt, furan ring, and benzene ring structures, exhibiting a rapid reaction rate, high sensitivity, and excellent stability towards ONOO&#8722;. Furthermore, PFVEI has been successfully employed to track endogenous ONOO&#8722; and to visualize the concentration changes of ONOO&#8722; during hepatotoxicity.







Abstract
As an essential component of reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) plays an indispensable role in redox homeostasis and signal transduction, with anomalous levels implicated in various clinical conditions. Therefore, accurate and rapid detection of intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels is crucial for revealing its role in physiological and pathological processes. In this study, we developed a ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect ONOO&#8722; levels in biological systems. The probe demonstrated a fast reaction rate (within 15&#8197;min), outstanding selectivity, high sensitivity (limit of detection=13.32&#8197;nM), and stability in the presence of ONOO&#8722;. The proposed probe was successfully used for visualizing endogenous ONOO&#8722; in living cells and tracking changes in intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels during drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity using ratiometric fluorescence.

         <dc:description>
Upon photo&#8208;irradiation, homobifunctional photocaged 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dials (bis&#8208;PBDAs) react with amine&#8208;rich biomolecules to form stable, well&#8208;defined crosslinks. In addition to their use in biopolymer preparation, bis&#8208;PBDAs facilitate effective cell fixation without significantly altering cellular morphology or interfering with biochemical analyses, such as protein/mRNA extraction and immunofluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Crosslinking amine&#8208;rich biomolecules with aldehydes, such as paraformaldehyde (PFA) and glutaraldehyde (GA), is a widely used method for biomaterial fabrication and cell fixation. In this study, we introduce homobifunctional photocaged 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dials (bis&#8208;PBDAs) as novel amine&#8208;reactive photo&#8208;crosslinkers. Compared to PFA and GA, bis&#8208;PBDAs are inherently less toxic. Upon photo&#8208;deprotection, bis&#8208;PBDAs efficiently react with the amino groups of biomolecules, such as carboxymethyl chitosan and histone H3, forming stable, well&#8208;defined crosslinks. Even at low concentrations (~100&#8197;&#956;M), bis&#8208;PBDAs facilitate effective cell fixation without significantly altering cellular morphology or interfering with biochemical analyses, including protein/mRNA extraction and immunofluorescence imaging. Therefore, bis&#8208;PBDAs are promising reagents for crosslinking amine&#8208;rich biopolymers and hold great potential in biomaterial fabrication and the fixation of living cells and tissues.

         <title>Lanthanides Gd and Tm Can Inhibit Carnitine/Acylcarnitine Transporter: Insights from All&#8208;Atoms Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibition of CAC transporter, an important mitochondrial protein, by Pr3+, Gd3+ and Tm3+ lanthanides is studied in the framework of all&#8208;atoms MD simulations. In presence of cations, it is shown that c&#8208;state to m&#8208;state conformational change occurs spontaneously, providing atomistic explanation of the protein's channel occlusion and inhibition.







Abstract
Recent experimental evidence highlighted the inhibition of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), an important mitochondrial transmembrane protein for living organisms, by the early lanthanide Pr3+. A possible explanation of such a behaviour was found in the preference of the cation for amino acids like aspartate and glutamate containing a carboxylate in the side chain, laying in the inter&#8208;membrane space. Interaction of the cation with these residues can cause halt the transfer of the protein&#8216;s substrates between the matrix and cytoplasm thus opening to new scenarios concerning the CAC&#8208;metal interactions and its relative inhibition. In the present work, the panel of metals binding the CAC protein is predictively expanded including Gd3+ and Tm3+, selected as representative species of middle and late lanthanides, respectively. A more realistic membrane&#8208;containing model of the protein was built and the comparative analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CAC apo&#8208;form with its complexed systems, named CAC&#8722;Pr, CAC&#8722;Gd and CAC&#8722;Tm, was performed. The analysis of the trajectories revealed that the inhibition is caused by the coordination of D132 and E179 to the cations and that such interactions generate a reorganization of important salt&#8208;bridges inside the framework of CAC. In detail, MD simulations highlighted that a spontaneous conformational change from cytoplasmatic&#8208;state (c&#8208;state) to matrix&#8208;state (m&#8208;state) induced by cations and that, in this condition, the protein channel is occluded, thus explaining the inhibition.

In presence of cations, it is shown that c-state to m-state conformational change occurs spontaneously, providing atomistic explanation of the protein's channel occlusion and inhibition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent experimental evidence highlighted the inhibition of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), an important mitochondrial transmembrane protein for living organisms, by the early lanthanide Pr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. A possible explanation of such a behaviour was found in the preference of the cation for amino acids like aspartate and glutamate containing a carboxylate in the side chain, laying in the inter-membrane space. Interaction of the cation with these residues can cause halt the transfer of the protein&#8216;s substrates between the matrix and cytoplasm thus opening to new scenarios concerning the CAC-metal interactions and its relative inhibition. In the present work, the panel of metals binding the CAC protein is predictively expanded including Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Tm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, selected as representative species of middle and late lanthanides, respectively. A more realistic membrane-containing model of the protein was built and the comparative analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CAC apo-form with its complexed systems, named CAC&#8722;Pr, CAC&#8722;Gd and CAC&#8722;Tm, was performed. The analysis of the trajectories revealed that the inhibition is caused by the coordination of D132 and E179 to the cations and that such interactions generate a reorganization of important salt-bridges inside the framework of CAC. In detail, MD simulations highlighted that a spontaneous conformational change from cytoplasmatic-state (c-state) to matrix-state (m-state) induced by cations and that, in this condition, the protein channel is occluded, thus explaining the inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Aspartate Transcarbamoylase: A Promising Broad&#8208;spectrum Target for Drug Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential for a wide variety of cellular processes and are synthesized either via a salvage pathway or through de novo biosynthesis. The latter is particularly important in proliferating cells, such as infectious diseases and cancer cells. Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the first committed and rate&#8208;limiting step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, making it an attractive therapeutic target for various diseases. This review summarizes the development of a series of allosteric ATCase inhibitors, advancing them as potential candidates for malarial, tuberculosis and cancer therapies. Furthermore, it explores the potential for these compounds to be expanded into drugs targeting neglected tropical diseases, antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens, and their possible application as herbicides. We identify the likely equivalent allosteric pocket in these systems and perform a structure and sequence&#8208;based analysis of the resides comprising it, providing a rationale for continued exploration of this compound series as both specific and broad&#8208;range inhibitors. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research into ATCase inhibitors, given their potential broad applicability in treating diverse diseases to enhance both human health and agricultural practices.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Biocatalytic and Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid increase in demand for longer and/or modified oligonucleotides calls for the development of improved strategies for their production. We review recent biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic methods to construct oligonucleotides, highlighting innovations in enzyme engineering, and substrate optimization for various applications. We address crucial details of the methods and describe remaining challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Access to synthetic oligonucleotides is crucial for applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology. Traditional solid phase synthesis is limited by sequence length and complexities, low yields, high costs and poor sustainability. Similarly, polymerase&#8208;based approaches such as in&#8197;vitro transcription and primer extension reactions do not permit any control on the positioning of modifications and display poor substrate tolerance. In response, biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategies have emerged as promising alternatives, offering selective and efficient pathways for oligonucleotide synthesis. These methods leverage the precision and efficiency of enzymes to construct oligonucleotides with high fidelity. Recent advancements have focused on optimized systems and/or engineered enzymes enabling the incorporation of chemically modified nucleotides. Biocatalytic approaches, particularly those using DNA/RNA polymerases provide advantages in milder reaction conditions and enhanced sustainability. Chemoenzymatic methods, combining chemical synthesis and enzymes, have proven to be effective in overcoming limitations of traditional solid phase synthesis. This review summarizes recent developments in biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategies to construct oligonucleotides, highlighting innovations in enzyme engineering, substrate and reaction condition optimization for various applications. We address crucial details of the methods, their advantages, and limitations as well as important insights for future research directions in oligonucleotide production.

         <title>Construction of Escherichia coli Cell Factory for Efficient Synthesis of Indigo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have constructed a dual&#8208;enzyme (EcTnaA, MaFMO) cascade pathway for the biosynthesis of indigo from L&#8208;tryptophan and enhanced the enzymatic activity of MaFMO through mechanism&#8208;guided rational design. Subsequently, by optimizing promoters and increasing copy numbers to regulate the expression levels of EcTnaA and MaFMOD197E, under optimal conditions, E.&#8197;coli IND&#8208;13 achieved the highest yield to date using glucose as the substrate.







Abstract
Indigo is widely used in dyes, medicines and semiconductors materials due to its excellent dyeing efficiency, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, anti&#8208;corrosion, and thermostability properties. Here, a biosynthetic pathway for indigo was designed, integrating two enzymes (EcTnaA, MaFMO) into a higher L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;producing the strain Escherichia coli TRP. However, the lower catalytic activity of MaFMO was a bottleneck for increasing indigo titers. To overcome this limitation, the enzyme activity of MaFMO was enhanced through mechanism&#8208;guided rational design. The optimal mutant obtained in this study, MaFMOD197E, whose kcat/Km was 1.34 times that of the wild type, and its specific activity was 2.36 times that of the wild type. In addition, the expression levels of EcTnaA and MaFMOD197E were regulated by optimizing the promoters and increasing the copy number to generate the strain E.&#8197;coli IND&#8208;13. Finally, in the optimal fermentation conditions (220&#8197;rpm, 0.05&#8201;% Tween&#8208;80), the strain E.&#8197;coli IND&#8208;13 achieved the indigo titer of 568.52&#8197;mg/L in a 5&#8208;L bioreactor, with the yield and productivity of 2.62&#8197;mg/g and 12.96&#8197;mg/L/h (the highest to date), respectively. The results presented here can lay a foundation for further construction of cell factories for indigo and its derivatives with industrial application potential.

         <title>Oligomerization of STING and Chemical Regulatory Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights strategies for regulating STING oligomerization, including agonists targeting the C&#8208;terminal cytoplasmic domain (CTD) and the N&#8208;terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). From a mechanical perspective, they function via multi&#8208;interaction or by directly inducing oligomerization of STING.







Abstract
Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a crucial role in innate immunity. Upon the recognition of cytosolic dsDNA, STING undergoes several structural changes, with oligomerization playing a key role in initiating a cascade of immune responses. Therefore, controlling the STING pathway by manipulating STING oligomerization is a practical strategy. This review focuses on the detailed mechanism of STING oligomerization, highlighting its decisive role. It also describes oligomerization&#8208;based strategies to regulate STING protein, such as the use of small&#8208;molecule agonists and biomacromolecules, highlighting their interaction modes and potential therapeutic applications. This knowledge may lead to the development of innovative approaches for treating cancer and immune disorders.

         <title>Harnessing from Nature &#8211; Evolving Potential of Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial peptides are recognized as the first line of the host immune defensive system to combat bacterial infection and regulate the healthy balance of host&#8208;microbe interactions. Benefited from their bactericidal capabilities and efficacy of modulating microbial homeostasis, emerging developments are trying to maximize AMP's biomedical applications for next&#8208;generation antimicrobial agents, peptide therapeutics, advanced biosensing and bioimaging.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are recognized as one of the most ancient components of innate immunity, playing a pivotal role as the first line of host defense systems. These evolutionarily conserved molecules have been identified in various organisms, from prokaryotes to humans. AMPs establish a delicate balanced relationship between host and microbes, by simultaneously regulating the biological activities of pathogens and commensal microbes. Given the escalating global concern over antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to explore alternative strategies to combat challenging infectious diseases. AMPs have emerged as promising candidates employed in clinical practice due to their sustainable bactericidal properties. Witnessed by deep understanding of AMPs actions toward host and bacteria, the potential applications of AMPs extend far beyond infection control. Emerging developments harnessed natural capabilities of AMPs to optimize their roles in modulating host signaling, treating diverse diseases, advancing biosensing and bioimaging technologies. In this Concept paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the diversity and properties of AMPs. Additionally, we elaborate on the mechanisms underlying AMP activity and bacterial responses counteracting AMPs&#8217; functions. Most importantly, we discuss potential biomedical applications of AMPs and offer perspectives on their future development.

These evolutionarily conserved molecules have been identified in various organisms, from prokaryotes to humans. AMPs establish a delicate balanced relationship between host and microbes, by simultaneously regulating the biological activities of pathogens and commensal microbes. Given the escalating global concern over antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to explore alternative strategies to combat challenging infectious diseases. AMPs have emerged as promising candidates employed in clinical practice due to their sustainable bactericidal properties. Witnessed by deep understanding of AMPs actions toward host and bacteria, the potential applications of AMPs extend far beyond infection control. Emerging developments harnessed natural capabilities of AMPs to optimize their roles in modulating host signaling, treating diverse diseases, advancing biosensing and bioimaging technologies. In this Concept paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the diversity and properties of AMPs. Additionally, we elaborate on the mechanisms underlying AMP activity and bacterial responses counteracting AMPs&#8217; functions. Most importantly, we discuss potential biomedical applications of AMPs and offer perspectives on their future development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper Depletion in Tumors Boosts Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increased levels of copper are associated with promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion. In this article, we highlight an innovative and effective approach to enhance immunotherapies for neuroblastoma patients using copper chelation as an adjunct therapy. Copper chelation may be a promising adjunct therapy for cancer treatment by altering the tumor microenvironment, making cancer cells more vulnerable.







Abstract
Copper depletion is being billed as a viable approach for cancer treatment. Vittorio and co&#8208;workers successfully demonstrated that Cuprior, an FDA&#8208;approved drug that binds with copper, effectively enhances anti&#8208;GD2 immunotherapy and improves the responses for neuroblastoma patients. These findings highlight the important role of copper chelation in modulating the tumor microenvironment. This study presented a novel approach to potentiate immunotherapies for neuroblastoma patients, warranting further investigations into copper depletion as a potential adjuvant therapy for other tumors.

         <title>The History of Studies on Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a detailed overview of the development of oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis. By summarizing these developments, we hope that this review will provide comprehensive and valuable insights into oxetane formation in the biosynthesis of paclitaxel and will be useful for metabolic engineering of paclitaxel in the future.







Abstract
There is no doubt that breakthroughs in the enzyme&#8208;mediated formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis constitute significant milestones in the biosynthesis of complex natural products. In this review, we summarize the understanding of the biosynthesis of the oxetane ring of paclitaxel from different viewpoints. Generally, it covers five aspects, (1)&#8197;a different understanding of the mechanistic formation of the oxetane ring on the basis of sound chemical reasoning, (2)&#8197;a reasonable speculation of the biosynthetic pathways and suitable surrogate substrates for oxetane ring formation based on the natural and chemical logical analysis, (3)&#8197;Taxus genome&#8208;enabled enzymes identification, (4)&#8197;the discovery of different enzymes that mediate oxetane ring formation, and (5)&#8197;a mechanistic investigation involving the use of isotopic labelling experiments and quantum chemical calculations. This review provides a detailed overview of the history of the studies on the oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis, which may be useful for a better understanding this process in combined view of nature, chemistry and biology logics, also for efficient heterologous reconstruction of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway in the future.

         <title>Review on the o&#8208;Aminoaniline Moiety in Peptide and Protein Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to prepare functional peptides and protein molecules is essential to understand fundamental biological processes and develop novel therapeutics for numerous diseases. In this review, Hong et&#8197;al. document the development of o&#8208;aminoaniline derivatives for chemical protein synthesis, peptide C&#8208;terminus diversification, and cyclic peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Peptides and proteins are important functional biomolecules both inside and outside of living organisms. The ability to prepare various types of functionalized peptides and proteins is essential for understanding fundamental biological processes, such as protein folding and post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), and for developing new therapeutics for many diseases, such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. The o&#8208;aminoaniline moiety was first proposed for activation to a thioester precursor and used for native chemical ligation to prepare large peptides and proteins. In the past decade, the function of o&#8208;aminoaniline has been greatly expanded to facilitate the preparation of homogeneously modified peptide and protein samples, where the modifications can include cyclization, C&#8208;terminus diversification, etc. Many o&#8208;aminoaniline derivatives have also been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of previous versions. In this review, we attempt to summarize the recent developments of different o&#8208;aminoaniline derivatives, focusing on their application to the preparation of functional peptide and protein molecules.

         <title>Laccase Functional Analysis: Substrates, Activity Assays, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme functional analysis is crucial for evaluating enzyme performance. However, even well&#8208;known enzymes, such as laccase, face challenges with substrates and methods for activity assays. The review examines both commonly and less&#8208;utilized compounds, as well as their associated techniques, methods, and approaches. The review highlights potential strategies to overcome identified gaps.







Abstract
Enzyme functional analysis is a multifaceted process that can be used for various purposes, such as screening for specific activities, as well as developing, optimising, and validating processes or final products. Functional analysis methods are crucial for assessing enzyme performance and catalytic properties. Laccase, a well&#8208;known blue multi&#8208;copper oxidase, holds immense potential in diverse industries such as pharmaceuticals, paper and pulp, food and beverages, textiles, and biorefineries due to its clean oxidation process and versatility in handling a wide range of substrates. Despite its prominence, the use of laccase encounters challenges in selecting appropriate functional analysis substrates and methods. This review delves into the substrates utilised in qualitative and quantitative techniques for laccase activity analysis. Although laccase catalyses mono&#8208;electron oxidation of aromatic hydroxyl, amine, and thiol compounds efficiently, using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor, the review identifies limitations in the specificity of the commonly employed substrates, concerns regarding the stability of certain compounds and highlights potential strategies.

         <title>Development of an Environmentally Responsive Fluorescent Ligand for Vitamin D Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized a novel fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time observation of ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes in the vitamin&#8197;D receptor (VDR). Incorporating a dansyl fluorophore at the C11 position of 1&#945;,25(OH)&#8322;D&#8323;, the probe exhibits turn&#8208;on fluorescence with intensity and wavelength shifts upon VDR binding, reflecting its environmentally responsive properties.







Abstract
Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a critical role in regulating multiple biological processes, including bone metabolism and cell differentiation, by mediating transcriptional activation in response to ligand binding. We have constructed an environmentally fluorescent probe 2 for VDR to facilitate real&#8208;time observation of its ligand&#8208;dependent conformational changes in living cells. This probe 2 was synthesized by introducing a dansyl fluorophore via an ethynyl group at the C11 position of 1&#945;,25(OH)&#8322;D&#8323;. Probe 2 exhibited strong environmentally responsive fluorescence, showing increased intensity and a blue shift of the peak wavelength upon binding to VDR due to the increased hydrophobicity of the environment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Immobilizing Fluorogenic Probe for In Situ Labeling of Granzyme B Activity in Host Immune Response to Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized three granzyme B&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe HCy&#8208;F exhibits in&#8197;situ imaging capabilities, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This advancement provides a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, represent a pressing global health challenge. During the interaction between pathogen infection and host defense, bacterial infections initiate the host's immune response, which involves the activation of proteases that play a critical role in antibacterial defense. Granzyme B (GzmB), a key immune&#8208;related biomarker associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), plays a pivotal role in this process. Therefore, detecting the activity of GzmB is crucial for understanding the host immune response to bacterial infections and for developing therapeutic strategies to overcome bacterial virulence. In this study, we designed and synthesized three granzyme B&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe HCy&#8208;F demonstrates in&#8197;situ imaging capability, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This development offers a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug-resistant bacteria, represent a pressing global health challenge. During the interaction between pathogen infection and host defense, bacterial infections initiate the host's immune response, which involves the activation of proteases that play a critical role in antibacterial defense. Granzyme B (GzmB), a key immune-related biomarker associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), plays a pivotal role in this process. Therefore, detecting the activity of GzmB is crucial for understanding the host immune response to bacterial infections and for developing therapeutic strategies to overcome bacterial virulence. In this study, we designed and synthesized three granzyme B-activated near-infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe &lt;b&gt;HCy-F&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; imaging capability, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This development offers a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Biarylitides: Understanding the Structure and Biosynthesis of a Fascinating Class of Cytochrome P450 Modified RiPP Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biarylitides are fascinating RiPP natural products with small core peptides and diverse peptide crosslinks performed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Here, we address the discovery and diversity of the biarylitides, methods to analyse these constrained cyclic peptides, the structures of the biarylitide P450 enzymes and address alternate catalytic outcomes as recently seen in rufomycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The biarylitides are a recently discovered class of RiPP natural products that are fascinating both from the small size of the core peptides as well as the diversity of peptide crosslinking exhibited by the cytochrome P450 enzymes found in these systems. In this review, we address the discovery and biosynthetic diversity of these systems and discuss the methods and challenges of analysing the structures of these constrained cyclic peptides. We also discuss the structures of the P450 enzymes involved in these pathways and address the potential for alternate catalytic outcomes and activities as seen most recently with the inclusion of biarylitide related enzymes within rufomycin biosynthesis.

         <title>From Antibacterial Activity to Molecular Mechanism: Case Study of Hexapeptide RWWRWW and Its Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8208; and L&#8208;isomers of designed hexapeptides are studied. Sum frequency generation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that D&#8208;isomer forms aggregates via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing the capability to disrupt bacterial membrane; while L&#8208;isomers form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, enabling them to interact with and leading to effective disruption of the membrane.







Abstract
In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a potent weapon against the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Among AMPs, the ones containing tryptophan (W) and arginine (R) exhibit enhanced antimicrobial properties, benefiting from the unique physicochemical features of the two amino acids. Herein, we designed three hexapeptides, including WR, DWR (D&#8208;isomer), and RF, derived from the original sequence, RWWRWW&#8208;NH2 (RW). By combining sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG&#8208;VS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we examined AMPs&#8217; interactions with model bacterial membrane at the molecular level. Our findings revealed the innate different structural features associated with molecular aggregation and membrane activity between L&#8208;(WR, RF and RW) and D&#8208;isomer. The D&#8208;isomer was demonstrated to aggregate via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which reduced its membrane adsorption quantity and consequently weakened its disruptive effect on the model membrane; while L&#8208;isomers rarely aggregated and thus could fully interact with the model membrane. D&#8208;isomer was proven to lack a stable helical structure, while L&#8208;isomers adopted helical structures, which was believed to be the reason for DWR's tendency to aggregate easily. This study should contribute to designing novel short&#8208;chain AMPs with high efficiency, especially in the case that D&#8208;isomers will be used.

         <title>Vanadium Complexes for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This highlight covers recent advances in mitochondria&#8208;targeted vanadium complexes for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in cancer treatment. These complexes demonstrate selective in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity toward cancer cells without harming the normal cells. This review combines stable vanadium complexes with their ROS generation and DNA crosslinking capabilities, this work opening the way for translational research and future clinical applications in targeted cancer therapies.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based drugs have the potential to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy by exhibiting key properties such as appropriate charge, thermodynamic stability, hydrolytic stability, oral bioavailability, and dual functional capability. These properties are critical for effective intracellular uptake, as drugs or prodrugs must cross cellular membranes to target specific organelles like mitochondria, essential for maximizing therapeutic impact. Bio&#8208;essential metal ions such as copper, zinc, and iron are transported through specialized active channels, whereas others depend on passive diffusion to enter cells. Vanadium has gained significant attention in research because of its remarkable coordination flexibility, lipid&#8208;lowering characteristics, and potential anticancer effects. The coordination flexibility of vanadium has led to its investigation in pharmaceuticals, given its demonstrated insulin&#8208;mimetic effects, lipid&#8208;lowering properties, and promising antitumor activities. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a targeted cancer treatment approach through light&#8208;activated compounds that selectively generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cell death. Among metal&#8208;based photosensitizers, vanadium complexes are emerging as effective agents due to their unique redox properties and known biological activity. This minireview explores mitochondria&#8208;targeting vanadium complexes within PDT. Mitochondria serve as an ideal ROS generation site, triggering apoptosis while minimizing damage to healthy cells. We examine key strategies in designing vanadium complexes that enhance mitochondrial localization, photodynamic efficiency, and cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. This review highlights the challenges like photostability and selective targeting, and future directions for advancing vanadium&#8208;based photosensitizers as next&#8208;generation PDT cancer therapies.

         <title>Probing DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex and I&#8208;Motif Structures Via a Fluorescent Nucleoside Analogue: 4&#8208;Cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxyribonucleoside</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was demonstrated that the nucleoside analogue, 4&#8208;cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI&#8208;NS), can serve as a minimally&#8208;perturbing and sensitive fluorescent probe of DNA structure and dynamics. In particular, the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of 4CNI&#8208;NS can be used to distinguish different noncanonical DNA structures, such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs), as well as to monitor the corresponding conformational transitions.







Abstract
Since the building blocks of DNA are nonfluorescent, various external fluorescence reporters have been employed to investigate the structure, dynamics, and function of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs), which play an important role in gene regulation and expression. However, most of those fluorescence reporters lack the ability to provide site&#8208;specific structural information of interest. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fluorescent nucleoside analogues that can be covalently inserted into oligonucleotides, which not only serve this purpose, but minimize any potential perturbation towards the native structure of the DNA systems in question. Herein, we characterize the spectroscopic utility of a high quantum yield fluorescent nucleoside analogue, 4&#8208;cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI&#8208;NS). We show that (1) incorporation of 4CNI&#8208;NS into various oligonucleotides does not alter their ability to fold into their respective native structures, nor does it affect the overall stability of those structures and (2) the fluorescence property of 4CNI&#8208;NS is sensitive to its local environment, and the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of the 4CNI&#8208;NS&#8208;containing oligonucleotides exhibit a clear dependence on their secondary structure formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 4CNI&#8208;NS can be used as a sensitive, isomorphic probe in the study of noncanonical DNA structures.

Comparison of the achiral residue 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and chiral &#945;&#8208;methylated analogues as modifications in a helix&#8208;rich miniprotein reveals a synergistic thermodynamic benefit from C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter. These results help inform the use of these monomers in design of helical peptide mimetics and yield new fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;helix is an abundant and functionally important element of protein secondary structure, which has motivated intensive efforts toward chemical strategies to stabilize helical folds. One such method is the incorporation of non&#8208;canonical backbone composition through an additional methyl substituent at the C&#945; atom. Examples of monomers include the achiral 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) with geminal dimethyl substitution and chiral analogues with one methyl and one non&#8208;methyl substituent. While Aib and chiral C&#945;&#8208;Me residues are both established helix promoting moieties, their comparative ability in this regard has not been quantitatively investigated. Addressing this gap would help to inform the use of these building blocks in the construction of peptide and protein mimetics as well as provide fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding. Here, we report a quantitative comparison of the impacts of Aib and chiral &#945;Me residues on the high&#8208;resolution folded structure and folding thermodynamics of a small helical protein. These results reveal a synergistic stabilizing effect arising from the presence of C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Nucleic Acid Nanostructures for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the most recent progress of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures based on the scaffolds of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA for biological applications, including gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription, due to their excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Nucleic acid, as a carrier of genetic information, has been widely employed as a building block for the construction of versatile nanostructures with pre&#8208;designed sizes and shapes through complementary base pairing. With excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility, nucleic acid nanostructures are extensively applied in biomedical researches, such as bio&#8208;imaging, bio&#8208;sensing, and drug delivery. Notably, the original gene&#8208;encoding capability of the nucleic acids themselves has been utilized in these structurally well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress in the design of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA&#8208;encoded nanostructures for various biological applications, such as gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription. Furthermore, the challenges and future opportunities of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures in biomedical applications will be discussed.

         <title>Target Identification of Marine Natural Product Odoamide:Odoamide Induces Apoptotic Cell Death by Targeting ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Alpha 1 (ATP1A1)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odoamide, a member of the aurilide&#8208;family, exhibits highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. This study clarifies the target protein and MOA of odoamide by an affinity&#8208;based methodology, followed by analyses of the binding protein and odoamide&#8208;resistant cells. We discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of odoamide for drug development.







Abstract
Marine natural products show a large variety of unique chemical structures and potent biological activities. Elucidating the target molecule and the mechanism of action is an essential and challenging step in drug development starting with a natural product. Odoamide, a member of aurilide&#8208;family isolated from Okinawan marine cyanobacterium, has been known to exhibit highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the target protein and the cytotoxic mechanism of odoamide. Compared to existing anticancer agents, odoamide showed a unique fingerprint in the JFCR39 cancer cell panel and a characteristic pattern in gene expression profiling. Affinity chromatography utilizing a biologically active odoamide probe identified ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) as a specific binding protein. Additionally, cells resistant to odoamide were found to have mutations at Gly98 and Gly99 of the ATP1A1 protein. The apparently attenuated cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of odoamide in odoamide&#8208;resistant cells suggests that the induction of these activities by odoamide is critically dependent on its interaction with ATP1A1. We conclude that odoamide induces apoptotic cell death by targeting ATP1A1, and we discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of ATP1A1 inhibitors for drug discovery.

         <title>Activation of Caged Functional RNAs by An Oxidative Transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sUrd) in place of uridine (Urd) can exhibit loss of function. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide can convert 2sUrd to Urd. We show that a 2sUrd&#8208;containing aptamer and ribozyme can exhibit recovery of function upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, allowing for redox&#8208;switched functional behavior.







Abstract
RNA exhibits remarkable capacity as a functional polymer, with broader catalytic and ligand&#8208;binding capability than previously thought. Despite this, the low side chain diversity present in nucleic acids (two purines and two pyrimidines) relative to proteins (20+ side chains of varied charge, polarity, and chemical functionality) limits the capacity of functional RNAs to act as environmentally responsive polymers, as is possible for peptide&#8208;based receptors and catalysts. Here we show that incorporation of the modified nucleobase 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sU) into functional (aptamer and ribozyme) RNAs produces functionally inactivated polymers that can be activated by oxidative treatment. 2&#8208;thiouridine lacksthe 2&#8208;position oxygen found in uridine, altering its hydrogen bonding pattern. This limits critical interactions (e.&#8201;g., G&#8722;U wobble pairs) that allow for proper folding. Oxidative desulfurization of the incorporated 2&#8208;thiouridine moieties to uridine relieves this inability to fold properly, enabling recovery of function. This demonstration of expanded roles for RNA as environmentally responsive functional polymers challenges the notion that they are not known to be redox&#8208;sensitive. Harnessing redox switchability in RNA could regulate cellular activities such as translation, or allow switching RNA between a &#8220;template&#8221; and a &#8220;catalytic&#8221; state in &#8220;RNA World&#8221; scenarios or in synthetic biology.

         <title>Protein Fusion of Biosynthetic Enzymes and a Thermo&#8208;Responsive Polypeptide Expedites Facile Access to Biocatalysts for Nucleotide Sugars</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green preparation and recycle avenue to biocatalysts for nucleotide sugars was established by protein fusion and a thermo&#8208;responsive tag. Using this strategy, five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64 and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) were successfully constructed and applied as biocatalysts. In addition, the ELP&#8208;tagged bifunctional enzymes may also be recycled from reaction solution by simple ITC process.







Abstract
Nucleotide sugars (NSs) are essential building blocks for the enzymatic assembly of glycans. In this study, we established a preparation and recycling avenue to the biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs. This approach involves fusing two enzymes into a bifunctional chimera and using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ET64) as a purification tag, which allows for easy recovery of these biocatalysts without the need for chromatography. We successfully constructed and obtained five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) for the synthesis of five common NSs (UDP&#8208;Gal, UDP&#8208;GlcNAc, GDP&#8208;Man, GDP&#8208;Fuc, and CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac). These enzymes were obtained using the Inverse Transition Cycling (ITC) process in yields ranging from 60 to 124&#8197;mg per liter of fermentation. The enzymatic synthesis of NSs was carried out on a scale from hundreds of milligrams to multiple grams using these biocatalysts. Furthermore, we investigated the reusability of these biocatalysts by recycling them from the reaction solution using the ITC process. The recycling of GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64 was effectively achieved for 15, 13, 3, and 4 times, respectively. These biocatalysts could be used not only for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs but also for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycan biomolecules when coupled with glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Dynamic G&#8208;Quadruplexes in the Rous Sarcoma Virus Genome: Scaffolds for Protein Interaction and Potential Anti&#8208;Viral Targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is an onco&#8208;retrovirus that infects avian species such as the chicken (Gallus gallus). RSV is the first oncovirus to be described, and the oncogenic activity of this virus is related to the expression of a tyrosine kinase that induces carcinogenic transformation. Interestingly, we have noted that the RSV genome contains various potential G4&#8208;forming sequences. Among these, two sequences in the GAG and POL genes show high G4&#8208;forming potential. Additionally, the SRC oncogene also harbours a putative G4 forming sequence. In this study, we have characterised the G4 formation and topology in these three loci in the RSV&#8208;DNA. We have found that these sequences form dynamic G4 structures in physiological conditions, and such dynamicity may be associated with their cellular functions. Further, we have also established that these G4s are recognised by G4 interacting small&#8208;molecule ligands and the G4&#8208;stabilising protein nucleolin. The binding of these ligands induces structural shifts in the G4s, leading to changes in structure and stability. Thus, the RSV&#8208;DNA G4s may be further studied as targets to control its infection and oncogenic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Molecular Basis for G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binders to ALS/FTD&#8208;Associated G4C2 Repeats of the C9orf72 Gene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some neurodegenerative disorders can be driven by recurrent mutations in the C9orf72 gene. These sequences can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex secondary structures. Here, by performing in silico investigations coupled with FRET DNA melting assays, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of organic and organometallic C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders.







Abstract
The most recurrent familial cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the presence of an abnormal number of intronic GGGGCC (G4C2) repetitions in the C9orf72 gene, which has been proposed to drive ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that such G4C2 repetitions can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary structures. These G4s have been selectively stabilized by small&#8208;molecule binders, furnishing proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that targeting these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid sequences represents a novel and effective therapeutic strategy to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. However, precise information on the mechanism of action of these compounds is still lacking. Here, by performing in silico investigations, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of known structurally related C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders. Moreover, we investigated the binding properties of a strong and selective metal&#8208;based G4 stabilizer, the AuI bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex &#8211; Au(TMX)2 &#8211; showing that it moderately stabilizes G4C2 G4 RNA by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) DNA melting assays. Using metadynamics (metaD) simulations, the Au(TMX)2 binding mode and the associated free&#8208;energy landscape were also evaluated. This information paves the way for developing improved compounds to tackle ALS/FTD neurodegenerative disorders.

         <title>Click Hydrogels to Assess Stiffness&#8208;Induced Activation of Pancreatic Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts and Its Impact on Cancer Cell Spreading</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) and migration of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC). Results show that substrate stiffness affects the nuclear localization dynamics of Yes&#8208;associated protein and verify the role of CAFs in promoting PCC migration under an elevated substrate stiffness.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is marked by significant desmoplastic reactions, or the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrices. PDAC stroma has abnormally high stiffness, which alters cancer cell behaviors and creates a barrier for effective drug delivery. Unfortunately, clinical trials using a combination of chemotherapy and matrix&#8208;degrading enzyme have led to disappointing results, as the degradation of stromal tissue likely accelerated the dissemination of cancer cells. High matrix stiffness has been shown to activate cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs), increasing their interaction with pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) through promoting proliferation, migration, and resistance to chemotherapy. With the advance of biomaterials science and engineering, it is now possible to design chemically defined matrices to understand the role of stiffness in activating pancreatic CAFs and how this may alter cancer cell migration. Here, we developed a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of CAFs and migration of PCCs. Our results show that matrix stiffness did not alter matrix deposition from CAFs but affected nuclear localization of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP). Our results also verify the role of CAFs on promoting PCC migration and an elevated substrate stiffness further increased PCC motility.

         <title>4&#8208;O&#8208;Methylglucaric Acid Production from Xylan with Uronic Acid Oxidase and Comparison to Glucaric Acid from Glucose</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beechwood glucuronoxylan was enzymatically hydrolyzed and the resulting 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid by uronic acid oxidase with a yield of 95&#8201;%. High purity (98&#8201;% w/w) 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated from the reaction mixture and was demonstrated to perform similarly to commercial glucaric acid in detergent builder applications.







Abstract
This study describes an enzymatic pathway to produce high purity 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid from xylan, an underutilized fraction of lignocellulosic biomass. Beechwood xylan was enzymatically hydrolysed using a commercial xylanase and an &#945;&#8208;glucuronidase from Amphibacillus xylanus to form 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid, which was then purified by anion exchange chromatography and subsequently oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid using a recombinantly produced uronic acid oxidase from Citrus sinensis. Enzymatic oxidation with uronic acid oxidase afforded 95&#8201;% yield in 72&#8197;hours which is considerably higher than yields previously achieved using a glucooligosaccharide oxidase from Sarocladium strictum. 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated by precipitation and purified by recrystallization. Characterization by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed product identity and high purity (97.8&#8201;% w/w). 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid's performance as a detergent builder was compared to commercial glucaric acid. At 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratios of detergent builder to calcium, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid provided similar calcium sequestration performance to glucaric acid (less than 5&#8201;% difference) at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;10 in the presence of surfactants, including sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate. Given their similar calcium sequestration performance, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid could effectively substitute for glucaric acid in detergent formulations.

         <title>Probing Native CB2 Receptor Mobility in Plasma Membranes of Living Cells by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we employed a novel fluorescent probe, RO7304924&#8212;which selectively targets cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R)&#8212;to assess the lateral mobility of CB2R within the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing a functional, untagged receptor variant. Utilizing confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we quantified the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of CB2R, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of RO7304924 as an innovative tool for elucidating the dynamics of this major endocannabinoid&#8208;binding G protein&#8208;coupled receptor. Our present findings highlight the potential of combining advanced ligand&#8208;based fluorescent probes with FRAP for future investigations into the biochemical details of CB2R mobility in living cells, and its impact on receptor&#8208;dependent cellular processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advance in Sensitive Detection of Demethylase FTO</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO) facilitates the demethylation of m6A in RNA, and its abnormal expression is closely linked to the development of several diseases. This review provides an overview of the progress in FTO detection methods, ranging from traditional approaches to innovative techniques, with a particular emphasis on recently reported advancements.







Abstract
Methylation modification is a critical regulatory mechanism in epigenetics and plays a significant role in various biological processes. N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common modification found in RNA. The fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO) facilitate the demethylation of m6A in RNA, and its abnormal expression is closely linked to the development of several diseases. As a result, FTO has the potential to serve as an important biomarker for clinical disease diagnosis. Despite its significance, there has been a lack of comprehensive reviews addressing advancements in detection methods for the demethylase FTO. This review provides an overview of the progress in FTO detection methods, ranging from traditional approaches to innovative techniques, with a particular emphasis on recently reported advancements. These novel detection methods can be categorized into strategies based on enzymes, functional nucleic acids (FNA), and conformational changes. We summarize the principles and applications of these detection methods and discuss the current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Advances in Drug Delivery Systems for Atopic Dermatitis Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. AD is incurable and prone to recurrence, and the treatment options are limited, we systematically summarize the current common drug delivery systems (DDS) such as liposomes, hydrogels, and nanoparticles, as well as the design of these drug delivery systems for the treatment of AD, the mechanism of the treatment process, and the advantages compared to traditional therapies.







Abstract
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus and impaired skin barrier function. Advances in drug delivery systems have transformed AD treatment by enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Drug delivery systems such as liposomes, hydrogels, and microneedles enable deeper skin penetration, prolonged drug retention, and controlled release, reducing side effects and treatment frequency. Liposomes improve drug absorption and stability, while hydrogels offer high water content and responsive drug release. Microneedles facilitate painless, localized drug delivery, enhancing patient compliance. These systems address the limitations of traditional therapies like topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants, which are associated with adverse effects and poor patient adherence. Recent innovations include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics targeting immune pathways, demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing inflammation and symptoms. Drug delivery systems offer a safer, more efficient alternative for delivering these advanced therapies. By improving therapeutic outcomes and patient experience, drug delivery systems represent a crucial advancement in AD management.
