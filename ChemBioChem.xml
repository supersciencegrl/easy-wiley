         <title>Cryo&#8208;kinetics Reveal Dynamic Effects on the Chemistry of Human Dihydrofolate Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotopologues, enzymes that differ only in their isotopic substitution, engage in a tug of war to determine the role of protein motions and electrostatics for catalysis. The features of the ribbon diagrams indicate that the enzymes are human dihydrofolate reductases. More information can be found in the Communication by R.&#8197;K. Allemann et&#8197;al.

         <title>Labeling and Characterization of Phenol&#8208;Containing Glycopeptides Using Chemoselective Probes with Isotope Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new tools to target natural products (NPs) can be applied to isolate novel NPs from complex samples. We have developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides by the ene&#8208;type reaction. After &#8220;clicking&#8221; with the biotin handle, the labeled NPs can be enriched, followed by the LC&#8208;MS and MSn analysis for structural prediction. Using Amycolatopsis orientalis as an example, a vancomycin&#8208;related glycopeptide was labeled and characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery. More information can be found in the Communication by T.&#8208;S.&#8197;A. Wang et&#8197;al.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of Nitrating Cytochrome P450 TxtE by Active Site Engineering of a Reductase Fusion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tryptophan&#8208;nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE has the potential to be developed into an environmentally benign aromatic nitration biocatalyst. However, the enzyme's narrow substrate tolerance is an impediment to this. The picture shows how randomly mutagenizing a key active site residue led to the discovery of a TxtE variant that efficiently nitrates tryptamine, which is not accepted by the wild&#8208;type enzyme. This demonstrates that directed evolution can be used to create TxtE variants able to nitrate synthetically useful substrates. More information can be found in the Communication by L.&#8197;M. Alkhalaf, G.&#8197;L. Challis et&#8197;al.

         <title>Manufacture of Multilayered Artificial Cell Membranes through Sequential Bilayer Deposition on Emulsion Templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a technology to manufacture multilayered lipid vesicles. Individual bilayers are deposited layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, allowing us to regulate the number of bilayers and their individual composition. This depiction of our structures portrays the self&#8208;assembly underpinning our method (bottom left) and our discovery that phase&#8208;separated domains align with one another through the layers (yellow). The undulating membranes represent the fluctuation analysis technique that we use to show that the mechanical properties of the vesicle scale with the number of layers.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of promiscuous halide methyltransferases enables the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues from alkyl iodides and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine. This facilitates the synthesis of analogues with alkyl groups larger than methyl groups, which can readily be used by methyltransferases. These processes provide access to diverse alkylated products with altered bioactivities, expanding the synthetic potential of methyltransferases. We expect a toolbox of protein&#8208;engineered halide methyltransferase variants to pave the way towards versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations. More information can be found in the Concept article by C.&#8197;P.&#8197;S. Badenhorst, U.&#8197;T. Bornscheuer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Chemoproteomics for Plasmodium Parasite Drug Target Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoproteomics adapted to Plasmodium parasites enable proteome&#8208;wide assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions. These methods assist in target deconvolution of novel antimalarial compounds, commonly discovered in phenotypic screens, that have unknown mechanisms of action. In this review, we detail current methods of label&#8208;based and energetics&#8208;based chemoproteomics and their application for Plasmodium parasite drug target discovery.







Abstract
Emerging Plasmodium parasite drug resistance is threatening progress towards malaria control and elimination. While recent efforts in cell&#8208;based, high&#8208;throughput drug screening have produced first&#8208;in&#8208;class drugs with promising activities against different Plasmodium life cycle stages, most of these antimalarial agents have elusive mechanisms of action. Though challenging to address, target identification can provide valuable information to facilitate lead optimization and preclinical drug prioritization. Recently, proteome&#8208;wide methods for direct assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions have emerged as powerful tools in a number of systems, including Plasmodium. In this review, we will discuss current chemoproteomic strategies that have been adapted to antimalarial drug target discovery, including affinity&#8208; and activity&#8208;based protein profiling and the energetics&#8208;based techniques thermal proteome profiling and stability of proteins from rates of oxidation. The successful application of chemoproteomics to the Plasmodium blood stage highlights the potential of these methods to link inhibitors to their molecular targets in more elusive Plasmodium life stages and intracellular pathogens in the future.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This communication advances the recently developed &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;(Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe)&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for fluorescent labeling of JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV) pentamers. We show a concise (two steps) synthesis of a small molecule &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive probe that is easily tunable for a broad set of fluorescent reporters, solubility, and fluorophore distance from the modification site. With this probe we demonstrate labeling in a structured loop region of a protein and visualize cellular entry of JCPyV viral particles.







Abstract
The major capsid protein VP1 of JC Polyomavirus assembles into pentamers that serve as a model for studying viral entry of this potentially severe human pathogen. Previously, labeling of viral proteins utilized large fusion proteins or non&#8208;specific amine&#8208; or cysteine&#8208;functionalization with fluorescent dyes. Imaging of these sterically hindered fusion proteins or heterogeneously labeled virions limits reproducibility and could prevent the detection of subtle trafficking phenomena. Here we advance the &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for site&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of VP1&#8208;pentamers. We demonstrate a one&#8208;step synthesis of a probe consisting of a bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry handle bridged to a perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive electrophile by a polyethylene glycol linker. We expand the scope of the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation by demonstrating selective labeling of an internal, surface exposed loop in VP1. Thus, the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation offers a general method to selectively bioconjugate tags&#8208;of&#8208;interest to viral proteins without impeding their ability to bind and enter cells.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine to piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde: A lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus (LOXPsa1) was identified, which generated the highly valuable, vanilla&#8208;like aroma compound piperonal through co&#8208;oxidation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper, in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, which also presents a vanilla&#8208;like odor, was produced as second product.







Abstract
The valuable aroma compound piperonal with its vanilla&#8208;like olfactory properties is of high interest for the fragrance and flavor industry. A lipoxygenase (LOXPsa1) of the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was identified to convert piperine, the abundant pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), to piperonal and a second volatile product, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, with a vanilla&#8208;like odor through an alkene cleavage. The reaction principle was co&#8208;oxidation, as proven by its dependence on the presence of linoleic or &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid, common substrates of lipoxygenases. Optimization of the reaction conditions (substrate concentrations, reaction temperature and time) led to a 24&#8208;fold and 15&#8208;fold increase of the piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde concentration using the recombinant enzyme. Monokaryotic strains showed different concentrations of and ratios between the two reaction products.

         <title>Approaches to introduce helical structure in cysteine&#8208;containing peptides with a bimane group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An  i&#8208;i+4 or  i&#8208;i+3 bimane&#8208;containing linker was introduced into a peptide known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;) in order to stabilise an &#945;&#8208;helical geometry. These macrocycles were studied by CD and NMR to reveal the  i&#8208;i+4&#160;constrained peptide adopts a 310&#8208;helical structure in solution, and an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation on interaction with the ER&#945; coactivator recruitment surface&#160;in silico. An acyclic bimane&#8208;modified peptide is also helical, when it includes a tryptophan or tyrosine residue; but is significantly less helical with a phenylalanine or alanine residue, which indicates such a bimane modification influences peptide structure in a sequence dependent manner. The fluorescence intensity of the bimane appears influenced by peptide conformation, where helical peptides displayed a fluorescence increase when TFE was added to phosphate buffer, compared to a decrease for less helical peptides. This study presents the bimane as a useful modification to influence peptide structure as an acyclic peptide modification, or as a side&#8208;chain constraint to give a macrocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Basis of Selectivity and Activity for the Antimicrobial Peptide Lynronne&#8208;1 Informs Rational Design of Peptide with Improved Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we describe the biophysical characterization of Lynronne&#8208;1, an antimicrobial peptide found in the bovine rumen microbiome. We reveal the location of an amphipathic helix containing all six cationic residues, and observe lipid&#8208;selective folding, membrane&#8208;binding and lysis. Our structural data were used to design three variants with changes in the size of the hydrophobic helical face, one of which yielded 32&#8208;fold improved activity in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to human health, with natural products remaining the best source for new antimicrobial compounds. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural products with great potential for clinical use as they are small, amenable to customization, and show broad&#8208;spectrum activities. Lynronne&#8208;1 is a promising AMP identified in the rumen microbiome that shows broad&#8208;spectrum activity against pathogens such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Here we investigated the structure of Lynronne&#8208;1 using solution NMR spectroscopy and identified a 13&#8208;residue amphipathic helix containing all six cationic residues. We used biophysical approaches to observe folding, membrane partitioning and membrane lysis selective to the presence of anionic lipids. We translated our understanding of Lynronne&#8208;1 structure to design peptides which varied in the size of their hydrophobic helical face. These peptides displayed the predicted continuum of membrane&#8208;lysis activities in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and yielded a new AMP with 4&#8208;fold improved activity against A. baumannii and 32&#8208;fold improved activity against S. aureus.

         <title>Caged Cumate Enables Proximity&#8208;Dependent Control Over Gene Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for visualizing cellular interactions was developed based on the cumate genetic switch. Nitrile&#8208;caged cumate released by activator cells induces gene expression in neighboring reporter cells.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;cell interactions underlie diverse physiological processes yet remain challenging to examine with conventional imaging tools. Here we report a novel strategy to illuminate cell proximity using transcriptional activators. We repurposed cumate, a small molecule inducer of gene expression, by caging its key carboxylate group with a nitrile. Nitrilase&#8208;expressing activator cells released the cage, liberating cumate for consumption by reporter cells. Reporter cells comprising a cumate&#8208;responsive switch expressed a target gene when in close proximity to the activator cells. Overall, this strategy provides a versatile platform to image and potentially manipulate cellular interactions over time.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Optical Ligands That Selectively Detect A&#946; Pathology in Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In several neurodegenerative diseases, the presence of aggregates of specific proteins in the brain is a significant pathological hallmark; thus, developing ligands able to bind to the aggregated proteins is essential for any effort related to imaging and therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based ligands containing nitrogen heterocycles. The ligands selectively recognized amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates in brain tissue from individuals diagnosed neuropathologically as having Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). The selectivity for A&#946; was dependent on the position of nitrogen in the heterocyclic compounds, and the ability to bind A&#946; was shown to be reduced when introducing anionic substituents on the thiophene backbone. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of ligands that can differentiate between aggregated proteinaceous species comprised of distinct proteins. These ligands might also be powerful tools for studying the pathogenesis of A&#946; aggregation and for designing molecules for imaging of A&#946; pathology.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Strategies and Tools Available for Interrogation of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The attachment of a single O&#8208;linked b&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of numerous proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and plays an important role as a regulator of various cellular processes in both healthy and disease states. Advances in strategies and tools that allow for the detection of dynamic O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins have helped to enhance our initial and ongoing understanding of its dynamic effects on cellular stimuli and given insights into its link to the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases. Furthermore, chemical genetic strategies and related tools have been successfully applied to a myriad of biological systems with a new level of spatiotemporal and molecular precision. These strategies have started to be used in studying and controlling O&#8208;GlcNAcylation both in vivo and in vitro. In this mini&#8208;review, overviews of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided. In addition, chemical genetic strategies that have already been applied or are potentially usable in O&#8208;GlcNAc functional are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Responsive Singlet Oxygen Nanocarriers for Hypoxic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypoxia in the aggressively proliferating tumor cells has been demonstrated to restrict the efficiency of photodynamic therapy owing to its oxygen (O  2  )&#8208;dependent generation of singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) from photosensitizers under light irradiation. To address this problem, we propose a small&#8208;molecule dye&#8208;based  1  O  2  capturing agent (  B1  ).  B1  not only bears with the near&#8208;infrared absorbing azo boron dipyrromethene backbone, but also owns 1,4&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene, which facilitates to capture  1  O  2  to form the endoperoxide (  B1&#8208;SO  ). On the other hand,  B1&#8208;SO  undergoes the reversible reaction via the near&#8208;infrared photothermal stimulation, thus allowing  1  O  2  release. Based on this mechanism, the stable  B1&#8208;SO  containing micelles (  B1&#8208;SO NPs  ) are prepared and employed as the  1  O  2  nanocarriers to ablate cancer cells  in vitro  . Taking advantages of the O  2  &#8208;independent  1  O  2  release ability,  B1&#8208;SO NPs  have demonstrated efficient cytotoxicity under the near&#8208;infrared irradiation, especially in hypoxic environment. The unique O  2  &#8208;independent  1  O  2  generation process of  B1&#8208;SO NPs  warrant them as novel cancer phototherapy agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Per&#8208;glycosylation of the Surface&#8208;Accessible Lysines: One&#8208;Pot Aqueous Route to Stabilized Proteins with Native Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical glycosylation of proteins is achieved via a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol, to pursue indiscriminate modification of the surface accessible amines. This facile method, drastically simpler than site&#8208;specific glycosylation, afforded a highly desired stabilization of proteins against aggregation and fibrillation, with a minimal change to the protein activity.







Abstract
Chemical glycosylation of proteins is a powerful tool applied widely in biomedicine and biotechnology. However, it is a challenging undertaking and typically relies on recombinant proteins and site&#8208;specific conjugations. The scope and utility of this nature&#8208;inspired methodology would be broadened tremendously by the advent of facile, scalable techniques in glycosylation, which are currently missing. In this work, we investigated a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol to achieve indiscriminate, surface&#8208;wide glycosylation of the surface accessible amines (lysines and/or N&#8208;terminus). We reveal that this approach afforded minimal if any change in the protein activity and recognition events in biochemical and cell culture assays, but at the same time provided a significant benefit of stabilizing proteins against aggregation and fibrillation &#8208; as demonstrated on serum proteins (albumins and immunoglobulin G, IgG), an enzyme (uricase), and proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease (&#945;&#8208;synuclein) and diabetes (insulin). Most importantly, this highly advantageous result was achieved via a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol performed on native proteins, bypassing the use of complex chemical methodologies and recombinant proteins.

         <title>Comparison of Two DNA Aptamers for Dopamine Using Homogeneous Binding Assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 11, Page 1948-1954, June 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two very different DNA aptamers have been reported for dopamine, one derived from an RNA aptamer (named Apt1) and other obtained via direct aptamer selection (named Apt2). In this study, we used four homogeneous binding assays to compare these two DNA dopamine aptamers. Apt1 does not appear to be able to bind dopamine specifically, while Apt2 showed specific binding and could be used for developing related biosensors.







Abstract
Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter and its detection is important for bioanalytical chemistry. Two very different DNA aptamers have been reported for dopamine, one derived from an RNA aptamer (named Apt1) and other obtained via direct aptamer selection (named Apt2). In this study, we used four homogeneous binding assays to compare these two DNA dopamine aptamers. Thiazole orange (TO) fluorescence assay indicated that the Apt2 specifically bound with dopamine with a Kd of 2.37&#8197;&#956;M, which was consistent with that from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. However, Apt1 had much less TO fluorescence change and also no signal from ITC. By labeling the two ends of the two aptamers by a fluorophore and a quencher, the aptamer beacons showed binding of dopamine only for Apt2. Finally, the label&#8208;free AuNP&#8208;based colorimetric assay showed no difference between these two aptamer sequences, and even non&#8208;binding random DNA showed the same response, indicating that AuNPs were not a good probe for detecting dopamine. According to the data, Apt1 does not appear to be able to bind dopamine specifically, while Apt2 showed specific binding and could be used for developing related biosensors.

         <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand&#8208;Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 11, Page 1901-1907, June 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bigger cage, bigger effect: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo by using guest&#8208;molecule&#8208;modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5&#8242; terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.







Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)&#8208;induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.

Transforming transcription: Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcription systems that rely on exogenous and endogenous cues to conditionally control the function of dCas9 proteins or gRNAs have provided pioneering platforms for genome engineering, cell&#8208;specific sensing and therapies.







Abstract
The clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats&#8208;associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR&#8208;Cas9) and the nuclease&#8208;deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized our ability to precisely engineer and regulate genomes. Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein using exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for the spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing, and so on. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in conditionally controlling CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcriptional systems through gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.

         <title>Supramolecular Interaction of Molecular Cage and &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase: Application in Enzymatic Inhibition, Drug Delivery and Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 11, Page 1955-1960, June 2, 2021. </description>

The effect of a water&#8208;soluble PdII8 molecular cage towards &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme activity was studied. The cage disintegrates in the presence of the enzyme and inhibits the enzyme by mixed mode of inhibition. This inhibition strategy and encapsulated hydrophobic curcumin inside the cage were used to control the growth of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.







Abstract
Enzyme inhibitors play a crucial role in diagnosis of a wide spectrum of diseases related to bacterial infections. We report here the effect of a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled PdII8 molecular cage towards &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme activity. The molecular cage is composed of a tetrapyridyl donor (L) and cis&#8208;[(en)Pd(NO3)2] (en=ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) acceptor and it has a hydrophobic internal cavity. We have observed that the acceptor moiety mainly possesses the ability to inactivate the &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme activity. Kinetic investigation revealed the mixed mode of inhibition. This inhibition strategy was extended to control the growth of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The internalization of the Pd(II) cage inside the bacteria was confirmed when bacterial solutions were incubated with curcumin loaded cage. The intrinsic green fluorescence of curcumin made the bacteria glow when put under an optical microscope. Furthermore, this curcumin loaded molecular cage shows an enhanced antibacterial activity. Thus, PdII8 molecular cage is quite attractive due to its dual role as enzyme inhibitor and drug carrier.

         <title>Exchange of Proteins in Liposomes through Streptolysin O Pores</title>

Taking a pore view of bioreactors: Streptolysin O creates pores in liposome membranes allowing proteins to permeate them. Enzymes including RNA polymerase can be supplied through these pores, allowing RNA to be synthesized in liposomes. The method could broaden the application of liposomes as biochemical reactors.







Abstract
Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. However, one of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. We used the toxic protein streptolysin O (SLO); this forms pores in membranes made of phospholipids containing cholesterol that can be closed by the addition of calcium ions. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9&#8201;% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98&#8208;kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in &#8764;8&#8201;% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.

         <title>Harnessing Multiple, Nonproteogenic Substitutions to Optimize CSP:ComD Hydrophobic Interactions in Group&#8197;1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>

Unnaturally optimized: The use of unnatural amino acids allowed the optimization of hydrophobic interactions between CSP1 and the cognate ComD1 receptor by assessing how multiple, coordinated substitutions in the CSP1 amino acid sequence can affect CSP1 binding.







Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence&#8208;stimulating peptide (CSP)&#8208;mediated quorum&#8208;sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in S. pneumoniae can therefore be used to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility to resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and nonproteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure&#8211;activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP&#8208;based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.

         <title>Two Triterpene Synthases from Imperata cylindrica Catalyzing the Formation of a Pair of Diastereoisomers through Boat or Chair Cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 11, Page 1992-2001, June 2, 2021. </description>

Controlling conformation during cyclization: I. cylindrica produces the diastereomeric triterpenes isoarborinol and fernenol depending on whether the B&#8208;ring of oxidosqualene was in a boat or chair conformation during cyclization. Mutational studies on the two enzymes resulted in partial conversion of the products. Placing a histidine residue at a critical site resulted in the production of a rare triterpene.







Abstract
Imperata cylindrica is known to produce a pair of triterpenes, isoarborinol and fernenol, that exhibit identical planar structures but possess opposite stereochemistry at six of the nine chiral centers. These differences arise from a boat or a chair cyclization of the B&#8208;ring of the substrate. Herein, we report the characterization of three OSC genes from I. cylindrica. IcOSC1 and IcOSC5 were identified as isoarborinol and fernenol synthases, respectively, while IcOSC3 was characterized as a multifunctional enzyme that produces glutinol and friedelin as its major products. Mutational studies of isoarborinol and fernenol synthases revealed that the residues surrounding the DCTAE motif partially affected the conformation of the B&#8208;ring during cyclization. Additionally, the IcOSC1&#8208;W255H mutant produced the rare triterpene boehmerol. The introduced histidine residue presumably abstracted a proton from the intermediary carbocation at C18 during the 1,2&#8208;rearrangement. Expression analysis indicated that all OSC genes were highly expressed in stems.

         <title>Probing the Interaction of Huntingtin Exon&#8208;1 Polypeptides with the Chaperonin Nanomachine GroEL</title>

Polyglutamine expansion within the region of huntingtin encoded by exon&#8208;1 of the htt gene results in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We show that the chaperonin GroEL, the bacterial homolog of human mitochondrial Hsp60, inhibits fibril formation of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 peptides and probe the interaction using NMR relaxation&#8208;based experiments designed to explore short&#8208;lived sparsely populated states.







Abstract
Huntington's disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon&#8208;1 region of huntingtin (httex1), resulting in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various httex1 constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy, we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of httex1 constructs with intact GroEL and a mini&#8208;chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation&#8208;based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100 to 400&#8197;&#956;s with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of &#8764;1&#8211;2&#8197;mM. The binding interface is formed by the N&#8208;terminal amphiphilic region of httex1 (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric httex1 by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.

         <title>Construction of a CRISPR&#8208;Biolayer Interferometry Platform for Real&#8208;Time, Sensitive, and Specific DNA Detection</title>

Threefold detection: A CRISPR biosensor is immobilized on a biolayer to construct a CRISPR&#8208;BLI platform for DNA detection. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI chip is rapid, label&#8208;free, and real&#8208;time, and has high sequence affinity and specificity due to the properties of BLI and the CRISPR probe. Coupling with PCR improves the sensitivity to 1.34&#8197;pg, revealing promising applications in dsDNA detection.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been widely applied for nucleic acid detection because of its high specificity. By using the highly specific and irreversible bond between HaloTag and its alkane chlorine ligand, we modified dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR/Cas9) with biotin as a biosensor to detect nucleic acids. The CRISPR biosensor was facilely prepared to adequately maintain its DNA&#8208;recognition capability. Furthermore, by coupling biolayer interferometry (BLI) with the CRISPR biosensor, a real&#8208;time, sensitive, and rapid digital system called CRISPR&#8208;BLI was established for the detection of double&#8208;stranded DNA. The CRISPR biosensor immobilised on the biolayer could recruit the target DNA onto the biosensor surface and change its optical thickness, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern and responding signal of the BLI. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system was further applied to detect the ALP gene of Escherichia coli DH5&#945; combined with a polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated a linear range from 20 to 20&#8201;000&#8197;pg and a low detection limit (1.34&#8197;pg). The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system is a promising approach for rapid and sensitive detection of target DNA analytes.

Se for yourself: We present a biocatalytic synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing pyrimidine nucleosides. Optimization of the reaction conditions improved the solubility and stability of the sensitive starting materials as well as previously observed low conversions. This approach offers a concise alternative to traditionally employed multistep routes to these compounds.







Abstract
Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The widespread application of 2&#8208;selenopyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Herein, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80&#8201;&#176;C and at pH&#8197;9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10, and therefore differ by an order of magnitude from the equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, and this complicates their synthesis significantly. A tenfold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48&#8201;% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40&#8201;% isolated yield, which compares favorably to established chemical routes.

         <title>Approaches to Evaluate the Impact of a Small&#8208;Molecule Binder to a Noncatalytic Site of the Proteasome</title>

Investigating the impact of small molecules: There are a number of essential protein&#8211;protein interactions between the 19S regulatory particle and 20S core particle to form the full 26S proteasome. We investigated whether a small&#8208;molecule binder to Rpn&#8208;6, a 19S subunit, could disrupt 26S proteasome activity.







Abstract
Proteasome activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. In recent years, small molecules have been discovered that can affect the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Rather than targeting the active sites of the proteasome, it might be possible to affect ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of proteins by limiting the association of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) with the 20S core particle (20S CP) of the proteasome. We recently described the discovery of TXS&#8208;8, a peptoid that binds to Rpn&#8208;6. Rpn&#8208;6 is a proteasome&#8208;associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Herein, we present a general workflow to evaluate the impact of a small&#8208;molecule binder on proteasome activity by using TXS&#8208;8 as an example. This workflow contains three steps in which specific probes or overexpressed proteins in cells are used to determine whether the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome is affected. Although, in our case, TXS&#8208;8 did not affect proteasome activity, our workflow is highly amenable to studying a variety of small&#8208;molecule&#8211;proteasome subunit interactions.

The newly developed NeuA stains live neurons, such as photoreceptor cells in the retina. The cover feature picture shows the NeuA&#8208;stained retina in the cross cryosection after tail vein injection. NeuA highly stains the outer segment layer and cell bodies of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). With this characteristic, this study demonstrated that NeuA distinguishes between healthy and photoreceptor degenerate retinas as an in vivo application. More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;L. Silver, Y.&#8208;T. Chang et&#8197;al.

Aligning the adaptor protein sequences: The image shows all sequences derived from PRMT5 adaptor proteins RioK1, pICln and COPR5, that were tested. The consensus sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] was identified, synthesized, and found to bind potently to PRMT5, highlighted as white sequence parts at the highest affinity binding peptides. White alanines represent the sequences, where the mutation to alanine reduced binding between peptide and PRMT5 the most. Protein truncation and the crystal structure of PRMT5 in complex with a RioK1 derived peptide confirmed the binding and illuminated a novel protein&#8211;protein interaction site on the TIM&#8208;barrel domain.

Sugar modifications on proteins enable cells to respond quickly to environmental cues. We review the plethora of chemical strategies to access precise glycoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc peptides and full proteins and explore the translational use of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptides and glycoproteins as biomarkers, mechanistic probes, and therapeutics. Synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycobiology is poised to rapidly identify roles in chronic and infectious disease.







Abstract
All human cells use O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modifications (O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists in defining precise roles for specific O&#8208;GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non&#8208;genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of O&#8208;GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this review details the state of the art of two strategies for O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modification: advances in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; installation of O&#8208;GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure&#8211;function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational O&#8208;GlcNAc biology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Two&#8208;Photon AIEgens and Their Application in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 11, Page 1871-1883, June 2, 2021. </description>

Improving potential: Two&#8208;photon AIEgen probes have attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages of large penetration depth, little light damage, dark field imaging and target excitation. This paper reviews the most representative two&#8208;photon imaging technology of the past five years, and discusses its great application potential in the field of biological imaging.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, little light damage, and high spatiotemporal resolution, which make it a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easily reduced or disappears completely, and is not conducive to optimal application. The concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides a solution to the problem of aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption properties can readily be improved just by increasing the loading content of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probes based on AIEgen to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in&#8197;vitro/in&#8197;vivo has become a major research hotspot. This review aims to summarize representative two&#8208;photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene, quinoline, naphthalene and other new structures from the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.

Scope and selectivity: Recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of secondary ADHs from T. pseudoethanolicus and T. brockii by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution are reviewed. Moreover, the thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion in other interesting reactions to produce optically active alcohols and amines.







Abstract
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are an important type of enzyme that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus (TeSADH) and Thermoanaerobacter brockii (TbSADH) are well&#8208;known as robust catalysts. However, like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.&#8201;e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This minireview discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of TeSADH and TbSADH by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, TeSADH has been used in quantitative non&#8208;stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to deracemize alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in the racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.

         <title>A Mutation&#8208;Based Method for Pinpointing a DNA N6&#8208;Methyladenine Methyltransferase Modification Site at Single Base Resolution</title>

An enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) substrate modification site at single&#8208;base resolution is described.







Abstract
DNA N6&#8208;methyladenine (6mA) has recently received notable attention due to an increased finding of its functional roles in higher eukaryotes. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA methyltransferase (MTase) substrate modification site at single base resolution. A designed allyl&#8208;substituted MTase cofactor was applied in the catalytic transfer reaction, and the allyl group was installed to the N6&#8208;position of adenine within a specific DNA sequence to form N6&#8208;allyladenine (6aA). The iodination of 6aA allyl group induced the formation of 1, N6&#8208;cyclized adenine which caused mutations during DNA replication by a polymerase. Thus the modification site could be precisely detected by a mutation signal. We synthesized 6aA deoxynucleoside and deoxynucleotide model compounds and a 6aA&#8208;containing DNA probe, and screened nine DNA polymerases to define an optimal system capable of detecting the substrate modification site of a DNA 6mA MTase at single&#8208;base resolution.

         <title>Application of Neuron&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe, NeuA, To Identify Mouse Retinal Degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 11, Page 1915-1919, June 2, 2021. </description>

As far as the eye can be seen: Developed fluorescent probe, NeuA (NeuO with an acrylamide group), stained healthy mouse retinal neuron cells and discriminated between healthy retina and retina with degenerating photoreceptors by confocal and fluorescent fundus microscopy. These imaging probes can be used as diagnostic and prognostic tools for retinitis pigmentosa in a clinical domain.







Abstract
The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe&#8208;NeuA&#8208;for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined in&#8197;vitro, ex vivo and in&#8197;vivo using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.

Determination of a PPI interface: The adaptor protein binding site of PRMT5 has been identified and studied by using synthetic peptides. A cocrystal structure of the PRMT5 TIM&#8208;barrel domain and a RioK1&#8208;derived peptide highlights the site of interaction.







Abstract
The PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein&#8211;protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins that recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for the methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5, we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report the characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identify the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Sinapigladioside, an Antifungal Isothiocyanate from Burkholderia Symbionts</title>

Alternative pathways: Genetic analyses and labeling studies provide the first insights into the biosynthesis of the rare isothiocyanate natural product sinapigladioside from beetle&#8208;associated bacteria that might protect the beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. Contrary to known isothiocyanate biosynthetic pathways, sinapigladioside assembly involves an isonitrile synthase.







Abstract
Sinapigladioside is a rare isothiocyanate&#8208;bearing natural product from beetle&#8208;associated bacteria (Burkholderia gladioli) that might protect beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. The biosynthetic origin of sinapigladioside has been elusive, and little is known about bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis in general. On the basis of stable&#8208;isotope labeling, bioinformatics, and mutagenesis, we identified the sinapigladioside biosynthesis gene cluster in the symbiont and found that an isonitrile synthase plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining and network analyses indicate that related gene clusters are distributed across various bacterial phyla including producers of both nitriles and isothiocyanates. Our findings support a model for bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis by sulfur transfer into isonitrile precursors.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 11, Page 1932-1935, June 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right spot for white spot: A G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence identified within the DNA genome of white spot syndrome virus folds into a major and a thermodynamically less stable minor loop isomer. The parallel quadruplex scaffold might constitute a potential target for viral drug development against white spot disease.







Abstract
White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G&#8594;T substitutions in the third G4 tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild&#8208;type sequence into a three&#8208;tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and a minor 1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.

         <title>Arylphosphonate&#8208;Tethered Porphyrins: Fluorescence Silencing Speaks a Metal Language in Living Enterocytes**

Pinpointing metals: Arylphosphonic acid fluorophores with a porphyrin core produced unique fluorescent behavior in response to each of the biologically significant metal ions studied. Thus they provide an expandable and engineerable platform for the development of improved, targeted fluorescence sensors suitable for in&#8197;vivo applications to determine and visualize metals in tissues during disease progression.







Abstract
We report the application of a highly versatile and engineerable novel sensor platform to monitor biologically significant and toxic metal ions in live human Caco&#8208;2 enterocytes. The extended conjugation between the fluorescent porphyrin core and metal ions through aromatic phenylphosphonic acid tethers generates a unique turn off and turn on fluorescence and, in addition, shifts in absorption and emission spectra for zinc, cobalt, cadmium and mercury. The reported fluorescent probes p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA can monitor a wide range of metal ion concentrations via fluorescence titration and also via fluorescence decay curves. Cu&#8208; and Zn&#8208;induced turn off fluorescence can be differentially reversed by the addition of common chelators. Both p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA readily pass the mammalian cellular membrane due to their amphipathic character as confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging of living enterocytes.

         <title>Modulation of Cellular Fate of Vinyl Triarylamines through Structural Fine Tuning: To Stay or Not To Stay in the Mitochondria?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes based on a triphenylamine core have been designed and synthesized as cellular imaging tools for monitoring mitochondrial status. This study was carried out to decipher the mechanism of relocalization from mitochondria to nucleus under mitochondrial membrane depolarisation.







Abstract
Mitochondria are involved in many cellular pathways and dysfunctional mitochondria are linked to various diseases. Hence efforts have been made to design mitochondria&#8208;targeted fluorophores for monitoring the mitochondrial status. However, the factors that govern the mitochondria&#8208;targeted potential of dyes are not well&#8208;understood. In this context, we synthesized analogues of the TP&#8208;2Bzim probe belonging to the vinyltriphenylamine (TPA) class and already described for its capacity to bind nuclear DNA in fixed cells and mitochondria in live cells. These analogues (TP&#8208;1Bzim, TPn&#8208;2Bzim, TP1+&#8208;2Bzim, TN&#8208;2Bzim) differ in the cationic charge, the number of vinylbenzimidazolium branches and the nature of the triaryl core. Using microscopy, we demonstrated that the cationic derivatives accumulate in mitochondria but do not reach mtDNA. Under depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane, TP&#8208;2Bzim and TP1+&#8208;2Bzim translocate to the nucleus in direct correlation with their strong DNA affinity. This reversible phenomenon emphasizes that these probes can be used to monitor &#916;&#936;m variations.

         <title>Design and Hybridization Properties of Acyclic Xeno Nucleic Acid Oligomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers composed of various acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) have been designed. This minireview highlights the design of acyclic XNA scaffolds with polyanion backbone and hybridization properties of acyclic XNA oligomers. Thermal stabilities of such acyclic XNA duplexes strongly depend on the structure of the scaffold.







Abstract
Xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) are analogues of DNA and RNA that have a non&#8208;ribose artificial scaffold. XNAs are possible prebiotic genetic carriers as well as alternative genetic systems in artificial life. In addition, XNA oligomers can be used as biological tools. Acyclic XNAs, which do not have cyclic scaffolds, are attractive due to facile their synthesis and remarkably high nuclease resistance. To maximize the performance of XNAs, a negatively charged backbone is preferable to provide sufficient water solubility; however, acyclic XNAs containing polyanionic backbones suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation, because of the high flexibility of the acyclic nature. Herein, we review the relationships between the structure and duplex hybridization properties of various acyclic XNA oligomers with polyanion backbones.

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmolyte synthesis at elevated temperatures: 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is produced on industrial scale using the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of sucrose phosphorylase. We engineered the catalytic efficiency and regioselectivity of a sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable than the one currently used in industry.







Abstract
2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by various bacteria and plants in response to environmental stress. It is widely applied as a bioactive moisturising ingredient in skin care products, for which it is manufactured via enzymatic glucosylation of glycerol by the sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This industrial process is operated at room temperature due to the mediocre stability of the biocatalyst, often leading to microbial contamination. The highly thermostable sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis could be a better alternative in that regard, but this enzyme is not fit for production of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol due to its low regioselectivity and poor affinity for glycerol. In this work, the thermostable phosphorylase was engineered to alleviate these problems. Several engineering approaches were explored, ranging from site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to conventional, binary, iterative or combinatorial randomisation of the active site, resulting in the screening of &#8764;3,900 variants. Variant P134Q displayed a 21&#8208;fold increase in catalytic efficiency for glycerol, as well as a threefold improvement in regioselectivity towards the 2&#8208;position of the substrate, while retaining its activity for several days at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Incorporation of TePhe into Expressed Proteins is Minimally Perturbing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using standard protein expression conditions, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve high levels of Phe to TePhe substitution. The modified protein is minimally perturbed, as judged by NMR spectroscopy and melting experiments, by this substitution that will provide the basis for new tellurium based biophysical studies.







Abstract
Tellurium is a versatile heavy chalcogen with numerous applications in chemical biology, providing valuable probes in mass cytometry, fluorescence imaging and structural biology. L&#8208;Tellurienylalanine (TePhe) is an analogue of the proteinogenic amino acid L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe) in which the phenyl side chain has been replaced by a 5&#8208;membered tellurophene moiety. High incorporation level of TePhe in expressed proteins at defined sites is expected to facilitate studies in proteomics, protein NMR spectroscopy, and structure elucidation. As a model we chose immunoglobulin&#8208;binding Protein G, B1 domain (GB1) to validate TePhe as a suitable structural analogue for Phe. We demonstrate that approximately 1 in 2 of all Phe sites within GB1 can be substituted with TePhe through expression in standard non&#8208;Phe&#8208;auxotrophic E. coli in Phe&#8208;deficient media containing glyphosate, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The TePhe content of the GB1 sample can be further increased to 85&#8201;% through HPLC. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we confirm that the Phe&#8208;to&#8208;TePhe substitution has negligible impact on the global structure and stability of GB1.

         <title>Stabilisation of the Fatty Acid Decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis by Caprylic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep me busy: The photoactivated fatty acid decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64&#8197;A (CvFAP) is a promising catalyst to generate next generation biodiesel from (waste) fatty acids. CvFAP, however is also plagued by pronounced photoinactivation, which can be alleviated by keeping it busy, i.&#8201;e. converting carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid.







Abstract
The fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64&#8197;A (CvFAP) catalyses the light&#8208;dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids. Photoinactivation of CvFAP still represents one of the major limitations of this interesting enzyme en route to practical application. In this study we demonstrate that the photostability of CvFAP can easily be improved by the administration of medium&#8208;chain length carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid indicating that the best way of maintaining CvFAP stability is &#8216;to keep the enzyme busy&#8217;.

         <title>Biosynthesis of [14C]&#8208;11&#8208;De&#8208;O&#8208;Methyltomaymycin, a Precursor of Radiolabelled Antibody Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this research was to avoid a radiolabelled multistep chemical synthesis of tomaymycin derivative using biosynthesis. The 14C radiolabel was incorporated efficiently in one step from radiolabelled tyrosine using the strain Streptomyces sp. FH6421. Optimization by using radiolabelled anthranilic acid led to one of the highest incorporation levels of radiochemical precursors published to date.







Abstract
Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are one of the most promising technologies to treat cancer as they combine the specificity of an antibody with the high potency of a cytotoxic molecule such as tomaymycin derivatives, which are DNA&#8208;interactive antitumor antibiotics previously isolated from bacterial broth. The multistep chemical synthesis of some tomaymycin derivatives is complicated because their structures contain a reactive imine bond. Therefore, we turned to biosynthesis to obtain 14C radiolabelled tomaymycin derivative to support ADME studies. Following Hurley's work (J. Antibiotics 1977, 30, 349&#8211;370; Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979, 15, 42&#8211;45; Acc. Chem. Res. 1980, 13, 263&#8211;269), the 14C radiolabel was incorporated efficiently in one step from radiolabelled tyrosine using the strain Streptomyces sp. FH6421. This process has been further optimized by using anthranilic acid as radiolabelled precursor, leading to one of the highest incorporation levels of radiochemical precursors published to date. This biosynthetic strategy is the fastest way to access such radiolabelled precursors.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalently attaching ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins as a post&#8208;translational modification can result in altered function of modified proteins. Enzymes regulating Ub as a post&#8208;translational modification, such as ligases and deubiquitinases, are challenging to characterize in part due to the low throughput of  in&#8208;vitro  assays. Single&#8208;molecule nanopore based assays have the advantage of detecting proteins with high specificity and resolution, and in a label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time fashion. Here we demonstrate the use of a MspA nanopore for discriminating and quantifying Ub proteins. We further applied the MspA pore to measure the Ub&#8208;chain disassembly activity of UCH37, a proteasome associated deubiquitinase. The implementation of this MspA system into nanopore arrays could enable high throughput characterizations of unknown deubiquitinases as well as drug screening against disease related enzymes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Proteins possess unique molecular recognition capabilities and enzymatic activities, features that are usually tied to a particular protein tertiary structure. To make use of proteins for biotechnological and biomedical purposes, it is often required to enforce their tertiary structure in order to ensure sufficient stability under the conditions inherent to a particular application. The introduction of intramolecular crosslinks has proven efficient in stabilizing native protein folds. Herein, we give an overview of methods that allow the macrocyclization of expressed proteins, discussing involved reaction mechanisms and structural implications.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Protection in Controlled Enzymatic Transformation of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are involved in practically every single biological process. The many enzymes involved in their synthesis, cleavage, and posttranslational modification (PTM) carry out highly specific tasks with no usage of protecting groups. Yet, the chemists&#8217; strategy of protection/deprotection potentially can be highly useful when a specific biochemical reaction catalyzed by a broad&#8208;specificity enzyme needs to be inhibited, during infection of cells by enveloped viruses, in the invasion and spread of cancer cells, and upon mechanistic investigation of signal&#8208;transduction pathways, for example. Doing so requires highly specific binding of peptide substrates in aqueous solution with biologically competitive affinities. Recent development of peptide&#8208;imprinted cross&#8208;linked micelles allows such protection and affords previously impossible manners of manipulating peptides and proteins in enzymatic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potent, Selective CBX2 Chromodomain Ligand and Its Cellular Activity During Prostate Cancer Neuroendocrine Differentiation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prostate cancers survive androgen deprivation by going through a process called neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), which requires gene repression by CBX2, a histone methyllysine reader protein. Selective inhibition of the CBX2 chromodomain using a cell permeable ligand blocks NED and promotes prostate cancer cell death.







Abstract
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic regulators that facilitate both embryonic development and cancer progression. PcG proteins form Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone mark recognized by the N&#8208;terminal chromodomain (ChD) of the CBX subunit of canonical PRC1. There are five PcG CBX paralogs in humans. CBX2 in particular is upregulated in a variety of cancers, particularly in advanced prostate cancers. Using CBX2 inhibitors to understand and target CBX2 in prostate cancer is highly desirable; however, high structural similarity among the CBX ChDs has been challenging for developing selective CBX ChD inhibitors. Here, we utilize selections of focused DNA encoded libraries (DELs) for the discovery of a selective CBX2 chromodomain probe, SW2_152F. SW2_152F binds to CBX2 ChD with a Kd of 80&#8197;nM and displays 24&#8208;1000&#8208;fold selectivity for CBX2 ChD over other CBX paralogs in&#8197;vitro. SW2_152F is cell permeable, selectively inhibits CBX2 chromatin binding in cells, and blocks neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cell lines in response to androgen deprivation.

         <title>Inhibitors of CA IX Enzyme Based on Polyhedral Boron Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review covers several classes of inhibitors specific for carbonic anhydrase IX enzyme that emerged recently from a non&#8208;traditional concept. This is characterized by combination of space&#8208;filing inorganic (metalla)carborane cluster with sulfamide and sulfonamide binding motif for Zn2+ in the active site. The structural factors essential for attaining high activity and selectivity for the CA IX isoform are discussed. Results from preclinical studies show relevance of these compounds for development of anticancer drugs.







Abstract
This review describes recent progress in the design and development of inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) based on space&#8208;filling carborane and cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters. CA IX enzyme is known to play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and metastases. The new class of potent and selective CA IX inhibitors combines the structural motif of a bulky inorganic cluster with an alkylsulfamido or alkylsulfonamido anchor group for Zn2+ ion in the enzyme active site. Detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of a large series containing 50 compounds uncovered structural features of the cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors that are important for efficient and selective inhibition of CA IX activity. Preclinical evaluation of selected compounds revealed low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics and ability to reduce tumor growth. Cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors of CA IX can thus be considered as promising candidates for drug development and/or for combination therapy in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).

         <title>Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum Lysyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase via a Piperidine&#8208;Ring Scaffold Inspired Cladosporin Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the synthesis and structural analysis of piperidine ring inspired cladosporin inhibitors against Plasmodium falciparum lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PfKRS). The series retains selectivity against its human counterpart but it was observed that replacing the tetrahydropyran moiety by piperidine reduces potency. Co&#8208;crystals of Cla&#8722;B and Cla&#8722;C with PfKRS reveal key interactions and loop readjustments that allow drug binding and inhibition of the enzyme.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PfKRS) represents a promising therapeutic anti&#8208;malarial target. Cladosporin was identified as a selective and potent PfKRS inhibitor but lacks metabolic stability. Here, we report chemical synthesis, biological evaluation and structural characterization of analogues where the tetrahydropyran (THP) frame of cladosporin is replaced with the piperidine ring bearing functional group variations. Thermal binding, enzymatic, kinetic and parasitic assays complemented with X&#8208;ray crystallography reveal compounds that are moderate in potency. Co&#8208;crystals of Cla&#8722;B and Cla&#8722;C with PfKRS reveal key atomic configurations that allow drug binding to and inhibition of the enzyme. Collectively these piperidine ring scaffold inhibitors lay a framework for further structural editing and functional modifications of the cladosporin scaffold to obtain a potent lead.

         <title>A Yeast Chronological Lifespan Assay to Assess Activity of Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aging is characterized by changes in several cellular processes, including dysregulation of proteostasis. Current research has shown long&#8208;lived rodents display elevated proteasome activity throughout life and proteasome dysfunction is linked to shorter lifespans in a transgenic mouse model. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is one of the main pathways leading to cellular protein clearance and quality maintenance. Reduction in proteasome activity is associated with aging and its related pathologies. Small molecule stimulators of the proteasome have been proposed to help alleviate cellular stress related to unwanted protein accumulation. Here we have described the development of techniques to monitor the impact of proteasome stimulation in wild&#8208;type yeast and a strain that has impaired proteasome expression. We validated our chronological lifespan assay using both types of yeast with a variety of small molecule stimulators at different concentrations. By modifying the media conditions for the yeast, molecules can be evaluated for their potential to increase chronological lifespan in five days. Additionally, our assay conditions can be used to monitor the activity of proteasome stimulators in modulating the degradation of a YFP&#8208;alpha&#8208;synuclein fusion protein produced by yeast. We anticipate these methods to be valuable for those wishing to study the impact of increasing proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation of proteins in a eukaryotic model organism.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for covalent labeling of long RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of chemical modifications into long RNA molecules at specific positions for visualization, biophysical investigations, diagnostic and therapeutic applications still remains challenging. In this review, we present recent approaches for covalent internal labeling of long RNAs. Topics included are the assembly of large modified RNAs via enzymatic ligation of short synthetic oligonucleotides and synthetic biology approaches preparing site&#8208;specifically modified RNAs via  in vitro  transcription using an expanded genetic alphabet. Moreover, recent approaches to employ deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) and ribozymes for RNA labeling and RNA methyltransferase based labeling strategies are presented. We discuss the potentials and limits of the individual methods, their applicability for RNAs with several hundred to thousands of nucleotides in length and indicate future directions in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Isopentenol Utilization Pathway for the Production of Linalool in Escherichia coli Using an Improved Bacterial Linalool/Nerolidol Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linalool is a monoterpenoid used as fragrance ingredient, and a promising source for alternative fuels. Here we explore the artificial isoprenol utilization pathway to produce linalool in Escherichia coli using the linalool/nerolidol synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus. The generation of improved bLinS variants together with substrate and strain optimization increased linalool production and decreased nerolidol by&#8208;product levels.







Abstract
Linalool is a monoterpenoid used as a fragrance ingredient, and is a promising source for alternative fuels. Synthetic biology offers attractive alternative production methods compared to extraction from natural sources and chemical synthesis. Linalool/nerolidol synthase (bLinS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus is a bifunctional enzyme, producing linalool as well as the sesquiterpenoid nerolidol when expressed in engineered Escherichia coli harbouring a precursor terpenoid pathway such as the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Here we identified two residues important for substrate selection by bLinS, L72 and V214, where the introduction of bulkier residues results in variants with reduced nerolidol formation. Terpenoid production using canonical precursor pathways is usually limited by numerous and highly regulated enzymatic steps. Here we compared the canonical MVA pathway to the non&#8208;canonical isopentenol utilization (IU) pathway to produce linalool using the optimised bLinS variant. The IU pathway uses isoprenol and prenol to produce linalool in only five steps. Adjusting substrate, plasmid system, inducer concentration, and cell strain directs the flux towards monoterpenoids. Our integrated approach, combining enzyme engineering with flux control using the artificial IU pathway, resulted in high purity production of the commercially attractive monoterpenoid linalool, and will guide future efforts towards efficient optimisation of terpenoid production in engineered microbes.

         <title>Simple plug&#8208;in synthetic step for the synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;camphor from renewable starting materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Racemic camphor and isoborneol are readily available as industrial side products, whereas (1R)&#8208;camphor is available from natural sources. Optically pure (1S)&#8208;camphor, however, is much more difficult to obtain. The synthesis of racemic camphor from a&#8208;pinene proceeds via an intermediary racemic isobornyl ester, which is then hydrolysed and oxidized to give camphor. We reasoned that enantioselective hydrolysis of isobornyl esters would give facile access to optically pure isoborneol and camphor isomers, respectively. While screening of a set of commercial lipases and esterases in the kinetic resolution of racemic monoterpenols did not lead to the identification of any enantioselective enzymes, the cephalosporin Esterase B from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB) and Esterase C (EstC) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed outstanding enantioselectivity (E&gt;100) towards the butyryl esters of isoborneol borneol and fenchol. The enantioselectivity was higher with increasing chain length of the acyl moiety of the substrate. The kinetic resolution of isobornyl butyrate can be easily integrated into the production of camphor from a&#8208;pinene and thus allows the facile synthesis of optically pure monoterpenols from a renewable side&#8208;product.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent single&#8208;molecule FRET studies on members of various transporter families reveal the potential of this technique to advance the mechanistic understanding of this protein class.







Abstract
Uncovering the structure and function of biomolecules is a fundamental goal in structural biology. Membrane&#8208;embedded transport proteins are ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. Despite structural flexibility, their mechanisms are typically studied by ensemble biochemical methods or by static high&#8208;resolution structures, which complicate a detailed understanding of their dynamics. Here, we review the recent progress of single molecule F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) in determining mechanisms and timescales of substrate transport across membranes. These studies do not only demonstrate the versatility and suitability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smFRET tools for studying membrane transport proteins but they also highlight the importance of membrane mimicking environments in preserving the function of these proteins. The current achievements advance our understanding of transport mechanisms and have the potential to facilitate future progress in drug design.

Synthetic sheets: The dynamism of short strands between random&#8208;coil and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet states is mimicked in H&#8208;bond&#8208;surrogate (HBS) constrained peptidomimetic models. 2D NMR data yield complete structural, kinetic and thermodynamic details of the &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8644;non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;sheet equilibrium in these dynamic templates.







Abstract
Antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets are important secondary structures within proteins that equilibrate with random&#8208;coil states; however, little is known about the exact dynamics of this process. Here, the first dynamic &#946;&#8208;sheet models that mimic this equilibrium have been designed by using an H&#8208;bond surrogate that introduces constraint and torque into a tertiary amide bond. 2D NMR data sufficiently reveal the structure, kinetics, and thermodynamics of the folding process, thereby leading the way to similar analysis in isolated biologically relevant &#946;&#8208;sheets.

         <dc:description>The severe acute respiratory syndrome &#8208; coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), that is the causal agent of COVID&#8208;19, has caused more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide and triggered a global pandemic. Even with successful vaccines being delivered, there is an urgent need for novel treatments to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and other emerging viral diseases. While various organic small molecule drug candidates are in development, some effort has also been devoted towards the application of metal complexes as potential antiviral agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Herein, the metal complexes that have been reported to show antiviral activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 or one of its target proteins are described and their proposed mechanisms of action are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Nucleic Acids Under Unusual Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual conditions, such as low solution pH, high and low temperatures, and organic solvents, were speculated to be the circumstances that ribozymes and riboswitches may have faced on the early Earth. Moreover, some artificial functional nucleic acids have been discovered to work under such unusual conditions and these molecules offer the potential for some interesting applications. Herein, we review recent progress of research on these functional nucleic acids.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including naturally occurring ribozymes and riboswitches as well as artificially created DNAzymes and aptamers, have been popular molecular toolboxes for diverse applications. Given the high chemical stability of nucleic acids and their ability to fold into diverse sequence&#8208;dependent structures, FNAs are suggested to be highly functional under unusual reaction conditions. This review will examine the progress of research on FNAs under conditions of low pH, high temperature, freezing conditions, and the inclusion of organic solvents and denaturants that are known to disrupt nucleic acid structures. The FNA species to be discussed include ribozymes, riboswitches, G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;based peroxidase mimicking DNAzymes, RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes, and aptamers. Research within this space has not only revealed the hidden talents of FNAs but has also laid important groundwork for pursuing these intriguing functional macromolecules for unique applications.

         <title>Marine Polysaccharides: Occurrence, Enzymatic Degradation and Utilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Algae biomass is a source for many valuable compounds for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. Especially marine polysaccharides contain rare sugars of interest, but a major bottleneck is access to these sugars. In this mini&#8208;review the common knowledge of marine CAZyme&#8208;based deconstruction of these polysaccharides and the biotechnological potential of the thus accessible oligo&#8208; and monosugars are described.







Abstract
Macroalgae species are fast growing and their polysaccharides are already used as food ingredient due to their properties as hydrocolloids or they have potential high value bioactivity. The degradation of these valuable polysaccharides to access the sugar components has remained mostly unexplored so far. One reason is the high structural complexity of algal polysaccharides, but also the need for suitable enzyme cocktails to obtain oligo&#8208; and monosaccharides. Among them, there are several rare sugars with high value. Recently, considerable progress was made in the discovery of highly specific carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes able to decompose complex marine carbohydrates such as carrageenan, laminarin, agar, porphyran and ulvan. This minireview summarizes these achievements and highlights potential applications of the now accessible abundant renewable resource of marine polysaccharides.

         <title>Development of NanoBRET&#8208;Binding Assays for FKBP&#8208;Ligand Profiling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular inhibition insights: NanoBRET assays were developed to measure target engagement of cytosolic FK506&#8208;binding proteins, confirming selectivities and revealing permeation issues of FKBP ligands.







Abstract
FK506&#8208;binding proteins (FKBPs) are promising targets for a variety of disorders and infectious diseases. High FKBP occupancy is thought to be necessary for ligands to effectively compete with the endogenous intracellular functions of FKBPs. Here, we report the development of NanoBRET assays for the most prominent cytosolic FKBPs, FKBP12, 12.6, 51 and 52. These assays allowed rapid profiling of FKBP ligands for target engagement and selectivity in living cells. These assays confirmed the selectivity of SAFit&#8208;type ligands for FKBP51 over FKBP52 but revealed a substantial offset for the intracellular activity of these ligands compared to bicyclic ligands or natural products. Our results stress the importance to control for intracellular FKBP occupancy and provide the assays to guide further FKBP ligand optimization.

         <title>High Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Multi&#8208;enzymatic Synthesis of All Phenylpropanolamine Stereoisomers from &#946;&#8208;Methylstyrene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the simultaneous combination of stereocomplementary alcohol dehydrogenases and &#969;&#8208;transaminases, we have developed a cascade for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of nor(pseudo)ephedrines with excellent optical purities and high yields. The cascade requires 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols as key intermediates, which are obtained from &#946;&#8208;methylstyrenes by combining a styrene monooxygenase with stereocomplementary epoxide hydrolases.







Abstract
We present a one&#8208;pot cascade for the synthesis of phenylpropanolamines (PPAs) in high optical purities (er and dr up to &gt;99.5&#8201;%) and analytical yields (up to 95&#8201;%) by using 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols as key intermediates. This bioamination entails the combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;TA) and an alanine dehydrogenase to create a redox&#8208;neutral network, which harnesses the exquisite and complementary regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities of the selected ADHs and &#969;TAs. The requisite 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol intermediates were obtained from trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylstyrene by combining a styrene monooxygenase with epoxide hydrolases. Furthermore, in selected cases, the envisioned cascade enabled to obtain the structural isomer (1S,2R)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol in high optical purity (er and dr &gt;99.5&#8201;%). This is the first report on an enzymatic method that enables to obtain all of the four possible PPA stereoisomers in great enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Ratiometric Detection of Glutathione Based on Disulfide Linkage Rupture between a FRET Coumarin Donor and a Rhodamine Acceptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probe based on a coumarin donor and a near&#8208;infrared rhodamine acceptor linked via a disulfide&#8208;tethered bond has been developed for ratiometric visualization of glutathione in live cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae through modulation of efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor.







Abstract
Abnormal levels of glutathione, a cellular antioxidant, can lead to a variety of diseases. We have constructed a near&#8208;infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect glutathione concentrations in biological samples. The probe consists of a coumarin donor, which is connected through a disulfide&#8208;tethered linker to a rhodamine acceptor. Under the excitation of the coumarin donor at 405&#8197;nm, the probe shows weak visible fluorescence of the coumarin donor at 470&#8197;nm and strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence of the rhodamine acceptor at 652&#8197;nm due to efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor. Glutathione breaks the disulfide bond through reduction, which results in a dramatic increase in coumarin fluorescence and a corresponding decrease in rhodamine fluorescence. The probe possesses excellent cell permeability, biocompatibility, and good ratiometric fluorescence responses to glutathione and cysteine with a self&#8208;calibration capability. The probe was utilized to ratiometrically visualize glutathione concentration alterations in HeLa cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Amyloid (A&#946;) interactions with the novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as therapeutic options for avoiding &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation have been investigated.

Cytotoxic aggregation of misfolded &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) proteins is the main culprit suspected to be behind the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, A&#946; interactions with the novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as therapeutic options for avoiding &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation have been investigated. The results from multi&#8208;scale atomistic simulations suggest that amine&#8208;functionalized COFs with a large surface area (more than 1000&#8197;m2/gr) have the potential to prevent A&#946; aggregation. Gibb's free energy analysis confirmed that COFs could prevent protofibril self&#8208;assembly in addition to inhibiting &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation. Additionally, it was observed that the amine functional group and high contact area could improve the inhibitory effect of COFs on A&#946; aggregation and enhance the diffusivity of COFs through the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). In addition, microsecond coarse&#8208;grained (CG) simulations with three hundred amyloids reveal that the presence of COFs creates instability in the structure of amyloids and consequently prevents the fibrillation. These results suggest promising applications of engineered COFs in the treatment of AD and provide a new perspective on future experimental research.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids for biological imaging: This work comprehensively reviews the use of ionic liquids for preparing hard&#8208;to&#8208;image, non&#8208;conductive, soft, and/or wet, biological materials for electron microscopy. Commonly used ionic liquids and their application to biomaterials for imaging are summarized to illicit sample&#8208;specific best practices. While the technique has risen in popularity and holds promise for several biological fields, key challenges must be solved to allow for its widespread adoption in microscopy.







Abstract
For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapor pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of in&#8197;situ physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL, in&#8197;situ microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.

         <title>A H2S&#8208;Specific Ultrasensitive Fluorogenic Probe Reveals TMV&#8208;Induced H2S Production to Limit Virus Replication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S biogenesis promoted by TMV invasion is visualized by a highly sensitive and selective fluorogenic probe, highlighting H2S as an endogenous defense against RNA viruses.







Abstract
Understanding the role of H2S in host defense mechanisms against RNA viruses may provide opportunities for the development of antivirals to combat viral infections. Here, we have developed a green&#8208;emitting fluorogenic probe, which exhibits a large fluorescence response at 520&#8197;nm (&gt;560&#8208;fold) when treated with 100&#8197;&#956;M H2S for 1&#8197;h. It is highly selective for H2S over biothiols (&gt;400&#8208;fold F/F0) and has a detection limit of 12.9&#8197;nM. We demonstrate the application of the probe for endogenous H2S detection in&#8197;vivo for the understanding of its roles in antiviral host defense. Such virus&#8208;induced H2S inhibits viral replication by reducing gene expression of RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP). Additionally, a H2S donor GYY4137 showed significantly antiviral activity as ribavirin, a broad&#8208;spectrum drug against RNA viruses. Furtherly, we propose a possible molecular mechanism for the TMV&#8208;induced H2S biogenesis. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in support of further studies identifying endogenous H2S and its donors as potential antivirals toward RNA viruses.

         <title>Labeling and Characterization of Phenol&#8208;Containing Glycopeptides Using Chemoselective Probes with Isotope Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS analysis. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery.







Abstract
Secondary metabolites are structurally diverse natural products (NPs) and have been widely used for medical applications. Developing new tools to enrich NPs can be a promising solution to isolate novel NPs from the native and complex samples. Here, we developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides by the ene&#8208;type labeling used in proteomic research. The clickable azido&#8208;linker was included for further biotin functionalization to facilitate the enrichment of labeled substrates. Afterward, our chemoselective method, in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS and MSn analysis, was demonstrated in bacterial cultures. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was labeled and characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery in complex environments.

         <title>Binding Mode Characterization of Osteopontin on Hydroxyapatite by Solution NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsically disordered protein osteopontin is associated with modulating the formation, growth and proliferation of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite. Employing different solution NMR spectroscopy methods, we characterize the binding modes to hydroxyapatite and provide evidence for the influence of phosphorylation of the protein on the binding character and the differing roles in biomineralization.







Abstract
Extracellular matrix glycoproteins play a major role in bone mineralization and modulation of osteogenesis. Among these, the intrinsically disordered protein osteopontin (OPN) is associated with the inhibition of formation, growth and proliferation of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite (HAP). Furthermore, post&#8208;translational modifications like phosphorylation can alter conformations and interaction properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Therefore, the actual interaction of OPN with a HAP surface on an atomic level and how this interaction is affected by phosphorylation is of great interest. Here, we study the interaction of full&#8208;length OPN on the surface of suspended HAP nanoparticles by solution NMR spectroscopy. We report the binding modes of this IDP and provide evidence for the influence of hyperphosphorylation on the binding character and an explanation for the differing roles in biomineralization. Our study moreover presents an easy and suitable option to measure interaction of nanoparticles in a stable suspension with full&#8208;length proteins.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring and engineered promiscuous halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues to be enzymatically synthesised and recycled, using simple and readily available alkyl iodides as alkyl donors.

Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) and methyl iodide. Characterisation of a range of naturally occurring HMTs and subsequent protein engineering led to HMT variants capable of synthesising ethyl, propyl, and allyl analogues of SAM. Notably, HMTs do not depend on chemical synthesis of methionine analogues, as required by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). However, at the moment MATs have a much broader substrate scope than the HMTs. Herein we provide an overview of the discovery and engineering of promiscuous HMTs and how these strategies will pave the way towards a toolbox of HMT variants for versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

         <title>Switching ON of Transcription&#8208;Translation System Using GUV Fusion by Co&#8208;supplementation of Calcium with Long&#8208;Chain Polyethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) fusion method using Ca2+ and PEG20k was established in this study. Because of its low leakage of molecules during GUV fusion, the method enabled the switch&#8208;ON of transcription&#8208;translation within GUVs by complementation of elements in different GUVs after fusion.







Abstract
Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) have been used as a material for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. However, due to the semi&#8208;permeability of the membrane, the need for methods to fuse GUVs has increased. To this aim, methods that are simple and show low leakage during fusion are important. In this study, we report a method of GUV fusion by a divalent cation (Ca2+) enhanced with a long chain polyethylene glycol (PEG20k). The methods showed significant GUV fusion without leakage of internal components of GUVs and maintained cell&#8208;free transcription&#8208;translation ability inside the GUVs without external supplementation of macromolecules. We demonstrate that the Ca&#8208;PEG method can be applied for switching ON of transcription&#8208;translation in GUVs in a fusion&#8208;dependent manner. The method developed here can be applied to extend bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and molecular robotics that use GUVs as a chassis.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of Nitrating Cytochrome P450 TxtE by Active Site Engineering of a Reductase Fusion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of aromatic nitration biocatalysts: Screening variants of a self&#8208;sufficient reductase fusion of the indole&#8208;nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE led to the discovery of an active site mutant that nitrates tryptamine and a range of tryptamine analogues with alterations to the aminoethyl group and/or indole.







Abstract
Aromatic nitration reactions are a cornerstone of organic chemistry, but are challenging to scale due to corrosive reagents and elevated temperatures. The cytochrome P450 TxtE nitrates the indole 4&#8208;position of l&#8208;tryptophan at room temperature using NO, O2 and NADPH, and has potential to be developed into a useful aromatic nitration biocatalyst. However, its narrow substrate scope (requiring both the &#945;&#8208;amino acid and indole functionalities) have hindered this. Screening of an R59 mutant library of a TxtE&#8208;reductase fusion protein identified a variant (R59C) that nitrates tryptamine, which is not accepted by native TxtE. This variant exhibits a broader substrate scope than the wild type enzyme and is able to nitrate a range of tryptamine analogues, with significant alterations to the aromatic and aminoethyl moieties.

         <title>A Novel D&#8208;A&#8208;D Photosensitizer for Efficient NIR Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel D&#8208;A&#8208;D photosensitizer, 2Cz&#8208;BTZ, was designed and synthesized. After encapsulation by amphiphilic polymers F127, the 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 NPs display strong intracellular 1O2 generation capabilities as well as in&#8197;vivo long&#8208;term NIR imaging.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted great interest in cancer theranostics owing to its minimal invasiveness and low side effect. In PDT, photosensitizers are indispensable components that generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to optimizing the photosensitizer with enhanced ROS efficiency. However, to improve the precision and controllability for PDT, developing NIR imaging&#8208;guided photosensitizers are still urgent and challenging. Here, we have designed a novel photosensitizer 2Cz&#8208;BTZ which integrated with intense NIR emission and photoinduced singlet oxygen 1O2 generation capabilities. Moreover, after loading the photosensitizers 2Cz&#8208;BTZ into biocompatible amphiphilic polymers F127, the formed 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited good photoinduced therapy as well as long&#8208;term in&#8197;vivo imaging capabilities. Under these merits, the 2Cz&#8208;BTZ@F127 NPs showed NIR imaging&#8208;guided PDT, which paves a promising way for spatiotemporally precise tumor theranostics.

         <title>Development of a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Based Luciferase Turn&#8208;On System as Nonhomologous End Joining Pathway Reporter</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHEJ turn&#8208;on bioluminescence: A bioluminescent signal mute luciferase vector was constructed by introducing a C205ATC mutation. CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting the mutation site generates DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), then triggers error&#8208;prone non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway to restore the reading frame. The turn&#8208;on bioluminescence signal reflects NHEJ efficiency.







Abstract
There is a need of a non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway reporter system that facilitates screening and discovery of NHEJ chemical inhibitors. In this study, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 based luciferase turn&#8208;on system as a NHEJ pathway reporter. By substituting nucleotide 205C with ATC, we introduced a reading&#8208;frame shift and a pre&#8208;stop codon into the luciferase coding region and thereby generated a bioluminescent signal mute HEK293T reporter cell line. Then, a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 plasmid expressing a guide RNA targeting luciferase coding region was introduced into the reporter cell line to generate NHEJ&#8208;associated indel to restore the reading frame and subsequently turn on the bioluminescent signal. We observed over three&#8208;thousand fold increase in signal after CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 vector transfection. Different known chemical inhibitors of the NHEJ pathway, such as NU7441, KU0060648, and KU55933, could significantly inhibit the bioluminescent signal generated by CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting. In addition, we validated our system by high throughput sequencing.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Selection Methods of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries (DEL) have become a major technology platform in drug discovery. Besides encoding method, DEL&#8208;compatible chemistry, and analysis of large datasets, another important but less&#8208;covered technological component of DELs is selection method. Although presently DEL selection is predominantly conducted with immobilized proteins on a matrix, the recent development of novel DEL selection methods has expanded the target scope and led to novel utilities of DELs. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of DEL selection methods with a particular focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DEL) have come of age and become a major technology platform for ligand discovery in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Technological maturation in the past two decades and the recent explosive developments of DEL&#8208;compatible chemistries have greatly improved the chemical diversity of DELs and fueled its applications in drug discovery. A relatively less&#8208;covered aspect of DELs is the selection method. Typically, DEL selection is considered as a binding assay and the selection is conducted with purified protein targets immobilized on a matrix, and the binders are separated from the non&#8208;binding background via physical washes. However, the recent innovations in DEL selection methods have not only expanded the target scope of DELs, but also revealed the potential of the DEL technology as a powerful tool in exploring fundamental biology. In this Review, we first cover the &#8220;classic&#8221; DEL selection methods with purified proteins on solid phase, and then we discuss the strategies to realize DEL selections in solution phase.

     alt="Recent Advances on the Selection Methods of DNA-Encoded Libraries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DNA-encoded chemical libraries&lt;/b&gt; (DEL) have become a major technology platform in drug discovery. Besides encoding method, DEL-compatible chemistry, and analysis of large datasets, another important but less-covered technological component of DELs is selection method. Although presently DEL selection is predominantly conducted with immobilized proteins on a matrix, the recent development of novel DEL selection methods has expanded the target scope and led to novel utilities of DELs. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of DEL selection methods with a particular focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA-encoded libraries (DEL) have come of age and become a major technology platform for ligand discovery in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Technological maturation in the past two decades and the recent explosive developments of DEL-compatible chemistries have greatly improved the chemical diversity of DELs and fueled its applications in drug discovery. A relatively less-covered aspect of DELs is the selection method. Typically, DEL selection is considered as a binding assay and the selection is conducted with purified protein targets immobilized on a matrix, and the binders are separated from the non-binding background via physical washes. However, the recent innovations in DEL selection methods have not only expanded the target scope of DELs, but also revealed the potential of the DEL technology as a powerful tool in exploring fundamental biology. In this Review, we first cover the &#8220;classic&#8221; DEL selection methods with purified proteins on solid phase, and then we discuss the strategies to realize DEL selections in solution phase. Finally, we focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellobiose was synthesized and evaluated for its effects on E. coli biofilms . The impact of the synthetic disaccharide on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays revealing an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate. Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo red binding to bacterial cells. Lastly, single electron microscopy reveals the disaccharide increased the production of curli fibers.







Abstract
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria growing in complex, multicellular enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Recently, a zwitterionic cellulose derivative produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined to play an important role in the formation and assembly of biofilms. In order to produce a minimal, yet structurally defined tool compound to probe the biology of the naturally occurring polymer, we have synthesized a zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose (pEtN cellobiose) and evaluated its biofilm activity in the gram&#8208;negative bacterium E. coli, a pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of UTIs. The impact of synthetic pEtN cellobiose on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays which revealed an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate compared to untreated samples. Additionally, Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo Red binding to bacterial cells. These results reveal new opportunities to study the impact glycopolymers have on cellular adhesion in gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

         <title>Flexible Assembly of Engineered Tetrahymena Ribozymes Forming Polygonal RNA Nanostructures with Catalytic Ability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular engineering of the Tetrahymena ribozyme enabled us to design unit RNAs (L&#8208;RNAs), assembly of which formed ribozyme&#8208;based polygonal nanostructures. Catalytic activity of L&#8208;RNAs was dependent on oligomer formation. The structural variety of L&#8208;RNA oligomers was extended by tuning their structural elements, yielding closed trimers, tetramers, pentamers and closed hexamers.







Abstract
Ribozymes with modular architecture constitute an attractive class of structural platforms for design and construction of nucleic acid nanostructures with biological functions. Through modular engineering of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, we have designed unit RNAs (L&#8208;RNAs), assembly of which formed ribozyme&#8208;based closed trimers and closed tetramers. Their catalytic activity was dependent on oligomer formation. In this study, the structural variety of L&#8208;RNA oligomers was extended by tuning their structural elements, yielding closed pentamers and closed hexamers. Their assembly properties were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

         <title>Site&#8208;specific selenocysteine incorporation into proteins by genetic engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation  in vivo  is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe these progresses in selenoprotein production methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Degradation of PARP14 Using a Heterobifunctional Small Molecule</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tool to dissect PARP14: A heterobifunctional small molecule that selectively degrades PARP14 is described. It can be used in studies to unravel the biological function of this large protein's mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyltransferase catalytic domain and its macrodomains, WWE domain and RNA recognition motifs in immunity and inflammation.







Abstract
PARP14 is an interferon&#8208;stimulated gene that is overexpressed in multiple tumor types, influencing pro&#8208;tumor macrophage polarization as well as suppressing the antitumor inflammation response by modulating IFN&#8208;&#947; and IL&#8208;4 signaling. PARP14 is a 203&#8197;kDa protein that possesses a catalytic domain responsible for the transfer of mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose to its substrates. PARP14 also contains three macrodomains and a WWE domain which are binding modules for mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose and poly&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose, respectively, in addition to two RNA recognition motifs. Catalytic inhibitors of PARP14 have been shown to reverse IL&#8208;4 driven pro&#8208;tumor gene expression in macrophages, however it is not clear what roles the non&#8208;enzymatic biomolecular recognition motifs play in PARP14&#8208;driven immunology and inflammation. To further understand this, we have discovered a heterobifunctional small molecule designed based on a catalytic inhibitor of PARP14 that binds in the enzyme's NAD+&#8208;binding site and recruits cereblon to ubiquitinate it and selectively target it for degradation.

         <title>Recent Advances in Late&#8208;Stage Construction of Stapled Peptides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation stapling strategies of peptides catalyzed by transition metals, such as palladium, rhodium, and manganese, are discussed. These strategies which rely on directing groups (DGs) in the reaction can be classified into three categories: (1)&#8197;directly constructing stapled peptides without DGs; (2)&#8197;those using peptide backbones as DGs; (3)&#8197;those that install additional DGs to generate stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides have been widely applied in many fields, including pharmaceutical chemistry, diagnostic reagents, and materials science. However, most traditional stapled peptide preparation methods rely on prefunctionalizations, which limit the diversity of stapled peptides. Recently, the emergence of late&#8208;stage transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation in amino acids and peptides has attracted wide interest due to its robustness and applicability for peptide stapling. In this review, we summarize the methods for late&#8208;stage construction of stapled peptides via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;kinetics Reveal Dynamic Effects on the Chemistry of Human Dihydrofolate Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR) catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis are reported. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures.







Abstract
Effects of isotopic substitution on the rate constants of human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR), an important target for anti&#8208;cancer drugs, have not previously been characterized due to its complex fast kinetics. Here, we report the results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the HsDHFR catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures. The presented cryogenic approach provides an opportunity to probe the kinetics of mammalian DHFRs, thereby laying the foundation for characterizing their transition state structure.

         <title>Investigation of Vitamin D2 and Vitamin D3 Hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microbial transformation of vitamin D to the active forms by a two&#8208;step hydroxylation represents a promising alternative to complex chemical syntheses. The ascomycete K. albida was shown to catalyze vitamin D hydroxylation by forming diverse single&#8208; and double&#8208;hydroxylation products. The efficiency of the reaction could be drastically increased by the addition of cyclodextrin derivatives to the biotransformation.







Abstract
The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D2 (VD2) and vitamin D3 (VD3) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain, Kutzneria albida, with the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D2 and 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D3 was identified. To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D3 and tenfold higher concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8722;D2 after addition of 5&#8201;% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single&#8208;hydroxylation products, the human double&#8208;hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D2 and 1,25&#8208;(OH)2&#8722;D3 and various other potential single&#8208; and double&#8208;hydroxylation products were detected. Thus, K. albida represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD2 and VD3 metabolites.

         <title>Fluorescence Properties of a Novel Isoquinoline Derivative Tested in an Invertebrate Chordate, Ciona intestinalis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a fluorescent 3&#8208;hydroxyisoquinoline derivative (ISO&#8208;1) has been revised, increasing the amount to gram scale. Its properties were tested in an invertebrate model, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. ISO&#8208;1 marks the nuclei in a reversible way and immobilizes larvae, suggesting neuroactive properties.







Abstract
3&#8208;Hydroxyisoquinolines (ISOs) and their tautomeric isoquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are heterocycles with attractive biological properties. Here we reported the revisited synthesis of a highly functionalized ISO that showed blue fluorescence and the characterization of its biological properties in an invertebrate animal model, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Larvae exposed to ISO at concentrations higher than 1&#8197;&#956;M showed an intense fluorescence localized in the cell nuclei of all tissues. Moreover, exposure to ISO interfered with larval ability to swim; this neuromuscular effect was reversible. Overall, these results suggested that ISOs can have promising applications as novel fluorescent dyes of the cell nuclei.

         <title>Direct Observation of the Self&#8208;Aggregation of R3R4 Bi&#8208;repeat of Tau Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;aggregation of R3R4 bi&#8208;repeat of tau is distinct from the heparin induced aggregation of the protein. Solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy confirm the significant role of R4 residues in the self&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
Abstract: Different cryo&#8208;EM derived atomic models of in&#8197;vivo tau filaments from patients with tauopathies consisted of R3 and R4 repeats of the microtubule&#8208;binding domain. In comparison, only the R3 repeat forms the core of the heparin&#8208;induced fibrils of the three repeat tau isoforms. For developing therapeutics, it is desirable to have an in&#8197;vitro tau aggregation system producing fibrils corresponding to the disease morphology. Here we report the self&#8208;aggregation of truncated tau segment R3R4 peptide without requiring heparin for aggregation induction. We used NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical methods to monitor the self&#8208;aggregation of R3R4. We identified the hexapeptide region in R3 and &#946;&#8208;turn region in R4 as the aggregation initiating region of the protein. The solid&#8208;state NMR of self&#8208;aggregated R3R4 fibrils demonstrated that in addition to R3 residues, residues of R4 were also part of the fibril filaments. The presence of both R3 and R4 residues in the aggregation process and the core of fibril filaments suggest that the aggregation of R3R4 might resemble the in&#8197;vivo aggregation process.

         <title>A Bi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Pathway towards Optically Pure FAHFAs**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full enzymatic synthesis of FAHFAs: Various hydroxy fatty acids with different &#8722;OH positions can be synthesized from renewable fatty acids by wild&#8208;type and engineered fatty acid hydratases, which can be cascaded with lipase to prepare value&#8208;added FAHFAs with potential medical value.







Abstract
Recently discovered endogenous mammalian lipids, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), have been proved to have anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;diabetic effects. Due to their extremely low abundancies in&#8197;vivo, forging a feasible scenario for FAHFA synthesis is critical for their use in uncovering biological mechanisms or in clinical trials. Here, we showcase a fully enzymatic approach, a novel in&#8197;vitro bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade system, enabling an effective conversion of nature&#8208;abundant fatty acids into FAHFAs. Two hydratases from Lactobacillus acidophilus were used for converting unsaturated fatty acids to various enantiomeric hydroxy fatty acids, followed by esterification with another fatty acid catalyzed by Candida antarctica lipase A (CALA). Various FAHFAs were synthesized in a semi&#8208;preparative scale using this bi&#8208;enzymatic approach in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step operation mode. In all, we demonstrate that the hydratase&#8208;CALA system offers a promising route for the synthesis of optically pure structure&#8208;diverse FAHFAs.

In all, we demonstrate that the hydratase-CALA system offers a promising route for the synthesis of optically pure structure-diverse FAHFAs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Thermodynamic Stability of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Impact of Sequence and Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological functions of G&#8208;quadruplexes and their properties as exploited in various technological applications depend on their major fold adopted under specific conditions. The present minireview guides through structural and environmental factors that have been identified to play a major role in the formation and stability of G&#8208;quadruplexes.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes have attracted growing interest in recent years due to their occurrence in&#8197;vivo and their possible biological functions. In addition to being promising targets for drug design, these four&#8208;stranded nucleic acid structures have also been recognized as versatile tools for various technological applications. Whereas a large number of studies have yielded insight into their remarkable structural diversity, our current knowledge on G&#8208;quadruplex stabilities as a function of sequence and environmental factors only gradually emerges with an expanding collection of thermodynamic data. This minireview provides an overview of general rules that may be used to better evaluate quadruplex thermodynamic stabilities but also discusses present challenges in predicting most stable folds for a given sequence and environment.

         <title>Discovery of a Cell&#8208;Active SuTEx Ligand of Prostaglandin Reductase 2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

A tyrosine&#8208;reactive PTGR2 inhibitor: A cell&#8208;active sulfonyl&#8208;triazole compound (HHS&#8208;0701) that ligands Y100 on prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) was discovered by quantitative chemical proteomics. Biochemical assays support HHS&#8208;0701 blockade of PTGR2 metabolism of the lipid substrate 15&#8208;Keto&#8208;PGE2. These findings bolster the potential for developing SuTEx compounds as pharmacological modulators of proteins in live cells.







Abstract
Sulfonyl&#8208;triazoles have emerged as a new reactive group for covalent modification of tyrosine sites on proteins through sulfur&#8208;triazole exchange (SuTEx) chemistry. The extent to which this sulfur electrophile can be tuned for developing ligands with cellular activity remains largely underexplored. Here, we performed fragment&#8208;based ligand discovery in live cells to identify SuTEx compounds capable of liganding tyrosine sites on diverse protein targets. We verified our quantitative chemical proteomic findings by demonstrating concentration&#8208;dependent activity of SuTEx ligands, but not inactive counterparts, against recombinant protein targets directly in live cells. Our structure&#8208;activity relationship studies identified the SuTEx ligand HHS&#8208;0701 as a cell&#8208;active inhibitor capable of blocking prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) biochemical activity.

         <title>Increased Valency Improves Inhibitory Activity of Peptides Targeting Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent scaffolds functionalized with PCSK9 inhibitors showed improved inhibitory activity, with the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers achieving up to &#8764;100&#8208;fold improved activity compared to monomeric P9&#8208;38. Overall, the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers are a highly efficacious class of peptide&#8208;based therapeutics for targeting PCSK9 inhibition.







Abstract
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a clinically validated target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 inhibitors have attracted pharmaceutical interest, but the effect of multivalency on bioactivity is poorly understood. Here we designed bivalent and tetravalent dendrimers, decorated with the PCSK9 inhibitory peptides Pep2&#8208;8[RRG] or P9&#8208;38, to study relationships between peptide binding affinity, peptide valency, and PCSK9 inhibition. Increased valency resulted in improved PCSK9 inhibition for both peptides, with activity improvements of up to 100&#8208;fold achieved for the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers compared to monomeric P9&#8208;38 in in&#8197;vitro competition binding assays. Furthermore, the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers showed improved potency at restoring functional low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels and internalizing LDL in the presence of PCSK9, demonstrating significant cell&#8208;based activity at picomolar concentrations. This study demonstrates the potential of increasing valency as a strategy for increasing the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 therapeutics.

         <title>Variety of Nucleotide Polymerase Mutants Aiming to Synthesize Modified RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces several nucleotide polymerase mutants that can incorporate chemically modified nucleotides. Altering amino acid residues around the active sites effectively renders both DNA and RNA polymerases tolerant to ribose 2&#8217; modified ribonucleotide substrates. Introduction of these modifications makes RNA stable and beneficial for therapeutics.







Abstract
Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic RNA aptamers that exploit synthetic RNA to capture target molecules. However, ensuring RNA aptamers are resistant against intrinsic nucleases remains an issue and restricts their use as therapeutics. Introduction of chemical modifications to the 2&#8242; sugar moiety of RNA improves their stability effectively and can be achieved by chemical synthesis using modified phosphoramidites; however, this approach is not suitable for preparing long RNA molecules. Although recombinant nucleotide polymerases can transcribe RNA, these polymerases cannot synthesize modified RNA because they do not recognize 2&#8242; modified nucleoside triphosphates. In this review, we focus on several polymerase mutants that tolerate substrates containing modifications of the 2&#8242; sugar moiety to synthesize RNA, and the problems that must be overcome to prepare chemically modified RNA with high efficacy by in&#8197;vitro transcription.

         <title>Enzymatic RNA Production from NTPs Synthesized from Nucleosides and Trimetaphosphate**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of the reaction of nucleosides with cyclic trimetaphosphate under mild aqueous conditions produces nucleoside triphosphates at concentrations sufficient to sustain RNA synthesis by ribozyme and protein RNA polymerases.







Abstract
A mechanism of nucleoside triphosphorylation would have been critical in an evolving &#8220;RNA world&#8221; to provide high&#8208;energy substrates for reactions such as RNA polymerization. However, synthetic approaches to produce ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) have suffered from conditions such as high temperatures or high pH that lead to increased RNA degradation, as well as substrate production that cannot sustain replication. Previous reports have demonstrated that cyclic trimetaphosphate (cTmp) can react with nucleosides to form rNTPs under prebiotically&#8208;relevant conditions, but their reaction rates were unknown and the influence of reaction conditions not well&#8208;characterized. Here we established a sensitive assay that allowed for the determination of second&#8208;order rate constants for all four rNTPs, ranging from 1.7&#215;10&#8722;6 to 6.5&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The ATP reaction shows a linear dependence on pH and Mg2+, and an enthalpy of activation of 88&#177;4&#8197;kJ/mol. At millimolar nucleoside and cTmp concentrations, the rNTP production rate is sufficient to facilitate RNA synthesis by both T7 RNA polymerase and a polymerase ribozyme. We suggest that the optimized reaction of cTmp with nucleosides may provide a viable connection between prebiotic nucleotide synthesis and RNA replication.

         <title>Chemoproteomic Profiling of Covalent XPO1 Inhibitors to Assess Target Engagement and Selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Target engaged? We report clickable probes based on the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor and eltanexor for the labeling of XPO1 in live cells to assess target engagement and selectivity. We used mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic workflows to profile the proteome&#8208;wide selectivity of selinexor and eltanexor and show that they are highly selective for XPO1.







Abstract
Selinexor, a covalent XPO1 inhibitor, is approved in the USA in combination with dexamethasone for penta&#8208;refractory multiple myeloma. Additional XPO1 covalent inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for multiple diseases including hematologic malignancies, solid tumor malignancies, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is important to measure the target engagement and selectivity of covalent inhibitors to understand the degree of engagement needed for efficacy, while avoiding both mechanism&#8208;based and off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we report clickable probes based on the XPO1 inhibitors selinexor and eltanexor for the labeling of XPO1 in live cells to assess target engagement and selectivity. We used mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic workflows to profile the proteome&#8208;wide selectivity of selinexor and eltanexor and show that they are highly selective for XPO1. Thermal profiling analysis of selinexor further offers an orthogonal approach to measure XPO1 engagement in live cells. We believe these probes and assays will serve as useful tools to further interrogate the biology of XPO1 and its inhibition in cellular and in&#8197;vivo systems.

Developing metal&#8208;based drugs that can be activated by red light is the &#8220;holy grail&#8220; of photodynamic therapy (PDT) research. This highlight summarizes current research on RuII&#8208;polypyridyl complexes with red&#8208;shifted absorption to achieve in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo photo&#8208;cytotoxicity with 540&#8211;600&#8197;nm light. The huge potential of judicial ligand modification and in&#8208;silico optimization to achieve red&#8208;light, metal&#8208;based PDT drugs are indicated.

         <title>Asparaginyl Ligases: New Enzymes for the Protein Engineer's Toolbox</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intents and (re)purposes: Asparaginyl ligases are highly efficient transpeptidases. These enzymes naturally catalyse the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation of small plant peptides, but recently have been repurposed for the modification of diverse proteins. This minireview describes the current state of protein engineering with asparaginyl ligases.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalysed site&#8208;specific protein modifications enable the precision manufacture of conjugates for the study of protein function and/or for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Asparaginyl ligases are a class of highly efficient transpeptidases with the capacity to modify proteins bearing only a tripeptide recognition motif. Herein, we review the types of protein modification that are accessible using these enzymes, including N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal protein labelling, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation, and protein&#8208;protein conjugation. We describe the progress that has been made to engineer highly efficient ligases as well as efforts to chemically manipulate the enzyme reaction to favour product formation. These enzymes are powerful additions to the protein engineer&#8216;s toolbox.

         <title>Sirtuin 2 Regulates Protein LactoylLys Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) alter the structure and function of enzymes and are often regulated by enzymatic removal by &#8220;erasers&#8221;. The nonenzymatically derived PTM lactoylLys was recently identified in states of elevated glycolytic flux. Herein, we report the deacylase sirtuin 2 as the first known &#8220;eraser&#8221; for lactoylLys, expanding the knowledge of enzymatic regulation of nonenzymatically derived protein PTMs.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play roles in both physiological and pathophysiological processes through the regulation of enzyme structure and function. We recently identified a novel PTM, lactoylLys, derived through a nonenzymatic mechanism from the glycolytic by&#8208;product, lactoylglutathione. Under physiologic scenarios, glyoxalase 2 prevents the accumulation of lactoylglutathione and thus lactoylLys modifications. What dictates the site&#8208;specificity and abundance of lactoylLys PTMs, however, remains unknown. Here, we report sirtuin 2 as a lactoylLys eraser. Using chemical biology and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, we show that SIRT2 controls the abundance of this PTM both globally and on chromatin. These results address a major gap in our understanding of how nonenzymatic PTMs are regulated and controlled.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Metallodrugs: An Untapped Source of Artificial Gene Editing Technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinking the duplex and other alterations: This review describes the rational design of metal complexes with nucleic acid recognition properties and how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions is opening up new avenues in the fields of gene engineering and targeted therapies.







Abstract
DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or noncovalent binding modes. Several recognition modes &#8211; including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation &#8211; are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes, which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This Review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.

         <title>Can Precision Electrophile Signaling Make a Meaningful and Lasting Impression in Drug Design?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medicinal chemists have uncovered that the incorporation of an electrophilic appendage into a non&#8208; covalent pharmacophore can confer important benefits, such as improved selectivity. Studies on electrophile signaling have shown that when a matched electrophile engages with its protein target, unexpected phenotypic responses can ensue. Such responses are above and beyond what has been typically reported for covalent pharmacophore&#8208;protein target interactions. So, can we blend these concepts together to make better drugs?







Abstract
For several years, drugs with reactive electrophilic appendages have been developed. These units typically confer prolonged residence time of the drugs on their protein targets, and may assist targeting shallow binding sites and/or improving the drug&#8211;protein target spectrum. Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.

     alt="Can Precision Electrophile Signaling Make a Meaningful and Lasting Impression in Drug Design?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medicinal chemists have uncovered&lt;/b&gt; that the incorporation of an electrophilic appendage into a non- covalent pharmacophore can confer important benefits, such as improved selectivity. Studies on electrophile signaling have shown that when a matched electrophile engages with its protein target, unexpected phenotypic responses can ensue. Such responses are above and beyond what has been typically reported for covalent pharmacophore-protein target interactions. So, can we blend these concepts together to make better drugs?

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years, drugs with reactive electrophilic appendages have been developed. These units typically confer prolonged residence time of the drugs on their protein targets, and may assist targeting shallow binding sites and/or improving the drug&#8211;protein target spectrum. Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, bioinspired catalysts possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these systems have high activity, enantioselectivity, and aqueous solubility. Recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.







Abstract
Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency. This review outlines important developments and future prospects for the design and application of bioinspired and biohybrid systems at multiple length scales for important, biologically relevant, clean energy transformations.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
