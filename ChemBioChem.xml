         <title>An Expanded Substrate Spectrum of Sulfide:Quinone Oxidoreductase Found in Pollutant&#8208;Degrading Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (Sqr) catalyzes the initial procedure on sulfide transformation, alongside sulfide (H2S, S2&#8208;) oxidization coupled with coenzyme Q (CoQ) reducing and reactive sulfur species (RSS) production. Here, we assessed the reactivity of propanethiol (PT) as an alternative substrate for Sqr to maintain intracellular homeostasis in strain S&#8208;1 capable of degrading emerging sulfur&#8208;containing pollutants. We deleted a gene encoding Sqr, and serial transcriptional difference induced by RSS dynamics was therefore revealed. Next, the reaction properties of two Sqr homologs from strains JMP134 and S&#8208;1 were comparatively characterized, respectively. As a result, an additional role of Sqr in yielding RSS from PT was found in reaction mixture prepared by cell&#8208;free extracts or purified enzymes. Interestingly, the transformation velocity of PT by Sqr was slower than that of sulfides. From this scenario, it was a rate&#8208;determining step that PT as a nucleophilic compound can be added into Sqr cysteine to form disulfide bond and likely serve nonoptimal sulfur recipient. In addition, the role of persulfidation driven by RSS in combating oxidative and sulfur stresses required to be further clarified. Nevertheless, this promiscuity of Sqr&#8208;binding organosulfur compounds and its catalytic modulation underscored that expanded substrates might benefit sulfide homeostasis in thiol&#8208;degrading bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidrug Resistance Reversed by Maleimide Interactions. A Biological and Synthetic Overview for an Emerging Field</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multidrug Resistance (MDR) can be considered one of the most frightening adaptation types in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and eukaryotic cells. It allows the organisms to survive the attack of many drugs used in the daily basis. This force the development of new and more complex, highly specific drugs to fight diseases. Given the high usage of medicaments, poor variation in active chemical cores, and self&#8208;medication, the appearance of MDR is more frequent each time, and has been established as a serious medical and social problem. Over the years it has been possible the identification of several genes and proteins responsible for MDR and with that the development of blockers of them to reach MDR reversion and try to avoid a global problem. These mechanisms also have been observed in cancer cells, and several calcium channel blockers have been successful in MDR reversion, and the maleimide can be found included in them. In this review we explore the history, mechanisms, reversion efforts, and we specifically focused on the maleimide synthesis as MDR&#8208;reversers in co&#8208;administration, as well as their biological applications in a urge to expand the available information and explore a very plausible MDR reversion source</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkylurea ligands as specific activators of human Toll&#8208;like receptor 2/6 heterodimer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands for Toll&#8208;like&#8208;receptor 2 (TLR2) have demonstrated significant potential as immune&#8208;stimulating components in synthetic vaccines. Activation of TLR2 relies on the formation of dimeric complexes with either TLR1 or TLR6 and the nature of these dimers can impact therapeutic outcomes. The lipopeptide&#8208;based TLR2 ligands Pam3CysSK4 and Pam2CysSK4 have been extensively studied, and their recognition by different TLR&#8208;receptor heterodimers, TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6, respectively, has been established. However, the high lipophilicity of these ligands, containing multiple palmitoyl residues, can result in solubility issues when used as vaccine adjuvants. To address this, we previously synthesized a less lipophilic ligand containing a single palmitoyl chain called mini&#8208;UPam, which effectively stimulates human moDC maturation. We here probe the receptor&#8208;dimer specificity of several mini&#8208;Upam derivatives and reveal that these mini&#8208;UPam are hTLR2/TLR6 selective ligands and that the introduction of longer urea alkyl chains does not shift the binding specificity to hTLR2/TLR1 heterodimers, in contrast to their Pam2CysSK4 and Pam3CysSK4 counterparts, pointing to a different binding mode of the UPam ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>A spectroscopic study on the Amyloid&#8208;&#946;&#160;interaction with clicked peptide&#8208;porphyrin conjugates: a vision toward the detection of A&#946;&#160;peptides in aqueous solution.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a multifactorial form of dementia mainly affecting people in the elderly, but no effective cure is available. According to the amyloid hypothesis the aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric toxic species is believed to concur with the onset and progression of the disease heavily. By using a click chemistry approach, we conjugated a suitable designed peptide sequence to a metalloporphyrin moiety to obtain three hybrid peptide systems to be studied for their interact ion with Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides. The aim is to get new tools for the diagnosis and therapy in AD. The results described in this study, which were obtained through spectroscopic techniques (UV&#8208;Vis, CD, Bis&#8208;Ans and intrinsic porphyrin Fluorescence), Microfluidics (GCI) and cell biology (MTT, Live cell imaging and flow cytometry), reveal interesting features about the structure&#8208;activity relationships connecting these conjugates with the interaction with A&#946;, as well as on their potential use as sensing systems. In our opinion the data reported in this paper make the porphyrin&#8208;peptide conjugates highly compelling for further exploration as spectroscopic probes to detect A&#946; biomarkers in biological fluids.</dc:description>

         <title>5&#8217;&#8208;Methoxyarmillane, a Bioactive Sesquiterpenoid Aryl Ester from the Fungus Armillaria ostoyae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8217;&#8208;Methoxyarmillane was isolated from cultures of Armillaria ostoyae in an optimized medium and the structure was elucidated by UHPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;HR&#8208;MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. It showed toxicity against Madin&#8208;Darby canine kidney&#8197;II and human lung cancer Calu&#8208;3 cells as well as bioactivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, but not against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Septoria tritici.







Abstract
Higher fungi of the genus Armillaria belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota produce bioactive sesquiterpenoid aryl esters called melleolides. A bioactivity&#8208;guided discovery process led to the identification of the new melleolide 5&#8217;&#8208;methoxyarmillane (1) in organic extracts from the mycelium of Armillaria ostoyae. Remarkably, supplementation of rapeseed oil to the culture medium potato dextrose broth increased the production of 1 by a factor of six during the course of the 35&#8197;days fermentation. Compound 1 was isolated and its structure elucidated by UHPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;HR&#8208;MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. It showed toxicity against Madin&#8208;Darby canine kidney&#8197;II (MDCK&#8197;II, IC50 19.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL, 44.1&#8197;&#956;M) and human lung cancer Calu&#8208;3 cells (IC50 15.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL, 34.9&#8197;&#956;M) as well as moderate bioactivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC 8&#8197;mg/mL, 18.4&#8197;&#956;M) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC 16&#8197;mg/mL, 36.8&#8197;&#956;M), but not against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Septoria tritici. No inhibitory effects of 1 against the influenza viruses H3N2, H1N1pdm, B/Malaysia, and B/Massachusetts were observed.

&lt;p&gt;5&#8217;-Methoxyarmillane was isolated from cultures of &lt;i&gt;Armillaria ostoyae&lt;/i&gt; in an optimized medium and the structure was elucidated by UHPLC-QTOF-HR-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher fungi of the genus &lt;i&gt;Armillaria&lt;/i&gt; belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota produce bioactive sesquiterpenoid aryl esters called melleolides. A bioactivity-guided discovery process led to the identification of the new melleolide 5&#8217;-methoxyarmillane (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) in organic extracts from the mycelium of &lt;i&gt;Armillaria ostoyae&lt;/i&gt;. Remarkably, supplementation of rapeseed oil to the culture medium potato dextrose broth increased the production of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; by a factor of six during the course of the 35&#8197;days fermentation. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was isolated and its structure elucidated by UHPLC-QTOF-HR-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. It showed toxicity against Madin-Darby canine kidney&#8197;II (MDCK&#8197;II, IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 19.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL, 44.1&#8197;&#956;M) and human lung cancer Calu-3 cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 15.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL, 34.9&#8197;&#956;M) as well as moderate bioactivity against &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (MIC 8&#8197;mg/mL, 18.4&#8197;&#956;M) and &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; (MIC 16&#8197;mg/mL, 36.8&#8197;&#956;M), but not against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Septoria tritici&lt;/i&gt;. No inhibitory effects of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; against the influenza viruses H3N2, H1N1pdm, B/Malaysia, and B/Massachusetts were observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent modification of protein by chemical probe in living cells for structural and interaction studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular activities are predominantly carried out by proteins that can dynamically adopt different structural conformations and differentially interact with other biomolecules according to cellular needs. Chemical probes are small molecules used to selectively interact and modulate the activities of specific proteins to study their functions such as the validation of potential drug targets. The remarkable performance of AlphaFold algorithms in the prediction of protein structures has pivoted interest toward elucidating the intracellular dynamics of protein structural conformation where covalent modification of proteins by chemical probes could be used to shed light upon. However, due to the barrier to entry by cell membrane and the general unfavorable reactive conditions of the intracellular environment, most studies using reactive chemical probes are still conducted on purified proteins and cell lysates. Nevertheless, recent progresses have been made in designing chemical probes with improved membrane permeability, stability and reactivity. This paper surveys the literature on recent advancements in membrane&#8208;permeable chemical probes and their applications with protein mass spectrometry for the intracellular studies of protein structural conformations and biomolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is crucial for advancing the frontiers of click chemistry. Selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry, a versatile chemistry in click chemistry, represents an all&#8208;encompassing term for nucleophilic substitution events that replace nitrogen at an electrophilic selenium(II) center, enabling the flexible and efficient assembly of linkages around a Se(II) core. Several SeNEx chemistries have been developed inspired by the biochemical reaction between Ebselen and cysteine residue, and demonstrated significant potential in on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, selenium&#8208;containing DNA&#8208;encoded library (SeDEL) synthesis, as well as peptide and protein bioconjugation. This concept aims to present the origins, advancements, and applications of selenium(II)&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry while also outlining the potential directions for future research in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformation for the Preparation of Chromopyrrolic Acid and 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;Chromopyrrolic Acid in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) and its congeners are important intermediates for the biosynthesis and synthesis of various dimeric tryptophan natural products. We have constructed two E. coli strains (CPA001/CPA002) harboring a single plasmid carrying genes coding for a combination of two enzymes (LaStaO/LzrO and VioB) that are able to convert L&#8208;tryptophan (L&#8208;Trp)/5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryotophan (5&#8208;Cl&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) to chromopyrrolic acid (CPA)/5,5&#8217;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid (5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA). Effect on the production of CPA were evaluated by varying the parameters of strain cultivation and biotransformation process. Under the optimized conditions, up to 325 mg/L of CPA and 275 mg/L of 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA could be obtained by supplementing L&#8208;Trp and 5&#8208;Cl&#8208;L&#8208;Trp, respectively, to a working culture of CPA001, or to a phosphate buffer&#8208;resuspended culture of CPA002. The practicability of this whole&#8208;cell biotransformation system could also be served as a potential platform for the preparation of CPA congeners.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural studies and functional validation of Eugenol and Ferulic acid against Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is commonly occurring pathogen&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; associated with nosocomial infections. Infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) nature and their tendency to form biofilms. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches of treatment. In this regard, targeting an important&#160; protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface&#8208;exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it&#8217;s a promising drug target for the development of anti&#8208;microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development.&#160;To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have&#160;purified E. faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA&#916;N59).&#160; Structural studies&#160;along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were done and&#160;confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti&#8208;biofilm assays and inhibition assay of selected ligands were also done against E. faecalis individually and in synergistic combinations.&#160; Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to EfSrtA&#916;N59 with significant interactions and show promising results.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aptamers are often employed as molecular recognition elements in the development of different types of biosensors. Many of these biosensors take advantage of the aptamer having a ligand&#8208;induced structure&#8208;formation binding mechanism. However, this binding mechanism is poorly understood. Here we use isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to study the binding and ligand&#8208;induced structural change exhibited by a dopamine&#8208;binding DNA aptamer. We analysed a series of aptamers where we shorten the terminal stem that contains the 5&#180;&#160;and 3&#180;termini of the aptamer sequence. All aptamers bind dopamine in an enthalpically driven process coupled with an unfavorable entropy. A general trend of the aptamer having a weaker binding affinity is observed as the terminal stem is shortened. For all aptamers studied, numerous signals appear in the imino region of the&#160;1H NMR spectrum indicating that new structure forms with ligand binding. However, it is only when this region of structure formation in the aptamer is brought close to the sensor surface that we obtain a functional electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine learning guided rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;based lysine dioxygenase improves its total turnover number</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective C&#8208;H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure&#8208;based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure&#8208;based machine&#8208;learning algorithm with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before&#8208;hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2&#8208;fold higher yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN = 160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low&#8208;barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre&#8208;existing protein engineering strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Antimycobacterial Evaluation of Novel Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazolines and Pyrazole&#8208;Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the synthesis of a new series of pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines, at very good yields, from the cyclocondensation reaction of pyrazole&#8208;enaminones with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Dehydration of the pyrazole&#8208;isoxazolines furnished another new series of the respective pyrazole&#8208;isoxazoles, at excellent yields. Both series of the obtained compounds were screened for antimycobacterial activity, and compounds 4f and 5c showed significant inhibition of bacterial growth with a time&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent bactericidal effect. Cytotoxicity tests in VERO cell line did not indicate toxicity of compounds 4f and 5c regarding cellular prediction, NO production or dsDNA release. However, both compounds were associated with an increase in total ROS levels, providing induction of oxidative stress, but without compromising cellular targets. These results highlight compounds 4f and 5c as promising candidates for antimycobacterial treatment with a favorable safety profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Sulfur Peptides Mimicking Ferredoxin for an Efficient Electron Transfer to Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenase enzyme of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii uses photosynthetic electrons received from ferredoxin to produce H2. Ferredoxin maquettes could ehnance the electron transfer. The interface between two canonical iron&#8208;sulfur peptides and hydrogenase is elucidated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Shielding the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster from water lowers the redox potential of the peptide.







Abstract
In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, hydrogenase HydA1 converts protons and electrons to H2 at the H&#8208;cluster, which includes a [4Fe&#8722;4S] cluster linked to a [2Fe] cluster. The yield of H2 is limited by the electron transfer to HydA1, mediated by the iron&#8208;sulfur unit of a photosynthetic electron transfer ferredoxin (PetF). In this study, I have investigated by molecular dynamics and the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method two canonical iron&#8208;sulfur peptides (PM1 and FBM) that hold potential as PetF replacements. Using a docking approach, I predict that the distance between the two iron&#8208;sulfur clusters in FBM/HydA1 is shorter than in PM1/HydA1, ensuring a greater electron transfer rate. This finding is in line with the reported higher H2 production rates for FBM/HydA1. I also show that the redox potential of these peptides, and therefore their electron transfer properties, can be changed by single&#8208;residue mutations in the secondary coordination sphere of their cluster. In particular, I have designed a PM1 variant that disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network between water and the cluster, shifting the redox potential negatively compared to PM1. These results will guide experiments aimed at replacing PetF with peptides that can unlock the biotechnological potential of the alga.

         <title>Elucidating Evolutionary Mechanisms and Variants of the Hammerhead Ribozyme Using In Vitro Selection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generated single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and triple&#8208;mutation libraries to explore the sequence requirements and evolution of a full&#8208;length hammerhead ribozyme. We identified many hammerhead variants, some of which possess mutations at previously considered essential nucleotides. We also present a novel methodological approach for evaluating the sequence&#8208;function relationships of functional nucleic acids by leveraging evolutionary trends observed during in&#8197;vitro selection.







Abstract
The Hammerhead Ribozyme (HHR) is a ubiquitous RNA enzyme that catalyzes site&#8208;specific intramolecular cleavage. While mutations to its catalytic core have traditionally been viewed as detrimental to its activity, several discoveries of naturally occurring variants of the full&#8208;length ribozyme challenge this notion, suggesting a deeper understanding of HHR evolution and functionality. By systematically introducing mutations at key nucleotide positions within the catalytic core, we generated single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and triple&#8208;mutation libraries to explore the sequence requirements and evolution of a full&#8208;length HHR. In vitro selection revealed many novel hammerhead variants, some of which possess mutations at nucleotides previously considered to be essential. We also demonstrate that the evolutionary trajectory of each nucleotide in the catalytic core directly correlates with their functional importance, potentially giving researchers a novel method to assess the sequence requirements of functional nucleic acids.

&lt;p&gt;We generated single-, double-, and triple-mutation libraries to explore the sequence requirements and evolution of a full-length hammerhead ribozyme. We identified many hammerhead variants, some of which possess mutations at previously considered essential nucleotides. We also present a novel methodological approach for evaluating the sequence-function relationships of functional nucleic acids by leveraging evolutionary trends observed during in&#8197;vitro selection.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a Versatile Immunoproteasome Activity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immunoproteasome (iCP) has gained significant interest in recent years as it has been discovered to be significantly expressed under inflammatory conditions, as well as playing significant roles in several diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, viral infection, and cancer. Selective inhibitors have been generated as a method to overcome the off&#8208;target effects of current proteasome inhibitor therapeutics. However, selective probes that allow for monitoring this protein complex remain limited, hindering our understanding of the iCP. Current probes are non&#8208;selective, not commercially available, or require difficult synthesis. Here, we describe the modular synthesis and application of an iCP&#8208;selective probe. The modular nature of the synthetic strategy can enable the incorporation of different fluorophores and covalent warheads, demonstrating the versatility of this probe.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of O&#8208;acetylation on the antigenicity and glycoconjugate immunogenicity of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 7F capsular polysaccharide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterial pathogen causing diseases as severe as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Commercial pneumococcal conjugate vaccines contain the 7F serotype, which is epidemiologically relevant and highly invasive. This serotype contains an O&#8208;acetyl group at the internal L&#8208;rhamnose of its polysaccharide repeating unit. Herein we report on the role of the O&#8208;acetyl moiety of 7F polysaccharide in both antigen recognition and the induction of a protective antibody response against 7F. Fully and partially de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated 7F polysaccharides were chemically prepared and compared with the O&#8208;acetylated counterpart in their antigenicity and immunogenicity of their tetanus toxoid glycoconjugates. These comparative studies showed a slight but consistent decrease in the antigenicity for the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharide, but not for the partly de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated variant. The glycoconjugates derived from the O&#8208;acetylated and the fully de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated polysaccharides had similar sizes and polysaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;protein ratio, and all proved both to be immunogenic and induce opsonophagocytic responses in mice. Nevertheless, the immune response elicited by the O&#8208;acetylated glycoconjugate was better in both quantity and quality, proving that the O&#8208;acetyl group is not strictly necessary but also not irrelevant for the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the 7F serotype polysaccharide and its glycoconjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic folding strategies for chemical synthesis of disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides and proteins, including hormones, toxins, growth factors, and others, are abundant in living organisms. These molecules play crucial physiological roles such as regulating cell and organism growth, development, and metabolism. They have also found widespread applications as drugs or tool molecules in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. However, the chemical synthesis of disulfide&#8208;bonded proteins is complicated by the challenges associated with their folding. This review focuses on the latest advancements in disulfide&#8208;bonded peptide and protein folding technologies. Particularly, it highlights biomimetic folding strategies that emulate the naturally occurring oxidative folding processes in nature. These strategies include chaperone&#8208;assisted folding, glycosylation&#8208;assisted folding, and organic&#8208;based oxidative folding methods. The review also anticipates future directions in folding technology. Such research offers innovative approaches for the chemical synthesis of complex proteins that are otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable detergents for light&#8208;controlled liposome lysis and channel gating</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation of membrane properties via photoswitchable lipids has attracted attention due to the unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of their functional control. Beside lipids, detergents are another prominent class for selective membrane perturbations owing to their ease of handling and spontaneous insertion in lipid bilayers. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of three classes of visible light&#8208;sensitive surfactants with various azobenzene tail chain lengths. The photoswitchable detergents show water&#8208;solubility and micellization as well as undergo reversible isomerization under blue&#8208;/green light illumination. We demonstrate that the light&#8208;induced structural change of azobenzene can lead to vesicle rupture, making them a tool for controlled cargo release from vehicles. Via spontaneous insertion into the plasma membrane of mammalian cells transiently transfected with MscL, we used the azobenzene&#8208;derived detergents to optically activate the transmembrane mechanosensitive channel. This led to the rapid controlled uptake of membrane&#8208;impermeable molecules. Since detergents are extensively used in biochemistry and biotechnology, we propose that the photoswitchable detergents will be useful tools for the spatiotemporal modulation of membrane properties. Additionally, our work provides a design strategy for new detergents in membrane (protein) research.</dc:description>

         <title>From the Design of Innovative Ti&#8208;Pt Heterometallic Complexes to the Development of Highly Anti&#8208;Proliferative Water&#8208;Soluble Cationic Titanocenes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented Ti&#8208;Pt heterobimetallic complexes are synthesized, and are tested in various cancer cell lines exhibiting superior anti&#8208;proliferative properties compared to their monometallic counterparts. Notably, one of the corresponding non&#8208;platinum titanocene&#8208;terpyridine water&#8208;soluble derivative demonstrates high stability in PBS, submicromolar anti&#8208;proliferative activity in vitro, significant anticancer effects in vivo, and is trackable via multiphoton microscopy imaging.







Abstract
Two innovative early/late Ti&#8722;Pt&#8208;heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized, characterized, and screened in cell&#8208;based assays using several human (SW480 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and murine cancer cell lines (CT26 and EMT6) as well as a non&#8208;cancerous cell line (HMEC). The combination of the two metals &#8211; titanium(IV) and platinum (IV) &#8211; in a single molecule led to a synergistic biological activity (higher anti&#8208;proliferative properties than a mixture of each of the corresponding monometallic complexes). This study also investigated the benefits of associating a metal&#8208;free terpyridine moiety (with intrinsic biological activity) with a water&#8208;soluble titanocene fragment. The present work reveals that these combinations results in water&#8208;soluble titanocene compounds displaying an anti&#8208;proliferative activity down to the submicromolar level. One of these complexes induced an antitumor effect in&#8197;vivo in CT26 tumor bearing BALB/C mice. The terpyridine moiety was also used to track the complex in&#8197;vitro by multiphoton microscopy imaging.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has emerged as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Novel STING&#8208;activating small molecular therapeutics, including cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and non&#8208;CDN STING agonists, have been developed to activate the STING pathway for triggering innate immune response. This review introduces the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and highlights several STING agonists and their clinical development. Furthermore, limitations of these agents and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed.







Abstract
Immuno&#8208;oncology has become a revolutionary strategy for cancer treatment. Therapeutic interventions based on adaptive immunity through immune checkpoint therapy or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have received clinical approval for monotherapy and combination treatment in various cancers. Although these treatments have achieved clinical successes, only a minority of cancer patients show a response, highlighting the urgent need to discover new therapeutic molecules that could be exploited to improve clinical outcomes and pave the way for the next generation of immunotherapy. Given the critical role of the innate immune system against infection and cancer, substantial efforts have been dedicated to developing novel anticancer therapeutics that target these pathways. Targeting the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a powerful strategy to generate a durable antitumor response, and activation of the adaptor protein STING induces the initiation of transcriptional cascades, thereby producing type I interferons, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Various STING agonists, including natural or synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), have been developed as anticancer therapeutics. However, since most CDNs are confined to intratumoral administration, there has been a great interest in developing non&#8208;nucleotide agonists for systemic treatment. Here, we review the current development of STING&#8208;activating therapeutics in both preclinical and clinical stages.

         <title>Retinoids Molecular Probes by Late&#8208;stage Azide Insertion &#8211; Functional Tools to Decrypt Retinoid Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of close&#8208;to&#8208;native retinoid probes was synthesized through versatile late&#8208;stage azide insertion at the C4 position. These probes retain the ability of the original compound to activate gene transcription. Their ability to undergo in&#8197;vivo click reactions enabled the highlighting of biological activities in a zebrafish model.







Abstract
Studying the complex and intricate retinoids metabolic pathways by chemical biology approaches requires design and synthesis of biologically functional molecular probes. Only few of such molecular retinoid probes could be found in literature, most of them bearing a molecular structure quite different from natural retinoids. To provide close&#8208;to&#8208;native retinoid probes, we have developed a versatile late&#8208;stage method for the insertion of azide function at the C4 position of several retinoids. This one&#8208;step process opens straightforward access to different retinoid and carotenoid probes from commercially available precursors. We have further demonstrated that the different molecular probes retain ability of the original compound to activate genes&#8217; transcription, despite azide insertion, highlighting biological activities that were further validated in zebrafish in&#8197;vivo model. The present work paves the way to future studies on vitamin A's metabolism.

         <title>Probing Peptidoglycan Synthesis in the Gut Commensal Akkermansia Muciniphila with Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We here present cyclopropene and isonitrile functionalized analogs of d&#8208;Ala dipeptides, essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as new members of the bacterial metabolic labeling toolkit. These non&#8208;toxic, tetrazine click&#8208;compatible probes allowed us to detect and image peptidoglycan in live Akkermansia muciniphila bacteria. Their effectiveness in this anaerobic bacterium and also aerobic bacteria (E. coli) shows their potential for in&#8197;situ study of peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Our gut microbiota directly influences human physiology in health and disease. The myriad of surface glycoconjugates in both the bacterial cell envelope and our gut cells dominate the microbiota&#8208;host interface and play a critical role in host response and microbiota homeostasis. Among these, peptidoglycan is the basic glycan polymer offering the cell rigidity and a basis on which many other glycoconjugates are anchored. To directly study peptidoglycan in gut commensals and obtain the molecular insight required to understand their functional activities we need effective techniques like chemical probes to label peptidoglycan in live bacteria. Here we report a chemically guided approach to study peptidoglycan in a key mucin&#8208;degrading gut microbiota member of the Verrucomicrobia phylum, Akkermansia muciniphila. Two novel non&#8208;toxic tetrazine click&#8208;compatible peptidoglycan probes with either a cyclopropene or isonitrile handle allowed for the detection and imaging of peptidoglycan synthesis in this intestinal species.

         <title>Synthesis of New Bodipy Hydrazide Fluorescent Probes for the Detection of Carbonylated Proteins Generated by Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. We report the design and the synthesis of new BODIPY possessing a hydrazide function (BODIPY&#8722;Hz), an emission in the near&#8208;infra red area and high quantum yield. We show the use of these new BODIPY&#8722;Hz as fluorescent probes for carbonylated proteins labeling. We demonstrate that the new BODIPY&#8722;Hz are compatible with the 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis technology, and that it can be used directly for proteins labeling in cells monitored by fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Oxidative stress is a cellular disorder implicated in various severe diseases and redox biology and represents an important field of research for the last decades. One of the major consequences of oxidative stress is the carbonylation of proteins, which is also a reliable marker to assess protein oxidative modifications. Accumulation of carbonylated proteins has been associated with aging and age&#8208;related diseases and can ultimately causes cell death. Detection of these oxidative modifications is essential to understand and discover new treatments against oxidative stress. We describe the design and the synthetic pathway of new BODIPY fluorescent probes functionalized with hydrazide function for protein carbonyl labeling to improve existing methodologies such as 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis. Hydrazide BODIPY analogues show very good fluorescent properties such as NIR emission up to 633&#8197;nm and quantum yield up to 0.88. These new probes were validated for the detection and quantification of carbonylated proteins with 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis using mouse muscle protein extracts, as well as both flow cytometry and microscopy using oxidant stressed C2 C12 cells.

         <title>Task&#8208;Similarity is a Crucial Factor for Few&#8208;Shot Meta&#8208;Learning of Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;learning has emerged as a promising strategy to facilitate efficient few&#8208;shot model training for a specific target of interest. Here, we show that the performance of the meta&#8208;learned model critically depends on the correlation &#8211; captured in terms of molecular similarity and target activity &#8211; between the specific target of interest and the training data used to meta&#8208;learn the model.







Abstract
Machine learning models support computer&#8208;aided molecular design and compound optimization. However, the initial phases of drug discovery often face a scarcity of training data for these models. Meta&#8208;learning has emerged as a potentially promising strategy, harnessing the wealth of structure&#8208;activity data available for known targets to facilitate efficient few&#8208;shot model training for the specific target of interest. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of two different meta&#8208;learning methods, namely model&#8208;agnostic meta&#8208;learning (MAML) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF), specifically in the regression setting. We investigated how factors such as dataset size and the similarity of training tasks impact predictability. The results indicate that ADKF significantly outperformed both MAML and a single&#8208;task baseline model on the inhibition data. However, the performance of ADKF varied across different test tasks. Our findings suggest that considerable enhancements in performance can be anticipated primarily when the task of interest is similar to the tasks incorporated in the meta&#8208;learning process.

         <title>An Active and Versatile Electron Transport System for Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases from the Alkane Degrading Organism Acinetobacter sp. OC4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) from Acinetobacter sp. OC4 demonstrate to form a suitable electron transport system for CYP153A&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Spectral analysis confirms NADH reduction capability, while linker fusion strategies enhance electron transfer to model electron acceptors. The systems&#8216; application in driving various CYP153A subfamily members underscores their potential as a versatile electron transport system.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are valuable biocatalysts for the oxyfunctionalization of non&#8208;activated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds. Most CYPs rely on electron transport proteins as redox partners. In this study, the ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. OC4 are investigated. Upon heterologous production of both proteins independently in Escherichia coli, spectral analysis showed their reduction capability towards reporter electron acceptors, e.&#8201;g., cytochrome c. The individual proteins&#8217; specific activity towards cytochrome c reduction was 25&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Furthermore, the possibility to enhance electron transfer by artificial fusion of the units was elucidated. FdR and FD were linked by helical linkers [EAAAK]n, flexible glycine linkers [GGGGS]n or rigid proline linkers [EPPPP]n of n=1&#8211;4 sequence repetitions. The system with a glycine linker (n=4) reached an appreciable specific activity of 19&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1 towards cytochrome c. Moreover, their ability to drive different members of the CYP153A subfamily is demonstrated. By creating artificial self&#8208;sufficient P450s with FdR, FD, and a panel of four CYP153A representatives, effective hydroxylation of n&#8208;hexane in a whole&#8208;cell system was achieved. The results indicate this protein combination to constitute a functional and versatile surrogate electron transport system for this subfamily.

         <title>Allosteric Effects of EF&#8208;G Domain I Mutations Inducing Ribosome Frameshifting Revealed by Multiplexed Force Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Description: We report ribosome translocation studies with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution on both ends of the mRNA, using the newly invented multiplexed force spectroscopy technique. The high&#8208;resolution results revealed that the specifically engineered elongation factor G induced frameshifting in contrast to the wild type.







Abstract
Ribosome translocation catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF&#8208;G) is a critical step in protein synthesis where the ribosome typically moves along the mRNA by three nucleotides at each step. To investigate the mechanism of EF&#8208;G catalysis, it is essential to precisely resolve the ribosome motion at both ends of the mRNA, which, to our best knowledge, is only achieved with the magnetic&#8208;based force spectroscopy developed by our groups. Here, we introduce a novel multiplexed force spectroscopy technique that, for the first time, offers single&#8208;nucleotide resolution for multiple samples. This technique combines multiple acoustic force generators with the smallest atomic magnetometer designed for biological research. Utilizing this technique, we demonstrate that mutating EF&#8208;G at the GTP binding pocket results in the ribosome moving only two nucleotides on both ends of the mRNA, thereby compromising ribosome translocation. This finding suggests a direct link between GTP hydrolysis and ribosome translocation. Our results not only provide mechanistic insights into the role of GTP binding pocket but also illuminate how allosteric mutations can manipulate translocation. We anticipate broader applications of our technique in the ribosome field, leveraging its high efficiency and single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.

         <title>Binding and Stabilization of a Semiquinone Radical by an Artificial Metalloenzyme Containing a Binuclear Copper (II) Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was obtained by insertion of a binuclear copper complex coupled to a lauric acid anchor into &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin, using the Trojan Horse strategy. The resulting biohybrid did not show any catecholase activity as it efficiently stabilized the intermediate 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;semi&#8208;quinone radical (DTB&#8208;SQ).







Abstract
A binuclear Cu(II) cofactor was covalently bound to a lauric acid anchor. The resulting conjugate was characterized then combined with beta&#8208;lactoglobulin (&#946;LG) to generate a new biohybrid following the so&#8208;called &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; strategy. This biohybrid was examined for its effectiveness in the oxidation of a catechol derivative to the corresponding quinone. The resulting biohybrid did not exhibit the sought after catecholase activity, likely due to its ability to bind and stabilize the semiquinone radical intermediate DTB&#8208;SQ. This semi&#8208;quinone radical was stabilized only in the presence of the protein and was characterized using optical and magnetic spectroscopic techniques, demonstrating stability for over 16&#8197;hours. Molecular docking studies revealed that this stabilization could occur owing to interactions of the semi&#8208;quinone with hydrophobic amino acid residues of &#946;LG.

         <title>Chemical Production of Cytotoxic Bispecific Antibodies Using the Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the chemical synthesis of bispecific antibodies using two site&#8208;selective conjugation reactions. Seven constructs with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 valency were produced, including two cytotoxic T&#8208;cell engagers with IC50 values in the picomolar range in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for the treatment of several conditions, most importantly cancer. Based on the combination of two different antigen&#8208;binding motifs in a single macromolecule; bsAbs can either display the combined characteristics of their parent antibodies, or new therapeutic features, inaccessible by the sole combination of two distinct antibodies. While bsAbs are traditionally produced by molecular biology techniques, the chemical development of bsAbs holds great promises and strategies have just begun to surface. In this context, we took advantage of a chemical strategy based on the use of the Ugi reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of whole antibodies and coupled the resulting conjugates in a bioorthogonal manner with Fab fragments, derived from various antibodies. We thus managed to produce five different bsAbs with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 valency, with yields ranging from 20&#8201;% to 48&#8201;%, and showed that the affinity of the parent antibody was preserved in all bsAbs. We further demonstrated the interest of our strategy by producing two other bsAbs behaving as cytotoxic T cell engagers with IC50 values in the picomolar range in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Biocatalysis with In&#8208;Situ Product Removal Improves p&#8208;Coumaric Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine ammonia lyase suffers from product inhibition, a common issue in biocatalytic processes. An aqueous two&#8208;phase system was developed for the extraction of the product p&#8208;coumaric acid at high pH. Immobilization of tyrosine ammonia lyase allowed for in&#8208;situ product removal in the aqueous two&#8208;phase system, improving the biocatalysis production metrics.







Abstract
Natural and pure p&#8208;coumaric acid has valuable applications, and it can be produced via bioprocessing. However, fermentation processes have so far been unable to provide sufficient production metrics, while a biocatalytic process decoupling growth and production historically showed much promise. This biocatalytic process is revisited in order to tackle product inhibition of the key enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase. In situ product removal is proposed as a possible solution, and a polymer/salt aqueous two&#8208;phase system is identified as a suitable system for extraction of p&#8208;coumaric acid from an alkaline solution, with a partition coefficient of up to 13. However, a 10&#8201;% salt solution was found to reduce tyrosine ammonia lyase activity by 19&#8201;%, leading to the need for a more dilute system. The cloud points of two aqueous two&#8208;phase systems at 40&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;10 were found to be 3.8&#8201;% salt and 9.5&#8201;% polymer, and a 5&#8201;% potassium phosphate and 12.5&#8201;% poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;ran&#8208;propylene glycol) mW~2500 system was selected for in&#8197;situ product removal. An immobilized tyrosine ammonia lyase biocatalyst in this aqueous two&#8208;phase system produced up to 33&#8197;g/L p&#8208;coumaric acid within 24&#8197;hours, a 1.9&#8208;fold improvement compared to biocatalysis without in&#8197;situ product removal.

&lt;p&gt;Tyrosine ammonia lyase suffers from product inhibition, a common issue in biocatalytic processes. An aqueous two-phase system was developed for the extraction of the product &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumaric acid at high pH. Immobilization of tyrosine ammonia lyase allowed for in-situ product removal in the aqueous two-phase system, improving the biocatalysis production metrics.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Profiling Cellular Morphological Changes Induced by Dual&#8208;Targeting PROTACs of Aurora Kinase and RNA&#8208;Binding Protein YTHDF2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of the multi&#8208;kinase PROTACs revealed the first examples of PROTAC degraders for the RNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2. Morphological profiling of the PROTACs via the cell painting assay complemented the current characterization toolbox for PROTACs and provided insights into biological targets and mechanisms of action at the cellular phenotypic level.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are new chemical modalities that degrade proteins of interest, including established kinase targets and emerging RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs). Whereas diverse sets of biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays are available for the evaluation and optimizations of PROTACs in understanding the involved ubiquitin&#8722;proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation mechanism and the structure&#8208;degradation relationship, a phenotypic method profiling the cellular morphological changes is rarely used. In this study, first, we reported the only examples of PROTACs degrading the mRNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2 via screening of multikinase PROTACs. Second, we reported the profiling of cellular morphological changes of the dual kinase&#8208; and RBP&#8208;targeting PROTACs using the unbiased cell painting assay (CPA). The CPA analysis revealed the high biosimilarity with the established aurora kinase cluster and annotated aurora kinase inhibitors, which reflected the association between YTHDF2 and the aurora kinase signaling network. Broadly, the results demonstrated that the cell painting assay can be a straightforward and powerful approach to evaluate PROTACs. Complementary to the existing biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays, CPA provided a new perspective in characterizing PROTACs at the cellular morphology.

         <title>Development of Putative Bivalent Dicovalent Ligands for the Adenosine A1 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bivalent dicovalent compounds for the adenosine A1 receptor. We developed a series of bivalent compounds whereby each side contains the same ligand and covalent warhead. We show these compounds could be interacting across the adenosine A1 homodimer and have improved adenosine receptor subtype selectivity compared to the single covalent ligand counterpart.







Abstract
Accumulating evidence suggests that G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) can exist and function in homodimer and heterodimer forms. The adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) has been shown to form both homodimers and heterodimers, but there is a lack of chemical tools to study these dimeric receptor populations. This work describes the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a novel class of bivalent GPCR chemical tools, where each ligand moiety of the bivalent compound contains a sulfonyl fluoride covalent warhead designed to be capable of simultaneously reacting with each A1R of an A1R homodimer. The novel compounds were characterised using radioligand binding assays, including washout assays, and functionally in cAMP assays. The bivalent dicovalent compounds were competitive A1R antagonists and showed evidence of covalent binding and simultaneous binding across an A1R homodimer. Greater selectivity for A1R over the adenosine A3 receptor was observed for bivalent dicovalent over the equivalent monovalent compounds, indicating subtype selectivity can be achieved with dual occupation by a bivalent dicovalent ligand.

         <title>Structures and Protein Engineering of the &#945;&#8208;Keto Acid C&#8208;Methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA for Rational Substrate Transfer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent C&#8208;methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA catalyze the stereoselective methylation of enolizable &#945;&#8208;keto acids in the biosynthesis of antibiotic natural products. By investigating key residues of the crystallized enzymes and rational engineering of MrsA, the substrate scope can be transferred to &#945;&#8208;keto acid substrates from different biosynthetic pathways, enabling enzymatic C&#8208;methylation beyond native substrates.







Abstract
S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) are involved in the C&#8208;methylation of a variety of natural products. The MTs SgvM from Streptomyces griseoviridis and MrsA from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae catalyze the methylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of &#945;&#8208;keto acids in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic natural products viridogrisein and 3&#8208;methylarginine, respectively. MrsA shows high substrate selectivity for 5&#8208;guanidino&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, while other &#945;&#8208;keto acids, such as the SgvM substrates 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, 2&#8208;oxovalerate, and phenylpyruvate, are not accepted. Here we report the crystal structures of SgvM and MrsA in the apo form and bound with substrate or S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine. By investigating key residues for substrate recognition in the active sites of both enzymes and engineering MrsA by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, the substrate range of MrsA was extended to accept &#945;&#8208;keto acid substrates of SgvM with uncharged and lipophilic &#946;&#8208;residues. Our results showcase the transfer of the substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;keto acid MTs from different biosynthetic pathways by rational design.

Due to its turn&#8208;ON response to apolar environment, the 4&#8208;DiMe&#8208;ANI enables wash&#8208;free imaging of lipid droplets in living cells with excellent LD/cytosol signal ratio







Abstract
The impacts of dimethylation of 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide (ANI) on its photophysical properties are reported. The resulting 4&#8208;DiMe&#8208;ANI displays completely different fluorescence properties, conferring it ability to selectively label lipid droplets in living cells. A comprehensive photophysical study revealed that this selectivity arises from an Internal Charge Transfer favored in lipophilic media to the detriment of a non&#8208;emissive TICT in more polar media. This results in a very high &#8220;LDs/Cytosol&#8221; signal ratio, enabling LDs to be imaged with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and positioning its performance above that of the BODIPY 493/503 commonly used to image LDs.

The resulting 4-DiMe-ANI displays completely different fluorescence properties, conferring it ability to selectively label lipid droplets in living cells. A comprehensive photophysical study revealed that this selectivity arises from an Internal Charge Transfer favored in lipophilic media to the detriment of a non-emissive TICT in more polar media. This results in a very high &#8220;LDs/Cytosol&#8221; signal ratio, enabling LDs to be imaged with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, and positioning its performance above that of the BODIPY 493/503 commonly used to image LDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Induced Suppression of PEG Crystallization from the Melt in a PEG&#8208;Peptide Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on crystallization of PEG in an amyloid peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate is investigated by SAXS/WAXS and DSC. The crystallization of PEG is suppressed (with sufficiently high &#945;CD content in the blends) due to complexation with &#945;CD, leading to hexagonal mesophase formation.







Abstract
The influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on PEG crystallization is examined for a peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate, YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3k comprising an amyloid peptide YYKLVFF linked to PEG with molar mass 3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Remarkably, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous synchrotron small&#8208;angle/wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) show that crystallization of PEG is suppressed by &#945;CD, provided that the cyclodextrin content is sufficient. A hexagonal mesophase is formed instead. The &#945;CD threading reduces the conformational flexibility of PEG, and hence suppresses crystallization. These results show that addition of cyclodextrins can be used to tune the crystallization of peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates and potentially other polymer/biomolecular hybrids.

         <title>Fluorocarbon&#8208;DNA Conjugates for Enhanced Cellular Delivery: Formation of a Densely Packed DNA Nano&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA conjugates were synthesized possessing perfluoroalkyl (RF) groups with different length, position, number, and stereochemistry. Systematical structural investigation revealed that the incorporation of a few long RF groups at the terminus of a DNA strand contributed to the formation of a nano&#8208;assembly with exceedingly high DNA density, which allowed itself taken up into cells efficiently.







Abstract
Forming nano&#8208;assemblies is essential for delivering DNA conjugates into cells, with the DNA density in the nano&#8208;assembly playing an important role in determining the uptake efficiency. In this study, we developed a strategy for the facile synthesis of DNA strands bearing perfluoroalkyl (RF) groups (RF&#8208;DNA conjugates) and investigated how they affect cellular uptake. An RF&#8208;DNA conjugate bearing a long RF group at the DNA terminus forms a nano&#8208;assembly with a high DNA density, which results in greatly enhanced cellular uptake. The uptake mechanism is mediated by clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis. The use of RF groups to densely assemble negatively charged DNA is a useful strategy for designing drug delivery carriers.

Several RF&#8208;DNA conjugates are synthesized, and the relationship between the uptake efficiency and the physicochemical properties is systematically investigated. RF&#8208;DNA conjugates carrying two C8F17 groups at the terminus of a DNA strand form a nano&#8208;assembly with the highest DNA content, leading to the greatest cellular uptake via scavenger receptors. More details can be found in article 10.1002/cbic.202400436 by Ai Kohata, Kohsuke Aikawa, and co&#8208;workers.

         <dc:description>
Ribosomal translocation, catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF&#8208;G), is a critical step in protein synthesis during which the ribosome typically moves three nucleotides along the mRNA per cycle. Using a new technique of multiplexed super&#8208;resolution force spectroscopy, it is shown that two engineered EF&#8208;G mutants, with mutated residues located approximately 80 Angstroms away from the EF&#8208;G pivot point, induce the ribosome to translocate by only two nucleotides, resulting in &#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; frameshifting. The article 10.1002/cbic.202400130 by Shoujun Xu, Yuhong Wang, and provides unique insights into EF&#8208;G&#8208;catalyzed ribosomal motion with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution from both ends of the mRNA.

Photoactivatable oligonucleotides in combination with recent developments in mass spectrometry are powerful tools for studying nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions involved in numerous biological processes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the different strategies for incorporating the most used photoreactive reagents into oligonucleotides probes and we illustrate their applications with several examples.







Abstract
A variety of proteins interact with DNA and RNA, including polymerases, histones, ribosomes, transcription factors, and repair enzymes. However, the transient non&#8208;covalent nature of these interactions poses challenges for analysis. Introducing a covalent bond between proteins and DNA via photochemical activation of a photosensitive functional group introduced onto nucleic acids offers a means to stabilize these often weak interactions without significantly altering the binding interface. Consequently, photoactivatable oligonucleotides are powerful tools for investigating nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions involved in numerous biological and pathological processes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the chemical tools developed so far and the different strategies used for incorporating the most commonly used photoreactive reagents into oligonucleotide probes or nucleic acids. Furthermore, we illustrate their application with several examples including protein binding site mapping, identification of protein binding partners, and in cell studies.

         <title>Using F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to Understand the Ubiquitination Landscape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a critical and detailed analysis for the use of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a tool to study protein ubiquitination. Topics include the unique approaches where FRET is used to quantify the transfer of ubiquitin through the E1, E2 and E3 enzymes of the ubiquitination cascade, the removal of ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes and the processing of ubiquitin&#8208;labelled proteins by the 26S&#8197;proteasome. FRET methods have enabled protein interactions, conformational changes and dynamics of the ubiquitination pathway to be measured that can be adapted to several high&#8208;throughput technologies and on the single molecule level.







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a fluorescence technique that allows quantitative measurement of protein interactions, kinetics and dynamics. This review covers the use of FRET to study the structures and mechanisms of ubiquitination and related proteins. We survey FRET assays that have been developed where donor and acceptor fluorophores are placed on E1, E2 or E3 enzymes and ubiquitin (Ub) to monitor steady&#8208;state and real&#8208;time transfer of Ub through the ubiquitination cascade. Specialized FRET probes placed on Ub and Ub&#8208;like proteins have been developed to monitor Ub removal by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that result in a loss of a FRET signal upon cleavage of the FRET probes. FRET has also been used to understand conformational changes in large complexes such as multimeric E3 ligases and the proteasome, frequently using sophisticated single molecule methods. Overall, FRET is a powerful tool to help unravel the intricacies of the complex ubiquitination system.

         <title>CNS Drug Discovery in Academia: Where Basic Research Meets Innovation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 19, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug discovery in academia provides both challenges and opportunities as shown by an in&#8208;depth analysis of drug discovery projects in the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research TransCure (2010&#8211;2022). A successful translational project related to selective endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitors is discussed providing a showcase of how innovative research in academia can inspire drug discovery.







Abstract
The involvement of academic research in drug discovery is consistently growing. However, academic projects seldom advance to clinical trials. Here, we assess the landscape of drug discovery within the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) TransCure launched by the Swiss National Science Foundation to foster basic research and early&#8208;stage drug discovery on membrane transporters. This included transporters in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, which represent a huge unmet medical need. While idea championship, sustainable funding, collaborations between disciplines at the interface of academia and industry are important for translational research, Popperian falsifiability, strong intellectual property and a motivated startup team are key elements for innovation. This is exemplified by the NCCR TransCure spin&#8208;off company Synendos Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotech company developing the first selective endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitors (SERIs) as novel treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. We provide a perspective on the challenges related to entering an uncharted druggable space and bridging the often mentioned &#8220;valley of death&#8221;. The high attrition rate of drug discovery projects in the CNS field within academia is often due to the lack of meaningful animal models that can provide pharmacological proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for potentially disruptive technologies at the earliest stages, and the absence of solid intellectual property.

         <title>Optimizing Transfection Efficiency of Spermine Polar Head Cholesterol&#8208;based Cationic Lipids with Amino Acid Linker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a series of spermine polar head cholesterol&#8208;based cationic lipids with various amino acid spacers were synthesized and evaluated as non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. The physicochemical properties of the resulting lipoplexes, formed from these lipids and DOPE, were assessed, including zeta&#8208;potential, DNA binding and DNA protection from serum. Transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity were examined under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8208;40% serum&#8208;containing conditions. The results showed that the physicochemical properties of cationic lipids, both with and without amino acid spacers, were not significantly different. Cationic liposomes composed of lipid Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol, which has a 6&#8208;aminohexanoic acid spacer, and DOPE exhibited greater transfection efficiency in HeLa cells compared to Lipofectamine3000, both in the absence and presence of 10&#8208;40% serum. Additionally, lipid Sper&#8208;His&#8208;Chol with a histidine spacer and Sper&#8208;Ahx&#8208;Chol showed higher efficiency than Lipofectamine3000 against HEK293T under 40% serum conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of amino acids into the cationic lipids can significantly enhance their DNA delivery efficiency. Specifically, certain amino acid modifications improved transfection efficiency while maintaining low cytotoxicity. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;tailored cationic lipids as promising vectors for enhanced DNA delivery.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Original covalent probes with an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamide cleavable linker were developed to target a broad set of human Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs). The electrophilicity of this cleavable linker was modulated to improve the selectivity of the probes as well as reduce their unspecific reactivity in complex biological matrices. We first demonstrated that targeting the S3&#160;subsite of MMPs enables access to broad&#8208;spectrum affinity&#8208;based probes that exclusively react with the active version of these proteases. The probes were further assessed in proteomes of varying complexity, where human MMP&#8208;13 was artificially introduced at known concentration and the resulting labeled MMP was imaged by in&#8208;gel fluorescence imaging. We showed that the less reactive probe was still able to covalently modify MMP&#8208;13 while exhibiting reduced off&#8208;target unspecific reactivity. This study clearly demonstrated the importance of finely controlling the reactivity of the NASA warhead to improve the selectivity of covalent probes in complex biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Complex&#8208;Gold Nanoparticle Hybrid for Biofilm Inhibition and Eradication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofilms, which are resistant to conventional antimicrobial treatments, pose significant challenges in medical and industrial environments. This study introduces manganese complex&#8208;gold nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;DPA&#8208;AuNPs) as a hybrid strategy for biofilm inhibition and eradication. Upon exposure to green light, these nanoparticles significantly enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. This activity substantially reduces the regrowth potential of the surviving bacteria within the biofilm, with marked efficacy noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. This study highlights the potential of integrating manganese complexes with gold nanoparticles to develop advanced antimicrobial agents against resistant biofilms, offering a promising approach to enhance microbial control in diverse settings.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Sensitivity of YFPs is Reduced Upon AlphaRep Binding: Proof of Concept in Vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Citrine is a fluorescent protein (FP) whose fluorescence is pH&#8208;sensitive. The artificial repeat protein, &#945;Rep, binds to Citrine at all pHs, enhancing its thermal stability and reducing its pH sensitivity by lowering its pKa. The same effect is observed in living cells or with other yellow FPs in&#8197;vitro, suggesting &#945;Reps&#8217; potential to improve YFP utility in acidic environments.







Abstract
Yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) are commonly used in biology to track cellular processes, particularly as acceptors in experiments using the F&#246;rster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) phenomenon. However, their fluorescence intensity is strongly pH&#8208;dependent, limiting their utility in acidic environments. Here, we explore the pH sensitivity of YFPs upon binding with an artificial repeat protein (&#945;Rep) both in&#8197;vitro and in living cells. We show that &#945;Rep binds to Citrine, with high affinity in the nanomolar range at physiological and acidic pHs, leading to increased thermal stability of the complex. Moreover, &#945;Rep binding reduces Citrine's pKa by 0.75&#8197;pH units, leading to a decreased sensitivity to pH fluctuations. This effect can be generalized to other YFPs as Venus and EYFP in&#8197;vitro. An efficient binding of &#945;Rep to Citrine has also been observed in living cells both at pH&#8197;7.4 and pH&#8197;6. This interaction leads to reduced variations of Citrine fluorescence intensity in response to pH variations in cells. Overall, the study highlights the potential of &#945;Reps as a tool to modulate the pH sensitivity of YFPs, paving the way for future exploration of biological events in acidic environments by FRET in combination with a pH&#8208;insensitive cyan donor.

The same effect is observed in living cells or with other yellow FPs in&#8197;vitro, suggesting &#945;Reps&#8217; potential to improve YFP utility in acidic environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) are commonly used in biology to track cellular processes, particularly as acceptors in experiments using the F&#246;rster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) phenomenon. However, their fluorescence intensity is strongly pH-dependent, limiting their utility in acidic environments. Here, we explore the pH sensitivity of YFPs upon binding with an artificial repeat protein (&#945;Rep) both &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in living cells. We show that &#945;Rep binds to Citrine, with high affinity in the nanomolar range at physiological and acidic pHs, leading to increased thermal stability of the complex. Moreover, &#945;Rep binding reduces Citrine's pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; by 0.75&#8197;pH units, leading to a decreased sensitivity to pH fluctuations. This effect can be generalized to other YFPs as Venus and EYFP &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;. An efficient binding of &#945;Rep to Citrine has also been observed in living cells both at pH&#8197;7.4 and pH&#8197;6. This interaction leads to reduced variations of Citrine fluorescence intensity in response to pH variations in cells. Overall, the study highlights the potential of &#945;Reps as a tool to modulate the pH sensitivity of YFPs, paving the way for future exploration of biological events in acidic environments by FRET in combination with a pH-insensitive cyan donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzymatic Cascade for Toxicant Degradation and Sugar Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a novel one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade approach for converting toxicants and continuously generating an electron acceptor for production of sugar acids. This method offers a promising solution to concerns about pesticide toxicity and environmental contamination by transforming hazardous substances into a useful electron acceptor. This acceptor is then utilized to produce valuable chemicals with broad industrial applications, particularly in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. The cascade reaction employs organophosphate hydrolase (OPD) to convert pesticides into 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP), which is subsequently transformed into 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone by HadA monooxygenase (HadA). 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone serves as an electron acceptor in the catalysis of sugar acid formation via pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH). The results indicate that this cascade reaction effectively converts lactose to lactobionic acid and xylose to 2&#8208;keto&#8208;xylonic acid. The latter can be further processed into xylonic acid through NaBH4 reduction. Notably, the one&#8208;pot reaction yields up to 10% higher compared to the direct addition of 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. The synthesized xylonic acid exhibits exceptional water uptake properties in hydrogels, and the synthesized lactobionic acid shows antioxidant activity comparable to well&#8208;established antioxidants. These findings demonstrate the technological viability of these reaction cascades for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Structural Diversity of Encapsulin Protein Shells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subcellular compartmentalization is a universal feature of all cells. Spatially distinct compartments, be they lipid&#8208; or protein&#8208;based, enable cells to optimize local reaction environments, store nutrients, and sequester toxic processes. Prokaryotes generally lack intracellular membrane systems and usually rely on protein&#8208;based compartments and organelles to regulate and optimize their metabolism. Encapsulins are one of the most diverse and widespread classes of prokaryotic protein compartments. They self&#8208;assemble into icosahedral protein shells and are able to specifically internalize dedicated cargo enzymes. This review discusses the structural diversity of encapsulin protein shells, focusing on shell assembly, symmetry, and dynamics. The properties and functions of pores found within encapsulin shells will also be discussed. In addition, fusion and insertion domains embedded within encapsulin shell protomers will be highlighted. Finally, future research directions for basic encapsulin biology, with a focus on the structural understand of encapsulins, are briefly outlined.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid conjugation methodologies involves linking the nucleic acid sequence to other (bio)molecules covalently. This typically allows for nucleic acid property enhancement whether it be for therapeutic purposes, biosensing, etc. Here, we report a streamlined aqueous compatible on&#8208;column conjugation methodology using nucleic acids containing a site&#8208;specific amino&#8208;modifier. Both monophosphates and carboxylates were amenable to the conjugation strategy, allowing for the introduction of a variety of useful handles including azide, aryl, and hydrophobic groups in DNA. We find that an on&#8208;column approach is superior to post&#8208;synthetic template&#8208;directed synthesis, mainly with respect to product purification and recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>The industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp derived monosaccharides d&#8208;Galacturonic acid and l&#8208;Arabinose.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review provides a perspective on the industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp (SBP) derived monosaccharides. The broad application of these monosaccharides could contribute to bio&#8208;based alternatives and sustainable practices, essential for the transition towards a more circular economy. This review focuses on the utilization and application of two SBP monosaccharides, d&#8208;galacturonic acid (d&#8208;GalA) and l&#8208;arabinose (l&#8208;Ara), derived from pectin and hemicellulose. These polysaccharides are major components of sugar beet pulp, an important side stream of sucrose production. d&#8208;GalA and l&#8208;Ara are therefore abundant in biomass and offer unique molecular structures amenable to selective chemical or enzymatic modifications. We review their application in various industrial applications such as the development and production of bioactive compounds, home and personal care products, and other industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Amyloid Fibril Formation on Neuronal Cells in the Coexistence of A&#946;40 and A&#946;42</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abnormal aggregation and subsequent deposition of amyloid &#946;&#8208;protein (A&#946;) in the brain are considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The two major species of A&#946; are A&#946;40 and A&#946;42, present at an approximate ratio of 9: 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal membranes are an important platform of amyloidogenesis by A&#946;. However, information on the aggregational behaviors of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 on membranes is lacking. In this study, the aggregation and resultant cytotoxicity of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 at a physiologically relevant ratio were investigated by fluorescence techniques. We found that the degree of coexistence of both A&#946;s in aggregates increased as the assembly proceeded, and reached a maximum in fibrils. However, the cytotoxicity of the mixed fibrils was weaker than that of A&#946;42 fibrils, indicating that A&#946;40 attenuates the toxicity of A&#946;42 by forming mixed fibrils. In contrast, the degree of coexistence was significantly lower in aqueous phase aggregation, highlighting different aggregation mechanisms between in membranes and in the aqueous phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of a New Antitumor Pyranonaphthoquinone from Streptomyces tanashiensis

DSM 731: Insights from Single&#8208;Molecule Stretching Assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guided by molecular networking based on single&#8208;molecule stretching assay, an unprecedented pyranonaphthoquinone, methyl kalafunginate (1) and five known compounds 2&#8211;6 were isolated from Streptomyces tanashiensis&#160;DSM 731. Compound 1 was characterized through a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis, ECD calculation, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Interestingly, we discovered that compound 1 was spontaneously converted from kalafungin (4) in methanol solution. All isolated compounds were assessed for their cytotoxic potential against a panel of five human cancer cell lines: A549, HepG2, BxPC&#8208;3, SW620, and C4&#8208;2B. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 exhibited remarkable cytotoxicity with IC50&#160;values below 2.382 &#956;M, suggesting their potential as promising anticancer agents. These findings  highlight the significance of using a combined approach of single&#8208;molecule stretching assays and molecular networking for efficiently discovering novel natural products with potential therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ursolic Acid Conjugates: A New Frontier in Anticancer Drug Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ursolic acid (UA) conjugates were synthesized through molecular hybridization, targeting C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;28. These conjugates demonstrated improved antiproliferative activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) and bladder cancer cell lines. Notably, compounds 18&#8201;c and 18&#8201;d exhibited significant cytotoxic properties, with 18&#8201;d showing exceptional selectivity for cancer cells over normal epithelial cells. Moreover, 18d demonstrated better pharmacokinetic properties.







Abstract
New Ursolic Acid (UA) conjugates were synthesized using optimized synthetic protocols through the molecular hybridization approach at C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;28. This resulted in the targeted molecules being produced in good yields. Some of the synthesized conjugates showed significantly relevant bioactivity against mammalian cells and in animal models of cancers. Selected UA conjugates were tested against bladder and breast cancer cell lines. The conjugates showed moderate to significantly enhanced antiproliferative activities against Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC; MDA&#8208;MB 231), which is an aggressive tumor making up about 10&#8211;15&#8201;% of all breast cancers and bladder (T24 and 5637) cancer cell lines. These properties were superior to the parent UA. Among all the synthesized compounds, 18&#8201;c and 18&#8201;d have exhibited promising antiproliferative and cytotoxic properties against all tested cancer cell lines. However, 18&#8201;d has proved to be exceptionally selective for cancer cell lines, showing more cytotoxicity towards them than normal epithelial cells (MCF&#8208;12A). Compound 18&#8201;d has demonstrated cytotoxicity against tumor cells, including those intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy drugs such as 2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;deoxy cytidine (Gemcitabine). The activity of the UA conjugates on tumor cells was mediated by multiple cytotoxic mechanisms, including drug&#8208;induced cytotoxic autophagy and programmed cell death, indicating a novel possibility of combination therapy.

         <title>Modulating Enzyme Activity using Engineered Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials offer a tunable platform for modulating enzyme activity. Based on their size, structure, and functionalization, they can inhibit or even enhance enzyme performance. Importantly, these effects can be reversible, enabling temporal control over enzyme function. This Concept highlights key advancements in this field and outlines areas in need of further development toward unlocking a broader range of applications.







Abstract
Enzymes serve as pivotal components in various biotechnological applications across several industries. Understanding enzyme inhibition sheds light on how certain compounds disrupt biochemical pathways, facilitating the design of targeted drugs for combating diseases. On the other hand, reversible inhibition or enhancement of activity can unlock new ways of controlling industrial reactions and boosting the catalytic activity of native enzymes that are taken out of their natural environments. Over the last two decades, immobilizing enzymes on nanomaterial&#8208;based solid supports has emerged as an especially promising approach for tuning enzyme activity. Nanomaterials not only inhibit enzymes but also enhance their performance, showcasing their versatility. This Concept highlights significant advancements in utilizing nanomaterials for enzyme modulation and discusses future prospects for leveraging this phenomenon in developing sophisticated molecular systems and downstream applications.

         <title>Mechanisms in the Synthesis of S&#8208;Alcohols with 1,4&#8208;NADH Biomimetic Co&#8208;factor N&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide using Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase: A Hybrid Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH), was investigated via a hybrid computational approach, for molecular reactions involved in chiral synthesis of S&#8208;alcohols, when the natural co&#8208;factor, 1,4&#8208;dihyronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 1,4&#8208;NADH, was replaced with biomimetic co&#8208;factor, N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide, 1.&#160; We surmised that different hydride and proton transfer mechanisms were involved using co&#8208;factor, 1. An alternative mechanism, where the hydride transfer step occurred, via an &#951;1&#8208;keto&#8208;S&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;5,6&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide&#8208;Zn(II) complex, was previously investigated with a model of the HLADH&#8208;Zn(II) catalytic site (J. Organometal. Chem. 2021, 943, 121810). &#160;Presently, we studied canonical and alternative mechanisms compared to models of the entire enzyme structure. &#160;We disproved the &#951;2&#8208;Zn(II) complex, and discovered a canonical hydride transfer from biomimetic 1,4&#8208;NADH, 1, to the Zn(II) bound prochiral ketone substrate, followed by a new proton relay, consisting of a water chain connecting His51 to Ser48 that accomplished the S&#8208;alkoxy anion&#8217;s protonation to yield the final S&#8208;alcohol product. The HLADH catalysis, with biomimetic co&#8208;factor, 1, that replaced the ribose group, the 5'&#8208;diphosphate groups, and the adenine nucleotide with a N&#8208;benzyl group, has provided a new paradigm for the design of other structures of 1,4&#8208;NADH biomimetic co&#8208;factors, including their economic value in biocatalysis reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Guided Engineering of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase for Aliphatic Ester Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Esters are valuable aroma compounds and can be produced enzymatically by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) from (aliphatic) ketone precursors. However, a genetically encoded biosensor system for the assessment of BVMO activity and the detection of reaction products is missing. In this work, we assembled a synthetic enzyme cascade &#8211; featuring an esterase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, and LuxAB &#8211; in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Target esters are produced by a BVMO, subsequently cleaved, and the corresponding alcohol oxidized through the artificial pathway. Ultimately, aldehyde products are detected in vivo by LuxAB, a luciferase from Photorhabdus luminescens that emits bioluminescence upon the oxidation of aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylates. This biosensor system greatly accelerated the screening and selection of active BVMO variants from a focused library, omitting commonly used low&#8208;throughput chromatographic analysis. Engineered enzymes accepted linear aliphatic ketones such as 2&#8208;undecanone and 2&#8208;dodecanone and exhibited improved ester formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Optogenetic Tools for Regulating RNA Metabolism and Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA molecules play a vital role in linking genetic information with various cellular processes. In recent years, a variety of optogenetic tools have been engineered for regulating cellular RNA metabolism and functions. These highly desirable tools can offer non&#8208;intrusive control with spatial precision, remote operation, and biocompatibility. Here, we would like to review these currently available approaches that can regulate RNAs with light: from non&#8208;genetically encodable chemically modified oligonucleotides to genetically encoded RNA aptamers that recognize photosensitive small&#8208;molecule or protein ligands. Some key applications of these optogenetic tools will also be highlighted to illustrate how they have been used for regulating all aspects of the RNA life cycle: from RNA synthesis, maturation, modification, and translation to their degradation, localization, and phase separation control. Some current challenges and potential practical utilizations of these RNA optogenetic tools will also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Multiplexed Assessment of Aromatic Prenyltransferase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An increasingly effective strategy to identify synthetically useful enzymes is to sample the diversity already present in Nature. Here, we construct and assay a panel of phylogenetically diverse aromatic prenyltransferases (PTs). These enzymes catalyze a variety of C&#8211;C bond forming reactions in natural product biosynthesis and are emerging as tools for synthetic chemistry and biology. Homolog screening was further empowered through substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening, which provides direct information on enzyme specificity. We perform a head&#8208;to&#8208;head assessment of the model members of the PT family and further identify homologs with divergent sequences that rival these superb enzymes. This effort revealed the first bacterial O&#8211;Tyr PT and, together, provide valuable benchmarking for future synthetic applications of PTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Based Discovery of New Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;dependent fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) hold significant potential for biotechnology, due to their capability to produce alka(e)nes directly from the corresponding (un)saturated natural fatty acids requiring light as the only reagent. This study expands the family of FAPs through cavity&#8208;based enzyme discovery methods. Thirty enzyme candidates with potential photodecarboxylation activity were identified by matching the cavities of four related template structures against the Protein Data Bank's flavoproteins, a library of proteins identified via the Foldseek Search Server, and homology models of sequences resulting from BLAST. Subsequent docking experiments narrowed this library to ten promising enzymes, which were expressed and assessed in vitro, identifying four photodecarboxylases. Out of these enzymes, the GMC oxidoreductase from Coccomyxa sp. Obi (CoFAP) was characterized in detail, which revealed high activity in the decarboxylation reactions of palmitic acid and octanoic acid and a broad pH tolerance (pH 6.5&#8208;9.5).</dc:description>

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;like Aggregation Propensities of Metabolites &#8208;&#160;Homogentisic acid, N&#8208;Acetyl aspartic acid and Isovaleric acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation of metabolites into amyloidogenic aggregates represent an intriguing dimension in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders, including alkaptonuria, canavan disease, and isovaleric acidemia. Central to this phenomenon are the metabolites homogentisic acid (HA), N&#8208;acetyl aspartic acid (NAA), and isovaleric acid (IVA), which we found, weave an intricate network of self&#8208;assembled structures. Leveraging an array of microscopy techniques, we traced the morphological behavior of these assemblies that exhibit concentration and time&#8208;dependent morphological transitions from isolated globules to clustered aggregates. MD simulation studies suggest significant role of hydrogen bonding interactions in the aggregation process. While displaying strong amyloidogenic propensity in solution, these aged aggregates were significantly cytotoxic to mouse neural N2a cell lines. &#160;In vivo effect in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode further validated cytotoxicity of aggregates. Our findings provide fresh insights to amyloidogenic nature of HA, NAA, and IVA aggregates and their possible role in associated metabolic disorders such as alkaptonuria, canavan disease and isovaleric acidemia.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Origami&#8208;Armored DNA Condensates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pickering&#8208;emulsion&#8208;type coating of DNA condensates with 3D DNA origami nanoparticles is reported. By connecting the DNA origami on the DNA condensate surface, named the &#8216;armoring&#8217; process, DNA condensates became sufficiently stable to prevent fusion. Moreover, the armored DNA condensates achieved the selective semipermeability of molecules and multicellular structures of DNA condensates.







Abstract
DNA condensates, formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), emerge as promising soft matter assemblies for creating artificial cells. The advantages of DNA condensates are their molecular permeability through the surface due to their membrane&#8208;less structure and their fluidic property. However, they face challenges in the design of their surface, e.&#8201;g., unintended fusion and less regulation of permeable molecules. Addressing them, we report surface modification of DNA condensates with DNA origami nanoparticles, employing a Pickering&#8208;emulsion strategy. We successfully constructed core&#8208;shell structures with DNA origami coatings on DNA condensates and further enhanced the condensate stability toward fusion via connecting DNA origamis by responding to DNA input strands. The &#8216;armoring&#8217; prevented the fusion of DNA condensates, enabling the formation of multicellular&#8208;like structures of DNA condensates. Moreover, the permeability was altered through the state change from coating to armoring the DNA condensates. The armored DNA condensates have significant potential for constructing artificial cells, offering increased surface stability and selective permeability for small molecules while maintaining compartmentalized space and multicellular organization.

         <title>Advances in Evolved T7 RNA Polymerases for Expanding the Frontiers of Enzymatic Nucleic Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering T7 RNA polymerase for RNA synthesis: The in&#8197;vitro synthesis of RNA is essential for basic RNA research and its therapeutic applications. This review highlights advancements in the engineering of T7 RNA polymerase for the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids incorporating non&#8208;canonical nucleotides and discuss prospective developments in this field.







Abstract
In vitro RNA synthesis technologies are crucial in developing therapeutic RNA drugs, such as mRNA vaccines and RNA interference (RNAi) therapies. Enzymatic RNA synthesis, recognized for its sustainability and efficiency, enables the production of extensive RNA sequences under mild conditions. Among the enzymes utilized, T7 RNA polymerase is distinguished by its exceptional catalytic efficiency, enabling the precise and rapid transcription of RNA from DNA templates by recognizing the specific T7 promoter sequence. With the advancement in clinical applications of RNA&#8208;based drugs, there is an increasing demand for the synthesis of chemically modified RNAs that are stable and resistant to nuclease degradation. To this end, researchers have applied directed evolution to broaden the enzyme's substrate scope, enhancing its compatibility with non&#8208;canonical substrates and reducing the formation of by&#8208;products. This review summarizes the progress in engineering T7 RNA polymerase for these purposes and explores prospective developments in the field.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Consequences of NEDD8 Acetylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides the notion that under oxidative stress conditions NEDD8 acetylation affects PARP1 activity, only little is known about the functional consequences of NEDD8 acetylation. Therefore, we used genetic code expansion to generate mono&#8208;acetylated (AcK) NEDD8 variants, enabling their detailed characterization on a biochemical and structural level. Moreover, we identified p300 as a NEDD8 acetyl&#8208;transferase.







Abstract
Similar to ubiquitin, the ubiquitin&#8208;like protein NEDD8 is not only conjugated to other proteins but is itself subject to posttranslational modifications including lysine acetylation. Yet, compared to ubiquitin, only little is known about the biochemical and structural consequences of site&#8208;specific NEDD8 acetylation. Here, we generated site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;acetylated NEDD8 variants for each known acetylation site by genetic code expansion. We show that, in particular, acetylation of K11 has a negative impact on the usage of NEDD8 by the NEDD8&#8208;conjugating enzymes UBE2M and UBE2F and that this is likely due to electrostatic and steric effects resulting in conformational changes of NEDD8. Finally, we provide evidence that p300 acts as a position&#8208;specific NEDD8 acetyltransferase.

         <title>Chemical Diversity of Aspergillus alliaceus Phenotypes: Discovery of Brominated Bianthrones with Activity against Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Cell Lines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three developmental forms of the marine&#8208;derived fungus Aspergillus alliaceus grown in different media resulted in the isolation and characterization of 14 fungal metabolites, including new brominated polyketides. The allianthrones exhibit selective in&#8197;vitro activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the genome of A.&#8197;alliaceus was sequenced and the bianthrone&#8208;producing biosynthetic gene cluster identified.







Abstract
Marine&#8208;derived fungi have emerged as a source for novel metabolites with a broad range of bioactivities. However, accessing the full potential of fungi under standard laboratory conditions remains challenging. LC&#8211;MS&#8208;based metabolomics in combination with varied culture conditions is a fast and powerful tool to detect new metabolites. Here, three developmental forms of the marine&#8208;derived fungus Aspergillus alliaceus were analyzed and 14 fungal metabolites, including new brominated polyketides (11&#8208;14) were isolated. Structure elucidation relied mainly on 1D and 2D NMR techniques and was supported by low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and DFT&#8208;based computations. We sequenced the A.&#8197;alliaceus genome, identified the bianthrone&#8208;producing biosynthetic gene cluster, and conducted expression analysis on genes involved in sexual development and biosynthesis. The NCI&#8208;60&#8197;cell line panel revealed selective in&#8197;vitro activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) for the halogenated allianthrones and their full antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects were evaluated in five TNBC cell lines.

         <title>Chemical tools for probing the Ub/Ubl conjugation cascades</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) and structurally related ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (Ubl's), essential for many cellular processes, employs muti&#8208;step reactions orchestrated by specific E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. The E1 enzyme activates the Ub/Ubl C&#8208;terminus in an ATP&#8208;dependent process that results in the formation of a thioester linkage with the E1 active site cysteine. The thioester activated Ub/Ubl is transferred to the active site of an E2 enzyme which then interacts with an E3 enzyme to promote conjugation to the target substrate. The E1&#8208;E2&#8208;E3 enzymatic cascades utilize labile intermediates, extensive conformational changes, and vast combinatorial diversity of short&#8208;lived protein&#8208;protein complexes to conjugate Ub/Ubl to various substrates in a regulated manner. In this review, we discuss various chemical tools and methods used to study the consecutive steps of Ub/Ubl activation and conjugation, which are often too elusive for direct studies. We focus on methods developed to probe enzymatic activities and capture and characterize stable mimics of the transient intermediates and transition states thereby providing insights into fundamental mechanisms in the Ub/Ubl conjugation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;specific modification of native IgGs with flexible drug&#8208;load</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous, site&#8208;specifically conjugated antibodies have shown to result in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with improved efficacy and tolerability compared to stochastically conjugated ADCs. However, precisely controlling the drug&#8208;load as well as attaching multiple payload moieties on the antibody remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the simple and direct modification of native IgG&#8208;antibodies at the residue glutamine 295 (Q295) without the need for any protein engineering at flexible drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios of one or multiple payloads. The conjugation is enabled through short, positively charged lysine containing peptides and native, commercially available microbial transglutaminase. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, HER2&#8208;targeting ADCs based on trastuzumab were generated with drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratios (DARs) of 2 and 4 of the same or different payloads using orthogonal conjugation chemistries. Quantitative biodistribution studies performed with 111In&#8208;radiolabeled conjugates showed high tumour uptake and low accumulation of radioactivity in non&#8208;targeted tissues. A single dose study of trastuzumab conjugated to the highly potent payload &#945;&#8208;Amanitin demonstrated complete and long&#8208;lasting tumour remissions and was well&#8208;tolerated at all dose levels tested.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of 18F Labeled AZD5213 Derivatives as Novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Radioligands Targeting Histamine Subtype&#8208;3 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The histamine subtype 3 (H3) receptor is an important drug target in the central nervous system (CNS), and PET imaging offers a promising technique for the noninvasive evaluation of CNS disease related to the H3 receptor. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated the binding effects of [18F]H3&#8208;2404 and [18F]H3&#8208;2405 by modifying the structure of AZD5213, a selective H3 antagonist. These two radioligands were prepared in high radiochemical yields and displayed stability in serum. The in vitro autoradiographic study in rat brain tissue and the following in vivo PET studies in mice demonstrated sufficient brain uptake but predominantly non&#8208;specific distribution in rodent brain. Although these data suggest that [18F]H3&#8208;2404 and [18F]H3&#8208;2405 are unsuitable as PET tracers for brain imaging of the H3 receptor, this study provides a valuable attempt for optimizing 18F labeled radiotracers based on AZD5213.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and antiproliferative activity of cisplatin&#8208;3&#8208;chloropiperidine conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of two novel cisplatin&#8208; alkylating agents conjugates. Combining a platinum based cytostatic agent with a sterically demanding alkylating agent could potentially induce further DNA damage, block cell repair mechanisms and keep the substrate active against resistant tumor cell lines. The 3&#8208;chloropiperidines utilized as ligands in this work are cyclic representatives of the N&#8208;mustard family and were not able to coordinate platinum on their own. The introduction of a second coordination site, in form of a pyridine moiety, led to the isolation of the desired conjugates. They were characterized with HRMS, CHN&#8208;analyses and XRD. We concluded this work by examining the cytotoxicity of the ligands and the obtained complexes with MTT assays in human cancer cell lines. While the ligands showed hardly any activity, the novel conjugates both displayed a high antiproliferative and cytotoxic potency in a panel of three cell lines. Moreover, both complexes were able to largely circumvent the acquired cisplatin resistance of A2780cisR ovarian cancer cells, both in the MTT assay and a flow&#8208;cytometric apoptosis assay.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Profiling the substrate sequence preferences of proteases is important for understanding both biological functions as well as for designing protease inhibitors. Several methods are available for profiling the sequence specificity of proteases. However, there is currently no rapid and high&#8208;throughput method to profile specificity of proteases for noncanonical substrates. In this study, we described a strategy to use a DNA&#8208;encoded noncanonical substrate library to identify the protease substrates composed of both canonical and noncanonical amino acids. This approach uses a DNA&#8208;encoded peptide library and introduces a biotin molecule at the N&#8208;terminus to immobilize the library on a solid support. Upon protease hydrolysis, the released DNA tag of the substrate peptides can be sequenced to identify the substrate structures. Using this approach, we profiled trypsin and fibroblast activation protein &#945; and discovered noncanonical substrates that were more efficiently cleaved than the commonly used substrates. The identified substrates of FAP were further used to design corresponding covalent inhibitors containing non&#8208;canonical sequences with high potency for the target protease. Overall, our approach can aid in the development of new protease substrates and inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>SnO2 encapsulated in alginate matrix: Evaluation and optimization of bioinspired nanoadsorbents for azo dye removal</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesized SnO2 NPs demonstrate potential capacity to adsorb toxic azo dye. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and SEM imaging confirmed the rutile phase and spherical morphology of SnO2 NPs. Average particle size has been confirmed to be approximately 3 nm through TEM analysis. Adsorption capacity is attributed to the high surface and presence of oxygen vacancy confirmed through BET and XPS, respectively. To mitigate the leaching of NPs in treated water, the encapsulation of NPs in sodium alginate (SA) has been proposed as an environmentally friendly, biocompatible, and economic solution. This study specifically focuses on investigating the parameters for the encapsulation of NPs within a sodium alginate matrix using CaCl2 as cross&#8208;linker, including effect of physical shape of encapsulation, effect of sodium alginate and CaCl2 concentration on the encapsulation efficiency and overall adsorption efficiency. Experimental results indicated that the physical form of encapsulation, such as spherical, wire&#8208;like, or irregular shape maintained consistent adsorption efficiency, which indicates its versatility. For effective encapsulation of NPs and adsorption, SA and CaCl2 concentration are suggested to be within the range of 0.2&#8208;0.3 g and &gt; 0.5 M, respectively..</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Visual Screen for the Directed Evolution of C &#946; &#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;threonine Aldolase</title>

         <dc:description>L&#8208;Threonine aldolase (L&#8208;TA) is a pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible condensation of glycine and aldehydes to form &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. The combination of directed evolution and efficient high&#8208;throughput screening methods is an effective strategy for enhancing the enzyme&#8217;s catalytic performance. However, few feasible high&#8208;throughput methods exist for engineering the C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;TAs. Here, we present a novel method of screening for variants with improved C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity; this method couples an L&#8208;threo&#8208;phenylserine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the specific oxidation of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine (L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS), with the concurrent synthesis of NADPH, which is easily detectable via 340&#8208;nm UV absorption. This enables the visual detection of L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS produced by L&#8208;TA through the measurement of generated NADPH. Using this method, we discover an L&#8208;TA variant with significantly higher diastereoselectivity, increasing from 0.98% de (for the wild&#8208;type) to 71.9% de.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Microreactors for the High&#8208;efficiency Enzymatic Synthesis of 10&#8208;Hydroxystearic Acid from Oleic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make oleic acid conversion efficient: This study introduces a continuous flow micro&#8208;reactor (CFMR) that effectively processes oleic acid, enhancing efficiency and overcoming key barriers. The CFMR significantly outperforms traditional reactors, achieving a 91&#8201;% conversionat high concentrations with a yield of 2312&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1, marking a breakthrough in sustainable chemical.







Abstract
Converting fatty acids into specialty chemicals is sustainable but hindered by the low efficiency and thermal instability of current oleic acid hydratases, along with mass transfer limitations in emulsion reactions. This study introduces an optimized continuous flow micro&#8208;reactor (CFMR) that efficiently transforms oleic acid at low (15&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) and high (50&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) concentrations, improving reaction efficiency and overcoming key conversion barriers. The first CFMR model showed reaction speeds surpassing traditional batch stirred tank reactors (BSTR). Optimizations were performed on three key components: liquid storage, mixer, and reaction section of the CFMR, with each round's best conditions carried into the next. This achieved a space&#8208;time yield of 597&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1 at a 15&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 oleic acid load. To further enhance the yield, we optimized the emulsifier system to solve incomplete emulsification and developed a two&#8208;component feed microreactor (TCFMR) that addressed mass transfer limitations caused by the product at high substrate loads, reaching a 91&#8201;% conversion of 50&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 oleic acid in 30&#8197;minutes, with a space&#8208;time yield of 2312&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1. These advancements represent significant progress in utilizing fatty acids and advancing sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Senolytic Prodrugs: A Promising Approach to Enhancing Senescence&#8208;Targeting Intervention</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elimination of senescent cells is an emerging therapeutic strategy for improving lifespan and treating age&#8208;related diseases. This Concept highlights the recent developments of senolytic prodrugs to enhance senescent cell targeting intervention. This Concept highlights the recent developments of senolytic prodrugs to improve senescent cell targeting intervention. Two strategies 1) galactose&#8208;modified senolytic prodrugs, in which sensing unit galactose is either directly conjugated to the drug or via a self&#8208;immolative linker and 2) bioorthogonal activation of senolytic prodrugs by incorporation of galactose into dihydrotetrazine to sense SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal for click activation, are discussed.







Abstract
Cellular senescence has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for aging and a wide range of age&#8208;related disorders. Despite the encouraging therapeutic impact of senolytic agents on improving lifespan and the outcomes of pharmacological intervention, the senolytic induced side effects pose barriers to clinical application. There is a pressing need for selective ablation of senescent cells (SnCs). The design of senolytic prodrugs has been demonstrated as a promising approach to addressing these issues. These prodrugs are generally designed via modification of senolytics with a cleavable galactose moiety to respond to the senescent biomarker &#8208; senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal) to restore their therapeutic effects. In this Concept, we summarize the developments by categorizing these prodrugs into two classes: 1) galactose&#8208;modified senolytic prodrugs, in which sensing unit galactose is either directly conjugated to the drug or via a self&#8208;immolative linker and 2) bioorthogonal activation of senolytic prodrugs. In the bioorthogonal prodrug design, galactose is incorporated into dihydrotetrazine to sense SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal for click activation. Notably, in addition to repurposed chemotherapeutics and small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs and photodynamic therapy have been introduced as new senolytics in the prodrug design. It is expected that the senolytic prodrugs would facilitate translating small&#8208;molecule senolytics into clinical use.

         <title>Untangling the complexity and impact of tau protein ubiquitination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered protein highly expressed in neuronal axons. In healthy neurons, tau regulates microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth. However, pathological conditions can trigger aberrant tau aggregation into insoluble filaments, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau undergoes diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs), suggesting complex regulation and potentially varied functions. Among PTMs, the role and mechanisms of ubiquitination in physiology and disease have remained enigmatic.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The microtubule-associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered protein highly expressed in neuronal axons. In healthy neurons, tau regulates microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth. However, pathological conditions can trigger aberrant tau aggregation into insoluble filaments, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau undergoes diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs), suggesting complex regulation and potentially varied functions. Among PTMs, the role and mechanisms of ubiquitination in physiology and disease have remained enigmatic. The past three decades have witnessed the emergence of key studies on tau protein ubiquitination. In this concept, we discuss how these investigations have begun to shed light on the ubiquitination patterns of physiological and pathological tau, the responsible enzymatic machinery, and the influence of ubiquitination on tau aggregation.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Arcyriaflavin F from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the characterisation of the Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712 arcyriaflavin F biosynthetic gene cluster. We express the gene cluster using Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 as a heterologous host, isolate the product and confirm distinct C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217; indole ring hydroxylation catalysed by a regioselective flavoprotein AcfX.







Abstract
Indolocarbazoles are natural products with a broad spectrum of bioactivity. A distinct feature of indolocarbazole biosynthesis is the modification of the indole and maleimide rings by regioselective tailoring enzymes. Here, we study a new indolocarbazole variant, which is encoded by the acfXODCP genes from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712. We characterise the pathway by expressing the acfXODCP genes in Streptomyces coelicolor, which led to the production of a C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;dihydroxylated indolocarbazole, which we assign as arcyriaflavin F. We also show that a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase AcfX catalyses the C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217; dihydroxylation of the unsubstituted arcyriaflavin A into arcyriaflavin F. Interestingly, AcfX shares homology to EspX from erdasporine A biosynthesis, which instead catalyses a single C&#8208;6 indolocarbazole hydroxylation. In summary, we report a new indolocarbazole biosynthetic pathway and a regioselective C&#8208;5 indole ring tailoring enzyme AcfX.

         <title>Understanding Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Substrate Inhibition and Prospects for Elimination Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate inhibition, a form of atypical Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics, results in reduced enzyme activity due to excessive substrate binding to CYP450, adversely affecting product formation. This occurs because CYP450 possesses multiple active sites. Further details will be explored in the main text. Overcoming this requires methods like enzyme immobilization, batch feeding, biphasic systems, and protein engineering.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, which are widely distributed and pivotal in various biochemical reactions, catalyze diverse processes such as hydroxylation, epoxidation, dehydrogenation, dealkylation, nitrification, and bond formation. These enzymes have been applied in drug metabolism, antibiotic production, bioremediation, and fine chemical synthesis. Recent research revealed that CYP450 catalytic kinetics deviated from the classic Michaelis&#8211;Menten model. A notable substrate inhibition phenomenon that affects the catalytic efficiency of CYP450 at high substrate concentrations was identified. However, the substrate inhibition of various reactions catalyzed by CYP450 enzymes have not been comprehensively reviewed. This review describes CYP450 substrate inhibition examples and atypical Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetic models, and provides insight into mechanisms of these enzymes. We also reviewed 3D structure and dynamics of CYP450 with substrate binding. Outline methods for alleviating substrate inhibition in CYP450 and other enzymes, including traditional fermentation approaches and protein engineering modifications. The comprehensive analysis presented in this study lays the foundation for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of CYP450 by deregulating substrate inhibition.

         <title>Conformational Selection in Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Depolymerization of Bio&#8208;based Polyesters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significance of conformational selection in enzymatic degradation of biopolymers is demonstrated for a series of terpene&#8208;derived polyesters. A fundamental 1D&#8208;geometric parameter with respect to whether the polymer chain is straight or twisted impacts biocatalytic depolymerization by influencing the polymer's affinity to enzyme ground state conformers. Two representative enzyme residues in PETase are shown in blue and magenta.







Abstract
Enzymatic degradation of polymers holds promise for advancing towards a bio&#8208;based economy. However, the bulky nature of polymers presents challenges in accessibility for biocatalysts, hindering depolymerization reactions. Beyond the impact of crystallinity, polymer chains can reside in different conformations affecting binding efficiency to the enzyme active site. We previously showed that the gauche and trans chain conformers associated with crystalline and amorphous regions of the synthetic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) display different affinity to PETase, thus affecting the depolymerization rate. However, structural&#8208;function relationships for biopolymers remain poorly understood in biocatalysis. In this study, we explored the biodegradation of previously synthesized bio&#8208;polyesters made from a rigid bicyclic chiral terpene&#8208;based diol and copolymerized with various renewable diesters. Herein, four of those polyesters spanning from semi&#8208;aromatic to aliphatic were subjected to enzymatic degradations in concert with induced&#8208;fit docking (IFD) analyses. The monomer yield following enzymatic depolymerization by IsPETase S238&#8197;A, Dura and LCC ranged from 2&#8201;% to 17&#8201;% without any further pre&#8208;treatment step. The degradation efficiency was found to correlate with the extent of matched substrate and enzyme conformations revealed by IFD, regardless of the actual reaction temperature employed. Our findings demonstrate the importance of conformational selection in enzymatic depolymerization of biopolymers. A straight or twisted conformation of the polymer chain is crucial in biocatalytic degradation by showing different affinities to enzyme ground&#8208;state conformers. This work highlights the importance of considering the conformational match between the polymer and the enzyme to optimize the biocatalytic degradation efficiency of biopolymers, providing valuable insights for the development of sustainable bioprocesses.

The pH dependent electronic spectral change is observed for two of the complexes. The enhancement of emission intensity is observed at different wavelength for pH &lt; 7 and pH &gt; 7 for Ir1 and Ir3. The emission sensing of biogenic amines with pka values ranging from 5.80 &#8211; 9.74 is reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome (pH = 4.5 &#8211; 5) and thus image this organelle with great precision.

         <title>Protein Engineering of Lipase A from Candida Antarctica to Improve Esterification of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of mutagenesis at selected amino acid positions (shown in red in the figure), the double mutant V278S+S429G of lipase A from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8722;A) was identified to exhibit a 1.5&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than wild type CAL&#8722;A in the kinetic resolution of a tertiary alcohol model substrate, while maintaining excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Chiral tertiary alcohols are important organic compounds in science as well as in industry. However, their preparation in enantiomerically pure form is still a challenge due to their complex structure and steric hindrances compared with primary and secondary alcohols, so kinetic resolution could be an attractive approach. Lipase A from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8722;A) has been shown to catalyze the enantioselective esterification of various tertiary alcohols with excellent enantioselectivity but low activity. Here we report a mutagenesis study by rational design to improve CAL&#8722;A activity against tertiary alcohols. Single mutants of CAL&#8722;A were selected, expressed, immobilized and screened for esterification of the tertiary alcohol 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ol. A double mutant V278S+S429G showed a 1.5&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than that of the wild type CAL&#8722;A, while maintaining excellent enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral tertiary alcohols are important organic compounds in science as well as in industry. However, their preparation in enantiomerically pure form is still a challenge due to their complex structure and steric hindrances compared with primary and secondary alcohols, so kinetic resolution could be an attractive approach. Lipase A from &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt; (CAL&#8722;A) has been shown to catalyze the enantioselective esterification of various tertiary alcohols with excellent enantioselectivity but low activity. Here we report a mutagenesis study by rational design to improve CAL&#8722;A activity against tertiary alcohols. Single mutants of CAL&#8722;A were selected, expressed, immobilized and screened for esterification of the tertiary alcohol 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-ol. A double mutant V278S+S429G showed a 1.5-fold higher reaction rate than that of the wild type CAL&#8722;A, while maintaining excellent enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How Clavulanic Acid Inhibits Serine &#946;&#8208;Lactamases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inhibition of serine &#946;&#8208;lactamases by clavulanic acid occurs via a bifurcating mechanism. The formation of an acyl&#8208;enzyme complex may be followed by hydrolysis, or oxazolidine ring opening and subsequent decarboxylation to give more stable species. Further fragmentation is slow and is less likely to be biologically relevant in inhibition.







Abstract
Clavulanic acid is a medicinally important inhibitor of serine &#946;&#8208;lactamases (SBLs). We report studies on the mechanisms by which clavulanic acid inhibits representative Ambler class A (TEM&#8208;116), C (Escherichia coli AmpC), and D (OXA&#8208;10) SBLs using denaturing and non&#8208;denaturing mass spectrometry (MS). Similarly to observations with penam sulfones, most of the results support a mechanism involving acyl enzyme complex formation, followed by oxazolidine ring opening without efficient subsequent scaffold fragmentation (at pH&#8197;7.5). This observation contrasts with previous MS studies, which identified clavulanic acid scaffold fragmented species as the predominant SBL bound products. In all the SBLs studied here, fragmentation was promoted by acidic conditions, which are commonly used in LC&#8211;MS analyses. Slow fragmentation was, however, observed under neutral conditions with TEM&#8208;116 on prolonged reaction with clavulanic acid. Although our results imply clavulanic acid scaffold fragmentation is likely not crucial for SBL inhibition in&#8197;vivo, development of inhibitors that fragment to give stable covalent complexes is of interest.

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;based activation of C2&#945;&#8208;lactylthiamin diphosphate decarboxylation on bacterial 1&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose 5&#8208;phosphate synthase.</title>

         <dc:description>1&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose 5&#8208;phosphate synthase (DXPS) catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent formation of DXP from pyruvate (donor substrate) and d&#8208;glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate (d&#8208;GAP, acceptor substrate) in bacterial central metabolism. DXPS uses a ligand&#8208;gated mechanism in which binding of a small molecule &#8220;trigger&#8221; activates the first enzyme&#8208;bound intermediate, C2&#945;&#8208;lactylThDP (LThDP), to form the reactive carbanion via LThDP decarboxylation. d&#8208;GAP is the natural acceptor substrate for DXPS and also serves a role as a trigger to induce LThDP decarboxylation in the gated step. Additionally, we have shown that O2 and d&#8208;glyceraldehyde (d&#8208;GA) can induce LThDP decarboxylation. We hypothesize this ligand&#8208;gated mechanism poises DXPS to sense and respond to cellular cues in metabolic remodeling during bacterial adaptation. Here we sought to characterize features of small molecule inducers of LThDP decarboxylation. Using a combination of CD, NMR and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy aldehyde moiety of d&#8208;GAP is sufficient to induce LThDP decarboxylation en route to DXP formation. A variety of aliphatic aldehydes also induce LThDP decarboxylation. The study highlights the capacity of DXPS to respond to different molecular cues, lending support to potential multifunctionality of DXPS and its metabolic regulation by this mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>The Multifunctional Preprotein Binding Domain of SecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sec&#8208;pathway is the main protein secretion pathway in prokaryotes and is essential for their survival. The motor protein SecA is the main coordinator of the pathway in bacteria as it is has evolved to perform multiple tasks, acting like a &#8220;swiss army knife&#8221;, from binding pre&#8208;proteins to altering its oligomeric and conformational states. This study focuses on the role of its Preprotein Binding Domain (PBD), which is a key protein module that identified in three conformational states (WO, O and C). A thorough analysis was conducted to identify PBD&#8217;s inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;protomeric interactions, highlighting the most significant and conserved ones. Both crystallographic and biophysical data indicate that the WO state is the main during dimerization, while the monomeric structure can adopt all three states. C&#8208;tail, StemPBD and 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD are important elements for the stabilization of different oligomeric and conformational states, as they offer specific interactions. Alterations in the lipophilicity of the StemPBD causes increased proteins dynamics or/and Prl phenotype. In the C state, 3&#946;&#8208;tipPBD interacts and opens the ATPase motor. We hypothesize that this partial opening of the motor with the increased dynamics describes the Prl phenotype.</dc:description>

         <title>A Thermostable Heme Protein Fold Adapted for Stereoselective C&#8208;H Bond Hydroxylation Using Peroxygenase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermostable protein folds of natural and synthetic origin are highly sought&#8208;after templates for biocatalyst generation due to their enhanced stability to elevated temperatures which overcomes one of the major limitations of applying enzymes for synthesis. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are a family of heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases that catalyse the oxidation of their substrates in a highly stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner. The CYP enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber binds the norisoprenoid &#946;&#8208;ionone and was employed as a scaffold for catalyst design. The I&#8208;helix was modified to convert this enzyme from a monooxygenase into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE), enabling the enantioselective oxidation of &#946;&#8208;ionone to (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ionone (94% e.e.). The enzyme was resistant to 20 mM H2O2, 20% (v/v) of organic solvent, supported over 1700 turnovers and was fully functional after incubation at 60 &#176;C for 1 h and 30 &#176;C for 365 days. The reaction was scaled&#8208;up to generate multi milligram quantities of the product for characterisation. Overall, we demonstrate that sourcing a CYP protein fold from an extremophile enabled the design of a highly stable enzyme for stereoselective C&#8208;H bond activation only using H2O2 as the oxidant, providing a viable strategy for future biocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a 13C/2H Labeled Building Block to Probe the Phosphotyrosine Interactome Using Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition coordinates the assembly of protein complexes, thus controlling key events of cell cycle, cell development and programmed cell death. Although many aspects of membrane receptor function and intracellular signal transduction have been deciphered in the last decades, the details of how phosphorylation alters protein&#8208;protein interaction and creates regulating switches of protein activity and localization often remains unclear. We developed a synthetic route to a protected phophotyrosine building block with isolated 13C&#8208;1H spins in the aromatic ring. The compound can be used for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and readily applied to study affinity, dynamics and interactions on an atomic level using NMR spectroscopy. As a first example, we prepared an isotopologue of a pTyr containing 12mer peptide (pY1021) as part of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor to analyze the binding to the phospholipase C&#8208;&#947; (PLC&#947;&#8208;1) SH2 domain.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we have selected eight Zn(II)&#8208;based complexes viz., [Zn(bpy)(acac)Cl] (1), [Zn(phen)(acac)Cl] (2), [Zn(dppz)(acac)Cl] (3), [Zn(dppn)(acac)Cl] (4), [Zn(bpy)(cur)Cl] (5), [Zn(phen)(cur)Cl] (6), [Zn(dppz)(cur)Cl] (7), [Zn(dppn)(cur)Cl] (8), where bpy=2,2'&#8208;bipyridine, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, dppz=benzo[i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine, dppn=naphtho[2,3&#8208;i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine, acac=acetylacetonate, cur=curcumin and performed in silico molecular docking studies with the viral proteins, i.e., spike protein (S), Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme II Receptor protein (ACE2), nucleocapsid protein (N), main protease protein (Mpro), and RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase protein (RdRp) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The binding energy calculations, visualization of the docking orientation, and analysis of the interactions revealed that these complexes could be potential inhibitors of the viral proteins. Among complexes 1&#8208;8, complex 6 showed the strongest binding affinity with S and ACE2 proteins. 4 exerted better binding affinity in the case of the N protein, whereas 8 presented the highest binding affinities with Mpro and RdRp among all the complexes. Overall, the study indicated that Zn(II) complexes have the potential as alternative and viable therapeutic solutions for COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Drug Design Targeting Abl Kinase: How Structure and Regulation Can Assist in Designing New Drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abelson kinase (Abl) plays a central role in cell signaling, and its dysregulation is implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This paper explores molecular mechanisms involved in regulating Abl activity and the historical evolution of Abl kinase inhibitors. Strategies to overcome resistance, minimize side effects, and consider future implications for kinase&#8208;targeted therapies are also discussed.







Abstract
The human protein Abelson kinase (Abl), a tyrosine kinase, plays a pivotal role in developing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Abl's involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its significance in regulating fundamental biological processes, including DNA damage responses, actin polymerization, and chromatin structural changes. The discovery of the Bcr&#8208;Abl oncoprotein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation in CML patients, revolutionized the understanding and treatment of the disease. The introduction of targeted therapies, starting with interferon&#8208;alpha and culminating in the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib, significantly improved patient outcomes. However, challenges such as drug resistance and side effects persist, indicating the necessity of research into novel therapeutic strategies. This review describes advancements in Abl kinase inhibitor development, emphasizing rational compound design from structural and regulatory information. Strategies, including bivalent inhibitors, PROTACs, and compounds targeting regulatory domains, promise to overcome resistance and minimize side effects. Additionally, leveraging the intricate structure and interactions of Bcr&#8208;Abl may provide insights into developing inhibitors for other kinases. Overall, this review highlights the importance of continued research into Abl kinase inhibition and its broader implications for therapeutic interventions targeting kinase&#8208;driven diseases. It provides valuable insights and strategies that may guide the development of next&#8208;generation therapies.

         <title>Bio&#8208;electrocatalytic Alkene Reduction Using Ene&#8208;Reductases with Methyl Viologen as Electron Mediator</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes using ene&#8208;reductases faces hurdles in flavin mononucleotide cofactor regeneration. Electrochemical MV2+ regeneration offers a cost&#8208;effective remedy. Our bio&#8208;electrocatalytic system, with TOYE or PETNR as enzymes, MV2+ and substrate in an H&#8208;type reactor cell, efficiently catalyzes alkene reduction under constant potential. This study underscores the promise of bio&#8208;electrocatalytic asymmetric hydrogenation.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation of alkene moieties is important for the synthesis of chiral molecules, but achieving high stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Biocatalysis using ene&#8208;reductases (EReds) offers a viable solution. However, the need for NAD(P)H cofactors limits large&#8208;scale applications. Here, we explored an electrochemical alternative for recycling flavin&#8208;containing EReds using methyl viologen as a mediator. For this, we built a bio&#8208;electrocatalytic setup with an H&#8208;type glass reactor cell, proton exchange membrane, and carbon cloth electrode. Experimental results confirm the mediator's electrochemical reduction and enzymatic consumption. Optimization showed increased product concentration at longer reaction times with better reproducibility within 4&#8211;6&#8197;h. We tested two enzymes, Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase (PETNR) and the Thermostable Old Yellow Enzyme (TOYE), using different alkene substrates. TOYE showed higher productivity for the reduction of 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one (1.20&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1), 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one (1.40&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pentanal (0.40&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1), with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 11&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. PETNR outperformed TOYE in terms of enantioselectivity for the reduction of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pentanal (ee 59&#8201;% &#177; 7&#8201;% (S)). Notably, TOYE achieved promising results also in reducing ketoisophorone, a challenging substrate, with similar enantiomeric excess compared to published values using NADH.

         <title>Condensation Domain Editing of the FR900359 Assembly Line Yields a Novel Analog Amenable to Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensation domain editing of the FR900359 assembly line, yielded a novel analog of FR, missing the N&#8208;acylation of its Hle side chain. The resulting &#945;&#8208;amino group was shown to be amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization of the FR&#8208;scaffold by standard amide coupling procedures. This strategy provided access to nine semisynthetic derivatives of FR, which were profiled concerning their antiproliferative effects against four melanoma cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The natural product FR900359 (FR) has generated significant attention lately, due to its characteristics as potent and selective inhibitor of Gq/11 mediated signal transduction of associated G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). This makes FR both a widely used pharmacological tool compound and a lead molecule for targeted cancer therapy. The exploration of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) of the scaffold by total synthesis has been complicated by its structural complexity and its incompatibility with standard approaches of solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Options for late&#8208;stage functionalization of FR are limited due to a lack of tractable functional groups. Here we present a mixed approach combining (i) genetic engineering of the FR&#8208;assembly line in Chromobacterium vaccinii, to obtain a novel FR analog featuring a primary amine, with (ii) its subsequent synthetic modification and biological profiling for further SAR exploration of the FR scaffold.

         <title>Development of Uniform Ribosome Display Technology Enabling Easy and Efficient Identification of Full&#8208;Length Proteins that Interact with Bioactive Small and Large Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a uniform ribosome display technology using equal&#8208;length mRNAs and DNAs. The equalized nucleic acids enabled the formation of larger full&#8208;length protein&#8208;displaying ribosomal complexes and efficient identification of target proteins that interact with bioactive molecules, such as low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight drug, enzyme substrate, and antibody, with simplified operations.







Abstract
Identifying target proteins that interact with bioactive molecules is indispensable for understanding their mechanisms of action. In this study, we developed a uniform ribosome display technology using equal&#8208;length DNAs and mRNAs to improve molecular display principle for target identification. The equal&#8208;length DNAs were designed to contain various coding sequences for full&#8208;length proteins with molecular weights of up to 130&#8197;kDa and were used to synthesize equal&#8208;length mRNAs, which allowed the formation of full&#8208;length protein&#8208;ribosome&#8208;equal&#8208;length mRNA complexes. Uniform ribosome display selections of dihydrofolate reductase and haloalkane dehalogenase mutant were performed against methotrexate and chlorohexane, respectively. Quantitative changes of proteins after each selection indicated that the target protein&#8208;displaying ribosomal complexes were specifically selected through non&#8208;covalent or covalent interactions with the corresponding bioactive molecules. Furthermore, selection of full&#8208;length proteins interacting with methotrexate or anti&#8208;DDX46 antibody from protein pools showed that only the target proteins could be precisely identified even though the molar amounts of equal&#8208;length mRNAs encoding them were adjusted to 1/20,000 of the total equal&#8208;length mRNAs. Thus, the uniform ribosome display technology enabled efficient identification of target proteins that interact with bioactive small and large molecules through simplified operations without deep sequencing.

Furthermore, selection of full-length proteins interacting with methotrexate or anti-DDX46 antibody from protein pools showed that only the target proteins could be precisely identified even though the molar amounts of &lt;i&gt;equal-length&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs encoding them were adjusted to 1/20,000 of the total &lt;i&gt;equal-length&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs. Thus, the uniform ribosome display technology enabled efficient identification of target proteins that interact with bioactive small and large molecules through simplified operations without deep sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Single Enzyme in Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols: Bidirectional Catalysis by Hydroxynitrile Lyase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Baliospermum montanum hydroxynitrile lyase (BmHNL)&#8217;s catalytic scope in enantiocomplementary synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols was illustrated. It exhibited broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity towards Henry and retro&#8208;Henry reaction in the production of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols respectively.







Abstract
A single enzyme, Baliospermum montanum hydroxynitrile lyase (BmHNL), without alteration, enabled bidirectional catalysis in enantiocomplementary synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols. BmHNL catalyzed promiscuous Henry (24 examples) and retro&#8208;Henry reaction (22 examples) provided up to &gt;99&#8201;% and 50&#8201;% conversion to (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols respectively, while both cases displayed up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. The broad substrate scope and high stereoselectivity of BmHNL represents its synthetic applications in sustainable production of diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols. Kinetic parameters of BmHNL was determined for Henry and retro&#8208;Henry reaction, which reveals poor catalytic efficiency for both the promiscuous transformations, however, the former has better efficiency than the latter. Practical applicability of the biocatalyst and transformation was illustrated by preparative scale synthesis of chiral intermediates of (S)&#8208;Tembamide, and (S)&#8208;Micanozole.

         <title>OsO2 as the Contrast&#8208;Generating Chemical Species of Osmium&#8208;Stained Biological Tissues in Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical species that gives rise to the membrane contrast of osmium&#8208;stained biological samples in electron microscopy is identified as OsO2(IV), revealed by characterizing local electronic structure using photoemission electron microscopy. This determination sets the fundamental basis for optimizing staining protocols via intentional synthetic design.







Abstract
Electron imaging of biological samples stained with heavy metals has enabled visualization of subcellular structures critical in chemical&#8208;, structural&#8208;, and neuro&#8208;biology. In particular, osmium tetroxide (OsO4) has been widely adopted for selective lipid imaging. Despite the ubiquity of its use, the osmium speciation in lipid membranes and the process for contrast generation in electron microscopy (EM) have continued to be open questions, limiting efforts to improve staining protocols and therefore high&#8208;resolution nanoscale imaging of biological samples. Following our recent success using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) to image mouse brain tissues with synaptic resolution, we have used PEEM to determine the nanoscale electronic structure of Os&#8208;stained biological samples. Os(IV), in the form of OsO2, generates nanoaggregates in lipid membranes, leading to a strong spatial variation in the electronic structure and electron density of states. OsO2 has a metallic electronic structure that drastically increases the electron density of states near the Fermi level. Depositing metallic OsO2 in lipid membranes allows for strongly enhanced EM signals and conductivity of biological materials. The identification of the chemical species and understanding of the membrane contrast mechanism of Os&#8208;stained biological specimens provides a new opportunity for the development of staining protocols for high&#8208;resolution, high&#8208;contrast EM imaging.

         <title>Complex Formation and Hydrolytic Processes of Protected Peptides Containing the &#8722;SXH&#8722; Motif in the Presence of Nickel(II) Ion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have shown that nickel(II)&#8208;induced hydrolysis of peptides containing &#8722;(S/T)XH&#8722; can take place at room temperatures in equimolar solutions. The hydrolysis can be monitored by CD spectroscopy and HPLC technique, and the measurement conditions that can be used for the further analysis of native protein fragments containing the &#8722;(S/T)XH&#8722; sequence have been determined.







Abstract
Interactions between metal ions and proteins are considered reversible, such as the coordination of a metal ion to a protein or enzyme, but irreversible processes like the oxidative reactions, aggregation or hydrolytic processes may occur. In the presence of Ni(II)&#8208;ions selective hydrolysis of the peptides containing the &#8722;SXH&#8722; or &#8722;TXH&#8722; motif was observed. Since the side chain of histidine serves as the metal ion binding site for many native proteins, and very often histidine is present in a &#8722;SXH&#8722; or &#8722;TXH&#8722; sequence, to study the complex formation and hydrolytic processes in presence of nickel(II) ion four peptides were synthesised: Ac&#8208;SKHM&#8208;NH2, A3SSH&#8208;NH2, A4SSH&#8208;NH2, AAA&#1013;KSH&#8208;NH2. The Ni(II)&#8208;induced hydrolysis of Ac&#8208;SKHM&#8208;NH2 peptide occurs rapidly in alkaline medium already at room temperature. In two peptides containing &#8722;SSH&#8722; sequence on the C&#8208;termini, the N&#8208;terminal part is the major binding site for the nickel(II) ion, but the formation of dinuclear complexes was also observed. In the [Ni2LH&#8722;6]2&#8722; complex of hexapeptide, the coordination sphere of the metal ions is saturated with deprotonated Ser&#8208;O&#8722;, which does not result in hydrolysis of the peptide. For A4SSH&#8208;NH2, both Ni(II) ions fulfill the conditions for hydrolysis, which was confirmed by HPLC analyses at pH&#8197;&#8776;8.2 and 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Multifunctional Probe for Colorimetric Copper Sensing, Lysosome Labelling and Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble, fluorescence and colorimetric copper probe (LysoBC1) has been synthesized and fully characterized; this system responds to both cupric ion and pH variation in aqueous environment. Live cell imaging shows that LysoBC1 is able to selectively accumulate into lysosome while the copper binding ability allowed us to monitor the dynamic tracking of the metal.







Abstract
We report a water&#8208;soluble fluorescence and colorimetric copper probe (LysoBC1); this system can also serve for lysosome labeling and for the dynamic tracking of Cu2+ in living cells. The sensing mechanism takes advantage of the synergic action by the following three components: i)&#8197;a lysosome targeting unit, ii)&#8197;the spirolactam ring&#8208;opening for the selective copper chelation and iii)&#8197;the metal&#8208;mediated hydrolysis of the rhodamine moiety for fluorescence enhancement. In aqueous environment the molecule acts as a fluorescent reversible pH sensor and as colorimetric probe for Cu2+ at physiological pH; the hydrolysis of the copper targeting unit resulted in a 50&#8208;fold increase of the fluorescence intensity. Most importantly, in&#8197;vitro cell analyses in undifferentiated (SH SY5Y) and differentiated (d&#8208;SH SY5Y) neuroblastoma cells, LysoBC1 is able to selectively accumulate into lysosome while the copper binding ability allowed us to monitor intracellular copper accumulation into lysosome.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are biological macromolecules well known to regulate many cellular signaling mechanisms. For instance, they are very appealing for their application as therapeutic agents, presenting high specificity and activity. Nonetheless, they suffer from unfolding, instability and low bioavailability making their administration through systemic and other routes very tough. To overcome these drawbacks, drug delivery systems and nanotechnology have arisen to deliver biomolecules in a sustained manner while, at the same time, increasing dose availability, protecting the cargo without compromising proteins' bioactivity, and enhancing intracellular delivery. In this work, we proposed the optimization of sphingomyelin nanosystems (SNs) for the delivery of a wide collection of proteins (ranging from 10&#8208;500 kDa and pI) using diverse chemical association strategies. We have further characterized SNs by varied analytical methodologies. We have also carried out in vitro experiments to validate the potential of the developed formulations. As the final goal, we aim to obtain evidence of the potential use of SNs for the development of protein therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>High Content Screening Assay of Inhibitors of the Legionella&#160;pneumophila Histone Methyltransferase RomA in Infected Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resistance to anti&#8208;microbial agents is a world&#8208;wide health threat. Thus there is an urgent need for new treatments. An alternative approach to disarm pathogens consists in developing drugs targeting epigenetic modifiers. Bacterial pathogens can manipulate epigenetic regulatory systems of the host to bypass defences to proliferate and survive. One example is Legionella pneumophila, a Gram&#8208;negative intracellular pathogen that targets host chromatin with a specific, secreted bacterial SET&#8208;domain methyltransferase named RomA. This histone methyltransferase specifically methylates H3K14 during infection and is responsible for changing the host epigenetic landscape upon L. pneumophila infection. To inhibit RomA activity during infection, we developed a reliable high&#8208;content imaging screening assay, which we used to screen an in&#8208;house chemical library developed to inhibit DNA and histone methyltransferases. This assay was optimised using monocytic leukemic THP&#8208;1 cells differentiated into macrophages infected with L. pneumophila in a 96&#8208; or 384&#8208;well plate format using the Opera Phenix&#174; (Perkin Elmer) confocal microscope, combined with Columbus&#8482; software for automated image acquisition and analysis. H3K14 methylation was followed in infected, single cells and cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel. A first pilot screening of 477 compounds identified a potential starting point for inhibitors of H3K14 methylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Substituted Acyclic and Cyclic N&#8208;Alkylhydrazines by Enzymatic Reductive Hydrazinations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine reductases (IREDs) provide promising opportunities for the synthesis of various chiral amines. Initially, asymmetric imine reduction was reported, followed by reductive aminations of aldehydes and ketones via imines. Herein we present the reductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), catalyzed by the IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus. In analogy to IRED&#8208;catalyzed reductive aminations, various carbonyls and dicarbonyls could react with simple hydrazines to produce substituted acyclic and cyclic N&#8208;alkylhydrazines. By incorporating and scaling up hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system, we demonstrated the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of an H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlightling the potential of IREDs in biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances of Light/Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Azobenzene in Nanomedicine Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzene (Azo) and its derivatives are versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules. Their reversible photoisomerization and susceptibility to reduction&#8208;mediated cleavage make them valuable for various biomedical applications. Upon exposure to the UV light, Azo units undergo a thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transition, which can be reversed by heating in the dark or irradiation with visible light. Additionally, the N=N bonds in azobenzenes can be cleaved under hypoxic conditions by azoreductase, making azobenzenes useful as hypoxia&#8208;responsive linkers. The integration of azobenzenes into nanomedicines holds promise for enhancing therapeutic efficacy, particularly in tumor targeting and controllable drug release. In this Concept paper, recent advances in the design and applications of azobenzene&#8208;based nanomedicines are updated, and future development opportunities are also summarized.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of a Malonyl&#8208;CoA Ligase for Production of Fluorinated Polyketide Extender Units</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally diverse malonyl&#8208;CoA building blocks are required to regioselectively diversify macrolide compounds. Specifically, fluorinated building blocks represent pathways to introduce fluorine into drug&#8208;like compounds. Herein, the biosynthesis of a tertiary fluorinated malonyl&#8208;CoA is described via mutagenesis of the malonyl&#8208;CoA ligase, MatB, from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Mutation provided a variant with a shifted product profile, providing a mutant relevant for macrolide biosynthesis.







Abstract
Enzymatic platforms for producing malonyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;based extender units required for polyketide biosynthesis are often based on malonyl&#8208;CoA ligases such as MatB from Rhizobium trifolii and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. However, despite broad interest in the fluorination of polyketides and prior success with engineering MatB homologs, the suitability of MatB for accessing the tertiary substituted fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA needed to produce flurithromycin and solithromycin has not yet been reported. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;guided engineering of a MatB homolog to optimize the production of fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, resulting in a variant with increased conversion and providing a platform to produce a suitable building block mixture for fluorinated macrolide production. Additionally, the mutant demonstrated broad utility for various substituted malonyl&#8208;CoAs. The MatB mutant sets the stage to access fluorinated macrolides by coupling it with altered PKS machinery to install fluorinated malonyl&#8208;CoA into macrolide scaffolds.

         <title>Research Progress of Cyanine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probes for Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an analysis of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes for biological application. The topic includes explaining what is cyanine dyes and why can these dyes be used for design of fluorescent probes for biological application. The typical cyanines&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probes, focusing on their utilities in fluorescence imaging, PTT and PDT, are critically discussed.







Abstract
Cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes have played vital roles in biological application due to their low interference from background fluorescence, deep tissue penetration, high sensitivity, and minimal photodamage to biological samples. They are widely utilized in molecular recognition, medical diagnosis, biomolecular detection, and biological imaging. Herein, we provide a review of recent advancements in cyanine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probes for the detection of pH, cells, tumor as well as their application in photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT).

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Modification of Daptomycin: Aromatic Group Installation on Trp1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic prenyltransferase CdpNPT can modify Trp1 of daptomycin using various alkyl&#8208;pyrophosphate analogs. This study evaluated CdpNPT's ability to generate daptomycin analogs with 21 different benzylic and heterocyclic alkyl&#8208;PP analogs. All six structurally characterized Trp1&#8208;substituted daptomycin analogs demonstrated potent activity against DapS and DapR Gram&#8208;positive bacterial strains.







Abstract
Daptomycin is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin&#8208;resistant enterococci (VRE). The emergence of daptomycin&#8208;resistant bacterial strains has renewed interest in generating daptomycin analogs. Previous studies have shown that replacing the tryptophan of daptomycin with aromatic groups can generate analogs with enhanced potency. Additionally, we have demonstrated that aromatic prenyltransferases can attach diverse groups to the tryptophan of daptomycin. Here, we report the use of the prenyltransferase CdpNPT to derivatize the tryptophan of daptomycin with a library of benzylic and heterocyclic pyrophosphates. An analytical&#8208;scale study revealed that CdpNPT can transfer various aromatic groups onto daptomycin. Subsequent scaled&#8208;up and purified reactions indicated that the enzyme can attach aromatic groups to N1, C2, C5 and C6 positions of Trp1 of daptomycin. In vitro antibacterial activity assays using six of these purified compounds identified aromatic substituted daptomycin analogs show potency against both daptomycin&#8208;susceptible and resistant strains of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. These findings suggest that installing aromatic groups on the Trp1 of daptomycin can lead to the generation of potent daptomycin analogs.

     alt="Chemoenzymatic Modification of Daptomycin: Aromatic Group Installation on Trp1"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aromatic prenyltransferase CdpNPT can modify Trp1 of daptomycin using various alkyl-pyrophosphate analogs. This study evaluated CdpNPT's ability to generate daptomycin analogs with 21 different benzylic and heterocyclic alkyl-PP analogs. All six structurally characterized Trp1-substituted daptomycin analogs demonstrated potent activity against DapS and DapR Gram-positive bacterial strains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daptomycin is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including multi-drug resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant &lt;i&gt;enterococci&lt;/i&gt; (VRE). The emergence of daptomycin-resistant bacterial strains has renewed interest in generating daptomycin analogs. Previous studies have shown that replacing the tryptophan of daptomycin with aromatic groups can generate analogs with enhanced potency. Additionally, we have demonstrated that aromatic prenyltransferases can attach diverse groups to the tryptophan of daptomycin. Here, we report the use of the prenyltransferase CdpNPT to derivatize the tryptophan of daptomycin with a library of benzylic and heterocyclic pyrophosphates. An analytical-scale study revealed that CdpNPT can transfer various aromatic groups onto daptomycin. Subsequent scaled-up and purified reactions indicated that the enzyme can attach aromatic groups to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;1, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;2, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;6 positions of Trp1 of daptomycin. In vitro antibacterial activity assays using six of these purified compounds identified aromatic substituted daptomycin analogs show potency against both daptomycin-susceptible and resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria. These findings suggest that installing aromatic groups on the Trp1 of daptomycin can lead to the generation of potent daptomycin analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Dissolution of Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Crystals Using a Pyrophosphate Specific Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint deposits of insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) cause pseudo&#8208;gout, a type of arthritis. CPPD's insolubility is driven by electrostatic interaction of di&#8208;cationic calcium ions with tetra&#8208;anionic pyrophosphate ions. This interaction can be effectively disrupted through the use of a molecule (PPS&#8208;1) that presents surrogate di&#8208;cations in a spatially ordered array. Using PPS&#8208;1 we were able to dissolve CPPD selectively over the closely related mineral hydroxy apatite.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;gout is caused by the deposition of highly insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joints of sufferers. This leads to inflammation and ultimately joint damage. The insolubility of CPPD is driven by the strong attraction of di&#8208;cationic calcium ions with tetra&#8208;anionic pyrophosphate ions. One of the challenges of dissolving CPPD is that a related mineral, hydroxy apatite (HA) is present in larger amounts in the form of bone and also contains strongly interacting calcium and phosphate ions. Our aim in this work was to selectively dissolve CPPD in preference to HA. To accomplish this, we used a known receptor for pyrophosphate that contains two complexed zinc ions that are ideally spaced to interact with the tetra&#8208;anion of pyrophosphate. We hypothesized that such a molecule could act as a preorganized tetra&#8208;cation that would be able to outcompete the two calcium ions present in the crystal lattice of CPPD. We demonstrate both visually and through analysis of released phosphorous that this molecule is able to preferentially dissolve CPPD over the closely related HA and thus can form the basis for a possible approach for the treatment of pseudo&#8208;gout.

&lt;p&gt;Joint deposits of insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) cause pseudo-gout, a type of arthritis. CPPD's insolubility is driven by electrostatic interaction of di-cationic calcium ions with tetra-anionic pyrophosphate ions. This interaction can be effectively disrupted through the use of a molecule (PPS-1) that presents surrogate di-cations in a spatially ordered array. Using PPS-1 we were able to dissolve CPPD selectively over the closely related mineral hydroxy apatite.

         <title>Enhancing cellular and enzymatic properties through in vivo continuous evolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution seeks to evolve target genes at a rate far exceeding the natural mutation rate, thereby endowing cellular and enzymatic properties with desired traits. In vivo continuous directed evolution achieves these purposes by generating libraries within living cells, enabling a continuous cycle of mutant generation and selection, enhancing the exploration of gene variants. Continuous evolution has become powerful tools for unraveling evolution mechanism and improving cellular and enzymatic properties. This review categorizes current continuous evolution into three distinct classes: non&#8208;targeted chromosomal, targeted chromosomal, and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation approaches. It also compares various continuous evolution strategies based on different principles, providing a reference for selecting suitable methods for specific evolutionary goals. Furthermore, this review discusses the two primary limitations for further widespread application of in vivo continuous evolution, which are lack of general applicability and insufficient mutagenic capability. We envision that developing generally applicable mutagenic components and methods to enhance mutation rates for in vivo continuous evolution are promising future directions for wide range applications of continuous evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mysterious World of Non&#8208;canonical Caps &#8211; What We Know and Why We Need New Sequencing Techniques</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It was long believed that viral and eukaryotic mRNA molecules are capped at their 5&#8242; end solely by the N7&#8208;methylguanosine cap, which regulates various aspects of the RNA life cycle, from its biogenesis to its decay. However, the recent discovery of a variety of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps derived from metabolites and cofactors &#8212; such as NAD, FAD, CoA, UDP&#8208;glucose, UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine, and dinucleoside polyphosphates &#8212; has expanded the known repertoire of RNA modifications. These non&#8208;canonical caps are found across all domains of life and can impact multiple aspects of RNA metabolism, including stability, translation initiation, and cellular stress responses. The study of these modifications has been facilitated by sophisticated methodologies such as liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry, which have unveiled their presence in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The identification of these novel RNA caps highlights the need for advanced sequencing techniques to characterize the specific RNA types bearing these modifications and understand their roles in cellular processes. Unravelling the biological role of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps will provide insights into their contributions to gene expression, cellular adaptation, and evolutionary diversity. This review emphasizes the importance of these technological advancements in uncovering the complete spectrum of RNA modifications and their implications for living systems.</dc:description>

         <title>HPPE Activates NRF2 Signaling by Liberating Heavy Metal Stores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cap&#8217;n&#8217;collar transcription factor BACH1 represses the transcription of gene products involved in oxidative stress protection. Accordingly, agents capable of inhibiting the activity of BACH1 would be of keen interest in treating several autoimmune and age&#8208;related diseases. Here, we report that a previously annotated BACH1 inhibitor, HPPE, does not inhibit BACH1 but instead activates a NRF2 driven transcription program that is dependent on the canonical cysteine sensors of NRF2 inhibitory protein KEAP1. Mechanistically, HPPE acts as an ionophore, liberating cellular Zn2+ stores and inducing non&#8208;lethal levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in KEAP1 inactivation. These data provide a surprising mechanism by which HPPE acts in cells and suggest that inducing small amounts of cellular stress may be a viable mechanism for activating NRF2 therapeutically.</dc:description>

         <title>Recombinant production of the cyclotide kalata B1 by conditional split inteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes the design, production, and characterization of a novel conditional intein system for the recombinant production of cyclic peptides. The system is based on two key features: (1) a promiscuous extein recognition site allowing cyclization of virtually any peptide, and (2) a secondary split site within the intein itself enabling triggered splicing at will. Two intein precursors were recombinantly expressed, purified, and then self&#8208;assembled in vitro to cyclize the model peptide kalata B1 (kB1). Cyclized kB1 was successfully purified, refolded and characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR, demonstrating correct disulfide bond formation and identical structure to synthetic kB1. Importantly, the intein&#8208;derived kB1 retained full biological activity as evidenced by insect cell toxicity assays. This work establishes a versatile and efficient approach for intein&#8208;mediated protein cyclization with potential applications in bioengineering and peptide discovery.</dc:description>

Two intein precursors were recombinantly expressed, purified, and then self-assembled in vitro to cyclize the model peptide kalata B1 (kB1). Cyclized kB1 was successfully purified, refolded and characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR, demonstrating correct disulfide bond formation and identical structure to synthetic kB1. Importantly, the intein-derived kB1 retained full biological activity as evidenced by insect cell toxicity assays. This work establishes a versatile and efficient approach for intein-mediated protein cyclization with potential applications in bioengineering and peptide discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent Acylation of Peptide Lysine Residues by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for modifying intact peptides are useful but can be unselective with regard to amino acid position and sequence context. In this work, we used in vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate a Lys residue of a short peptide in sequence&#8208;dependent fashion. The DNAzymes do not acylate Lys when placed at other residues in the peptide, and the acylation activity depends on the Lys sequence context. A good acylation yield is observed on the preparative nanomole scale. These findings are promising for further development of DNAzymes for broader application to top&#8208;down Lys acylation of peptide and protein substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Clinical Glycoproteome by Integrating Affinity Enrichment with Nanopore Sequencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective enlightens the use of enrichment techniques like lectin affinity, boronate affinity, hydrazide chemistry, and molecularly imprinted polymers before nanopore detection to advance clinical glycoproteomics. These methods selectively isolate glycoproteins, removing abundant background proteins. Nanopore technology provides label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time analysis, ensuring optimal sensor function. This combined strategy promises advances in glycosylation research, biomarker discovery, and personalized therapy.







Abstract
This prospect explores the integration of enrichment strategies with nanopore detection to advance clinical glycoproteomics. Glycoproteins, crucial for understanding biological processes, pose challenges due to their low abundance and structural diversity. Enrichment techniques using lectin affinity, boronate affinity, and hydrazide chemistry and especially molecular imprinted polymers may selectively and specifically isolate glycoproteins from complex samples, while nanopore technology enables label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time, and single&#8208;molecule analysis. This approach holds promise for disease&#8208;related glycosylation studies, biomarker discovery, personalized medicine, and streamlined clinical analysis. Standardization, optimization, and data analysis remain challenges, requiring interdisciplinary collaborations and technological advancements. Overall, this integration may offer transformative potential for clinical glycoproteomics and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Regioselective Deacetylation in Nucleosides and Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in acetylated nucleosides demonstrates practical significance in synthetic processes. It simplifies the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarized and evaluated recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylation, and de&#8208;N&#8208;acetylation) are summarized and discussed within each section of this report.







Abstract
Nucleoside analogues are a promising class of natural compounds in the pharmaceutical industry, and many antiviral, antibacterial and anticancer drugs have been created through structural modification of nucleosides scaffold. Acyl protecting groups, especially the acetyl group, play an important role in the protection of hydroxy groups in nucleoside synthesis and modification; consequently, numerous methodologies have been put forth for the acetylation of free nucleosides. However, for nucleosides that contain different O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities, selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in nucleosides has been studied little, despite its practical significance in simplifying the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini&#8208;review, recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues are summarized and evaluated. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylation, and de&#8208;N&#8208;acetylation) are summarized and discussed in each section.

         <title>Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation of Peptides: An Overview of Synthetic and Chemoenzymatic Methodologies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation is a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates key biological processes. It occurs on a wide range of amino acids, including arginine, cysteine, serine, and glutamic acid. Well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides are valuable tools for investigating the structures, mechanisms of action, and interaction partners of this modification. This article provides a comprehensive overview of chemical and chemoenzymatic methodologies for the construction of mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.







Abstract
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification that regulates vital biological processes like histone reorganization and DNA&#8208;damage repair through the modification of various amino acid residues. Due to advances in mass&#8208;spectrometry, the collection of long&#8208;known ADP&#8208;ribose (ADPr) acceptor sites, e.&#8201;g. arginine, cysteine and glutamic acid, has been expanded with serine, tyrosine and histidine, among others. Well&#8208;defined ADPr&#8208;peptides are valuable tools for investigating the exact structures, mechanisms of action and interaction partners of the different flavors of this modification. This review provides a comprehensive overview of synthetic and chemoenzymatic methodologies that enabled the construction of peptides mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated on various amino acids, and close mimetics thereof.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Binding Oligonucleotide Backbone Modifications for Targeting a DNA&#8208;Processing Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA oligonucleotides bearing a modified internucleotide linkage that enables chelation of zinc ions were synthesized. Modifications included urea, squaramide, sulfanylacetamide and sulfinylacetamide moieties. The interaction of the oligonucleotides with the zinc&#8208;dependent DNA repair enzyme SNM1A was studied. The oligonucleotides were capable of strong binding to SNM1A, and the most potent compound inhibited SNM1A activity with an IC50 of 231&#8197;nM.







Abstract
A series of chemically&#8208;modified oligonucleotides for targeting the DNA repair nuclease SNM1A have been designed and synthesised. Each oligonucleotide contains a modified internucleotide linkage designed to both mimic the native phosphodiester backbone and chelate to the catalytic zinc ion(s) in the SNM1A active site. Dinucleoside phosphoramidites containing urea, squaramide, sulfanylacetamide, and sulfinylacetamide linkages were prepared and employed successfully in solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. All the modified oligonucleotides were found to interact with SNM1A in a gel electrophoresis&#8208;based assay, demonstrating the first examples of inhibition of DNA damage repair enzymes for many of these groups in oligonucleotides. One strand containing a sulfinylacetamide&#8208;linkage was found to have the strongest interaction with SNM1A and was further tested in a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay. This allowed an IC50 value of 231&#8197;nM to be determined, significantly lower than previously reported substrate&#8208;mimics targeting this enzyme. It is expected that these modified oligonucleotides will serve as a scaffold for the future development of fluorescent or biotin&#8208;labelled probes for the in&#8197;vivo study of DNA repair processes.

         <title>Comparative Study of Immobilized Biolipasa&#8208;R for Second Generation Biodiesel Production from an Acid Oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biolipasa&#8208;R immobilized via adsorption on diatomaceous earth and commercial carriers efficiently catalyzes the production of fatty acid methyl esters from acid oils, for the preparation of second&#8208;generation biodiesel. It's performance in this process is superior to benchmark enzyme Novozym&#174; 435.







Abstract
The primary objective of this work is to develop a sustainable biocatalytic transesterification process for low&#8208;grade oils, aligning with EU green technology requirements for the shift to second generation biodiesel. Thus, we investigated the immobilization and subsequent application of the lipase Biolipasa&#8208;R on transesterification processes to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from both a sunflower oil and an acid oil which is a bioproduct of the biodiesel industry. The lipase was immobilized on biomaterials, such as diatomaceous earth, with a yield of 60&#8201;%, and commercial carriers such as methacrylic resins with a yield of 100&#8201;%. The enzyme demonstrated superior activity when immobilized on diatomaceous earth, particularly in reactions involving the acid oil, outperforming the benchmark enzyme Novozym&#174; 435 (95.1&#8201;% and 35&#8201;% conversion respectively). This work highlights the potential of Biolipasa&#8208;R as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient biocatalyst for biodiesel production and emphasizes the environmental benefits of utilizing industrial byproducts and eco&#8208;friendly immobilization techniques. The findings suggest that Biolipasa&#8208;R is a promising candidate for industrial applications in biodiesel production, offering a sustainable solution for waste management and energy generation.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Halogenated Tryptophans for Protein Engineering Using Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tryptophan halogenases SttH and RebH catalyze the halogenation of tryptophan at the C&#8208;6 and C&#8208;7 positions, respectively. By introducing the biosynthetic pathways for tryptophan halogenation along with the appropriate aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs, cells can be engineered to produce halogenated tryptophans and site&#8208;specifically incorporate them genetically into proteins of interest.







Abstract
Genetic Code Expansion technology offers significant potential in incorporating noncanonical amino acids into proteins at precise locations, allowing for the modulation of protein structures and functions. However, this technology is often limited by the need for costly and challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize external noncanonical amino acid sources. In this study, we address this limitation by developing autonomous cells capable of biosynthesizing halogenated tryptophan derivatives and introducing them into proteins using Genetic Code Expansion technology. By utilizing inexpensive halide salts and different halogenases, we successfully achieve the selective biosynthesis of 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan, and 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan. These derivatives are introduced at specific positions with corresponding bioorthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs in response to the amber codon. Following optimization, we demonstrate the robust expression of proteins containing halogenated tryptophan residues in cells with the ability to biosynthesize these tryptophan derivatives. This study establishes a versatile platform for engineering proteins with various halogenated tryptophans.

         <title>Freezing Functional Nucleic Acids: From Molecular Reactions to Surface Immobilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freezing aqueous solution of functional nucleic acids can accelerate reactions across different scales mainly via the freeze&#8208;concentration effect. These reactions include molecular ligation and cleavage, nanoparticle conjugation, and immobilization on bulk surfaces.







Abstract
Biochemical reactions are typically slowed down by decreasing temperature. However, accelerated reaction kinetics have been observed for a long time. More recent examples have highlighted the unique role of freezing in fabricating supermaterials, degrading environmental contaminants, and accelerating bioreactions. Functional nucleic acids are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with versatile properties, including target recognition, catalysis, and molecular co4mputing. In this review, we discuss the current observations and understanding of freezing&#8208;facilitated reactions involving functional nucleic acids. Molecular reactions such as ligation/conjugation, cleavage, and hybridization are discussed. Moreover, freezing&#8208;induced DNA&#8208;nanoparticle conjugations are introduced. Then, we describe our effect in immobilizing DNA on bulk surfaces. Finally, we address some critical questions and research opportunities in the field.

         <title>Exploring the World of Curcumin: Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Applications in Nanoscience and Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of curcumin lies not only in its photophysical properties but also in its diverse applications in nanoscience and biology.







Abstract
Curcumin is a bright yellow naturally occurring polyphenol which is the principal component of turmeric. It is used as herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, and food coloring agent. Over the years, the therapeutic properties of the natural product curcumin have gone unexploited but not unnoticed. Curcumin cannot be employed as a drug due to limitations such as low aqueous solubility and limited bioavailability. Many attempts have been made to overcome these limitations by confining the drug in various confined media to enhance its bioavailability. The biomolecule is emissive and undergoes fundamental excited state processes such as solvation dynamics and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials are also a fast advancing field where curcumin is an intrinsic component necessary for formation of these materials and no longer added as an external free drug. In this review, we will summarize the recent research on the photophysical and photochemical properties of curcumin and its excited state dynamics in various bio&#8208;mimicking systems. At the same time we wish to also incorporate the various applications of curcumin, especially in biology. Lastly due to the growing importance of materials science, we will briefly discuss some recent advances on curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials. We believe such a compilation of recent research surrounding curcumin will provide an overall understanding of its potentialities in different areas.

         <title>Short Oligourea Foldamers as N&#8208; or C&#8208;Caps for Promoting &#945;&#8208;Helix Formation in Water</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locked at either end: The high helix propensity of short oligourea sequences allows efficient capping at both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminus of water&#8208;soluble peptide sequences. This extra&#8208;helical stabilization is a versatile tool for modulating the conformation of bioactive peptides.







Abstract
While foldamers have been extensively studied as protein mimics and especially as &#945;&#8208;helix mimics, their use as capping motif to enhance &#945;&#8208;helix propensity remains comparatively much limited. In this study, we leverage the structural similarities between urea&#8208;based helical foldamers and &#945;&#8208;helix to investigate the efficacy of oligoureas as N&#8208; or C&#8208;caps for reinforcing &#945;&#8208;helical structures in water. Short oligoureas, comprising 3 to 4 residues, were strategically introduced at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus of two peptide sequences (S&#8208;peptide and an Ala&#8208;rich model sequence). The impact of these foldamer insertions on peptide conformation was examined using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and solution NMR. This research identifies specific foldamer sequences capable of promoting &#945;&#8208;helicity when incorporated at either terminus of the peptides. Not only does this work broaden the application scope of foldamers, but it also provides valuable insights into novel strategies for modulating peptide conformation in aqueous environments. The findings presented in this study may have implications for peptide design and the development of bioactive foldamer&#8208;based peptide mimics.

         <title>Synthesis and Semi&#8208;Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein: Insight into the Chemical Complexity of Synucleinopathies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alpha&#8208;synuclein (aSyn) physiologically is involved in neurotransmitter release, but pathologically aggregates into proteinaceous deposits in the brain, being associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Herein, the various reported synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic routes to obtain wild&#8208;type (WT) and modified aSyn are summarized in order to enlighten their importance for studying the effects of modifications on the structure and aggregation behavior of aSyn.







Abstract
The chemical rules governing protein folding have intrigued generations of researchers for decades. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), prediction of protein structure has improved tremendously. However, there is still a level of analysis that is only possible through wet laboratory experiments, especially in respect to the investigation of the pathological effect of mutations and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on proteins of interest. This requires the availability of pure peptides and proteins in sufficient quantities for biophysical, biochemical, and functional studies. In this context, chemical protein synthesis and semi&#8208;synthesis are powerful tools in protein research, which help to enlighten the role of protein modification in the physiology and pathology of proteins. A protein of high interest in the field of biomedicine is alpha&#8208;synuclein (aSyn), a protein deeply associated with several devastating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple systems atrophy (MSA). Here, we describe several methods and pathways to synthesize native or modified aSyn, and discuss how these approaches enable us to address pathological mechanisms that may open novel perspectives for therapeutic intervention.

However, there is still a level of analysis that is only possible through wet laboratory experiments, especially in respect to the investigation of the pathological effect of mutations and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on proteins of interest. This requires the availability of pure peptides and proteins in sufficient quantities for biophysical, biochemical, and functional studies. In this context, chemical protein synthesis and semi-synthesis are powerful tools in protein research, which help to enlighten the role of protein modification in the physiology and pathology of proteins. A protein of high interest in the field of biomedicine is alpha-synuclein (aSyn), a protein deeply associated with several devastating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple systems atrophy (MSA). Here, we describe several methods and pathways to synthesize native or modified aSyn, and discuss how these approaches enable us to address pathological mechanisms that may open novel perspectives for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting New Functions and Applications of Bacterial Two&#8208;Component Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are widespread in bacteria, and crucial for their cellular processes. This concept paper focuses on His&#8208;Asp phosphotransfer, the function of ATP synthesis, antimicrobial drug design, cellular biosensors, and protein allostery mechanisms based on recent TCS investigations, aiming to inspire new applications and future research directions.







Abstract
Two&#8208;component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are regulatory systems widely distributed in eubacteria, archaea, and a few eukaryotic organisms, but not in mammalian cells. A typical TCS consists of a histidine kinase and a response regulator protein. Functional and mechanistic studies on different TCSs have greatly advanced the understanding of cellular phosphotransfer signal transduction mechanisms. In this concept paper, we focus on the His&#8208;Asp phosphotransfer mechanism, the ATP synthesis function, antimicrobial drug design, cellular biosensors design, and protein allostery mechanisms based on recent TCS investigations to inspire new applications and future research perspectives.

         <title>Broadening The Substrate Scope of Aldolases Through Metagenomic Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence&#8208;based metagenomic approach was used to analyse ten metagenomes and extract putative DERA aldolases with unprecedented activity. We characterized the most promising enzyme by investigating its stability and activity under different conditions including temperature, pH and buffer type. Lastly, these enzymes were tested using furfural and benzaldehyde as acceptors, broadening the substrate scope of this class.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;processes based on enzymatic catalysis play a major role in the development of green, sustainable processes, and the discovery of new enzymes is key to this approach. In this work, we analysed ten metagenomes and retrieved 48 genes coding for deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolases (DERAs, EC 4.1.2.4) using a sequence&#8208;based approach. These sequences were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and screened for activity towards a range of aldol additions. Among these, one enzyme, DERA&#8208;61, proved to be particularly interesting and catalysed the aldol addition of furfural or benzaldehyde with acetone, butanone and cyclobutanone with unprecedented activity. The product of these reactions, aldols, can find applications as building blocks in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Screening was carried out to identify optimized reaction conditions targeting temperature, pH, and salt concentrations. Lastly, the kinetics and the stereochemistry of the products were investigated, revealing that DERA&#8208;61 and other metagenomic DERAs have superior activity and stereoselectivity when they are provided with non&#8208;natural substrates, compared to well&#8208;known DERAs.

         <title>Photoactivated Anticancer Activity of Cobalt(III) Complexes with Naturally Occurring Flavonoids Chrysin and Silibinin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;ligand dipyridophenazine cobalt(III) complexes, Co5 and Co6, which incorporate the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin and silibinin, respectively, demonstrate significant visible light&#8208;triggered cytotoxicity against HeLa cervical and A549 lung cancer cells. Importantly, these complexes exhibit only minimal toxicity to HPL1D normal lung epithelial cells, suggesting their potential utility in cancer photodynamic therapy applications.







Abstract
Photoactive metal complexes of bioessential transition metal ions with natural chelators are gaining interest as photocytotoxic agents for cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). We report six new cobalt(III) complexes with a mixed&#8208;ligand formulation [Co(B)2(L)](ClO4)2 (Co1&#8211;Co6), where B represents a N,N&#8208;donor &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand, namely, phenanthroline (phen; Co1, Co2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq; Co3, Co4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz; Co5, Co6), and L is the monoanionic form of the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin (chry; Co1, Co3, Co5) and silibinin (sili; Co2, Co4, Co6). Complexes displayed a d&#8208;d absorption band within 500&#8211;700&#8197;nm and exhibited excellent dark and photostability in solution. Cytotoxicity studies indicated significant activity of Co5 and Co6 against cervical (HeLa) and lung (A549) cancer cells under visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) irradiation giving low micromolar IC50 values (2.3&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#956;M, phototoxicity index~15&#8211;30). The complexes demonstrated notably low toxicity against normal HPL1D lung epithelial cells. Flow cytometry assay revealed an apoptotic mode of cell damage triggered by the complexes when irradiated. ROS generation assay indicated the involvement of singlet oxygen species in the cell death mechanism when irradiated with light. Overall, complexes Co5 and Co6 with coordinated dipyridophenazine and flavonoid ligands are potential candidates for cancer PDT applications.

         <title>Uracil&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Linking in RNA and Inhibition of miRNA Function by 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinyl&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine Deoxynucleosides</title>

Herein, we report the synthesis of a cross&#8208;linkable nucleoside (2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;propynyl&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine deoxyriboside; dADpVP). dADpVP selectively reacted with counter uridine with high reactivity upon duplex hybridization. The structural determination of the cross&#8208;linked adduct revealed that cross&#8208;linking occurred at the N&#8208;3 of uridine. We investigated if the incorporation of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides into microRNA inhibitors enabled a more effective inhibition of endogenous miRNA function.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through RNA interference. Consequently, miRNA inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), have attracted attention for treating miRNA overexpression. To achieve efficient inhibition, we developed 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine (AVP) nucleosides that form covalent bonds with uridine counterparts in RNA. We demonstrated that mRNA cross&#8208;linked with AVP&#8208;conjugated antisense oligonucleotides with AVP were protected from gene silencing by exogenous miRNA. However, endogenous miRNA function could not be inhibited in cells, probably because of slow cross&#8208;linking kinetics. We recently developed ADpVP, an AVP derivative bearing a 7&#8208;propynyl group &#8211; which boasts faster reaction rate than the original AVP. Here, we synthesized dADpVP &#8211; a deoxy analog of ADpVP &#8211; through a simplified synthesis protocol. Evaluation of the cross&#8208;linking reaction revealed that the reaction kinetics of dADpVP were comparable to those of ADpVP. In addition, structural analysis of the cross&#8208;linked adduct discovered N3 linkage against uridine. Incorporating dADpVP into two types of miRNA inhibitors revealed a marginal impact on AMO efficacy yet improved the performance of target site blockers. These results indicate the potential of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides for indirect miRNA function inhibition.

         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms pose a significant clinical challenge because they are highly resistant to host immune responses and antibiotic treatments. This review delves into the reasons behind the difficulty in treating biofilms and investigates the potential of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery as a method to address various in vivo biofilm infections.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are a significant concern in various medical contexts due to their resilience to our immune system as well as antibiotic therapy. Biofilms often require surgical removal and frequently lead to recurrent or chronic infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved strategies to treat biofilm infections. Ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery is a technique that combines ultrasound application, often with the administration of acoustically&#8208;active agents, to enhance drug delivery to specific target tissues or cells within the body. This method involves using ultrasound waves to assist in the transportation or activation of medications, improving their penetration, distribution, and efficacy at the desired site. The advantages of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery include targeted and localized delivery, reduced systemic side effects, and improved efficacy of the drug at lower doses. This review scrutinizes recent advances in the application of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery for treating biofilm infections, focusing on in vivo studies. We examine the strengths and limitations of this technology in the context of wound infections, device&#8208;associated infections, lung infections and abscesses, and discuss current gaps in knowledge and clinical translation considerations.

         <title>(S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 Activates Autophagy via TRPML1&#8208;TFEB Pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed liquid chromatography (LC) and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) to resolve for the first time, the enantiomers of ML&#8208;SA1 an agonist of the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1. Compound (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 was nearly 10&#8208;fold more potent than the racemate in the calcium assay, which lead to a strong transcription factor EB (TFEB) translocation to the nucleus, followed by gene transcription and increase in the autophagy markers.







Abstract
Autophagic flux plays a crucial role in various diseases. Recently, the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 has emerged as a promising target in lysosomal storage diseases, such as mucolipidosis. The discovery of mucolipin synthetic agonist&#8208;1 (ML&#8208;SA1) has expanded our understanding of TRPML1&#8242;s function and its potential therapeutic uses. However, ML&#8208;SA1 is a racemate with limited cellular potency and poor water solubility. In this study, we synthetized rac&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1, separated the enantiomers by chiral liquid chromatography and determined their absolute configuration by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). In addition, we focused on investigating the impact of each enantiomer of ML&#8208;SA1 on the TRPML1&#8208;TFEB axis. Our findings revealed that (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 acts as an agonist for TRPML1 at the lysosomal membrane. This activation prompts transcription factor EB (TFEB) to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus in a dose&#8208;dependent manner within live cells. Consequently, this signaling pathway enhances the expression of coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) genes and activates autophagic flux. Our study presents evidence for the potential use of (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 in the development of new therapies for lysosomal storage diseases that target TRPML1.

         <title>Biosynthesis and Assembly Logic of Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks of polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine relies on the collaboration of terpene cyclases (TCs) or prenyltransferases (PTs) with polyketide synthases (PKSs), nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPSs), or glycosyltransferases (GTs), these combination strategies significantly contribute to the formation of hybrid terpenoid natural products in fungi.







Abstract
In recent decades, fungi have emerged as significant sources of diverse hybrid terpenoid natural products, and their biosynthetic pathways are increasingly unveiled. This review mainly focuses on elucidating the various strategies underlying the biosynthesis and assembly logic of these compounds. These pathways combine terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks including polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine, resulting in the formation of plenty of hybrid terpenoid natural products via C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, or C&#8722;N bond linkages. Subsequent tailoring steps, such as oxidation, cyclization, and rearrangement, further enhance the biological diversity and structural complexity of these hybrid terpenoid natural products. Understanding these biosynthetic mechanisms holds promise for the discovery of novel hybrid terpenoid natural products from fungi, which will promote the development of potential drug candidates in the future.

         <title>New Frontiers in Nonheme Enzymatic Oxyferryl Species</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we summarize the reactivities demonstrated by S=2 oxyferryl intermediates found in non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron enzymes and the recently discovered S=1 ferryl intermediate in the same enzyme family. The mechanistic implication and the reactivity difference of the ferryl intermediates with different spin states are further discussed.







Abstract
Non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron dependent (NHM&#8722;Fe) enzymes exhibit exceedingly diverse catalytic reactivities. Despite their catalytic versatilities, the mononuclear iron centers in these enzymes show a relatively simple architecture, in which an iron atom is ligated with 2&#8211;4 amino acid residues, including histidine, aspartic or glutamic acid. In the past two decades, a common high&#8208;valent reactive iron intermediate, the S=2 oxyferryl (Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo or Fe(IV)=O) species, has been repeatedly discovered in NHM&#8722;Fe enzymes containing a 2&#8208;His&#8208;Fe or 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;Fe center. However, for 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes, no common reactive intermediate has been identified. Recently, we have spectroscopically characterized the first S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate in a 3&#8208;His&#8208;Fe containing enzyme, OvoA, which catalyzes a novel oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation. In this review, we summarize the broad reactivities demonstrated by S=2 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates, the discovery of the first S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate in OvoA and the mechanistic implication of such a discovery, and the intrinsic reactivity differences of the S=2 and the S=1 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo species. Finally, we postulate the possible reasons to utilize an S=1 Fe(IV) species in OvoA and their implications to other 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes.

         <title>Single Point Mutation Abolishes Water Capture in Germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering water capture in sesquiterpene synthase (GdolS) is explored by manipulating highly conserved active site residues. This work demonstrates that hydroxylation in sesquiterpene synthases can be prevented resulting in the formation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons from carbocation intermediates.







Abstract
The high&#8208;fidelity sesquiterpene cyclase (&#8722;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol synthase (GdolS) converts farnesyl diphosphate into the macrocyclic alcohol (&#8722;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis was used to decipher the role of key residues in the water control mechanism. Replacement of Ala176, located in the G1/2 helix, with non&#8208;polar aliphatic residues of increasing size (valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine) resulted in the accumulation of the non&#8208;hydroxylated products germacrene A and germacrene D. In contrast, hydroxylation was maintained when the polar residues threonine, glutamine or aspartate replaced Ala176. Additionally, although a contribution of His150 to the nucleophilic water addition could be ruled out, the imidazole ring of His150 appears to assist carbocation stabilisation. The results presented here shed light on how hydroxylating sesquiterpene synthases can be engineered to design modified sesquiterpene synthases to reduce the need for further steps in the biocatalytic production of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids.

         <title>Vinyl 3&#8208;(Dimethylamino)propanoate as an Irreversible Acyl Donor Reagent in a Chromatography&#8208;free Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of sec&#8208;Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel &#8220;acid&#8208;washable&#8221; acyl donor, namely vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate, dedicated to a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. The employed vinyl ester is easy to obtain from commercially available starting materials, allows the synthesis of both enantiomers of a range of structurally diverse benzylic alcohols with high conversions and excellent enantioselectivity, and, most importantly, significantly simplifies enzymatic KR, leading to a more sustainable and ecologically friendly bioprocess. The developed procedure can be applied when classical purification methods fail to separate KR products.







Abstract
The reported chemoenzymatic strategy involves the employment of vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate as an irreversible acyl donor in a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. This biotransformation is achieved in a sequential manner using CAL&#8208;B to affect the kinetic resolution, followed by a simple acidic extractive work&#8208;up furnishing both KR products with excellent enantioselectivity (E&gt;200; up to 98&#8201;% ee). The elaborated method eliminates a single&#8208;use silica gel chromatographic separation and significantly reduces organic solvent consumption to foster a more environmentally friendly chemical industry.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applications of electrochemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) for visual biosensing and bioimaging in recent years were reviewed. Some existing challenges and feasible solutions were presented aiming to provide general guidelines for broadening the research field of ECLM.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is one of the most powerful techniques that meet the needs of analysis and detection in a variety of scenarios, because of its highly analytical sensitivity and excellent spatiotemporal controllability. ECL combined with microscopy (ECLM) offers a promising approach for quantifying and mapping a wide range of analytes. To date, ECLM has been widely used to image biological entities and processes, such as cells, subcellular structures, proteins and membrane transport properties. In this review, we first introduced the mechanisms of several classic ECL systems, then highlighted the progress of visual biosensing and bioimaging by ECLM in the last decade. Finally, the characteristics of ECLM were summarized, as well as some of the current challenges. The future research interests and potential directions for the application of ECLM were also outlooked.

         <title>Heavy Metal Detection with Organic Moiety&#8208;Based Sensors: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on accuracy, selectivity, and sensitivity, this paper examines the necessity of sophisticated heavy metal detection methods. Using terpyridine, porphyrin, coumarin, and Schiff bases as organic moiety&#8208;based techniques, it also addresses recent advancements in fluorescence chemosensors for multi&#8208;ion detection, highlighting detection limitations, stoichiometry, Solvent systems, metal bindings, and applications.







Abstract
Heavy metal hazardous and enduring characteristics present a noteworthy risk to both human well&#8208;being and the ecosystem. Heavy metal level monitoring requires accurate and dependable detection techniques. This review emphasizes the requirement for sophisticated detection methods that can address the issues like sensitivity, selectivity, cost and ease of use for the detection of heavy metal ions and allow for more accurate and trustworthy monitoring using various organic moieties. It offers a thorough overview of cutting&#8208;edge organic moiety&#8208;based heavy metal detection techniques. It primarily discusses four different types of substituted core structures, including coumarin, porphyrin, Schiff bases, and terpyridine, along with their mechanisms, methods, detection limits, and appropriate metal bindings. These moieties exhibit strong coordination with heavy metal ions because of their distinct structural characteristics. They produce stable complexes with complicated ligand&#8208;metal interactions that are useful in a variety of applications, including sensing and catalysis. Each probe was chosen based on its propensity or capacity to identify important analytes in practical applications. To increase the effectiveness and productivity of fluorescence sensing, researchers have recently been working to create new fluorescence chemosensors that can identify many ions at once.

         <title>Sunflower Pollen&#8208;Derived Microspheres Selectively Absorb DNA for microRNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microsphere (HSEC) with hierarchical structures is developed to selectively absorb polyC and polyA single&#8208;stranded DNA with high efficiency and affinity, particularly in the presence of Ca2+ and under neutral and acidic conditions. The absorption mechanism involves electrostatic and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, highlighting the potential of HSECs for diverse biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.







Abstract
Herein, we report the finding that a naturally sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microspheres (HSECs) with hierarchical structures can selectively absorb polyC and polyA with high efficiency and affinity. HSECs exhibit the capability to selectively absorb polyC and polyA ssDNA under neutral and acidic conditions. It has been observed that the presence of metal cations, specifically Ca2+, enhances the absorption efficiency of HSECs. Mechanically, this absorption phenomenon can be attributed to both electrostatic interactions and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such an appealing property enables the functionalization of HSECs for broad potential biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.

Reviewing computational methods for Enzyme Engineering in the era of Machine Learning: A concise overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods, ranging from property engineering to the de novo design of enzymes, with an emphasis on user&#8208;friendly tools that are freely accessible as web&#8208;interfaces.







Abstract
Enzyme engineering, though pivotal across various biotechnological domains, is often plagued by its time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive nature. This review aims to offer an overview of supportive in silico methodologies for this demanding endeavor. Starting from methods to predict protein structures, to classification of their activity and even the discovery of new enzymes we continue with describing tools used to increase thermostability and production yields of selected targets. Subsequently, we discuss computational methods to modulate both, the activity as well as selectivity of enzymes. Last, we present recent approaches based on cutting&#8208;edge machine learning methods to redesign enzymes. With exception of the last chapter, there is a strong focus on methods easily accessible via web&#8208;interfaces or simple Python&#8208;scripts, therefore readily useable for a diverse and broad community.
