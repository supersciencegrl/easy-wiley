         <title>Conjugating Hemoglobin and Albumin by Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208; Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) of site&#8208;selectively cross&#8208;linked human hemoglobin with specifically modified human serum albumin yields a structurally defined protein&#8208;protein conjugate. A circulating solution of the conjugate can provide cooperative oxygen transport and maintain colloid osmotic pressure.







Abstract
A one&#8208;to&#8208;one conjugate of cross&#8208;linked human hemoglobin and human serum albumin results from a strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) of the modified proteins. Additions of a strained alkyne&#8208;substituted maleimide to the Cys&#8208;34 thiol of human serum albumin and an azide&#8208;containing cross&#8208;link between the amino groups of each &#946;&#8208;unit at Lys&#8208;82 of human hemoglobin provide sites for coupling by the SPAAC process. The coupled hemoglobin&#8208;albumin conjugate can be readily purified from unreacted hemoglobin. The oxygen binding properties of the two&#8208;protein bioconjugate demonstrate oxygen affinity and cooperativity that are suitable for use in an acellular oxygen carrier.

         <title>Controllable Silver Release for Efficient Treatment of Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial&#8208;Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ag@C with core&#8208;shell structure provides more options for controlling the Ag+ release kinetics. By regulating the synthesis temperature, we optimize the crystallinity of the Ag NP core and the carbon shell topology and elucidate their correlation with the Ag+ release kinetics. The optimized Ag@C exhibits exceptional antibacterial activity and biocompatibility, thereby achieving efficient bacterial&#8208;infected wound treatment.







Abstract
The use of traditional Ag&#8208;based antibacterial agents is usually accompanied by uncontrollable silver release, which makes it difficult to find a balance between antibacterial performance and biosafety. Herein, we prepared a core&#8208;shell system of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived amorphous carbon&#8208;coated Ag nanoparticles (Ag@C) as an ideal research model to reveal the synergistic effect and structure&#8208;activity relationship of the structural transformation of carbon shell and Ag core on the regulation of silver release behavior. It is found that Ag@C prepared at 600&#8201;&#176;C (AC6) exhibits the best ion release kinetics due to the combination of relatively simple shell structure and lower crystallinity of the Ag core, thereby exerting stronger antibacterial properties (&gt;99.999&#8201;%) at trace doses (20&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1) compared with most other Ag&#8208;based materials. Meanwhile, the carbon shell prevents the metal Ag from being directly exposed to the organism and thus endows AC6 with excellent biocompatibility. In animal experiments, AC6 can effectively promote wound healing by inactivating drug&#8208;resistant bacteria while regulating the expression of TNF&#8208;&#945; and CD31. This work provides theoretical support for the scientific design and clinical application of controllable ion&#8208;releasing antibacterial agents.

         <title>Profiling Cellular Morphological Changes Induced by Dual&#8208;Targeting PROTACs of Aurora Kinase and RNA&#8208;Binding Protein YTHDF2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of the multi&#8208;kinase PROTACs revealed the first examples of PROTAC degraders for the RNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2. Morphological profiling of the PROTACs via the cell painting assay complemented the current characterization toolbox for PROTACs and provided insights into biological targets and mechanisms of action at the cellular phenotypic level.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are new chemical modalities that degrade proteins of interest, including established kinase targets and emerging RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs). Whereas diverse sets of biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays are available for the evaluation and optimizations of PROTACs in understanding the involved ubiquitin&#8722;proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation mechanism and the structure&#8208;degradation relationship, a phenotypic method profiling the cellular morphological changes is rarely used. In this study, first, we reported the only examples of PROTACs degrading the mRNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2 via screening of multikinase PROTACs. Second, we reported the profiling of cellular morphological changes of the dual kinase&#8208; and RBP&#8208;targeting PROTACs using the unbiased cell painting assay (CPA). The CPA analysis revealed the high biosimilarity with the established aurora kinase cluster and annotated aurora kinase inhibitors, which reflected the association between YTHDF2 and the aurora kinase signaling network. Broadly, the results demonstrated that the cell painting assay can be a straightforward and powerful approach to evaluate PROTACs. Complementary to the existing biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays, CPA provided a new perspective in characterizing PROTACs at the cellular morphology.

         <title>An Assay for Immunogenic Detection of Anti&#8208;PEG Antibody</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adopting a surfactant&#8208;free procedure with incorporating 1&#8201;% bovine serum albumin into the serum dilution minimized the underestimation of PEG antibody detection levels.







Abstract
With the increasing use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) based proteins and drug delivery systems, anti&#8208;PEG antibodies have commonly been detected among the population, causing the accelerated blood clearance and hypersensitivity reactions, poses potential risks to the clinical efficacy and safety of PEGylated drugs. Therefore, vigilant monitoring of anti&#8208;PEG antibodies is crucial for both research and clinical guidance regarding PEGylated drugs. The enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a common method for detecting anti&#8208;PEG antibodies. However, diverse coating methods, blocking solutions and washing solutions have been employed across different studies, and unsuitable use of Tween 20 as the surfactant even caused biased results. In this study, we established the optimal substrate coating conditions, and investigated the influence of various surfactants and blocking solutions on the detection accuracy. The findings revealed that incorporating 1&#8201;% bovine serum albumin into the serum dilution in the absence of surfactants will result the credible outcomes of anti&#8208;PEG antibody detection.

ATCC 10712</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indolocarbazoles are natural products with broad bioactivities. A distinct feature of indolocarbazole biosynthesis is the modification of the indole and maleimide rings by regioselective tailoring enzymes. Here, we study a new indolocarbazole variant, which is encoded by the acfXODCP genes from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712. First we characterise this pathway by expressing the acfXODCP genes in Streptomyces coelicolor, which led to the production of a C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;dihydroxylated indolocarbazole. We assign as a new product arcyriaflavin F. Second, we demonstrate the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase AcfX catalyses the C&#8208;5/C&#8208;5&#8217; dihydroxylation of the unsubstituted arcyriaflavin A into arcyriaflavin F. Interestingly, AcfX shares homology to EspX from erdasporine A biosynthesis, which instead catalyses a single C&#8208;6 indolocarbazole hydroxylation. In summary, we report a new indolocarbazole biosynthetic pathway and a regioselective C&#8208;5 indole ring tailoring enzyme AcfX.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Deacetylation in Nucleosides and Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleoside analogues are a promising class of natural compounds in the pharmaceutical industry, and many antiviral, antibacterial and anticancer drugs have been created through structural modification of nucleosides scaffold. Acyl protecting groups, especially the acetyl group, play an important role in the protection of hydroxy groups in nucleoside synthesis and modification; consequently, numerous methodologies have been put forth for the acetylation of free nucleosides. However, for nucleosides that contain different O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities, selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in nucleosides has been studied little, despite its practical significance in simplifying the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini&#8208;review, recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues are summarized and evaluated. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylation, and de&#8208;N&#8208;acetylation) are summarized and discussed in each section.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of a Malonyl&#8208;CoA Ligase for Production of Fluorinated Polyketide Extender Units</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic platforms for producing malonyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;based extender units required for polyketide biosynthesis are often based on malonyl&#8208;CoA ligases such as MatB from Rhizobium trifolii and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. However, despite broad interest in the fluorination of polyketides and prior success with engineering MatB homologs, the suitability of MatB for accessing the tertiary substituted fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA needed to produce flurithromycin and solithromycin has not yet been reported. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;guided engineering of a MatB homolog to optimize the production of fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, resulting in a variant with increased conversion and providing a platform to produce a suitable building block mixture for fluorinated macrolide production. Additionally, the mutant demonstrated broad utility for various substituted malonyl&#8208;CoAs. The MatB mutant sets the stage to access fluorinated macrolides by coupling it with altered PKS machinery to install fluorinated malonyl&#8208;CoA into macrolide scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>OsO2&#160;as the Contrast&#8208;Generating Chemical Species of Osmium&#8208;Stained Biological Tissues in Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron imaging of biological samples stained with heavy metals has enabled visualization of subcellular structures critical in chemical&#8208;, structural&#8208;, and neuro&#8208;biology. In particular, osmium tetroxide OsO4 has been widely adopted for selective lipid imaging. Despite the ubiquity of its use, the osmium speciation in lipid membranes and the process for contrast generation in electron microscopy (EM) have continued to be open questions, limiting efforts to improve staining protocols and therefore high&#8208;resolution nanoscale imaging of biological samples. Following our recent success using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) to image mouse brain tissues with synaptic resolution, we have used PEEM to determine the nanoscale electronic structure of Os&#8208;stained biological samples. Os(IV), in the form of OsO2, generates nanoaggregates in lipid membranes, leading to a strong spatial variation in the electronic structure and electron density of states. OsO2&#160;has a metallic electronic structure that drastically increases the electron density of states near the Fermi level. Depositing metallic OsO2 in lipid membranes allows for strongly enhanced EM signals and conductivity of biological materials. The identification of the chemical species and understanding of the membrane contrast mechanism of Os&#8208;stained biological specimens provides a new opportunity for the development of staining protocols for high&#8208;resolution, high&#8208;contrast EM imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Selection in Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Depolymerization of Bio&#8208;based Polyesters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic degradation of polymers holds promise for advancing towards a bio&#8208;based economy. However, bulky polymers presents challenges in accessibility for biocatalysts, hindering depolymerization reactions. Beyond the impact of crystallinity, polymer chains can reside in different conformations affecting binding efficiency to the enzyme. We previously showed that the gauche and trans chain conformers associated with crystalline and amorphous regions of the synthetic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) display different affinity to PETase, thus affecting the depolymerization rate. However, structural&#8208;function relationships for biopolymers remain poorly understood in biocatalysis. In this study, we explored biodegradation of by&#8208;us previously synthesized bio&#8208;polyesters made from a rigid bicyclic chiral terpene&#8208;based diol and copolymerized with various renewable diesters. Herein, four of those polyesters spanning from semi&#8208;aromatic to aliphatic were subjected to enzymatic degradations in concert with induced&#8208;fit docking (IFD) analyses. Our findings demonstrate the importance of conformational selection in enzymatic depolymerization of biopolymers. A straight or twisted conformation of the polymer chain is crucial in biocatalytic degradation by showing different affinities to enzyme ground&#8208;state conformers. This work highlights the importance of considering the conformational match between the polymer and the enzyme to optimize the biocatalytic degradation efficiency of biopolymers, providing valuable insights for the development of sustainable bioprocesses.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;electrocatalytic alkene reduction using ene&#8208;reductases with methyl viologen as electron mediator</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation of alkene moieties is important for the synthesis of chiral molecules, but achieving high stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Biocatalysis using ene&#8208;reductases (EReds) offers a viable solution. However, the need for NAD(P)H cofactors limits large&#8208;scale applications. Here, we explored an electrochemical alternative for recycling flavin&#8208;containing EReds using methyl viologen as a mediator. For this, we built a bio&#8208;electrocatalytic setup with an H&#8208;type glass reactor cell, proton exchange membrane, and carbon cloth electrode. Experimental results confirm the mediator's electrochemical reduction and enzymatic consumption. Optimization showed increased product concentration at longer reaction times with better reproducibility within 4&#8211;6 h. We tested two enzymes, Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase (PETNR) and the Thermostable Old Yellow Enzyme (TOYE), using different alkene substrates. TOYE showed higher productivity for the reduction of 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one (1.20 mM h&#8211;1), 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one (1.40 mM h&#8211;1) and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pentanal (0.40 mM h&#8211;1), with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 11% to 99%. PETNR outperformed TOYE in terms of enantioselectivity for the reduction of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pentanal (ee 59&#177;7% (S)). Notably, TOYE achieved promising results also in reducing ketoisophorone, a challenging substrate, with similar enantiomeric excess compared to published values using NADH.</dc:description>

         <title>The Post&#8208;Polyketide Synthase Modification Mechanism in Hitachimycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenase HitM4 and reductase HitM1 gene knockout strains of Streptomyces scabrisporus accumulate all&#8208;trans&#8208;pentaene macrolactam and 10&#8208;O&#8208;demethyl&#8208;10&#8208;oxohitachimycin, respectively. The pentaene macrolactam, an initial biosynthetic intermediate, is presumed to be converted to 10&#8208;O&#8208;demethyl&#8208;10&#8208;oxohitachimycin by four post&#8208;PKS enzymes in the post&#8208;PKS modification pathway. The reductase HitM1 reduces 10&#8208;O&#8208;demethyl&#8208;10&#8208;oxohitachimycin with NADPH, yielding 10&#8208;O&#8208;demethylhitachimycin, which is O&#8208;methylated by the methyltransferase HitM6, completing hitachimycin biosynthesis.

Hitachimycin is a bicyclic macrolactam antibiotic with (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine (&#946;&#8208;Phe) at the starter position of the polyketide skeleton. While the enzymes that recognize &#946;&#8208;amino acids, modify the aminoacyl groups, and transfer the resultant dipeptide groups to the acyl carrier protein domains of polyketide synthases (PKSs) have been studied extensively, the post&#8208;PKS modification mechanism responsible for constructing the unique bicyclic structure of hitachimycin remains elusive. In this study, we first inactivated six genes encoding putative post&#8208;PKS modification enzymes, namely hitM1 to hitM6, in Streptomyces scabrisporus to determine their involvement in hitachimycin biosynthesis. The &#916;hitM4 strain accumulated an all&#8208;trans&#8208;2,4,6,8,18&#8208;pentaene macrolactam, which was confirmed as a true intermediate in hitachimycin biosynthesis by cellular feeding experiments, and appears to be the initial intermediate in the post&#8208;PKS modification pathway. The &#916;hitM1 strain accumulated 10&#8208;O&#8208;demethyl&#8208;10&#8208;oxohitachimycin (M1&#8208;A). In enzymatic experiments, M1&#8208;A was reduced by the NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductase HitM1 in the presence of NADPH. The product of the reaction catalyzed by HitM1 was converted to hitachimycin by the methyltransferase HitM6. We thus propose a plausible post&#8208;PKS modification mechanism for the biosynthesis of hitachimycin.

&lt;p&gt;The dehydrogenase HitM4 and reductase HitM1 gene knockout strains of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces scabrisporus&lt;/i&gt; accumulate all-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-pentaene macrolactam and 10-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-demethyl-10-oxohitachimycin, respectively. The pentaene macrolactam, an initial biosynthetic intermediate, is presumed to be converted to 10-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-demethyl-10-oxohitachimycin by four post-PKS enzymes in the post-PKS modification pathway. The reductase HitM1 reduces 10-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-demethyl-10-oxohitachimycin with NADPH, yielding 10-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-demethylhitachimycin, which is &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylated by the methyltransferase HitM6, completing hitachimycin biosynthesis.

         <title>Chemical Diversity of Aspergillus alliaceus Phenotypes: Discovery of brominated bianthrones with activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Marine&#8208;derived fungi have emerged as a source for novel metabolites with a broad range of bioactivities. However, accessing the full potential of fungi under standard laboratory conditions remains challenging. LC&#8208;MS&#8208;based metabolomics in combination with varied culture conditions is a fast and powerful tool to detect new metabolites. Here, three developmental forms of the marine&#8208;derived fungus&#160;Aspergillus alliaceus&#160;were analyzed and 14 fungal metabolites, including new brominated polyketides (11&#8208;14) were isolated.&#160;Structure elucidation relied mainly on 1D and 2D NMR techniques and was supported by low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and DFT&#8208;based computations. We sequenced the&#160;A. alliaceus&#160;genome, identified the bianthrone&#8208;producing biosynthetic gene cluster, and conducted expression analysis on genes involved in sexual development and biosynthesis. The&#160;NCI&#8208;60 cell line panel revealed selective&#160;in vitro&#160;activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) for the halogenated allianthrones and their full anti&#8208;proliferative and cytotoxic effects were evaluated in five&#160;TNBC&#160;cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of RNA Modified with Thioamide Internucleoside Linkage</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioamide internucleoside linkages were well tolerated as a single substitution in a guide strand of short interfering RNA and increased the specificity of target mRNA cleavage similar to their amide counterparts. Because of different hydrogen bonding and conformational properties compared to amides or phosphates, thioamides are promising RNA modifications and useful chemical biology tools for modulation of RNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Recent success of RNA therapeutics has reinvigorated interest in chemical modifications of RNA. As exemplified by the phosphorothioates, modifications of sugar&#8208;phosphate backbone have been remarkably impactful but relatively underexplored in therapeutic RNAs. The present study reports synthesis, thermal stability, and RNA interference activity of RNAs modified with thioamide linkages. Compared to the previously studied amide&#8208;modified RNA, thioamide linkages strongly destabilized a short self&#8208;complementary RNA model duplex. However, in short interfering RNAs amides and thioamides had a similar effect on duplex stability and target RNA cleavage activity and specificity. Hence, the thioamide may be added to the toolbox of chemical biologist as a useful backbone modification well tolerated by the RNA interference machinery.

         <title>Hemicyanine&#8208;Based Highly Water&#8208;Soluble Probe for Extracellular Nitroreductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitro hemicyanine derivative, HCyS&#8208;NO2, was reported here as a turn&#8208;on fluorescent sensor. HCyS&#8208;NO2 showed negligible fluorescence, due to the quenching effect caused by intramolecular electron transfer (IET). Upon reduction by nitroreductase, a strong fluorescent signal restored. HCyS&#8208;NO2 was selectively reduced by nitroreductase, and not permeable into bacteria, which made it a useful tool to study the extracellular reduction processes.







Abstract
Nitroreductase (NTR) has long been a target of interest for its important role involved in the nitro compounds metabolism. Various probes have been reported for NTR analysis, but rarely able to distinguish the extracellular NTR from intracellular ones. Herein we reported a new NTR sensor, HCyS&#8208;NO2, which was a hemicyanine molecule with one nitro and two sulfo groups attached. The nitro group acted as the reporting group to respond NTR reduction. Direct linkage of nitro group into the hemicyanine &#960; conjugate system facilitated the intramolecular electron transfer (IET) process and thus quenched the fluorescence of hemicyanine core. Upon reduction with NTR, the nitro group was rapidly converted into the hydroxylamino and then the amino group, eliminating IET process and thus restoring the fluorescence. The sulfo groups installed significantly increased the hydrophilicity of the molecule, and introduced negative charges at physiological pH, preventing the diffusion into bacteria. Both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive bacteria were able to turn on the fluorescence of HCyS&#8208;NO2, without detectable diffusion into cells, providing a useful tool to probe the extracellular reduction process.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Photocaged Proteinogenic and Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged amino acids could be genetically encoded into proteins via genetic code expansion and constitute unique tools for innovative protein engineering. Herein, we would like to summarize the efforts in encoding photocaged proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, hoping to draw more attention to this fruitful and exciting scientific campaign.







Abstract
Photocaged amino acids could be genetically encoded into proteins via genetic code expansion (GCE) and constitute unique tools for innovative protein engineering. There are a number of photocaged proteinogenic amino acids that allow strategic conversion of proteins into their photocaged variants, thus enabling spatiotemporal and non&#8208;invasive regulation of protein functions using light. Meanwhile, there are a hand of photocaged non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids that address the challenges in directly encoding certain non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that structurally resemble proteinogenic ones or possess highly reactive functional groups. Herein, we would like to summarize the efforts in encoding photocaged proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, hoping to draw more attention to this fruitful and exciting scientific campaign.

         <title>Imidazoles are Tunable Nucleofuges for Developing Tyrosine&#8208;Reactive Electrophiles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we developed a series of sulfonyl&#8208;azole (SufAz) probes to investigate chemical reactivity and applications for chemical proteomics. Our studies identified aryl sulfonyl imidazoles as a tempered electrophile that could be tuned, by substitutions at the 4&#8208;position of the imidazole nucleofuge, for developing targeted covalent inhibitors with enhanced stability and selectivity.







Abstract
Imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonyl and &#8208;sulfonate (imidazylate) are widely used in synthetic chemistry as nucleofuges for diazotransfer, nucleophilic substitution, and cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The utility of these reagents for protein bioconjugation, in contrast, have not been comprehensively explored and important considering the prevalence of imidazoles in biomolecules and drugs. Here, we synthesized a series of alkyne&#8208;modified sulfonyl&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;imidazole probes to investigate the utility of this electrophile for protein binding. Alkylation of the distal nitrogen activated the nucleofuge capability of the imidazole to produce sulfonyl&#8208;imidazolium electrophiles that were highly reactive but unstable for biological applications. In contrast, arylsulfonyl imidazoles functioned as a tempered electrophile for assessing ligandability of select tyrosine and lysine sites in cell proteomes and when mated to a recognition element could produce targeted covalent inhibitors with reduced off&#8208;target activity. In summary, imidazole nucleofuges show balanced stability and tunability to produce sulfone&#8208;based electrophiles that bind functional tyrosine and lysine sites in the proteome.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we developed a series of sulfonyl-azole (SufAz) probes to investigate chemical reactivity and applications for chemical proteomics. Our studies identified aryl sulfonyl imidazoles as a tempered electrophile that could be tuned, by substitutions at the 4-position of the imidazole nucleofuge, for developing targeted covalent inhibitors with enhanced stability and selectivity.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Binding Oligonucleotide Backbone Modifications for Targeting a DNA&#8208;Processing Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of chemically&#8208;modified oligonucleotides for targeting the DNA repair nuclease SNM1A have been designed and synthesised. Each oligonucleotide contains a modified internucleotide linkage designed to both mimic the native phosphodiester backbone and chelate to the catalytic zinc ion(s) in the SNM1A active site. Dinucleoside phosphoramidites containing urea, squaramide, sulfanylacetamide, and sulfinylacetamide linkages were prepared and employed successfully in solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. All the modified oligonucleotides were found to interact with SNM1A in a gel electrophoresis&#8208;based assay, demonstrating the first examples of inhibition of DNA damage repair enzymes for many of these groups in oligonucleotides. One strand containing a sulfinylacetamide&#8208;linkage was found to have the strongest interaction with SNM1A and was further tested in a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay. This allowed an IC50 value of 231 nM to be determined, significantly lower than previously reported substrate&#8208;mimics targeting this enzyme. It is expected that these modified oligonucleotides will serve as a scaffold for the future development of fluorescent or biotin&#8208;labelled probes for the in vivo study of DNA repair processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Consequences of NEDD8 Acetylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Similar to ubiquitin, the ubiquitin&#8208;like protein NEDD8 is not only conjugated to other proteins but is itself subject to posttranslational modifications including lysine acetylation. Yet, compared to ubiquitin, only little is known about the biochemical and structural consequences of site&#8208;specific NEDD8 acetylation. Here, we generated site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;acetylated NEDD8 variants for each known acetylation site by genetic code expansion. We show that, in particular, acetylation of K11 has a negative impact on the usage of NEDD8 by the NEDD8&#8208;conjugating enzymes UBE2M and UBE2F and that this is likely due to electrostatic and steric effects resulting in conformational changes of NEDD8. Finally, we provide evidence that p300 acts as a position&#8208;specific NEDD8 acetyltransferase.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Modification of Daptomycin: Aromatic Group Installation on Trp1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Daptomycin is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus au&#8208;reus (MRSA) and vancomycin&#8208;resistant enterococci (VRE). The emergence of daptomycin&#8208;resistant bacterial strains has renewed interest in generating daptomycin analogs. Previous studies have shown that replacing the tryptophan of daptomycin with aromatic groups can generate analogs with enhanced potency. Additionally, we have demonstrated that aromatic prenyltransferases can attach diverse groups to the tryptophan of daptomycin. Here, we report the use of the prenyltransferase CdpNPT to derivatize the tryptophan of daptomycin with a library of benzylic and heterocyclic pyrophosphates. An analytical&#8208;scale study revealed that CdpNPT can transfer various aromatic groups onto daptomycin. Subsequent scaled&#8208;up and purified reactions indicated that the enzyme can attach aromatic groups to N1, C2, C5 and C6 positions of Trp1 of daptomycin. In vitro antibacterial activity assays using six of these purified compounds identified aromatic substituted daptomycin analogs show potency against both daptomycin&#8208;susceptible and resistant strains of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. These findings suggest that installing aromatic groups on the Trp1 of daptomycin can lead to the generation of potent daptomycin analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Changes in ROS/RNS Levels in Endothelial Cells in Experimental Bacteremia</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;precision system was developed for the quantification of biological analytes in single cells (reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS)) based on the electrochemical amperometric method. The efficacy of this system was evaluated using an experimental bacteremia model. Endothelial cells exhibited increased ROS/RNS production when stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus. However, they remained inactive when exposed to either unprimed or primed neutrophils that had been pre&#8208;incubated with bacteria. It is noteworthy that the sequential stimulation of endothelial cells with bacteria followed by neutrophils resulted in a significant increase in the ROS/RNS level, which demonstrated a correlation with the number of neutrophils in contact with the endothelial cells. These results highlight the potential of our system to quantitatively assess ROS/RNS dynamics in complex biological systems. They also offer insights into the interplay between various cellular components in experimental bacteremia.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid screening of infected individuals plays an essential role in viral pandemics. This review highlights the recent progress, application, and prospect of DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based virus detection platforms, with the goal of offering insights and inspiration for the development of innovative virus detection methods to deal with potential large&#8208;scale outbreaks of infectious diseases in the future.







Abstract
Several major viral pandemics in history have significantly impacted the public health of human beings. The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has further underscored the critical need for early detection and screening of infected individuals. However, current detection techniques are confronted with deficiencies in sensitivity and accuracy, restricting the capability of detecting trace amounts of viruses in human bodies and in the environments. The advent of DNA nanotechnology has opened up a feasible solution for rapid and sensitive virus determination. By harnessing the designability and addressability of DNA nanostructures, a range of rapid virus sensing platforms have been proposed. This review overviewed the recent progress, application, and prospect of DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based rapid virus detection platforms. Furthermore, the challenges and developmental prospects in this field were discussed.

         <title>Sunflower Pollen&#8208;Derived Microspheres Selectively Absorb DNA for microRNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microsphere (HSEC) with hierarchical structures is developed to selectively absorb polyC and polyA single&#8208;stranded DNA with high efficiency and affinity, particularly in the presence of Ca2+ and under neutral and acidic conditions. The absorption mechanism involves electrostatic and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, highlighting the potential of HSECs for diverse biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.







Abstract
Herein, we report the finding that a naturally sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microspheres (HSECs) with hierarchical structures can selectively absorb polyC and polyA with high efficiency and affinity. HSECs exhibit the capability to selectively absorb polyC and polyA ssDNA under neutral and acidic conditions. It has been observed that the presence of metal cations, specifically Ca2+, enhances the absorption efficiency of HSECs. Mechanically, this absorption phenomenon can be attributed to both electrostatic interactions and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such an appealing property enables the functionalization of HSECs for broad potential biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the finding that a naturally sunflower pollen-derived microspheres (HSECs) with hierarchical structures can selectively absorb polyC and polyA with high efficiency and affinity. HSECs exhibit the capability to selectively absorb polyC and polyA ssDNA under neutral and acidic conditions. It has been observed that the presence of metal cations, specifically Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, enhances the absorption efficiency of HSECs. Mechanically, this absorption phenomenon can be attributed to both electrostatic interactions and cation-&#960; interactions. Such an appealing property enables the functionalization of HSECs for broad potential biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of Orthosteric and Allosteric Pharmacological Chaperones for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modeled substrate interactions in NAGLU&#8242;s active site and predicted allosteric sites. Virtual screening against a human&#8208;tested molecule database identified potential pharmacological chaperones (PCs). In vitro evaluations confirmed their binding to NAGLU and ability to restore enzymatic activity in MPS IIIB fibroblasts with mutant enzymes.







Abstract
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB) is an autosomal inherited disease caused by mutations in gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme N&#8722;acetyl&#8208;alpha&#8208;glucosaminidase (NAGLU). These mutations result in reduced NAGLU activity, preventing it from catalyzing the hydrolysis of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). There are currently no approved treatments for MPS IIIB. A novel approach in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases is the use of pharmacological chaperones (PC). In this study, we used a drug repurposing approach to identify and characterize novel potential PCs for NAGLU enzyme. We modeled the interaction of natural and artificial substrates within the active cavity of NAGLU (orthosteric site) and predicted potential allosteric sites. We performed a virtual screening for both the orthosteric and the predicted allosteric site against a curated database of human tested molecules. Considering the binding affinity and predicted blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability and gastrointestinal absorption, we selected atovaquone and piperaquine as orthosteric and allosteric PCs. The PCs were evaluated by their capacity to bind NAGLU and the ability to restore the enzymatic activity in human MPS IIIB fibroblasts These results represent novel PCs described for MPS IIIB and demonstrate the potential to develop novel therapeutic alternatives for this and other protein deficiency diseases

         <title>Exploration of Rhenium Bisquinoline Tricarbonyl Complexes for their Antibacterial Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores the antimicrobial properties of eight newly synthesized rhenium tricarbonyl bisquinoline derivatives. Their biological properties are explored in detail with most compounds showing strong antibacterial properties but also cytotoxicity. In mode of action studies, in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, a distinct pore&#8208;forming effect on the bacterial membrane is observed.







Abstract
Metal complexes have emerged as a promising source for novel classes of antibacterial agents to combat the rise of antimicrobial resistance around the world. In the exploration of the transition metal chemical space for novel metalloantibiotics, the rhenium tricarbonyl moiety has been identified as a promising scaffold. Here we have prepared eight novel rhenium bisquinoline tricarbonyl complexes and explored their antibacterial properties. Significant activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria was observed. However, all complexes also showed significant toxicity against human cells, putting into question the prospects of this specific rhenium compound class as metalloantibiotics. To better understand their biological effects, we conduct the first mode of action studies on rhenium bisquinoline complexes and show that they are able to form pores through bacterial membranes. Their straight&#8208;forward synthesis and tuneability suggests that further optimisation of this compound class could lead to compounds with enhanced bacterial specificity.

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided drug design targeting Abl kinase: how structure and regulation can assist in designing new drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human protein Abelson kinase (Abl), a tyrosine kinase, plays a pivotal role in developing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Abl's involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its significance in regulating fundamental biological processes, including DNA damage responses, actin polymerization, and chromatin structural changes. The discovery of the Bcr&#8208;Abl oncoprotein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation in CML patients, revolutionized the understanding and treatment of the disease. The introduction of targeted therapies, starting with interferon&#8208;alpha and culminating in the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib, significantly improved patient outcomes. However, challenges such as drug resistance and side effects persist, indicating the necessity of research into novel therapeutic strategies. This review describes advancements in Abl kinase inhibitor development, emphasizing rational compound design from structural and regulatory information. Strategies, including bivalent inhibitors, PROTACs, and compounds targeting regulatory domains, promise to overcome resistance and minimize side effects. Additionally, leveraging the intricate structure and interactions of Bcr&#8208;Abl may provide insights into developing inhibitors for other kinases. Overall, this review highlights the importance of continued research into Abl kinase inhibition and its broader implications for therapeutic interventions targeting kinase&#8208;driven diseases. It provides valuable insights and strategies that may guide the development of next&#8208;generation therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Mushroom Tyrosinase: Six Isoenzymes Catalyzing Distinct Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus var. bisporus) possesses six tyrosinases (AbPPO1&#8208;6). While all isoenzymes are tyrosinases, their substrate specificity is very different. &#947;&#8208;l&#8208;glutaminyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzene, an important natural phenolic compound of A. bisporus, is the natural substrate of AbPPO4, but is not accepted by AbPPO3. This result pinpoints ambiguity in the definition of isoenzymes and calls for a refinement of the term.







Abstract
&#8220;Mushroom tyrosinase&#8221; from the common button mushroom is the most frequently used source of tyrosinase activity, both for basic and applied research. Here, the complete tyrosinase family from Agaricus bisporus var. bisporus (abPPO1&#8208;6) was cloned from mRNA and expressed heterologously using a single protocol. All six isoenzymes accept a wide range of phenolic and catecholic substrates, but display pronounced differences in their specificity and enzymatic reaction rate. AbPPO3 ignores &#947;&#8208;l&#8208;glutaminyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzene (GHB), a natural phenol present in mM concentrations in A. bisporus, while AbPPO4 processes 100&#8197;&#956;M GHB at 4&#8208;times the rate of the catechol l&#8208;DOPA. All six AbPPOs are biochemically distinct enzymes fit for different roles in the fungal life cycle, which challenges the traditional concept of isoenzymes as catalyzing the same physiological reaction and varying only in secondary properties. Transferring this approach to other enzymes and organisms will greatly stimulate both the study of the in&#8197;vivo function(s) of enzymes and the application of these highly efficient catalysts.

         <title>Amodiaquine Nonspecifically Binds Double Stranded and Three&#8208;Way Junction DNA Structures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of amodiaquine, mefloquine, chloroquine and quinine to different DNA structures was studied using isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Amodiaquine tightly binds to all DNA structures studied while other ligands are more selective in which DNA structures they bind. Trends in calculated binding free energy versus the experimental results of amodiaquine binding a DNA dodecamer match.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;aminoquinoline class of compounds includes the important antimalarial compounds amodiaquine and chloroquine. Despite their medicinal importance, the mode of action of these compounds is poorly understood. In a previous study we observed these compounds, as well as quinine and mefloquine, tightly bind the DNA cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer. Here, we further explore the range of nucleic acid structures bound by these compounds. To gauge a wide range of binding affinities, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to explore high affinity binding (nM to tens of &#956;M) and NMR spectroscopy to assay weak binding biding in the hundreds of micromolar range. We find that amodiaquine tightly binds all double stranded DNA structures explored. Mefloquine binds double stranded DNA duplex molecules tightly and weakly associates with a three&#8208;way junction DNA construct. Quinine and chloroquine only weakly bind duplex DNA but do not tightly bind any of the DNA constructs explored. A simulation of the free energy of binding of these ligands to the Dickerson&#8208;Drew dodecamer resulted in an excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental free energy. These results provide new insight into the DNA binding of clinically important antimalarial compounds and may play a role in future development of new antimalarials.

We find that amodiaquine tightly binds all double stranded DNA structures explored. Mefloquine binds double stranded DNA duplex molecules tightly and weakly associates with a three-way junction DNA construct. Quinine and chloroquine only weakly bind duplex DNA but do not tightly bind any of the DNA constructs explored. A simulation of the free energy of binding of these ligands to the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer resulted in an excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental free energy. These results provide new insight into the DNA binding of clinically important antimalarial compounds and may play a role in future development of new antimalarials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Quantitative Method to Distinguish Cytosolic from Endosome&#8208;Trapped Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence protocol to determine the quantity of a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide internalized at 37&#8201;&#176;C either by direct translocation across the cell membrane or endocytosis. The protocol can be used with any cell type and only requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides. Its application to tetra&#8208; and hexaarginines highlights their difference of internalization.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are known to penetrate cells through endocytosis and translocation. The two pathways are hardly distinguished in current cell assays. We developed a reliable, simple and robust method to distinguish and quantify independently the two routes. The assay requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides. When the labeled peptide is intact, the fluorescence signal is weak thanks to the dark quenching property of DABCYL. A 10&#8208;fold higher fluorescence signal is measured when the labeled peptide is degraded. By referring to a standard fluorescent curve according to the concentration of the hydrolyzed peptide, we have access to the internalized peptide quantity. Therefore, cell lysis after internalization permits to determine the total quantity of intracellular peptide. The molecular state of the internalized peptide (intact or degraded), depends on its location in cells (cytosol vs endo&#8208;lysosomes), and can be blocked by boiling cells. This boiling step results indeed in denaturation and inhibition of the cellular enzymes. The advantage of this method is the possibility to quantify translocation at 37&#8201;&#176;C and to compare it to the 4&#8201;&#176;C condition, where all endocytosis processes are inhibited. We found that ranking of the translocation efficacy is DABCYL&#8208;R6&#8208;(&#1013;CF)K&#8811;DABCYL&#8208;R4&#8208;(&#1013;CF)K&#8805;CF&#8208;R9.

         <title>A Highly Sensitive and Selective Fluorescent Sensor for Folic Acid Detection Based on D&#8208;penicillamine Stabilized Ag/Cu Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a sensor was developed for detecting folic acid (FA) using D&#8208;penicillamine stabilized Ag/Cu alloy nanoclusters (DPA@Ag/Cu NCs). Experimental results demonstrated a linear relationship between FA concentrations and fluorescence quenching of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs, with a low detection limit of 5.3&#8197;nM, based on the fluorescence quenching mechanism caused by electron transfer. Moreover, this approach was successfully applied to FA in complex biological samples.







Abstract
In this work, a highly sensitive and selective method for detecting folic acid (FA) was developed using D&#8208;penicillamine (DPA) stabilized Ag/Cu alloy nanoclusters (DPA@Ag/Cu NCs). The yellow emission of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs was found to be quenched upon the addition of FA to the system. The fluorescence intensity quenching value demonstrated a linear relationship with FA concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1200&#8197;&#956;M, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.3&#8197;nM. Furthermore, the detection mechanism was investigated through various characterization analyses, including high resolution transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence spectra, ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectra, and fluorescence lifetime. The results indicated that the fluorescence quenching induced by FA was a result of electron transfer from FA to the ligands of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs. The selectivity of the FA sensor was also evaluated, showing that common amino acids and inorganic ions had minimal impact on the detection of FA. Moreover, the standard addition method was successfully applied to detect FA in human serum, chewable tablets and FA tablets with promising results. The use of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs demonstrates significant potential for detecting FA in complex biological samples.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Guided Redesign of an Omega&#8208;Transaminase from Bacillus megaterium for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#969;&#8208;TA from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTA) is selected for engineering to catalyze the synthesis of (S)&#8208;methoxyisopropylamine from methoxyacetone. An engineered &#969;&#8208;TA (2M) with improvement of solubility, activity and thermostability is obtained through multiple sequence alignment. Furthermore, Molecule Dynamics simulation explains the mechanisms of its improved properties. 2M is also found to be more advantageous in catalyzing various ketones.







Abstract
&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) are attractive biocatalysts asymmetrically catalyzing ketones to chiral amines. However, poor non&#8208;native catalytic activity and substrate promiscuity severely hamper its wide application in industrial production. Protein engineering efforts have generally focused on reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pockets of &#969;&#8208;TAs. However, hotspots around the substrate tunnel as well as distant sites outside the pockets may also affect its activity. In this study, the &#969;&#8208;TA from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTA) was selected for engineering. The tunnel mutation Y164F synergy with distant mutation A245T which was acquired through a multiple sequence alignment showed improved soluble expression, a 3.7&#8208;fold higher specific activity and a 19.9&#8208;fold longer half&#8208;life at 45&#8201;&#176;C. Molecule Dynamics simulation explains the mechanism of improved catalytic activity, enhanced thermostability and improved soluble expression of BmeTAY164F/A245T(2&#8197;M). Finally, the resting cells of 2&#8197;M were used for biocatalytic processes. 450&#8197;mM of S&#8208;methoxyisopropylamine (S&#8208;MOIPA) was obtained with an ee value of 97.3&#8201;% and a conversion rate of 90&#8201;%, laying the foundation for its industrial production. Mutant 2&#8197;M was also found to be more advantageous in catalyzing the transamination of various ketones. These results demonstrated that sites that are far away from the active center also play an important role in the redesign of &#969;&#8208;TAs.

         <title>Kinetic Characterization and Identification of Key Active Site Residues of the L&#8208;Aspartate N&#8208;Hydroxylase, CreE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work characterizes the catalytic mechanism of the multiple oxidizing flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase, CreE, using steady&#8208;state and rapid&#8208;reaction kinetic approaches. Analysis of the active site revealed residues that are involved in binding L&#8208;aspartate and are conserved in related enzymes, providing the crucial foundation for enzyme engineering efforts for biomedical and synthetic applications.







Abstract
CreE is a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase (FMO) that catalyzes three sequential nitrogen oxidation reactions of L&#8208;aspartate to produce nitrosuccinate, contributing to the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial and antiproliferative nautral product, cremeomycin. This compound contains a highly reactive diazo functional group for which the reaction of CreE is essential to its formation. Nitro and diazo functional groups can serve as potent electrophiles, important in some challenging nucleophilic addition reactions. Formation of these reactive groups positions CreE as a promising candidate for biomedical and synthetic applications. Here, we present the catalytic mechanism of CreE and the identification of active site residues critical to binding L&#8208;aspartate, aiding in future enzyme engineering efforts. Steady&#8208;state analysis demonstrated that CreE is very specific for NADPH over NADH and performs a highly coupled reaction with L&#8208;aspartate. Analysis of the rapid&#8208;reaction kinetics showed that flavin reduction is very fast, along with the formation of the oxygenating species, the C4a&#8722;hydroperoxyflavin. The slowest step observed was the dehydration of the flavin. Structural analysis and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis implicated T65, R291, and R440 in the binding L&#8208;aspartate. The data presented describes the catalytic mechanism and the active site architecture of this unique FMO.

Analysis of the rapid-reaction kinetics showed that flavin reduction is very fast, along with the formation of the oxygenating species, the C4a&#8722;hydroperoxyflavin. The slowest step observed was the dehydration of the flavin. Structural analysis and site-directed mutagenesis implicated T65, R291, and R440 in the binding L-aspartate. The data presented describes the catalytic mechanism and the active site architecture of this unique FMO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Photoexcited 2&#8208;Chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Dinitrobenzoic Acid as a Chemical Deprenylase of i6A RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the efficient application of nitroaromatics in the chemical field, we have developed a novel reaction achieving direct deisopentenylation of i6A at the nucleotide level under blue light irradiation with high specific selectively and reaction efficiency. This method provided a photo&#8208;controlled intervention mode for the degradation of i6A. RNA modifications regulate gene expression and cellular homeostasis. Targeting RNA&#8208;modifying enzymes is a promising therapeutic strategy but faces challenges like unidentified enzymes and compensatory mechanisms. Chemical approaches offer alternatives. We have identified 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzoic acid as an effective photochemical deprenylase of i6A RNA, converting it to natural adenine, advancing RNA modification biology and therapeutic development.







Abstract
RNA modifications play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular homeostasis. Modulating RNA modifications, particularly by targeting the enzymes responsible for their catalysis, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. However, limitations, such as the lack of identified modifying enzymes and compensatory mechanisms, hinder targeted interventions. Chemical approaches independent of enzymatic activity offer an alternative strategy for RNA modification modulation. Here, we present the identification of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzoic acid as a highly effective photochemical deprenylase of i6A RNA. This method demonstrates exceptional selectivity towards i6A, converting its substituent into a &#8220;N&#8208;doped&#8221; ozonide, which upon hydrolysis releases natural adenine. We believe that this chemical approach will pave the way for a better understanding of RNA modification biology and the development of novel therapeutic modalities.

Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides can enter into cells through endocytosis and direct translocation at the plasma membrane. In article 10.1002/cbic.202400198, Sandrine Sagan and co&#8208;workers develop a simple and robust method to distinguish and quantify independently the two routes at 37&#176;C. The assay requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides and relies on the intracellular protease activity and location.

         <title>14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions: From Mechanistic Understanding to Their Small&#8208;Molecule Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 14, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular glues that stabilize the interaction of the phosphorylation reader protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with individual client proteins present a huge opportunity for therapeutic intervention in a wide array of human diseases. Among the vast array of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 clients are disease&#8208;related proteins like LRRK2, Tau, p53, C&#8208;Raf, CFTR, Pyrin, PLN, and ChREBP, where a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 molecular glue promises a therapeutic benefit for patients.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are of utmost importance for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Herein, a central role can be found for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins. These hub&#8208;proteins are known to bind hundreds of interaction partners, thereby regulating their activity, localization, and/or stabilization. Due to their ability to bind a large variety of client proteins, studies of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes flourished over the last decades, aiming to gain greater molecular understanding of these complexes and their role in health and disease. Because of their crucial role within the cell, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes are recognized as highly interesting therapeutic targets, encouraging the discovery of small molecule modulators of these PPIs. We discuss various examples of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated regulation of its binding partners on a mechanistic level, highlighting the versatile and multi&#8208;functional role of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 within the cell. Furthermore, an overview is given on the development of stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes, from initially used natural products to fragment&#8208;based approaches. These studies show the potential of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilizers as novel agents in drug discovery and as tool compounds to gain greater molecular understanding of the role of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;based protein regulation.

         <title>Comparative Study of&#160;ImmobilizedBiolipasa&#8208;R&#160;for Second Generation Biodiesel Production from an Acid Oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The primary objective of this work is to develop a sustainable biocatalytic transesterification process for low&#8208;grade oils, aligning with EU green technology requirements for the shift to second generation biodiesel. Thus, we investigated the immobilization and subsequent application of the lipase Biolipasa&#8208;R on transesterification processes to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from both a sunflower oil and an acid oil which is a bioproduct of the biodiesel industry. The lipase was immobilized on biomaterials, such as diatomaceous earth, with a yield of 60%, and commercial carriers such as methacrylic resins with a yield of 100%. The enzyme demonstrated superior activity when immobilized on diatomaceous earth, particularly in reactions involving the acid oil, outperforming the benchmark enzyme Novozym&#174; 435 (95.1% and 35% conversion respectively). This work highlights the potential of Biolipasa&#8208;R as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient biocatalyst for biodiesel production and emphasizes the environmental benefits of utilizing industrial byproducts and eco&#8208;friendly immobilization techniques. The findings suggest that Biolipasa&#8208;R is a promising candidate for industrial applications in biodiesel production, offering a sustainable solution for waste management and energy generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Multiply Guaranteed DNA Sensors for Biological Sensing and Bioimaging Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the most recent progress of multiply guaranteed DNA sensors, which have attracted increasing attention for biological sensing and bioimaging applications due to their improvement in accuracy via dual signal output and endogenous regulation.







Abstract
Nucleic acids exhibit exceptional functionalities for both molecular recognition and catalysis, along with the capability of predictable assembly through strand displacement reactions. The inherent programmability and addressability of DNA probes enable their precise, on&#8208;demand assembly and accurate execution of hybridization, significantly enhancing target detection capabilities. Decades of research in DNA nanotechnology have led to advances in the structural design of functional DNA probes, resulting in increasingly sensitive and robust DNA sensors. Moreover, increasing attention has been devoted to enhancing the accuracy and sensitivity of DNA&#8208;based biosensors by integrating multiple sensing procedures. In this review, we summarize various strategies aimed at enhancing the accuracy of DNA sensors. These strategies involve multiple guarantee procedures, utilizing dual signal output mechanisms, and implementing sequential regulation methods. Our goal is to provide new insights into the development of more accurate DNA sensors, ultimately facilitating their widespread application in clinical diagnostics and assessment.

         <title>Development of Putative Bivalent Dicovalent Ligands for the Adenosine A1 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bivalent dicovalent compounds for the adenosine A1 receptor. We developed a series of bivalent compounds whereby each side contains the same ligand and covalent warhead. We show these compounds could be interacting across the adenosine A1 homodimer and have improved adenosine receptor subtype selectivity compared to the single covalent ligand counterpart.







Abstract
Accumulating evidence suggests that G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) can exist and function in homodimer and heterodimer forms. The adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) has been shown to form both homodimers and heterodimers, but there is a lack of chemical tools to study these dimeric receptor populations. This work describes the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a novel class of bivalent GPCR chemical tools, where each ligand moiety of the bivalent compound contains a sulfonyl fluoride covalent warhead designed to be capable of simultaneously reacting with each A1R of an A1R homodimer. The novel compounds were characterised using radioligand binding assays, including washout assays, and functionally in cAMP assays. The bivalent dicovalent compounds were competitive A1R antagonists and showed evidence of covalent binding and simultaneous binding across an A1R homodimer. Greater selectivity for A1R over the adenosine A3 receptor was observed for bivalent dicovalent over the equivalent monovalent compounds, indicating subtype selectivity can be achieved with dual occupation by a bivalent dicovalent ligand.

         <title>Construction of Multi&#8208;Enzyme Integrated Catalysts for Deracemization of Cyclic Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and versatile strategy for fabricating amphiphilic core&#8208;shell structured nanocatalysts for highly improved chemoenzymatic deracemization of chiral cyclic amines.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzyme cascade catalysis has become an important technique for chemical reactions used in manufacturing and scientific study. In this research, we designed a four&#8208;enzyme integrated catalyst and used it to catalyse the deracemization reaction of cyclic chiral amines, where monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyses the enantioselective oxidation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline (MTQ), imine reductase (IRED) catalyses the stereo selective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (MDQ), formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is used for the cyclic regeneration of cofactors, and catalase (CAT) is used for decomposition of oxidative reactions. The four enzymes were immobilized via polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;encapsulated dendritic organosilica nanoparticles (DONs) as carriers, resulting in the amphiphilic core&#8208;shell catalysts. The hydrophilic PDA shell ensures the dispersion of the catalyst in water, and the hydrophobic DON core creates a microenvironment with the spatial confinement effect of the organic substrate and the preconcentration effect to enhance the stability of the enzymes and the catalytic efficiency. The core&#8208;shell structure improves the stability and reusability of the catalyst and rationally arranges the position of different enzymes according to the reaction sequence to improve the cascade catalytic performance and cofactor recovery efficiency.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental control principle of enzyme nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly technology, along with the application schematic diagram in gene detection, protein detection, metal ion detection, and cancer cell therapy. Various types of triggers can activate specific enzymes to achieve programmable self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles, thereby producing detectable optical or electrical signals, or releasing drugs.







Abstract
Nanoparticles are a hot topic in the field of nanomaterial research due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. In recent years, DNA&#8208;directed nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly technology has been widely applied to the development of numerous complex nanoparticle superstructures. Due to the inherent stability and surface electric repulsion of nanoparticles, it is difficult to make nanoparticle superstructures respond to molecular signals in the external environment. In fact, enzyme&#8208;programmed molecular systems are developed to allow diverse functions, including logical operations, signal amplification, and dynamic assembly control. Therefore, combining enzyme&#8208;controlled DNA systems may endow nanoparticle assembly systems with more flexibility in program design, allowing them to respond to a variety of external signals. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of enzyme&#8208;controlled DNA/nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and introduce its applications in heavy metal detection, gene expression, proteins inside living cells, cancer cell therapy, and drug delivery. With the continuous development of new nanoparticle materials and the increasing functionality of enzyme DNA circuits, enzyme&#8208;directed DNA/nanoparticle self&#8208;assembled probe technology is expected to see significant future development.

         <title>Harnessing External Irradiation for Precise Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Agents in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External irradiation&#8208;activated metal&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer agents provide precise temporal and spatial controllability, enabling selective drug activation within tumor tissues to minimize adverse effects. In this review, we summarize diverse anti&#8208;cancer treatments facilitated by metal&#8208;based agents in response to external irradiations such as near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, ultrasound (US), and X&#8208;ray, and offer some prospects and insights into these therapeutic approaches.







Abstract
Cancer is a significant global health issue. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, are crucial in clinical anti&#8208;cancer treatment. However, these drugs have limitations such as drug resistance, non&#8208;specific distribution, and irreversible toxic and side effects. In recent years, the development of metal&#8208;based agents has led to the discovery of other anti&#8208;cancer effects beyond chemotherapy. Precise spatiotemporal controlled external irradiation can activate metal&#8208;based agents at specific sites and play a different role from traditional chemotherapy. These strategies can not only enhance the anti&#8208;cancer efficiency, but also show fewer side effects and non&#8208;cross&#8208;drug resistance, which are ideal approaches to solve the problems caused by traditional platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy drugs. In this review, we focus on various metal&#8208;based agent&#8208;mediated cancer therapies that are activated by three types of external irradiation: near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, ultrasound (US), and X&#8208;ray, and give some prospects. We hope that this review will promote the generation of new kinds of metal&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer agents.

In recent years, the development of metal-based agents has led to the discovery of other anti-cancer effects beyond chemotherapy. Precise spatiotemporal controlled external irradiation can activate metal-based agents at specific sites and play a different role from traditional chemotherapy. These strategies can not only enhance the anti-cancer efficiency, but also show fewer side effects and non-cross-drug resistance, which are ideal approaches to solve the problems caused by traditional platinum-based chemotherapy drugs. In this review, we focus on various metal-based agent-mediated cancer therapies that are activated by three types of external irradiation: near-infrared (NIR) light, ultrasound (US), and X-ray, and give some prospects. We hope that this review will promote the generation of new kinds of metal-based anti-cancer agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In vitro Selection and Characterization of a Light&#8208;up DNA Aptamer for Thiazole Orange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new DNA aptamer that binds to the target Thiazole Orange&#8208;biotin (TO1&#8208;biotin) was isolated after nine rounds of in vitro selection. The selection was performed on streptavidin&#8208;coated beads with the target bound to the surface and with free dye in solution in higher selection rounds to select for slower off&#8208;rate binding. Using next&#8208;generation sequencing (NGS), the libraries after the 4th and 9th rounds of selection were sequenced to identify enriched sequences. Several sequence families emerged, showing superior fluorescence enhancement and high affinity for the target compared to the other families obtained by NGS analysis. These sequence families were further studied to understand the binding interactions better. Primary sequence and secondary structure analysis tools were used to identify a hypothetical three&#8208;tiered G&#8208;quadruplex motif for these families. This indicates that the TO1&#8208;biotin DNA aptamer identified here uses a similar ligand&#8208;binding topology to the original Mango RNA aptamer.</dc:description>

         <title>Complex Formation and Hydrolytic Processes of Protected Peptides Containing the &#8211;SXH&#8211; Motif in the Presence of Nickel(II) Ion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between metal ions and proteins are considered reversible, such as the coordination of a metal ion to a protein or enzyme, but irreversible processes like the oxidative reactions, aggregation or hydrolytic processes may occur. In the presence of Ni(II)&#8208;ions selective hydrolysis of the peptides containing the &#8211;SXH&#8211; or &#8211;TXH&#8211; motif was observed. Since the side chain of histidine serves as the metal ion binding site for many native proteins, and very often histidine is present in a &#8211;SXH&#8211; or &#8211;TXH&#8211; sequence, to study the complex formation and hydrolytic processes in presence of nickel(II) ion four peptides were synthesised: Ac&#8208;SKHM&#8208;NH2, A3SSH&#8208;NH2, A4SSH&#8208;NH2, AAAeKSH&#8208;NH2. The Ni(II)&#8208;induced hydrolysis of Ac&#8208;SKHM&#8208;NH2 peptide occurs rapidly in alkaline medium already at room temperature. In two peptides containing &#8211;SSH&#8211; sequence on the C&#8208;termini, the N&#8208;terminal part is the major binding site for the nickel(II) ion, but the formation of dinuclear complexes was also observed. In the [Ni2LH&#8211;6]2&#8211; complex of hexapeptide, the coordination sphere of the metal ions is saturated with deprotonated Ser&#8208;O&#8211;, which does not result in hydrolysis of the peptide. For A4SSH&#8208;NH2, both Ni(II) ions fulfill the conditions for hydrolysis, which was confirmed by HPLC analyses at pH ~ 8.2 and&#160;25 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>IKZF2 Degradation: It&#8242;s Time to Take into Account it When Designing Cereblon&#8208;Based PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The E3 ligase CRBN ligand in PROTAC are itself molecular glue that lead to the degradation of neo&#8208;substrates, such as IKZF2. This review summarizes IKZF2 degraders reported in both literature and patents, and provides inspiration for the design of PROTACs with desired IKZF2 degradation activity.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) has become a very important means of protein degradation and a new way of disease treatment. In particular, PROTACs constructed with ligands for E3 ligase cereblon account for more than 90&#8201;% of the PROTACs currently in clinical research. Notably, CRBN ligands themselves are a class of molecular glue compounds capable of degrading neo&#8208;substrate proteins. Compared to the target proteins degradation, the degradation of neo&#8208;substrates, especially IKZF2, has not received enough attention. Therefore, this review summarizes the currently published IKZF2 degraders derived from articles and patents, which are conducive to the design of PROTACs with desired IKZF2 degradation from the perspective of medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Expanding the Available RNA Labeling Toolbox With CutA Nucleotidyltransferase for Efficient Transcript Labeling with Purine and Pyrimidine Nucleotide Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CutA nucleotidyltransferase serves as a new tool for enzymatic incorporation of purine and pyrimidine analogs at the RNA 3&#8242; end. The developed method allows for efficient labeling of messenger RNA along with retaining biological properties of the transcript. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to select the nucleotide analog candidates for CutA substrates.







Abstract
RNA labeling is an invaluable tool for investigation of the function and localization of nucleic acids. Labels are commonly incorporated into 3&#8242; end of RNA and the primary enzyme used for this purpose is RNA poly(A) polymerase (PAP), which belongs to the class of terminal nucleotidyltransferases (NTases). However, PAP preferentially adds ATP analogs, thus limiting the number of available substrates. Here, we report the use of another NTase, CutA from the fungus Thielavia terrestris. Using this enzyme, we were able to incorporate into the 3&#8242; end of RNA not only purine analogs, but also pyrimidine analogs. We engaged strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyl cycloaddition (SPAAC) to obtain fluorescently labeled or biotinylated transcripts from RNAs extended with azide analogs by CutA. Importantly, modified transcripts retained their biological properties. Furthermore, fluorescently labeled mRNAs were suitable for visualization in cultured mammalian cells. Finally, we demonstrate that either affinity studies or molecular dynamic (MD) simulations allow for rapid screening of NTase substrates, what opens up new avenues in the search for the optimal substrates for this class of enzymes.

         <title>Genome mining leads to the identification of a stable and promiscuous Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase from a thermophilic microorganism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent flavoproteins that convert ketones to&#160;esters and lactones. While these enzymes offer an appealing alternative to traditional Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidations, these proteins tend to be either too unstable or exhibit too narrow of a substrate scope for implementation as industrial biocatalysts. Here, sequence similarity networks were used to search for novel BVMOs that are both stable and promiscuous. Our genome mining led to the identification of an enzyme from Chloroflexota bacterium (strain G233) dubbed ssnBVMO that exhibits i) the highest melting temperature&#160;of any&#160;naturally sourced BVMO (62.5 &#186;C), ii) a remarkable kinetic stability across a wide range of conditions, similar to those of PAMO and PockeMO, iii) optimal catalysis&#160;at 50 &#176;C, and iv) a broad substrate scope that includes linear aliphatic, aromatic, and sterically bulky ketones. Subsequent quantitative assays using propiophenone demonstrated&#160;&gt;95% conversion. Several fusions were also constructed that linked ssnBVMO to a thermostable phosphite dehydrogenase. These&#160;fusions can recycle NADPH and catalyze oxidations with sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of this expensive cofactor. Characterization of these fusions&#160;permitted identification of PTDH&#8208;L1&#8208;ssnBVMO as the most promising protein that could have utility as a seed sequence for enzyme engineering campaigns aiming to develop biocatalysts for Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification that regulates vital biological processes like histone reorganization and DNA&#8208;damage repair through the modification of various amino acid residues. Due to advances in mass&#8208;spectrometry, the collection of long&#8208;known ADP&#8208;ribose (ADPr) acceptor sites, e.g. arginine, cysteine and glutamic acid, has been expanded with serine, tyrosine and histidine, among others. Well&#8208;defined ADPr&#8208;peptides are valuable tools for investigating the exact structures, mechanisms of action and interaction partners of the different flavors of this modification. This review provides a comprehensive overview of synthetic and chemoenzymatic methodologies that enabled the construction of peptides mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated on various amino acids, and close mimetics thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;sulfur peptides mimicking ferredoxin for an efficient electron transfer to hydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, hydrogenase HydA1 converts protons and electrons to H2 at the H&#8208;cluster, which includes a [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster linked to a [2Fe] cluster. The yield of H2 is limited by the electron transfer to HydA1, mediated by the iron&#8208;sulfur unit of a photosynthetic electron transfer ferredoxin (PetF). In this study, I have investigated by molecular dynamics and the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method two canonical iron&#8208;sulfur peptides (PM1 and FBM) that hold potential as PetF replacements. Using a docking approach, I predict that the distance between the two iron&#8208;sulfur clusters in FBM/HydA1 is shorter than in PM1/HydA1, ensuring a greater electron transfer rate. This finding is in line with the reported higher H2 production rates for FBM/HydA1. I also show that the redox potential of these peptides, and therefore their electron transfer properties, can be changed by single&#8208;residue mutations in the secondary coordination sphere of their cluster. In particular, I have designed a PM1 variant that disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network between water and the cluster, shifting the redox potential negatively compared to PM1. These results will guide experiments aimed at replacing PetF with peptides that can unlock the biotechnological potential of the alga.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metastable Semiquinone Molecular Switch Modulated by Ascorbate/O2: a Study from a System Far&#8208;From&#8208;Equilibrium to Biological Assays in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molecular switch based on the metastable radical anion derived from a substituted heteroaryl quinone is described. Pyrrolil quinone thiocyanate (PQ 5) showed an interaction with the fluoride anion that was visible to the naked eye and quantified by UV/vis and 1H and 13C NMR. The metastable quinoid species formed by the interaction with F&#8208; ("ON" state) showed a molecular switching effect autocontrolled by the presence of ascorbate ("OFF" state) and back to the "ON" state by an autooxidation process, measured by visible and UV/vis spectroscopy. Due to its out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium properties and the exchange of matter and energy, a dissipative structural behaviour is proposed. Considering its similarity to the mechanism of coenzyme Q in oxidative phosphophorylation, PQ 5 was evaluated on Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial function for inhibition of complexes II, III and IV, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, catalase activity and lipid peroxidation. The results showed that PQ 5 inhibited complex III activity as well as the activity of all electron transport chain (ETC) complexes. In addition, PQ 5 reduced ROS production and catalase activity in yeast. The results suggest that PQ 5 may have potential applications as a new microbicidal compound by inducing ETC dysfunction.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;cell Catalysis by Tethered Organo&#8722;Osmium Complexes Generates Selectivity for Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;A covalently&#8208;tethered osmium(II) catalyst can carry out in&#8208;cell catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) as part of a novel anticancer mechanism of action.&#8221;







Abstract
Anticancer agents that exhibit catalytic mechanisms of action offer a unique multi&#8208;targeting strategy to overcome drug resistance. Nonetheless, many in&#8208;cell catalysts in development are hindered by deactivation by endogenous nucleophiles. We have synthesised a highly potent, stable Os&#8208;based 16&#8208;electron half&#8208;sandwich (&#8216;piano stool&#8217;) catalyst by introducing a permanent covalent tether between the arene and chelated diamine ligand. This catalyst exhibits antiproliferative activity comparable to the clinical drug cisplatin towards triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells and can overcome tamoxifen resistance. Speciation experiments revealed Os to be almost exclusively albumin&#8208;bound in the extracellular medium, while cellular accumulation studies identified an energy&#8208;dependent, protein&#8208;mediated Os accumulation pathway, consistent with albumin&#8208;mediated uptake. Importantly, the tethered Os complex was active for in&#8208;cell transfer hydrogenation catalysis, initiated by co&#8208;administration of a non&#8208;toxic dose of sodium formate as a source of hydride, indicating that the Os catalyst is delivered to the cytosol of cancer cells intact. The mechanism of action involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus exploiting the inherent redox vulnerability of cancer cells, accompanied by selectivity for cancerous cells over non&#8208;tumorigenic cells.

         <title>STING&#8208;Activating Small Molecular Therapeutics for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immuno&#8208;oncology has become a revolutionary strategy for cancer treatment. Therapeutic interventions based on adaptive immunity through immune checkpoint therapy or chimeric antigen receptor T cells have received clinical approval for monotherapy and combination treatment use in various cancers. Although these treatments have achieved clinical successes, only a minority of cancer patients show a response, highlighting the urgent need to discover new therapeutic molecules that could be exploited to improve clinical outcomes and pave the way for the next generation of immunotherapy. Given the critical role of the innate immune system against infection and cancer, substantial efforts have been dedicated to developing novel anticancer therapeutics that target these pathways. Targeting the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a powerful strategy to generate durable antitumor response, and activation of the adaptor protein STING induces the initiation of transcriptional cascades, thereby producing type I interferons, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Various STING agonists, including natural or synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) have been developed as anticancer therapeutics. However, since most CDNs are confined to intratumoral administration, there has been a great interest in developing non&#8208;nucleotide agonists for systemic treatment. Here we review the current development of STING&#8208;activating therapeutics in both preclinical or clinical stages.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Nanocatalytic Medicine from Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides Containing an ATCUN&#8208;Like Copper&#8208;Binding Motif for Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembling peptide with ATCUN motifs was developed which could work as an effective platform for fabricating biocompatible and catalytic nanomedicine with multi&#8208;oxidase activities and synergistic cancer therapy.







Abstract
Development of nanomaterials with multiple enzymatic activities via a facile approach receives growing interests in recent years. Although peptide self&#8208;assembling provides an effective approach for the construction of biomimetic materials in recent years, fabrication of artificial enzymes from self&#8208;assembling peptides with multiple catalytic activities for anticancer therapy is still a challenge. Here, we report a simple method to prepare nanocatalysts with multienzyme&#8208;like activities from self&#8208;assembling peptides containing ATCUN copper&#8208;binding motifs. With the aid of the coordination interactions between the ATCUN motif and Cu(II) ions, these peptides could perform supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to form nanomaterials with biomimetic peroxidase, ascorbate oxidase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Moreover, these trienzyme&#8208;like effects can elevate oxidative stress levels and suppress the antioxidative capability of cancer cells, which synergistically induce the apoptosis of cancer cells. Because of the high biocompatibility, catalytic activities and drug encapsulation properties, this self&#8208;assembled peptide provides a biomimetic platform for the development of new nanocatalytic medicines for multimodal synergistic cancer therapies.

         <title>An Active and Versatile Electron Transport System for Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases from the Alkane Degrading Organism Acinetobacter sp. OC4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) from Acinetobacter sp. OC4 demonstrate to form a suitable electron transport system for CYP153A&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Spectral analysis confirms NADH reduction capability, while linker fusion strategies enhance electron transfer to model electron acceptors. The systems&#8216; application in driving various CYP153A subfamily members underscores their potential as a versatile electron transport system.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are valuable biocatalysts for the oxyfunctionalization of non&#8208;activated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds. Most CYPs rely on electron transport proteins as redox partners. In this study, the ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. OC4 are investigated. Upon heterologous production of both proteins independently in Escherichia coli, spectral analysis showed their reduction capability towards reporter electron acceptors, e.&#8201;g., cytochrome c. The individual proteins&#8217; specific activity towards cytochrome c reduction was 25&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Furthermore, the possibility to enhance electron transfer by artificial fusion of the units was elucidated. FdR and FD were linked by helical linkers [EAAAK]n, flexible glycine linkers [GGGGS]n or rigid proline linkers [EPPPP]n of n=1&#8211;4 sequence repetitions. The system with a glycine linker (n=4) reached an appreciable specific activity of 19&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1 towards cytochrome c. Moreover, their ability to drive different members of the CYP153A subfamily is demonstrated. By creating artificial self&#8208;sufficient P450s with FdR, FD, and a panel of four CYP153A representatives, effective hydroxylation of n&#8208;hexane in a whole&#8208;cell system was achieved. The results indicate this protein combination to constitute a functional and versatile surrogate electron transport system for this subfamily.

         <dc:description>Biochemical reactions are typically slowed down by decreasing temperature. However, accelerated reaction kinetics have been observed for a long time. More recent examples have highlighted the unique role of freezing in fabricating supermaterials, degrading environmental contaminants, and accelerating bioreactions. Functional nucleic acids are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with versatile properties, including target recognition, catalysis, and molecular co4mputing. In this review, we discuss the current observations and understanding of freezing&#8208;facilitated reactions involving functional nucleic acids. Molecular reactions such as ligation/conjugation, cleavage, and hybridization are discussed. Moreover, freezing&#8208;induced DNA&#8208;nanoparticle conjugations are introduced. Then, we describe our effect in immobilizing DNA on bulk surfaces. Finally, we address some critical questions and research opportunities in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Phenylalanine Adenylation Enzyme HitB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single mutation in the (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine adenylation enzyme HitB enabled efficient activation of various meta&#8208;substituted and ortho&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs. Structural analysis of the generated HitB mutants revealed an enlarged substrate binding pocket for these (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs, providing new insights into the structural basis for creating enzyme substrate promiscuity.







Abstract
Adenylation enzymes catalyze the selective incorporation of aminoacyl building blocks in the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides and related natural products. Although &#946;&#8208;amino acid units are one of the important aminoacyl building blocks in natural product biosynthesis, very little is known about the engineering of &#946;&#8208;amino acid adenylation enzymes. In this study, we engineered the substrate specificity of the (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine adenylation enzyme, HitB, involved in the biosynthesis of macrolactam polyketide hitachimycin. Based on the previously determined structure of HitB wild&#8208;type, we mutated Phe328 and Ser293, which are located near the meta and ortho position of the (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine moiety, respectively. As a result, the HitB F328V and F328L mutants efficiently activated meta&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs, and the HitB T293G and T293S mutants efficiently activated ortho&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs. Structural analysis of the HitB F328L and T293G mutants with the corresponding nonhydrolyzable intermediate analogs revealed an enlarged substrate binding pocket for (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs, providing detailed insights into the structural basis for creating enzyme substrate promiscuity. Our findings may be useful for production of various &#946;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing natural product analogs.

         <title>Structures and Protein Engineering of the &#945;&#8208;Keto Acid C&#8208;Methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA for Rational Substrate Transfer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent C&#8208;methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA catalyze the stereoselective methylation of enolizable &#945;&#8208;keto acids in the biosynthesis of antibiotic natural products. By investigating key residues of the crystallized enzymes and rational engineering of MrsA, the substrate scope can be transferred to &#945;&#8208;keto acid substrates from different biosynthetic pathways, enabling enzymatic C&#8208;methylation beyond native substrates.







Abstract
S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) are involved in the C&#8208;methylation of a variety of natural products. The MTs SgvM from Streptomyces griseoviridis and MrsA from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae catalyze the methylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of &#945;&#8208;keto acids in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic natural products viridogrisein and 3&#8208;methylarginine, respectively. MrsA shows high substrate selectivity for 5&#8208;guanidino&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, while other &#945;&#8208;keto acids, such as the SgvM substrates 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, 2&#8208;oxovalerate, and phenylpyruvate, are not accepted. Here we report the crystal structures of SgvM and MrsA in the apo form and bound with substrate or S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine. By investigating key residues for substrate recognition in the active sites of both enzymes and engineering MrsA by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, the substrate range of MrsA was extended to accept &#945;&#8208;keto acid substrates of SgvM with uncharged and lipophilic &#946;&#8208;residues. Our results showcase the transfer of the substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;keto acid MTs from different biosynthetic pathways by rational design.

         <title>Atomistic Characterization of Healthy and Damaged Hair Surfaces: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study of Fatty Acids on Protein Layer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keratin&#8208;associated protein inclusive atomistic models of healthy and damaged hair surface presented in this study enables a realistic representation of the intricate details within the hair epicuticle, facilitating an assessment of the molecular interactions during the design of sustainable hair care formulations.







Abstract
Amid the bourgeoning demand for in&#8208;silico designed, environmentally sustainable, and highly effective hair care formulations, a growing interest is evident in the exploration of realistic computational model for the hair surface. In this work, we present an atomistic model for the outermost layer of the hair surface derived through molecular dynamics simulations, which comprises 18&#8208;Methyleicosanoic acid (18&#8208;MEA) fatty acid chains covalently bound onto the keratin&#8208;associated protein 10&#8208;4 (KAP10&#8208;4) at a spacing distance of ~1&#8197;nm. Remarkably, this hair surface model facilitates the inclusion of free fatty acids (free 18&#8208;MEA) into the gaps between chemically bound 18&#8208;MEA chains, up to a maximum number that results in a packing density of 0.22&#8197;nm2 per fatty acid molecule, consistent with the optimal spacing identified through free energy analysis. Atomistic insights are provided for the organization of fatty acid chains, structural features, and interaction energies on protein&#8208;inclusive hair surface models with varying amounts of free 18&#8208;MEA (FMEA) depletion, as well as varying degrees of anionic cysteic acid from damaged bound 18&#8208;MEA (BMEA), under both dry and wet conditions. In the presence of FMEA and water, the fatty acid chains in a pristine hair surface prefers to adopt a thermodynamically favored extended chain conformation, forming a thicker protective layer (~3&#8197;nm) on the protein surface. Our simulation results reveal that, while the depletion of FMEA can induce a pronounced impact on the thickness, tilt angle, and order parameters of fatty acid chains, the removal of BMEA has a marked effect on water penetration. There is a &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; spacing between the 18&#8208;MEA whereby damaged hair surface properties can be reinstated by replenishing FMEA. Through the incorporation of the protein layer and free fatty acids, the hair surface models presented in this study enables a realistic representation of the intricate details within the hair epicuticle, facilitating a molecular scale assessment of surface properties during the formulation design process.

In this work, we present an atomistic model for the outermost layer of the hair surface derived through molecular dynamics simulations, which comprises 18-Methyleicosanoic acid (18-MEA) fatty acid chains covalently bound onto the keratin-associated protein 10-4 (KAP10-4) at a spacing distance of ~1&#8197;nm. Remarkably, this hair surface model facilitates the inclusion of free fatty acids (free 18-MEA) into the gaps between chemically bound 18-MEA chains, up to a maximum number that results in a packing density of 0.22&#8197;nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per fatty acid molecule, consistent with the optimal spacing identified through free energy analysis. Atomistic insights are provided for the organization of fatty acid chains, structural features, and interaction energies on protein-inclusive hair surface models with varying amounts of free 18-MEA (FMEA) depletion, as well as varying degrees of anionic cysteic acid from damaged bound 18-MEA (BMEA), under both dry and wet conditions. In the presence of FMEA and water, the fatty acid chains in a pristine hair surface prefers to adopt a thermodynamically favored extended chain conformation, forming a thicker protective layer (~3&#8197;nm) on the protein surface. Our simulation results reveal that, while the depletion of FMEA can induce a pronounced impact on the thickness, tilt angle, and order parameters of fatty acid chains, the removal of BMEA has a marked effect on water penetration. There is a &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; spacing between the 18-MEA whereby damaged hair surface properties can be reinstated by replenishing FMEA. Through the incorporation of the protein layer and free fatty acids, the hair surface models presented in this study enables a realistic representation of the intricate details within the hair epicuticle, facilitating a molecular scale assessment of surface properties during the formulation design process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A bifunctional methyltransferase in biosynthesis of antitumor antibiotic streptonigrin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptonigrin (STN, 1) is a highly functionalized aminoquinone alkaloid antibiotic with broad and potent antitumor activity. STN structurally contains four methyl groups belonging to two types: C&#8208;methyl group and O&#8208;methyl groups. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the O&#8208;methyltransferase StnQ2 that can catalyze both the methylation of a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group in the biosynthesis of streptonigrin. This work not only provides a new insight into methyltransferases, but also advances the elucidation of the complete biosynthetic pathway of streptonigrin.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Dynamics, Energetics, and the Divergent Evolution of Allosteric Regulation: The Case of the Yeast MAPK Family</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Conformational dynamics, energetics, and the divergent evolution of allosteric regulation: the case of the yeast MAPK family. Analysis of internal dynamics and interaction networks in homologous proteins reveal the basis for the evolutionary divergence and differentiation of their mechanisms of allosteric regulation.







Abstract
Allosteric mechanisms provide finely&#8208;tuned control over signalling proteins. Proteins of the same family may share high sequence identity and structural similarity but show distinct traits of allosteric control and evolutionary divergent regulation. Revealing the determinants of such properties may be important to understand the molecular bases of different regulatory pathways. Herein, we investigate whether and how evolutionarily&#8208;divergent traits of allosteric regulation in homologous proteins can be decoded in terms of internal dynamics and interaction networks that support functionally oriented conformations. In this framework, we start from the comparative analysis of the dynamics and energetics of the yeast MAP Kinases (MAPKs) Fus3 and Kss1 in their native basins. Importantly, distinctive dynamic and energetic stabilization features emerge, which can be related to the two proteins&#8217; differential ability to be phosphorylated and engage with the allosteric activator Ste5. We then expanded our study to other evolutionarily&#8208;related MAPKs. We show that the dynamical and energetical traits defining the distinct regulatory profiles of Fus3 and Kss1 can be traced along their evolutionary tree. Overall, our approach is able to reconnect (latent) allostery with the principal elements of protein structural stabilization and dynamics, showing how allosteric regulation was encrypted in MAPKs structure well before Ste5 appearance.

         <title>Kinetic ITC of DNA Aptamers Binding for Small Molecules and Implications for Binding Assays and Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using KineticITC, the kon and koff values of a few small molecule binding aptamers are plotted against their Kd values, implications for fundamental aptamer binding and biosensor development are discussed.







Abstract
The determination of kon and koff values through kinetic analysis is crucial for understanding the intricacies of aptamer&#8208;target binding interactions. By employing kinetic ITC, we systematically analyzed a range of ITC data of various aptamers. Upon plotting their kon and koff values as a function of their Kd values, a notable trend emerged. Across a range of Kd values spanning from 28&#8197;nM to 864&#8197;&#956;M, the kon value decreased from 2&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 to 96&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas the koff value increased from 1.03&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 to 0.012&#8197;s&#8722;1. Thus, both kon and koff contributed to the change of Kd in the same direction, although the range of kon change was larger. Since experiments are often run at close to the Kd value, this concentration effect also played an important role in the observed binding kinetics. The effect of these kinetic parameters on two common sensing mechanisms, including aptamer beacons and strand&#8208;displacement assays, are discussed. This work has provided the kinetic values of small molecule binding aptamers and offered insights into aptamer&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>The Dynamic Plasticity of P. aeruginosa CueR Copper Transcription Factor upon Cofactor and DNA Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EPR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the behavior of P.&#8197;aeruginosa CueR copper transcription factor, revealing its responsiveness to the promoter sequence and a distinct mechanism from its E.&#8197;coli counterpart.







Abstract
Bacteria use specialized proteins, like transcription factors, to rapidly control metal ion balance. CueR is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial copper regulator. The structure of E.&#8197;coli CueR complexed with Cu(I) and DNA was published, since then many studies have shed light on its function. However, P.&#8197;aeruginosa CueR, which shows high sequence similarity to E.&#8197;coli CueR, has been less studied. Here, we applied room&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements to explore changes in dynamics of P.&#8197;aeruginosa CueR in dependency of copper concentrations and interaction with two different DNA promoter regions. We showed that P.&#8197;aeruginosa CueR is less dynamic than the E.&#8197;coli CueR protein and exhibits much higher sensitivity to DNA binding as compared to its E.&#8197;coli CueR homolog. Moreover, a difference in dynamical behavior was observed when P.&#8197;aeruginosa CueR binds to the copZ2 DNA promoter sequence compared to the mexPQ&#8208;opmE promoter sequence. Such dynamical differences may affect the expression levels of CopZ2 and MexPQ&#8208;OpmE proteins in P.&#8197;aeruginosa. Overall, such comparative measurements of protein&#8208;DNA complexes derived from different bacterial systems reveal insights about how structural and dynamical differences between two highly homologous proteins lead to quite different DNA sequence&#8208;recognition and mechanistic properties.

         <title>Targeting New Functions and Applications of Bacterial Two&#8208;component Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are regulatory systems widely distributed in eubacteria, archaea, and a few eukaryotic organisms, but not in mammalian cells. A typical TCS consists of a histidine kinase and a response regulator protein. Functional and mechanistic studies on different TCSs have greatly advanced the understanding of cellular phosphotransfer signal transduction mechanisms. In this concept paper, we focus on the His&#8208;Asp phosphotransfer mechanism, the ATP synthesis function, antimicrobial drug design, cellular biosensors design, and protein allostery mechanisms based on recent TCS investigations to inspire new applications and future research perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Semi&#8208;Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein: Insight into the Chemical Complexity of Synucleinopathies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical rules governing protein folding have intrigued generations of researchers for decades. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), prediction of protein structure has improved tremendously. However, there is still a level of analysis that is only possible through wet laboratory experiments, especially in respect to the investigation of the pathological effect of mutations and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on proteins of interest. This requires the availability of pure peptides and proteins in sufficient quantities for biophysical, biochemical, and functional studies. In this context, chemical protein synthesis and semi&#8208;synthesis are powerful tools in protein research, which help to enlighten the role of protein modification in the physiology and pathology of proteins. A protein of high interest in the field of biomedicine is alpha&#8208;synuclein (aSyn), a protein deeply associated with several devastating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple systems atrophy (MSA). Here, we describe several methods and pathways to synthesize native or modified aSyn, and discuss how these approaches enable us to address pathological mechanisms that may open novel perspectives for therapeutic intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>A dual bispecific hydrolysis peptide&#8208;drug conjugate responsive to micro&#8208;acidic and reduction circumstance promotes antitumor efficacy in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paclitaxel and its derivates are the first&#8208;line chemotherapeutic agents of breast cancer, which also showed tremendous clinical value in many other diseases including ovarian cancer, lung cancer etc. However, there are many drawbacks for almost all paclitaxel or its derivates, including extremely short half&#8208;life, poor solubility and adverse events, which significantly limits their clinical applications. In this work, we designed and constructed a bispecific hydrolysis PAP&#8208;SS&#8208;PTX, consisting with pro&#8208;apoptosis peptide (PAP) and paclitaxel (PTX) that were conjugated together via disulfide and ester bonds. On the one hand, PAP could improve the solubility of PTX and promote cellular uptake for drugs. On the other hand, it was able to prolong the PTX half&#8208;life. We performed series of chemo&#8208;dynamical assays and showed that PDC would release active drug molecules under micro&#8208;acidic and reduction circumstance. The further assays elucidated that PDC could interrupt DNA synthesis and arrest cell division through downregulating CDK4/6 and Histone methylation that inhibit tumor growth in vitro. What&#8217;s more, it could not only inhibit 4T1 breast tumor growth, but also prolong the survival time of mice and exert antitumor efficacy in vivo. It may provide a new research idea for cancer therapies via controlled release strategy in tumor microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of the Stereochemistry of Staphyloferrin A for Developing Staphylococcus&#8208;specific Targeting Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacteria in the genus Staphylococcus are pathogenic and harmful to humans. Alarmingly, some Staphylococcus, such as methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (VRSA) have spread worldwide and become notoriously resistant to antibiotics, threatening and concerning public health. Hence, the development of new Staphylococcus&#8208;targeting diagnostic and therapeutic agents is urgent. Here, we chose the S. aureus&#8208;secreted siderophore staphyloferrin A (SA) as a guiding unit. We developed a series of Staphyloferrin A conjugates (SA conjugates) and showed the specific targeting ability to Staphylococcus bacteria. Furthermore, among the structural factors we evaluated, the stereo&#8208;chemistry of the amino acid backbone of SA conjugates is essential to efficiently target Staphylococci. Finally, we demonstrated that fluorescent Staphyloferrin A probes (SA&#8208;FL probes) could specifically target Staphylococci in complex bacterial mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivated Anticancer Activity of Cobalt(III) Complexes with Naturally Occurring Flavonoids Chrysin and Silibinin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactive metal complexes of bioessential transition metal ions with natural chelators are gaining interest as photocytotoxic agents for cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). We report six new cobalt(III) complexes with a mixed&#8208;ligand formulation [Co(B)2(L)](ClO4)2 (Co1&#8211;Co6), where B represents a N,N&#8208;donor &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand, namely, phenanthroline (phen; Co1, Co2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq; Co3, Co4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz; Co5, Co6), and L is the monoanionic form of the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin (chry; Co1, Co3, Co5) and silibinin (sili; Co2, Co4, Co6). Complexes displayed a d&#8208;d absorption band within 500&#8211;700 nm and exhibited excellent dark and photostability in solution. Cytotoxicity studies indicated significant activity of Co5 and Co6 against cervical (HeLa) and lung (A549) cancer cells under visible light (400&#8211;700 nm) irradiation giving low micromolar IC50 values (2.3&#8211;3.4 &#181;M, phototoxicity index ~ 15&#8211;30). The complexes demonstrated notably low toxicity against normal HPL1D lung epithelial cells. Flow cytometry assay revealed an apoptotic mode of cell damage triggered by the complexes when irradiated. ROS generation assay indicated the involvement of singlet oxygen species in the cell death mechanism when irradiated with light. Overall, complexes Co5 and Co6 with coordinated dipyridophenazine and flavonoid ligands are potential candidates for cancer PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>CNS Drug Discovery in Academia: Where Basic Research Meets Innovation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug discovery in academia provides both challenges and opportunities as shown by an in&#8208;depth analysis of drug discovery projects in the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research TransCure (2010&#8211;2022). A successful translational project related to selective endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitors is discussed providing a showcase of how innovative research in academia can inspire drug discovery.







Abstract
The involvement of academic research in drug discovery is consistently growing. However, academic projects seldom advance to clinical trials. Here, we assess the landscape of drug discovery within the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) TransCure launched by the Swiss National Science Foundation to foster basic research and early&#8208;stage drug discovery on membrane transporters. This included transporters in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, which represent a huge unmet medical need. While idea championship, sustainable funding, collaborations between disciplines at the interface of academia and industry are important for translational research, Popperian falsifiability, strong intellectual property and a motivated startup team are key elements for innovation. This is exemplified by the NCCR TransCure spin&#8208;off company Synendos Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotech company developing the first selective endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitors (SERIs) as novel treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. We provide a perspective on the challenges related to entering an uncharted druggable space and bridging the often mentioned &#8220;valley of death&#8221;. The high attrition rate of drug discovery projects in the CNS field within academia is often due to the lack of meaningful animal models that can provide pharmacological proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for potentially disruptive technologies at the earliest stages, and the absence of solid intellectual property.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genetic Code Expansion technology offers significant potential in incorporating noncanonical amino acids into proteins at precise locations, allowing for the modulation of protein structures and functions. However, this technology is often limited by the need for costly and challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize external noncanonical amino acid sources. In this study, we address this limitation by developing autonomous cells capable of biosynthesizing halogenated tryptophan derivatives and introducing them into proteins using Genetic Code Expansion technology. By utilizing inexpensive halide salts and different halogenases, we successfully achieve the selective biosynthesis of 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan, and 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan. These derivatives are introduced at specific positions with corresponding bioorthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs in response to the amber codon. Following optimization, we demonstrate the robust expression of proteins containing halogenated tryptophan residues in cells with the ability to biosynthesize these tryptophan derivatives. This study establishes a versatile platform for engineering proteins with various halogenated tryptophans.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural basis of the dehydratase module (hDH) of human fatty acid synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human fatty acid synthase (hFASN) produces fatty acids for cellar membrane construction, energy storage, biomolecule modifications and signal transduction. Abnormal expression and functions of hFASN highly associate with numerous human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cancers, and thereby it has been considered as a valuable potential drug target. So far, the structural and catalytic mechanisms of most of the hFASN enzymatic modules have been extensively studied, except the key dehydratase module (hDH). Here we presented the enzymatic characterization and the high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of hDH. We demonstrated that the hDH preferentially catalyzes the acyl substrates with short lengths between 4 to 8&#8208;carbons, and exhibits much lower enzymatic activity on longer substrates. Subsequent structural study showed that hDH displays a pseudo&#8208;dimeric organization with a single L&#8208;shaped composite hydrophobic catalytic tunnel as well as an atypical ACP binding site nearby, indicating that hDH achieves distinct substrate recognition and dehydration mechanisms compared to the conventional bacterial fatty acid dehydratases identified. Our findings laid the foundation for understanding the biological and pathogenic functions of hFASN, and may facilitate therapeutical drug development against diseases with abnormal functionality of hFASN.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Dependent Activation of Split DNAzyme Kinase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binary (also known as split) nucleic acid enzymes have emerged as novel tools in biosensors. We report a new split strategy to split the DNAzyme kinase into two independent and non&#8208;functional fragments, denoted DK1sub and DK1enz. In the presence of the specific target, their free ends are brought sufficiently close to interact with each other without the formation of Watson&#8208;Crick base pairings between Dk1sub and Dk1enz, thus allowing the DNA phosphorylation reaction.&#160;We term this approach proximity&#8208;dependent activation of split DNAzyme kinase (ProxSDK). The utility of ProxSDK is demonstrated by engineering a biosensing system that is capable of measuring specific DNA&#8208;protein interactions. We envision that the approach described herein will &#64257;nd useful applications in biosensing, imaging, and clinical diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotide&#8208;Based Photoaffinity Probes: Chemical Tools and Applications for Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivatable oligonucleotides in combination with recent developments in mass spectrometry are powerful tools for studying nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions involved in numerous biological processes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the different strategies for incorporating the most used photoreactive reagents into oligonucleotides probes and we illustrate their applications with several examples.







Abstract
A variety of proteins interact with DNA and RNA, including polymerases, histones, ribosomes, transcription factors, and repair enzymes. However, the transient non&#8208;covalent nature of these interactions poses challenges for analysis. Introducing a covalent bond between proteins and DNA via photochemical activation of a photosensitive functional group introduced onto nucleic acids offers a means to stabilize these often weak interactions without significantly altering the binding interface. Consequently, photoactivatable oligonucleotides are powerful tools for investigating nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions involved in numerous biological and pathological processes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the chemical tools developed so far and the different strategies used for incorporating the most commonly used photoreactive reagents into oligonucleotide probes or nucleic acids. Furthermore, we illustrate their application with several examples including protein binding site mapping, identification of protein binding partners, and in cell studies.

         <title>Exploring the World of Curcumin: Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Applications in Nanoscience and Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Curcumin is a bright yellow naturally occurring polyphenol which is the principal component of turmeric. It is used as herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, and food coloring agent. Over the years, the therapeutic properties of natural product curcumin have gone unexploited but not unnoticed. Curcumin cannot be employed as a drug due to limitations such as low aqueous solubility and limited bioavailability. Many attempts have been made to overcome these limitations by confining the drug in various confined media to enhance its bioavailability. The biomolecule is emissive and undergoes fundamental excited state processes such as solvation dynamics and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials are also a fast advancing field where curcumin is an intrinsic component necessary for formation of these materials and no longer added as an external free drug. In this review, we will summarise the recent research on the photophysical and photochemical properties of curcumin and its excited state dynamics in various bio&#8208;mimicking systems. At the same time we wish to also incorporate the various applications of curcumin, especially in biology. Lastly due to the growing importance of materials science, we will briefly discuss some recent advances on curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Broadening The Substrate Scope of Aldolases Through Metagenomic Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;processes based on enzymatic catalysis play a major role in the development of green, sustainable processes, and the discovery of new enzymes is key to this approach. In this work, we analysed ten metagenomes and retrieved 48 genes coding for deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolases (DERAs, EC 4.1.2.4) using a sequence&#8208;based approach. These sequences were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and screened for activity towards a range of aldol additions. Among these, one enzyme, DERA&#8208;61, proved to be particularly interesting and catalysed the aldol addition of furfural or benzaldehyde with acetone, butanone and cyclobutanone with unprecedented activity. The product of these reactions, aldols, can find applications as building blocks in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Screening was carried out to identify optimized reaction conditions targeting temperature, pH, and salt concentrations. Lastly, the kinetics and the stereochemistry of the products were investigated, revealing that DERA&#8208;61 and other metagenomic DERAs have superior activity and stereoselectivity when they are provided with non&#8208;natural substrates, compared to well&#8208;known DERAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeting of the HER2 Cancer Receptor with an Antibody&#8208;Directed Enzyme and a&#160;Nanobody&#8208;Guided MMAE Prodrug Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody&#8208;enzyme conjugates have shown potential as tissue&#8208;specific prodrug activators by antibody&#8208;directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), but the approach met challenges clinically due to systemic drug release. Here, we report a novel dual&#8208;targeting ADEPT system (DuADEPT) which is based on active cancer receptor targeting of both a trastuzumab&#8208;sialidase conjugate (Tz&#8208;Sia) and a highly potent sialidase&#8208;activated monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) prodrug scaffold. The scaffold is based on a four&#8208;way junction of the artificial nucleic acid analog acyclic (L)&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid ((L)&#8208;aTNA) which at the ends of its four arms carries one nanobody targeting HER2 and three copies of the prodrug. Dual&#8208;targeting of the constructs to two proximal epitopes of HER2 was shown by flow cytometry, and a dual&#8208;targeted enzymatic drug release assay revealed cytotoxicity upon prodrug activation specifically for HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells. The specific delivery and activation of prodrugs in this way could potentially be used to decrease systemic side effects and increase drug efficacy, and utilization of Tz&#8208;Sia provides an opportunity to combine the local chemotherapeutic effect of the DuADEPT with an anticancer immune response.</dc:description>

         <title>Short Oligourea Foldamers as N&#8208; or C&#8208;Caps for Promoting &#945;&#8208;Helix Formation in Water</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While foldamers have been extensively studied as protein mimics and especially as &#945;&#8208;helix mimics, their use as capping motif to enhance &#945;&#8208;helix propensity remains comparatively much limited. In this study, we leverage the structural similarities between urea&#8208;based helical foldamers and &#945;&#8208;helix to investigate the efficacy of oligoureas as N&#8208; or C&#8208;caps for reinforcing &#945;&#8208;helical structures in water. Short oligoureas, comprising 3 to 4 residues, were strategically introduced at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus of two peptide sequences (S&#8208;peptide and an Ala&#8208;rich model sequence). The impact of these foldamer insertions on peptide conformation was examined using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and solution NMR. This research identifies specific foldamer sequences capable of promoting a&#8208;helicity when incorporated at either terminus of the peptides. Not only does this work broaden the application scope of foldamers, but it also provides valuable insights into novel strategies for modulating peptide conformation in aqueous environments. The findings presented in this study may have implications for peptide design and the development of bioactive foldamer&#8208;based peptide mimics.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Induced Suppression of PEG Crystallization from the Melt in a PEG&#8208;Peptide Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on crystallization of PEG in an amyloid peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate is investigated by SAXS/WAXS and DSC. The crystallization of PEG is suppressed (with sufficiently high &#945;CD content in the blends) due to complexation with &#945;CD, leading to hexagonal mesophase formation.







Abstract
The influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on PEG crystallization is examined for a peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate, YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3k comprising an amyloid peptide YYKLVFF linked to PEG with molar mass 3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Remarkably, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous synchrotron small&#8208;angle/wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) show that crystallization of PEG is suppressed by &#945;CD, provided that the cyclodextrin content is sufficient. A hexagonal mesophase is formed instead. The &#945;CD threading reduces the conformational flexibility of PEG, and hence suppresses crystallization. These results show that addition of cyclodextrins can be used to tune the crystallization of peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates and potentially other polymer/biomolecular hybrids.

         <title>Catalytic and selective red light&#8208;triggered photodegradation of a G&#8208;quadruplex DNA by a zinc (II) phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives have been regarded as potential G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid&#8208;targeting ligands for anticancer therapy and have been extensively studied as effective photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Understanding how photosensitizers interact with nucleic acids and the subsequent photolytic reactions is essential for deciphering the initial steps of PDT, thereby aiding in the development of new photosensitizing agents. In this study, we found that red&#8208;light irradiation of a mixture of a Zn(II) Pc derivative and an all&#8208;parallel G4 DNA leads to catalytic and selective photodegradation of the DNA by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the Zn(II) Pc derivative bound to DNA through a reaction mechanism similar to that of an enzyme reaction. This finding provides a novel insight into the molecular design of a photosensitizer to enhance its PDT efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor Acidity&#8208;Triggered Bioorthogonal Reactions for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is one of the most serious threats to human health. Over the past few years, researchers have incrementally uncovered the pivotal role of tumor acidity in tumor formation, development and treatment through in&#8208;depth scientific research. In addition, bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used in tumor diagnosis and therapy, owing to their advantageous characteristics, including small ligand size, biocompatibility, fast reaction kinetics, and high chemospecificity. Consequently, bioorthogonal reactions triggered by tumor acidity have become an emerging strategy in biomedical applications. On this basis, we introduce the concept and major strategies of tumor acidity&#8208;triggered bioorthogonal reactions, and review their progress in biomedical applications, with a particular focus on their importance in disease diagnosis and treatment. Finally, clinical challenges and future trends are also outlooked.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing active fragments for drug discovery utilising nitroreductase biocatalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis has played a limited role in the early stages of drug discovery. This is often attributed to the limited substrate scope of enzymes not affording access to vast areas of novel chemical space. Here, we have shown a promiscuous nitroreductase enzyme (NR&#8208;55) can be used to produce a panel of functionalised anilines from a diverse panel of aryl nitro starting materials. After screening on analytical scale, we show that sixteen substrates could be scaled to 1 mmol scale, with several poly&#8208;functional anilines afforded with ease under the standard conditions. The aniline products were also screened for activity against several cell lines of interest, with modest activity observed for one compound. This study demonstrates the potential for nitroreductase biocatalysis to provide access to functional fragments under benign conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalysis with In&#8208;Situ Product Removal Improves p&#8208;Coumaric Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine ammonia lyase suffers from product inhibition, a common issue in biocatalytic processes. An aqueous two&#8208;phase system was developed for the extraction of the product p&#8208;coumaric acid at high pH. Immobilization of tyrosine ammonia lyase allowed for in&#8208;situ product removal in the aqueous two&#8208;phase system, improving the biocatalysis production metrics.







Abstract
Natural and pure p&#8208;coumaric acid has valuable applications, and it can be produced via bioprocessing. However, fermentation processes have so far been unable to provide sufficient production metrics, while a biocatalytic process decoupling growth and production historically showed much promise. This biocatalytic process is revisited in order to tackle product inhibition of the key enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase. In situ product removal is proposed as a possible solution, and a polymer/salt aqueous two&#8208;phase system is identified as a suitable system for extraction of p&#8208;coumaric acid from an alkaline solution, with a partition coefficient of up to 13. However, a 10&#8201;% salt solution was found to reduce tyrosine ammonia lyase activity by 19&#8201;%, leading to the need for a more dilute system. The cloud points of two aqueous two&#8208;phase systems at 40&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;10 were found to be 3.8&#8201;% salt and 9.5&#8201;% polymer, and a 5&#8201;% potassium phosphate and 12.5&#8201;% poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;ran&#8208;propylene glycol) mW~2500 system was selected for in&#8197;situ product removal. An immobilized tyrosine ammonia lyase biocatalyst in this aqueous two&#8208;phase system produced up to 33&#8197;g/L p&#8208;coumaric acid within 24&#8197;hours, a 1.9&#8208;fold improvement compared to biocatalysis without in&#8197;situ product removal.

         <title>Transport of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine to Cancer Cells using Myoglobin&#8208;Albumin Fusion Protein for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive approach to cancer treatment, wherein cell death is initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) production via energy transfer from excited photosensitizers to ground&#8208;state O2. Effective clinical photosensitizers necessitate water solubility for in vivo administration. Hydrophobic dyes, such as phthalocyanines, cannot be used directly as photosensitizers. Herein, we synthesized a myoglobin&#8208;(human serum albumin) fusion protein reconstituted with zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), termed ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical properties of ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA closely resemble those of ZnPc&#8208;substituted Mb. Notably, ZnPc dissociates from ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA and selectively accumulates within cancer cells, while the protein components remain extracellular. Treatment of four distinct cell lines with ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA, followed by red&#8208;light irradiation, effectively induced apoptosis. The half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) against these cancer cell lines ranged between 0.1&#8211;0.5 &#956;M. Reconstituted Mb&#8208;HSA emerges as a promising carrier for transporting various water&#8208;insoluble porphyrinoid photosensitizer to target cancer cells in PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomer&#8208;Dimer Equilibrium of Human Cystatin C During Internalization Into Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental pathway followed within the manuscript. Human cystatin C (hCC) was labeled with sulfo&#8208;Cyanine 5.5 NHS ester (Cy5.5) and incubated with HeLa cells. The internalization of hCC in the cells was monitored with confocal microscopy to understand the influence of the oligomeric state of hCC on the cell membrane&#8208;protein interaction.







Abstract
Human cystatin C (hCC) is a physiologically important protein that serves as intra&#8208; and extracellular cysteine proteinase inhibitor in homeostasis. However, in pathological states it dimerizes and further oligomerizes accumulating into a toxic amyloid. HCC forms an active monomer in the extracellular space and becomes an inactive dimer when internalized in cellular organelles. However, hCC cell penetration and its oligomeric state during this process are not well understood. To determine if and how the oligomeric state influences hCC transmembrane migration, we investigated the internalization of the hCC wild type protein as well as three different mutants, which exclusively exist in the monomeric or multimeric state into HeLa cells via confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results showed that the preferred pathway was endocytosis and that the oligomeric state did not significantly influence the internalization because both monomeric and dimeric hCC migrated into HeLa cells. Considering the differences of the active monomeric and the passive dimeric states of hCC, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the intra and extra cellular functions of hCC and their interaction with cysteine proteases.

         <title>Chemical Production of Cytotoxic Bispecific Antibodies Using the Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the chemical synthesis of bispecific antibodies using two site&#8208;selective conjugation reactions. Seven constructs with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 valency were produced, including two cytotoxic T&#8208;cell engagers with IC50 values in the picomolar range in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for the treatment of several conditions, most importantly cancer. Based on the combination of two different antigen&#8208;binding motifs in a single macromolecule; bsAbs can either display the combined characteristics of their parent antibodies, or new therapeutic features, inaccessible by the sole combination of two distinct antibodies. While bsAbs are traditionally produced by molecular biology techniques, the chemical development of bsAbs holds great promises and strategies have just begun to surface. In this context, we took advantage of a chemical strategy based on the use of the Ugi reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of whole antibodies and coupled the resulting conjugates in a bioorthogonal manner with Fab fragments, derived from various antibodies. We thus managed to produce five different bsAbs with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 valency, with yields ranging from 20&#8201;% to 48&#8201;%, and showed that the affinity of the parent antibody was preserved in all bsAbs. We further demonstrated the interest of our strategy by producing two other bsAbs behaving as cytotoxic T cell engagers with IC50 values in the picomolar range in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Allosteric effects of EF&#8208;G domain I mutations inducing ribosome frameshifting revealed by multiplexed force spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosome translocation catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF&#8208;G) is a critical step in protein synthesis where the ribosome typically moves along the mRNA by three nucleotides at each step. To investigate the mechanism of EF&#8208;G catalysis, it is essential to precisely resolve the ribosome motion at both ends of the mRNA, which, to our best knowledge, is only achieved with the magnetic&#8208;based force spectroscopy developed by our groups. Here, we introduce a novel multiplexed force spectroscopy technique that, for the first time, offers single&#8208;nucleotide resolution for multiple samples. This technique combines multiple acoustic force generators with the smallest atomic magnetometer designed for biological research. Utilizing this technique, we demonstrate that mutating EF&#8208;G at the GTP binding pocket results in the ribosome moving only two nucleotides on both ends of the mRNA, thereby compromising ribosome translocation. This finding suggests a direct link between GTP hydrolysis and ribosome translocation. Our results not only provide mechanistic insights into the role of GTP binding pocket but also illuminate how allosteric mutations can manipulate translocation. We anticipate broader applications of our technique in the ribosome field, leveraging its high efficiency and single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis and Assembly Logic of Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent decades, fungi have emerged as significant sources of diverse hybrid terpenoid natural products,&#160;and&#160;their biosynthetic pathways are increasingly unveiled. This review mainly focuses on elucidating the various strategies underlying the biosynthesis and assembly logic of these compounds. These pathways combine terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks including polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine, resulting in the formation of plenty of hybrid terpenoid natural products via C&#8211;O, C&#8211;C, or C&#8211;N bond linkages. Subsequent tailoring steps, such as oxidation, cyclization, and rearrangement, further enhance the biological diversity and structural complexity of these hybrid terpenoid natural products. Understanding these biosynthetic mechanisms holds promise for the discovery of novel hybrid terpenoid natural products from fungi, which will promote the development of potential drug candidates in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;mediated antibiotic delivery to in vivo biofilm infections: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial biofilms are a significant concern in various medical contexts due to their resilience to our immune system as well as antibiotic therapy. Biofilms often require surgical removal and frequently lead to recurrent or chronic infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved strategies to treat biofilm infections. Ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery is a technique that combines ultrasound application, often with the administration of acoustically&#8208;active agents, to enhance drug delivery to specific target tissues or cells within the body. This method involves using ultrasound waves to assist in the transportation or activation of medications, improving their penetration, distribution, and efficacy at the desired site. The advantages of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery include targeted and localized delivery, reduced systemic side effects, and improved efficacy of the drug at lower doses. This review scrutinizes recent advances in the application of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery for treating biofilm infections, focusing on in vivo studies. We examine the strengths and limitations of this technology in the context of wound infections, device&#8208;associated infections, lung infections and abscesses, and discuss current gaps in knowledge and clinical translation considerations.</dc:description>

         <title>(S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 ACTIVATES AUTOPHAGY VIA TRPML1&#8208;TFEB PATHWAY</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autophagic flux plays a crucial role in various diseases. Recently, the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 has emerged as a promising target in lysosomal storage diseases, such as mucolipidosis. The discovery of mucolipin synthetic agonist&#8208;1 (ML&#8208;SA1) has expanded our understanding of TRPML1's function and its potential therapeutic uses. However, ML&#8208;SA1 is a racemate with limited cellular potency and poor water solubility. In this study, we synthetized rac&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1, separated the enantiomers by chiral liquid chromatography and determined their absolute configuration by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). In addition, we focused on investigating the impact of each enantiomer of ML&#8208;SA1 on the TRPML1&#8208;TFEB axis. Our findings revealed that (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 acts as an agonist for TRPML1 at the lysosomal membrane. This activation prompts transcription factor EB (TFEB) to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus in a dose&#8208;dependent manner within live cells. Consequently, this signaling pathway enhances the expression of coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) genes and activates autophagic flux. Our study presents evidence for the potential use of (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 in the development of new therapies for lysosomal storage diseases that target TRPML1.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;responsive supramolecular hydrogels based on glucosamine derivatives with an aryl sulfide group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels can be obtained via self&#8208;assembly of small molecules in aqueous environments. In this study, we describe the development of oxidation&#8208;responsive supramolecular hydrogels comprising glucosamine derivatives with an aryl sulfide group. We demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide can induce a gel&#8211;sol transition through the oxidation of the sulfide group to the corresponding sulfoxide. Furthermore, we show that this oxidation responsiveness can be extended to photo&#8208;responsiveness with the aid of a photosensitizer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bispecific Chimeric Aptamer Design Platform Based on c&#8208;MET Aptamer with a Replaceable Redundant Region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular engineering enables the creation of aptamers with novel functions, but the prerequisite is a deep understanding of their structure and recognition mechanism. The cellular&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;MET) is garnering significant attention due to the critical role of the c&#8208;MET/HGF signaling pathway in tumor development and invasion. This study reports a strategy for constructing novel chimeric aptamers that bind to both c&#8208;MET and other specific proteins. c&#8208;MET was identified to be the molecular target of a DNA aptamer, HF3&#8208;58, selected through cell&#8208;SELEX. The binding structure and mechanism of HF3&#8208;58 with c&#8208;MET were systematically studied, revealing the scaffold, recognition, and redundancy regions. Through molecular engineering design, the redundancy region was replaced with other aptamers possessing stem&#8208;loop structures, yielding novel chimeric aptamers with bispecificity for binding to c&#8208;MET and specific proteins. A chimeric bispecific aptamer HF&#8208;3b showed the ability to mediate the adhesion of T&#8208;cells to tumor cells, suggesting the prospective utility in tumor immunotherapy. These findings suggest that aptamer HF3&#8208;58 can serve as a molecular engineering platform for the development of diverse multifunctional ligands targeting c&#8208;MET. Moreover, comprehensive understanding of the binding mechanisms of aptamers will provide guidance for the design of functional aptamers, significantly expanding their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoproteomic strategy identifies PfUCHL3 as the target of halofuginone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) continues to pose a significant public health challenge, leading to millions of fatalities globally. Halofuginone (HF) has shown a significant anti&#8208;P. falciparum effect, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for malaria treatment. In this study, we synthesized a photoaffinity labeling probe of HF to identify its direct target in P. falciparum. Our results reveal that ubiquitin carboxyl&#8208;terminal hydrolase 3 (PfUCHL3) acts as a crucial target protein of HF, which modulates parasite growth in the intraerythrocytic cycle. In particular, we discovered that HF potentially forms hydrogen bonds with the Leu10, Glu11, and Arg217 sites of PfUCHL3, thereby inducing an allosteric effect by promoting the embedding of the helix 6&#8217; region on the protein surface. Furthermore, HF disrupts the expression of multiple functional proteins mediated by PfUCHL3, specifically those that play crucial roles in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism in P. falciparum. Taken together, this study highlights PfUCHL3 as a previously undisclosed druggable target of HF, which contributes to the development of novel anti&#8208;malarial agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of smartphone&#8208;integrated nanozyme sensor based on amino acid&#8208;modulated gold nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acids are not only the building blocks of proteins but also lead to the development of novel nanomaterials with unique properties. Herein, we proposed a simple strategy to produce gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activities by using a series of amino acids as reducing agents, named Au NPs@M (M represents different amino acids). The Au NPs@His was identified as the nanozyme with the most potent catalytic performance, which was used in combination with smartphones to achieve rapid detection of hydrogen peroxide with a detection limit of 0.966 &#956;M. It also enables rapid detection of glucose with a detection limit of 2.904 &#956;M, highlighting the significant contribution of Au NPs@His in expediting the detection of critical biomolecules. This work not only provides a convenient and highly efficient method to identify glucose but also shows the potential of histidine as a reducing agent in constructing Au nanomaterials exerting enzyme&#8208;like catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Chemical Reactions for Studying Nucleic Acids and Their Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tools are highly necessary to study the diverse structures, intricate functions, and complex interactions of nucleic acids, further laying the foundation for investigating their biological and physiological roles within multiple contexts. This work reviews the recent advances of chemical and enzyme&#8208;mediated chemical reactions applied to nucleobases, naturally occurring base modification variants, and ribose ring.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are genetic information&#8208;carrying molecules inside cells. Apart from basic nucleotide building blocks, there exist various naturally occurring chemical modifications on nucleobase and ribose moieties, which greatly increase the encoding complexity of nuclei acids, contribute to the alteration of nucleic acid structures, and play versatile regulation roles in gene expression. To study the functions of certain nucleic acids in various biological contexts, robust tools to specifically label and identify these macromolecules and their modifications, and to illuminate their structures are highly necessary. In this review, we summarize recent technique advances of using chemical and enzyme&#8208;mediated chemical reactions to study nucleic acids and their modifications and structures. By highlighting the chemical principles of these techniques, we aim to present a perspective on the advancement of the field as well as to offer insights into developing specific chemical reactions and precise enzyme catalysis utilized for nucleic acids and their modifications.

         <title>Fluorinated Tags to Study Protein Conformation and Interactions Using 19F&#8201;NMR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8216;Tagging&#8217; proteins with fluorinated groups provides a tool to observe protein behavior at the atomic level using 19F&#8197;NMR. This background&#8208;free, environmentally&#8208;sensitive method allows researchers to study protein conformation, folding, aggregation and ligand/drug binding. Chemical tagging also allows the use of a much larger pool of fluorinated reporters with tunable chemical shifts and sensitivities compared to biosynthetic methods.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine atoms into a biomacromolecule provides a background&#8208;free and environmentally sensitive reporter of structure, conformation and interactions using 19F&#8197;NMR. There are several methods to introduce the 19F reporter &#8211; either by synthetic incorporation via solid phase peptide synthesis; by suppressing the incorporation or biosynthesis of a natural amino acid and supplementing the growth media with a fluorinated counterpart during protein expression; and by genetic code expansion to add new amino acids to the amino acid alphabet. This review aims to discuss progress in the field of introducing fluorinated handles into biomolecules for NMR studies by post&#8208;translational bioconjugation or &#8216;fluorine&#8208;tagging&#8217;. We will discuss the range of chemical tagging &#8216;warheads&#8217; that have been used, explore the applications of fluorine tags, discuss ways to enhance reporter sensitivity and how the signal to noise ratios can be boosted. Finally, we consider some key challenges of the field and offer some ideas for future directions.

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tagging&#8217; proteins with fluorinated groups provides a tool to observe protein behavior at the atomic level using &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR. This background-free, environmentally-sensitive method allows researchers to study protein conformation, folding, aggregation and ligand/drug binding. Chemical tagging also allows the use of a much larger pool of fluorinated reporters with tunable chemical shifts and sensitivities compared to biosynthetic methods.

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Assisted NIR Triggered in&#8208;Situ Polymerized Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are commonly used as wound dressings to help maintain a moist environment around the wound and isolate contaminants, thus promoting healing. For irregular wounds, the slow healing process and even infection may occur due to the inability of dressings to adhere well to the wound.&#160;Prussian blue (PB)&#160;is a metal&#8208;organic framework&#160;(MOF)&#160;material with excellent photothermal conversion and superior stability. In this paper, a kind of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#160;light triggered in&#8208;situ&#160;polymerized antimicrobial hydrogel was prepared. The free radical initiator was&#160;encapsulated in the hollow PB by a phase change material&#160;(PCM)&#160;to maintain stability.
The&#160;raised temperature triggered by NIR&#160;induced the release and decomposition of the initiator. The matrix was formed by the cross&#8208;linking of double bonds on modified chitosan. The quaternary amine groups of modified chitosan and the photothermal properties of PB enhanced the antimicrobial properties of the hydrogel. High&#8208;quality wound healing was demonstrated in the whole skin defect model. This study provides a new reference for the preparation of in&#8208;situ&#160;polymerized hydrogel dressings for irregular wounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Effects on Subcellular Organelle Localization in Live&#8208;cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D&#8208;p&#8208;A indole&#8208;containing fluorescent probes were developed followed by an investigation of their photophysical properties and compounds' suitability for subcellular imaging in living cells. We demonstrate that the preference for mitochondrial localization was lost when morpholine was substituted, resulting in the accumulation of the molecule in the lysosomes. However, interestingly, the presence of a nitro group led to their localization within the lipid droplets despite the presence of the morpholine pendant. We also showcase the probes' sensitivity to pH, the influence of added chloroquine, and the temperature response on the changes in fluorescence intensity within lysosomes. The design of the probes with strong intramolecular charge transfer and substantial Stokes shift could facilitate extensive application in various cellular lysosomal models and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in stimuli&#8208;responsive diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Uracil&#8208;selective Cross&#8208;linking in RNA and Inhibition of miRNA Function by 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinyl&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine Deoxynucleosides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through RNA interference. Consequently, miRNA inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), have attracted attention for treating miRNA overexpression. To achieve efficient inhibition, we developed 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine (AVP) nucleosides that form covalent bonds with uridine counterparts in RNA. We demonstrated that mRNA cross&#8208;linked with AVP&#8208;conjugated antisense oligonucleotides with AVP were protected from gene silencing by exogenous miRNA. However, endogenous miRNA function could not be inhibited in cells, probably because of slow cross&#8208;linking kinetics. We recently developed ADpVP, an AVP derivative bearing a 7&#8208;propynyl group&#8212;which boasts faster reaction rate than the original AVP. Here, we synthesized dADpVP&#8212;a deoxy analog of ADpVP&#8212;through a simplified synthesis protocol. Evaluation of the cross&#8208;linking reaction revealed that the reaction kinetics of dADpVP were comparable to those of ADpVP. In addition, structural analysis of the cross&#8208;linked adduct discovered N3 linkage against uridine. Incorporating dADpVP into two types of miRNA inhibitors revealed a marginal impact on AMO efficacy yet improved the performance of target site blockers. These results indicate the potential of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides for indirect miRNA function inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Peptidoglycan Synthesis in the Gut Commensal Akkermansia Muciniphila with Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We here present cyclopropene and isonitrile functionalized analogs of d&#8208;Ala dipeptides, essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as new members of the bacterial metabolic labeling toolkit. These non&#8208;toxic, tetrazine click&#8208;compatible probes allowed us to detect and image peptidoglycan in live Akkermansia muciniphila bacteria. Their effectiveness in this anaerobic bacterium and also aerobic bacteria (E. coli) shows their potential for in&#8197;situ study of peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Our gut microbiota directly influences human physiology in health and disease. The myriad of surface glycoconjugates in both the bacterial cell envelope and our gut cells dominate the microbiota&#8208;host interface and play a critical role in host response and microbiota homeostasis. Among these, peptidoglycan is the basic glycan polymer offering the cell rigidity and a basis on which many other glycoconjugates are anchored. To directly study peptidoglycan in gut commensals and obtain the molecular insight required to understand their functional activities we need effective techniques like chemical probes to label peptidoglycan in live bacteria. Here we report a chemically guided approach to study peptidoglycan in a key mucin&#8208;degrading gut microbiota member of the Verrucomicrobia phylum, Akkermansia muciniphila. Two novel non&#8208;toxic tetrazine click&#8208;compatible peptidoglycan probes with either a cyclopropene or isonitrile handle allowed for the detection and imaging of peptidoglycan synthesis in this intestinal species.

         <title>Matching Together Living Cells and Prototissues: Will There Be Chemistry?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scientific advancements in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology have led to the development of numerous models of synthetic cells, or protocells. To date, research has mainly focused on increasing the (bio)chemical complexity of these bioinspired micro&#8208;compartmentalized systems, yet the successful integration of protocells with living cells remains one of the major challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. In this review, we aim to summarize the current state of the art in hybrid protocell/living cell and prototissue/living cell systems. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in tissue engineering, we review the chemical, bio&#8208;chemical, and mechano&#8208;chemical aspects that hold promise for achieving an effective integration of non&#8208;living and living matter. The future production of fully integrated protocell/living cell systems and increasingly complex prototissue/living tissue systems not only has the potential to revolutionize the field of tissue engineering, but also paves the way for new technologies in (bio)sensing, personalized therapy, and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The high&#8208;fidelity sesquiterpene cyclase (&#8208;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol synthase (GdolS) converts farnesyl diphosphate into the macrocyclic alcohol (&#8208;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis was used to decipher the role of key residues in the water control mechanism. Replacement of Ala176, located in the G1/2 helix, with non&#8208;polar aliphatic residues of increasing size (valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine) resulted in the accumulation of the non&#8208;hydroxylated products germacrene A and germacrene D. In contrast, hydroxylation was maintained when the polar residues threonine, glutamine or aspartate replaced Ala176. Additionally, although a contribution of His150 to the nucleophilic water addition could be ruled out, the imidazole ring of His150 appears to assist carbocation stabilisation. The results presented here shed light on how hydroxylating sesquiterpene synthases can be engineered to design modified sesquiterpene synthases to reduce the need for further steps in the biocatalytic production of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids,</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Generation of Hydrogen Polysulfides (H2Sn) with Thioglucose, Glucose Oxidase, and Chloroperoxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn) have emerged as critical physiological mediators that are closely associated with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) signaling. H2Sn exhibit greater nucleophilicity than H2S while also having electrophilic characteristics, enabling unique activities such as protein S&#8208;persulfidation. Despite their physiological importance, mechanisms and reactivities of H2Sn remain inadequately explored due to their inherent instability in aqueous environments. Consequently, there is a need to develop biocompatible methods for controlled H2Sn generation to elucidate their behaviors in biological contexts. Herein, we present a dual enzyme system (containing glucose oxidase (GOx) and chloroperoxidase (CPO)) with thioglucose as the substrate to facilitate the controlled release of H2Sn. Fluorescence measurements with SSP4 and the trapping studies allowed us to confirm the production of H2Sn. Such a method may be useful in elucidating the reactivity of hydrogen polysulfides in biological systems as well as provide a potential delivery of H2Sn to target sites for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Resolution of an Epitope Recognized by Blood Group Antibodies Capable of Binding Both A and B Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high specificity of human antibodies to blood group A and B antigens is impressive, especially when considering the structural difference between these antigens (tetrasaccharides) is a NHAc versus a OH&#8208;group on the terminal monosaccharide residue. It is well established that in addition to anti&#8208;A and anti&#8208;B there is a third antibody, anti&#8208;A,B capable of recognizing both A and B antigens. To analyze this AB specificity, we synthesized a tetrasaccharide, where the NHAc of the A antigen was replaced with NH2. This NH2&#8208;group was used to attach the glycan to an affinity resin, creating an AB&#8208;epitope (ABep) adsorbent where the critical site for recognition by A and B antibodies was not accessible, while the rest of the (conformationally compact) tetrasaccharide remained accessible. Anti&#8208;ABep antibodies were isolated from blood group O donors and found to have expected A,B&#8208;specificity against immobilized and red cell bound synthetic antigens, including ABep, and were able to agglutinate both A and B red cells. The amount of these anti&#8208;ABep (anti&#8208;A,B) antibodies found in the blood of group O donors was comparable to levels of anti&#8208;A and anti&#8208;B found in group B and A individuals. Using STD&#8208;NMR the location for the AB&#8208;epitope on the tetrasaccharide was found.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is one of the most powerful techniques that meet the needs of analysis and detection in a variety of scenarios, because of its highly analytical sensitivity and excellent spatiotemporal controllability. ECL combined with microscopy (ECLM) offers a promising approach for quantifying and mapping a wide range of analytes. To date, ECLM has been widely used to image biological entities and processes, such as cells, subcellular structures, proteins and membrane transport properties. In this review, we first introduced the mechanisms of several classic ECL systems, then highlighted the progress of visual biosensing and bioimaging by ECLM in the last decade. Finally, the characteristics of ECLM were summarized, as well as some of the current challenges. The future research interests and potential directions for the application of ECLM were also outlooked.</dc:description>

         <title>New Frontiers in Nonheme Enzymatic Oxyferryl Species</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron dependent (NHM&#8208;Fe) enzymes exhibit exceedingly diverse catalytic reactivities. Despite their catalytic versatilities, the mononuclear iron centers in these enzymes show a relatively simple architecture, in which an iron atom is ligated with 2&#8208;4 amino acid residues, including histidine, aspartic or glutamic acid. In the past two decades, a common high&#8208;valent reactive iron intermediate, the S = 2 oxoferryl (Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo or Fe(IV)=O) species, has been repeatedly discovered in NHM&#8208;Fe enzymes containing a 2&#8208;His&#8208;Fe or 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;Fe center. However, for 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes, no common reactive intermediate has been identified. Recently, we have spectroscopically characterized the first S = 1 Fe(IV) intermediate in a 3&#8208;His&#8208;Fe containing enzyme, OvoA, which catalyzes a novel oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation. In this review, we summarize the broad reactivities demonstrated by S = 2 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates, the discovery of the first S = 1 Fe(IV) intermediate in OvoA and the mechanistic implication of such a discovery, and the intrinsic reactivity differences of the S = 2 and the S = 1 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo species. Finally, we postulate the possible reasons to utilize an S = 1 Fe(IV) species in OvoA and their implications to other 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reported chemoenzymatic strategy involves the employment of vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate as an irreversible acyl donor in a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. This biotransformation is achieved in a sequential manner using CAL&#8208;B to affect the kinetic resolution, followed by a simple acidic extractive work&#8208;up furnishing both KR products with excellent enantioselectivity (E&gt;200; up to 98% ee). The elaborated method eliminates a single&#8208;use silica gel chromatographic separation and significantly reduces organic solvent consumption to foster a more environmentally friendly chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of HphA: the First Enzyme in the Homologation Pathway of l&#8208;Phenylalanine and l&#8208;Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homologation of amino acids is the insertion or deletion of a methylene group to their side chain, which is a relatively uncommon chemical transformation observed in peptide natural product (NP) structure. Homologated amino acids can potentially make the NP more stable in a biological system, but its biosynthesis is yet to be understood. This study biochemically characterized the first of three unexplored enzymes in the homologation pathway of l&#8208;phenylalanine and l&#8208;tyrosine. Previously proposed reactions catalyzed by HphA were confirmed by reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The substrate profile and kinetic parameters showed high selectivity for the natural substrates and their close analogs. The comparability of HphA to homologous enzymes in primary metabolic pathways, 2&#8208;isopropylmate synthase and homocitrate synthase which are involved in l&#8208;leucine and l&#8208;lysine biosynthesis, respectively, was validated by bioinformatical and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies. The knowledge obtained from this study has deepened the understanding of the homologation of amino acids, which can lead to future combinatorial biosynthesis and metabolic engineering studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Glycerolipid Metabolism using a Caged Clickable Glycerol&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphate Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report describes a strategy for general metabolic labeling and imaging of glycerolipid metabolism using a caged and clickable glycerol 3&#8208;phosphate probe (SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3). This probe is shown to infiltrate a wide range of lipids and enable detection, post&#8208;derivatization, and imaging in yeast cells.







Abstract
In this study, we present the probe SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3 as a novel tool for metabolic labeling of glycerolipids (GLs) to investigate lipid metabolism in yeast cells. By introducing a clickable azide handle onto the glycerol backbone, this probe enables general labeling of glycerolipids. Additionally, this probe contains a caged phosphate moiety at the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position to not only facilitate probe uptake by masking negative charge but also to bypass the phosphorylation step crucial for initiating phospholipid synthesis, thereby enhancing phospholipid labeling. The metabolic labeling activity of the probe was thoroughly assessed through cellular fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and thin&#8208;layer chromatography (TLC) experiments. Fluorescence microscopy analysis demonstrated successful incorporation of the probe into yeast cells, with labeling predominantly localized at the plasma membrane. LCMS analysis confirmed metabolic labeling of various phospholipid species (PC, PS, PA, PI, and PG) and neutral lipids (MAG, DAG, and TAG), and GL labeling was corroborated by TLC. These results showcased the potential of the SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3 probe in studying GL metabolism, offering a versatile and valuable approach to explore the intricate dynamics of lipids in yeast cells.

         <title>Synthesis of New Bodipy Hydrazide Fluorescent Probes for the Detection of Carbonylated Proteins Generated by Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. We report the design and the synthesis of new BODIPY possessing a hydrazide function (BODIPY&#8722;Hz), an emission in the near&#8208;infra red area and high quantum yield. We show the use of these new BODIPY&#8722;Hz as fluorescent probes for carbonylated proteins labeling. We demonstrate that the new BODIPY&#8722;Hz are compatible with the 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis technology, and that it can be used directly for proteins labeling in cells monitored by fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Oxidative stress is a cellular disorder implicated in various severe diseases and redox biology and represents an important field of research for the last decades. One of the major consequences of oxidative stress is the carbonylation of proteins, which is also a reliable marker to assess protein oxidative modifications. Accumulation of carbonylated proteins has been associated with aging and age&#8208;related diseases and can ultimately causes cell death. Detection of these oxidative modifications is essential to understand and discover new treatments against oxidative stress. We describe the design and the synthetic pathway of new BODIPY fluorescent probes functionalized with hydrazide function for protein carbonyl labeling to improve existing methodologies such as 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis. Hydrazide BODIPY analogues show very good fluorescent properties such as NIR emission up to 633&#8197;nm and quantum yield up to 0.88. These new probes were validated for the detection and quantification of carbonylated proteins with 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis using mouse muscle protein extracts, as well as both flow cytometry and microscopy using oxidant stressed C2 C12 cells.

         <title>Task&#8208;Similarity is a Crucial Factor for Few&#8208;Shot Meta&#8208;Learning of Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;learning has emerged as a promising strategy to facilitate efficient few&#8208;shot model training for a specific target of interest. Here, we show that the performance of the meta&#8208;learned model critically depends on the correlation &#8211; captured in terms of molecular similarity and target activity &#8211; between the specific target of interest and the training data used to meta&#8208;learn the model.







Abstract
Machine learning models support computer&#8208;aided molecular design and compound optimization. However, the initial phases of drug discovery often face a scarcity of training data for these models. Meta&#8208;learning has emerged as a potentially promising strategy, harnessing the wealth of structure&#8208;activity data available for known targets to facilitate efficient few&#8208;shot model training for the specific target of interest. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of two different meta&#8208;learning methods, namely model&#8208;agnostic meta&#8208;learning (MAML) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF), specifically in the regression setting. We investigated how factors such as dataset size and the similarity of training tasks impact predictability. The results indicate that ADKF significantly outperformed both MAML and a single&#8208;task baseline model on the inhibition data. However, the performance of ADKF varied across different test tasks. Our findings suggest that considerable enhancements in performance can be anticipated primarily when the task of interest is similar to the tasks incorporated in the meta&#8208;learning process.

         <title>Synthesis and Thermodynamic Evaluation of Sialyl&#8208;Tn MUC1 Glycopeptides Binding to Macrophage Galactose&#8208;Type Lectin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between the tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigens of Mucin 1 (MUC1) and the carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins, lectins, often lead to the creation of a pro&#8208;tumor microenvironment favoring tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Macrophage galactose binding lectin (MGL) is a C&#8208;type lectin receptor found on antigen&#8208;presenting cells that facilitates the uptake of carbohydrate antigens for antigen presentation, modulating the immune response homeostasis, autoimmunity, and cancer. Considering the crucial role of tumor&#8208;associated forms of MUC1 and MGL in tumor immunology, a thorough understanding of their binding interaction is essential for it to be exploited for cancer vaccine strategies. The synthesis of MUC1 glycopeptide models carrying a single or multiple Tn and/or sialyl&#8208;Tn antigen(s) is described. A novel approach for the sialyl&#8208;Tn threonine building block suitable for the solid phase peptide synthesis was developed. The thermodynamic profile of the binding interaction between the human MGL and MUC1 glycopeptide models was analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry. The measured dissociation constants for the sialyl&#8208;Tn&#8208;bearing peptide epitopes were consistently lower compared to the Tn antigen and ranged from 10 &#956;M for mono&#8208; to 100 nM for triglycosylated MUC1 peptide, respectively. All studied interactions, regardless of the glycan&#8217;s site of attachment or density, exhibited enthalpy&#8208;driven thermodynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;resolution imaging reveals the mechanism of endosomal acidification inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, super&#8208;resolution structured illumination microscope (SIM) was used to analyze molecular mechanism of endocytic acidification inhibitors in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic, such as Chloroquine (CQ), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). We fluorescently labeled the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and its receptor ACE2 protein with small molecule dyes. Utilizing SIM imaging, the real&#8208;time impact of inhibitors (BafA1, CQ, HCQ, Dynasore) on the RBD&#8208;ACE2 endocytotic process was dynamically tracked in living cells. Initially, the protein activity of RBD and ACE2 was ensured after being labeled. And then our findings revealed that these inhibitors could inhibit the internalization and degradation of RBD&#8208;ACE2 to varying degrees. Among them, 100 nM BafA1 exhibited the most satisfactory endocytotic inhibition (~63.9%) and protein degradation inhibition (~97.7%). And it could inhibit the fusion between endocytic vesicles in the living cells. Additionally, Dynasore, a widely recognized dynein inhibitor, also demonstrated cell acidification inhibition effects. Together, these inhibitors collectively hinder SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection by inhibiting both the viral internalization and RNA release. The comprehensive evaluation of pharmacological mechanisms through super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging has laid a crucial theoretical foundation for the development of potential drugs to treat COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <title>A Naphthalimide Based &#8220;Turn&#8208;ON&#8221; Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Imaging of Lipid&#8208;Droplet in Living Cells With an Excellent Selectivity</title>

Due to its turn&#8208;ON response to apolar environment, the 4&#8208;DiMe&#8208;ANI enables wash&#8208;free imaging of lipid droplets in living cells with excellent LD/cytosol signal ratio







Abstract
The impacts of dimethylation of 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide (ANI) on its photophysical properties are reported. The resulting 4&#8208;DiMe&#8208;ANI displays completely different fluorescence properties, conferring it ability to selectively label lipid droplets in living cells. A comprehensive photophysical study revealed that this selectivity arises from an Internal Charge Transfer favored in lipophilic media to the detriment of a non&#8208;emissive TICT in more polar media. This results in a very high &#8220;LDs/Cytosol&#8221; signal ratio, enabling LDs to be imaged with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and positioning its performance above that of the BODIPY 493/503 commonly used to image LDs.

         <title>Amplification&#8208; and Enzyme&#8208;Free Magnetic Diagnostics Circuit for Whole&#8208;Genome Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a first&#8208;in&#8208;class magnetic signal amplification circuit (MAC) for detecting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA genome. The MAC combines the specificity of toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement with the sensitivity of magnetic response of MNPs to declustering processes. Using MAC, we detected the N gene of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in an amplification&#8208;, enzyme&#8208; and wash&#8208;free manner at 25&#8201;&#176;C at a concentration of 104 RNA copies/&#956;l.







Abstract
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) requires thermal cycling and enzymatic reactions for sequence amplification, hampering their applications in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) settings. Magnetic bioassays based on magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are isothermal, wash&#8208;free, and can be quantitative. Realizing them amplification&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;free on a benchtop device, they will become irreplaceable for POC applications. Here we demonstrate a first&#8208;in&#8208;class magnetic signal amplification circuit (MAC) that enables detection of whole genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by combining the specificity of toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement with the magnetic response of MNPs to declustering processes. Using MAC, we detect the N gene of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 samples at a concentration of 104 RNA copies/&#956;l as determined by droplet digital PCR. Further, we demonstrate that MAC can reliably distinguish between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other human coronaviruses. Being a wash&#8208;, amplification&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;free biosensing concept and working at isothermal conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C) on a low&#8208;cost benchtop MPS device, our MAC biosensing concept offers several indispensable features for translating nucleic acid detection to POC applications.

         <title>Binding and Stabilization of a Semiquinone Radical by an Artificial Metalloenzyme Containing a Binuclear Copper (II) Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was obtained by insertion of a binuclear copper complex coupled to a lauric acid anchor into &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin, using the Trojan Horse strategy. The resulting biohybrid did not show any catecholase activity as it efficiently stabilized the intermediate 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;semi&#8208;quinone radical (DTB&#8208;SQ).







Abstract
A binuclear Cu(II) cofactor was covalently bound to a lauric acid anchor. The resulting conjugate was characterized then combined with beta&#8208;lactoglobulin (&#946;LG) to generate a new biohybrid following the so&#8208;called &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; strategy. This biohybrid was examined for its effectiveness in the oxidation of a catechol derivative to the corresponding quinone. The resulting biohybrid did not exhibit the sought after catecholase activity, likely due to its ability to bind and stabilize the semiquinone radical intermediate DTB&#8208;SQ. This semi&#8208;quinone radical was stabilized only in the presence of the protein and was characterized using optical and magnetic spectroscopic techniques, demonstrating stability for over 16&#8197;hours. Molecular docking studies revealed that this stabilization could occur owing to interactions of the semi&#8208;quinone with hydrophobic amino acid residues of &#946;LG.

         <dc:description>
Reviewing computational methods for Enzyme Engineering in the era of Machine Learning: A concise overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods, ranging from property engineering to the de novo design of enzymes, with an emphasis on user&#8208;friendly tools that are freely accessible as web&#8208;interfaces.







Abstract
Enzyme engineering, though pivotal across various biotechnological domains, is often plagued by its time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive nature. This review aims to offer an overview of supportive in silico methodologies for this demanding endeavor. Starting from methods to predict protein structures, to classification of their activity and even the discovery of new enzymes we continue with describing tools used to increase thermostability and production yields of selected targets. Subsequently, we discuss computational methods to modulate both, the activity as well as selectivity of enzymes. Last, we present recent approaches based on cutting&#8208;edge machine learning methods to redesign enzymes. With exception of the last chapter, there is a strong focus on methods easily accessible via web&#8208;interfaces or simple Python&#8208;scripts, therefore readily useable for a diverse and broad community.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of Protein Containing Thiotyrosine as an Active Site Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;canonical amino acid thiotyrosine was incorporated into a small cyclic protein by chemical synthesis. Thanks to the aryl&#8208;thiol containing side chain, it is able to serve as a catalyst for ester hydrolysis and native chemical ligation of peptides.







Abstract
Native chemical ligation is a key reaction in the toolbox of chemical methods for the synthesis of native and modified proteins. The catalysis of ligation is commonly performed by using small aryl&#8208;thiol molecules added at high concentrations. In this work, we incorporated thiotyrosine, a non&#8208;canonical amino acid containing an aryl&#8208;thiol moiety, into a designed cyclic protein &#171; sans queue ni t&#234;te &#187;. Importantly, the protein environment reduced the pKa of the thiol group to 5.8&#8211;5.9, which is significantly lower than the previously reported value for thiotyrosine in a short peptide (pKa 6.4). Furthermore, we demonstrated the catalytic activity of this protein both as hydrolase and in native chemical ligation of peptides. These results will be useful for the development of efficient protein catalysts (enzymes) for protein synthesis and modification.

         <title>Proteomic Profiling of Antimalarial Plasmodione Using 3&#8208;Benz(o)ylmenadione Affinity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe here the design, synthesis and evaluation of an antiplasmodial 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;menadione probe for affinity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments using yeast and P. falciparum parasite lysates. These studies allowed us to identify a first list of proteins interacting with plasmodione in both yeast and P. falciparum late trophozoites.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms of drug action in malarial parasites is crucial for the development of new drugs to combat infection and to counteract drug resistance. Proteomics is a widely used approach to study host&#8208;pathogen systems and to identify drug protein targets. Plasmodione is an antiplasmodial early&#8208;lead drug exerting potent activities against young asexual and sexual blood stages in&#8197;vitro with low toxicity to host cells. To elucidate its molecular mechanisms, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) approach was applied to yeast and P. falciparum proteomes. New (pro&#8208;) AfBPP probes based on the 3&#8208;benz(o)yl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;menadione scaffold were synthesized. With optimized conditions of both photoaffinity labeling and click reaction steps, the AfBPP protocol was then applied to a yeast proteome, yielding 11 putative drug&#8208;protein targets. Among these, we found four proteins associated with oxidoreductase activities, the hypothesized type of targets for plasmodione and its metabolites, and other proteins associated with the mitochondria. In Plasmodium parasites, the MS analysis revealed 44 potential plasmodione targets that need to be validated in further studies. Finally, the localization of a 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoromenadione AfBPP probe was studied in the subcellular structures of the parasite at the trophozoite stage.

&lt;p&gt;We describe here the design, synthesis and evaluation of an antiplasmodial 3-benzyl-6-fluoro-menadione probe for affinity-based protein profiling experiments using yeast and &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasite lysates. These studies allowed us to identify a first list of proteins interacting with plasmodione in both yeast and &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; late trophozoites.

         <title>Using F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to Understand the Ubiquitination Landscape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a critical and detailed analysis for the use of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a tool to study protein ubiquitination. Topics include the unique approaches where FRET is used to quantify the transfer of ubiquitin through the E1, E2 and E3 enzymes of the ubiquitination cascade, the removal of ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes and the processing of ubiquitin&#8208;labelled proteins by the 26S&#8197;proteasome. FRET methods have enabled protein interactions, conformational changes and dynamics of the ubiquitination pathway to be measured that can be adapted to several high&#8208;throughput technologies and on the single molecule level.







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a fluorescence technique that allows quantitative measurement of protein interactions, kinetics and dynamics. This review covers the use of FRET to study the structures and mechanisms of ubiquitination and related proteins. We survey FRET assays that have been developed where donor and acceptor fluorophores are placed on E1, E2 or E3 enzymes and ubiquitin (Ub) to monitor steady&#8208;state and real&#8208;time transfer of Ub through the ubiquitination cascade. Specialized FRET probes placed on Ub and Ub&#8208;like proteins have been developed to monitor Ub removal by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that result in a loss of a FRET signal upon cleavage of the FRET probes. FRET has also been used to understand conformational changes in large complexes such as multimeric E3 ligases and the proteasome, frequently using sophisticated single molecule methods. Overall, FRET is a powerful tool to help unravel the intricacies of the complex ubiquitination system.

         <title>Crystallization Assisted Dynamic Kinetic Resolution for the Synthesis of (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of enzymatic synthesis with in&#8197;situ product crystallization (ISPC) is used to convert 2&#8208;phenylpropanal to (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine. Product concentrations of up to 250&#8197;mM and enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% are reached in a DKR&#8208;based reaction. The source of substrate decomposition during the reaction is investigated and the byproduct formation is reduced to insignificant levels.







Abstract
This study explores a combination of the concept of enantioselective enzymatic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;chiral amines through transamination with in&#8197;situ product crystallization (ISPC) to overcome product inhibition. Using 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a readily available and easily racemizing substrate of choice, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine ((R)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;amine) concentrations of up to 250&#8197;mM and enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% are achieved when using a commercially available transaminase from Ruegeria pomeroyi in a fed&#8208;batch based dynamic kinetic resolution reaction on preparative scale. The source of substrate decomposition during the reaction is also investigated and the resulting unwanted byproduct formation is successfully reduced to insignificant levels.

         <title>Detoxification of V&#8208;Nerve Agents Assisted by a Microperoxidase: New Pathway Revealed by the Use of a Relevant VX Simulant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalyzed oxidative detoxification of the V&#8208;series simulant PhX with the microperoxidase AcMP11 affords the corresponding phosphonothioate as the prominent product instead of the classical P&#8722;S and P&#8722;O bond cleavage. These results highlight the efficacy of AcMP11 to efficiently detoxify V&#8208;series organophosphorus nerve agents and the necessity to use relevant simulants, such as PhX, to prevent false positive/negative results.







Abstract
The biocatalyzed oxidative detoxification of the V&#8208;series simulant PhX, by mean of the microperoxidase AcMP11, affords the corresponding phosphonothioate as the prominent product instead of the classical P&#8722;S and P&#8722;O bond cleavage. While PhX is structurally very close to the live agent VX (the methyl group is replaced by a phenyl), assessment with other surrogates missing the nucleophilic amino function displayed more resistance under the same conditions with no phosphonothioate observed. These encouraging results highlight 1) the efficacy of AcMP11 microperoxidase to efficiently detoxify V&#8208;series organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA), and 2) the necessity to use representative alkyl or aryl phosphonothioates simulants such as PhX bearing the appropriate side chain as well as the P&#8722;O and P&#8722;S cleavable bond to mimic accurately the V&#8208;series OPNA to prevent false positive or false negative results.
