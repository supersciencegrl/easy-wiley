         <title>Chemical Probes for Profiling of MALT1 Protease Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The paracaspase MALT1 is a key regulator of the human immune response. It is implicated in a variety of human diseases. For example, deregulated protease activity drives the survival of malignant lymphomas and is involved in the pathophysiology of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. Thus, MALT1 has attracted attention as promising drug target. While many MALT1 inhibitors have been identified, molecular tools to study MALT1 activity, target engagement and inhibition in complex biological samples, such as living cells and patient material, are still scarce. Such tools are valuable to validate MALT1 as a drug target in vivo and to assess yet unknown biological roles of MALT1. In this review we discuss the recent literature on the development and biological application of molecular tools to study MALT1 activity and inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Chemistry Platform for the Development of a Cereblon E3 Ligase&#8208;Based Partial PROTAC Library</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular platform for the synthesis of ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;connected lenalidomide&#8208;derived CRBN E3 ligase ligands and a partial PROTAC library under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions is described. This method allows to systematically introduce linkers with subtle differences in length and orientation to examine their effect for the activity of PROTACs against any potential targets.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising therapeutic strategy to selectively promote the degradation of protein targets by exploiting the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. Among the limited number of E3 ligase ligands discovered for the PROTAC technology, ligands of cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase, such as pomalidomide, thalidomide, or lenalidomide, are the most frequently used for the development of PROTACs. Our group previously reported that a phenyl group could be tolerated on the C4&#8208;position of lenalidomide as the ligand of CRBN to develop PROTACs. Herein, we report a modular chemistry platform for the efficient attachment of various ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;substituted phenyls to the C4&#8208;position of the lenalidomide via Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which allows the systematic investigation of the linker effect for the development of PROTACs against any target. We examined the substrate scope by preparing twelve lenalidomide&#8208;derived CRBN E3 ligase ligands with different linkers.

         <title>Design of Cationic Lipids with Acetal Linkers: Conformational Preferences, Hydrolytic Stability, and High Drug&#8208;Loading Abilities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design, synthesis, and biophysical characterizations of a library of cationic lipid analogous containing an acetal residue in the linker region (CALs) are presented. These CALs could be conveniently prepared through a trans&#8208;acetalization protocol from commercially available precursors.







Abstract
Lipids are key constituents of numerous biomedical drug delivery technologies. Here, we present the design, synthesis and biophysical characterizations of a library of cationic lipids containing an acetal residue in their linker region. These cationic acetal lipids (CALs) were conveniently prepared through a trans&#8208;acetalization protocol from commercially available precursors. NMR studies highlighted the conformational rigidity at the acetal residue and the high hydrolytic stability of these CALs. Fluorescence anisotropy studies revealed that the CAL with a pyridinium headgroup (CAL1) formed highly cohesive vesicular aggregates in water. These structural and self&#8208;assembly features of the CAL1 allowed up to 196&#8201;% w/w loading of curcumin (Cur) as a representative hydrophobic drug. A reconstitutable formulation of Cur was obtained as a result, which could deliver the drug inside mammalian cells with very high efficiency. The hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility of CAL1 was significantly enhanced by creating a coating of polydopamine (PDA) onto its vesicular assemblies to produce hybrid lipid&#8208;polymer nanocapsules. This work demonstrates rapid access to the useful synthetic lipid formulations with high potential in drug and gene delivery applications.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Carboline Alkaloids Resist the Aggregation and Cytotoxicity of Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;carboline alkaloids harmine and harmol effectively impede the fibril formation and cytotoxicity of human islet amyloid polypeptide. Both of them change the morphology of peptide aggregates and upregulate the cell viability by reducing peptide oligomerization.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Carboline alkaloids have a variety of pharmacological activities, such as antitumor, antibiosis and antidiabetes. Harmine and harmol are two structurally similar &#946;&#8208;carbolines that occur in many medicinal plants. In this work, we chose harmine and harmol to impede the amyloid fibril formation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) associated with type&#8197;2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), by a series of physicochemical and biochemical methods. The results indicate that harmine and harmol effectively prevent peptide fibril formation and alleviate toxic oligomer species. In addition, both small molecules exhibit strong binding affinities with hIAPP mainly through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, thus reducing the cytotoxicity induced by hIAPP. Their distinct binding pattern with hIAPP is closely linked to the molecular configuration of the two small molecules, affecting their ability to impede peptide aggregation. The study is of great significance for the application and development of &#946;&#8208;carboline alkaloids against T2DM.

         <title>Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Smart Polymer Vectors for Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymerization enables translating nucleic acid templates into synthetic precision polymers displaying sensitivity to pH and redox changes. In return, the templated polymers may serve as smart gene delivery vehicles. The overall process amounts to therapeutic nucleic acids fabricating their own delivery vector, thus mimicking the dynamic templated self&#8208;assembly of viral capsids and opening new avenues in gene therapies.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are information&#8208;rich and readily available biomolecules, which can be used to template the polymerization of synthetic macromolecules. Here, we highlight the control over the size, composition, and sequence one can nowadays obtain by using this methodology. We also highlight how templated processes exploiting dynamic covalent polymerization can, in return, result in therapeutic nucleic acids fabricating their own dynamic delivery vector &#8211; a biomimicking concept that can provide original solutions for gene therapies.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Site Mutation Tunes Fluorescence and Chromophorylation of an Orange Fluorescent Cyanobacteriochrome
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phycoerythrobilin (PEB)&#8208;binding cyanobacteriochromes are a group of small and bright orange fluorescent proteins that offer new opportunities as biological reporters. Here, protein sequence truncation and single site mutations were used to tune fluorescence emission over 30&#8197;nm while improving non&#8208;native PEB binding to Slr1393g3 expressed in E. coli cells.







Abstract
Cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) cGMP&#8208;specific phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase, and FhlA (GAF) domains bind bilin cofactors to confer sensory wavelengths important for various cyanobacterial photosensory processes. Many isolated GAF domains autocatalytically bind bilins, including the third GAF domain of CBCR Slr1393 from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which binds phycoerythrobilin (PEB) to yield a bright orange fluorescent protein.

&lt;p&gt;Phycoerythrobilin (PEB)-binding cyanobacteriochromes are a group of small and bright orange fluorescent proteins that offer new opportunities as biological reporters. Here, protein sequence truncation and single site mutations were used to tune fluorescence emission over 30&#8197;nm while improving non-native PEB binding to Slr1393g3 expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase, and FhlA (GAF) domains bind bilin cofactors to confer sensory wavelengths important for various cyanobacterial photosensory processes. Many isolated GAF domains autocatalytically bind bilins, including the third GAF domain of CBCR Slr1393 from &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC6803, which binds phycoerythrobilin (PEB) to yield a bright orange fluorescent protein. Compared to green fluorescent proteins, the smaller size and lack of an oxygen requirement for fluorescence make Slr1393g3 a promising platform for new genetically encoded fluorescent tools. Slr1393g3, however, shows low PEB binding efficiency (chromophorylation) at ~3&#8201;% compared to total Slr1393g3 expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis and plasmid redesign methods to improve Slr1393g3-PEB binding and demonstrate its utility as a fluorescent marker in live cells.

         <title>Heterologous Expression and Partial Characterization of a Putative Opine Dehydrogenase from a Metagenomic Sequence of Desulfohalobium retbaense</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gene for putative opine dehydrogenase was identified in Desulfohalobium retbaense and was successfully produced in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified and structurally and kinetically characterized. It showed high stability and activity in harsh conditions capable of forming secondary amines.







Abstract
The aim of this research was to prove the function of the putative opine dehydrogenase from Desulfohalobium retbaense and to characterize the enzyme in terms of functional and kinetic parameters. A putative opine dehydrogenase was identified from a metagenomic library by a sequence&#8208;based technique search of the metagenomic library, and afterward was successfully heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. In order to examine its potential for applications in the synthesis of secondary amines, first the substrate specificity of the enzyme towards different amino donors and amino acceptors was determined. The highest affinity was observed towards small amino acids, preferentially L&#8208;alanine, and when it comes to &#945;&#8208;keto acids, pyruvate proved to be a preferential amino acceptor. The highest activity was observed at pH&#8197;6.5 in the absence of salts. The enzyme showed remarkable stability in a wide range of experimental conditions, such as broad pH stability (from 6.0&#8211;11.0 after 30&#8197;min incubation in buffers at a certain pH), stability in the presence of NaCl up to 3.0&#8197;M for 24&#8197;h, it retained 80&#8201;% of the initial activity after 1&#8197;h incubation at 45&#8201;&#176;C, and 65&#8201;% of the initial activity after 24&#8197;h incubation in 30&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide.

         <title>Terpene Synthases in the Biosynthesis of Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpenes Across Diverse Organisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are significant terpenoid natural products characterized by their unique C15 bicyclic skeleton. They are produced by various organisms including plants, fungi, bacteria and marine organisms, and exhibit a diverse array of bioactivities. These bioactivities encompass antifeedant, anti&#8208;insecticidal, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;fungal, anti&#8208;viral and anti&#8208;proliferative properties. Some DTSs contribute to the pungent flavor found in herb plants like water pepper, while others serve as active components responsible for the anti&#8208;cancer activities observed in medicinal mushrooms such as (&#8210;)&#8208;antrocin from Antrodia cinnamomea. Recently, DTS synthases have been identified in various organisms, biosynthesizing drimenol, drim&#8208;8&#8208;ene&#8208;11&#8208;ol and (+)&#8208;albicanol, which all possess the characteristic drimane skeleton. Interestingly, despite these enzymes producing chemical molecules with a drimane scaffold, they exhibit minimal amino acid sequence identity across different organisms. This Concept article focuses on the discovery of DTS synthases and the tailoring enzymes generating the chemical diversity of drimane natural products. We summarize and discuss their key features, including the chemical mechanisms, catalytic motifs and functional domains employed by these terpene synthases to generate DTS scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Prodrug Chemistries for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of Stimuli&#8208;responsive prodrugs for controlled release of the drugs to tumour tissues and cells while reducing the exposure of drugs in the blood and healthy cells is a highly challenging task. In this review, the design strategies and recent advances of stimuli&#8208;responsive anticancer prodrugs for tumor&#8208;specific drug delivery have been discussed.







Abstract
Prodrugs are pharmacologically inactive, chemically modified derivatives of active drugs, which, following in&#8197;vivo administration, are converted to the parent drugs through chemical or enzymatic cleavage. The prodrug approach holds tremendous potential to create the enhanced version of an existing pharmacological agent and leverage those improvements to augment the drug molecules&#8242; bioavailability, targeting ability, therapeutic efficacy, safety, and marketability. Especially in cancer therapy, prodrug application has received substantial attention. A prodrug can effectively broaden the therapeutic window of its parent drug by enhancing its release at targeted tumor sites while reducing its access to healthy cells. The spatiotemporally controlled release can be achieved by manipulating the chemical, physical, or biological stimuli present at the targeted tumor site. The critical strategy comprises drug&#8208;carrier linkages that respond to physiological or biochemical stimuli in the tumor milieu to yield the active drug form. This review will focus on the recent advancements in the development of various fluorophore&#8208;drug conjugates that are widely used for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery. The use of different stimuli&#8208;cleavable linkers and the mechanisms of linker cleavage will be discussed. Finally, the review will conclude with a critical discussion of the prospects and challenges that might impede the future development of such prodrugs.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infections associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are poised to become the leading cause of death in the next few decades, a scenario that can be ascribed to two phenomena: antibiotic over&#8208;prescription and a lack of antibiotic drug development. The crowd&#8208;sourced initiative CO&#8208;ADD has been testing research compounds contributed by researchers around the world to find new antimicrobials to combat AMR, and during this campaign has found that metallodrugs might be a promising, yet untapped source. To this end, we submitted 18 Pd(II) and Ru(II) &#8211; pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl complexes which were developed as catalysts for their antimicrobial properties. It was found that the Pd&#8208;complexes possessed potent antifungal activity, especially Pd1, with MICs between 0.06 &#8211; 0.125 &#181;g/mL against C. glabrata. The in vitro studies were extended to in vivo studies in G. mellonella larvae where it was established that the compounds were non&#8208;toxic. Here we effectively demonstrate the potential of Pd(II)&#8208;pyta complexes as antifungal agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Homodimeric Protein Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bivalent ligands can engage homodimeric protein targets with high affinity due to avidity effects. This study shows that compounds conjugated to a masked formyl acetamide can be coupled efficiently and conveniently through trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)&#8208;catalyzed pyridone formation. In most cases, the product is produced in nearly quantitative yield and in excellent purity. The reaction is tolerant of a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
Many proteins exist as oligomers (homodimers, homotrimers, etc.). A proven strategy for the development of high affinity ligands for such targets is to link together two modest affinity ligands that allows the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 (or higher&#8208;order) protein&#8208;ligand complex. We report here the discovery of a convenient, &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; reaction for the homodimerization of protein ligands that is efficient, operationally simple to carry out, and tolerant of many functional groups. This chemistry reduces the synthetic burden inherent in the creation of homodimeric ligands since only a single precursor is required. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of homodimeric inhibitors, including PROTACs.

A proven strategy for the development of high affinity ligands for such targets is to link together two modest affinity ligands that allows the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 (or higher-order) protein-ligand complex. We report here the discovery of a convenient, &#8220;click-like&#8221; reaction for the homodimerization of protein ligands that is efficient, operationally simple to carry out, and tolerant of many functional groups. This chemistry reduces the synthetic burden inherent in the creation of homodimeric ligands since only a single precursor is required. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of homodimeric inhibitors, including PROTACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substance P&#8208;Derived Extracellular&#8208;Matrix&#8208;Mimicking Peptide Hydrogel as a Cytocompatible Biomaterial Platform</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the highly conserved C terminus of substance P neuropeptide, we designed and synthesized a novel peptide sequence Fmoc&#8722;FFGLMRGD comprising the C&#8208;terminal fragment &#8220;FFGLM&#8221; from substance P with an integrin&#8208;interacting RGD motif. This designed octapeptide undergoes quick self&#8208;assembly at biological pH to give an ECM mimicking soft hydrogel matrix with superior biocompatibility.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled short peptide&#8208;based hydrogel platforms have become widely applicable biomedical therapeutic maneuvers for their soft, tunable architecture, which can influence cellular behavior and morphology to an inordinate extent. In this work, a short supramolecular hydrogelator peptide, substance P, has been designed and synthesized from the C terminus conserved &#8220;FFGLM&#8221; section of a biologically abundant neuropeptide by using a fusion approach. In addition, to incorporate a good hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic balance, the truncated pentapeptide segment was further C&#8208;terminally modified by the incorporation of an integrin&#8208;binding &#8220;RGD&#8221; motif. Thanks to its N&#8208;terminal Fmoc group, this octapeptide ensemble &#8220;FFGLMRGD&#8221; undergoes rapid self&#8208;assembly to give rise to an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive, hydrogel&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting platform that exhibited good cytocompatibility with the cultured mammalian cells under both 2D and 3D culture conditions without exerting any potent cytotoxic effect in a Live/Dead experiment. A rheological experiment demonstrated its hydrogel&#8208;like mechanical properties, including thixotropicity. The atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy images of the fabricated hydrogel show a tangled fibrous surface topography owing to the presence of the N&#8208;terminal Fmoc&#8722;FF residue. Furthermore, an in&#8208;vitro scratch assay performed on fibroblast cell lines confirmed the wound&#8208;ameliorating potency of this designed hydrogel; this substantiates its future therapeutic prospects.

         <title>Integrating Pillar[5]arene and BODIPY for a Supramolecular Nanoplatform To Achieve Synergistic Photodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative capability: A novel drug delivery system with synergistic photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy capability was built by integrating pillar[5]arene WP5 and BODIPY BDP&#8208;CN to construct nanocarrier to load hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug TPZ. The experimental results revealed that the excellent synergistic therapeutic effects can be attributed to the cooperation of BDP&#8208;CN and TPZ.







Abstract
BODIPY photosensitizers have been integrated with a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug to achieve synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. A novel BODIPY derivative BDP&#8208;CN was designed and synthesized. It had two cyano groups to make it complex well with a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene. Their association constant was calculated to be (6.8&#177;0.9)&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. After self&#8208;assembly in water, regular spherical nanocarriers can be formed; these were used to encapsulate the hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ). BDP&#8208;CN displayed excellent photodynamic activity to complete PDT. In this process, O2 can be continuously consumed to activate TPZ to allow it to be converted to a benzotriazinyl (BTZ) radical with high cytotoxicity to complete chemotherapy. As a result, the formed nanoparticles showed excellent synergistic photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy efficacy. The synergistic therapy mechanism is discussed in detail.

         <title>RNA&#8208;TAG Mediated Protein&#8208;RNA Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present an enzymatic, covalent, protein&#8208;nucleic acid conjugation method. This method precisely links two classes of biological macromolecules using SNAP&#8208;tag and RNA&#8208;TAG labeling technologies and a bifunctional small molecule probe. We demonstrate the utility of this method by recruiting an endonuclease to an RNA of interest for targeted degradation.







Abstract
Combinations of biological macromolecules can provide researchers with precise control and unique methods for regulating, studying, and manipulating cellular processes. For instance, combining the unmatched encodability afforded by nucleic acids with the diverse functionality of proteins has transformed our approach to solving several problems in chemical biology. Despite these benefits, there remains a need for new methods to site&#8208;specifically generate conjugates between different classes of biomolecules. Here we present a fully enzymatic strategy for combining nucleic acids and proteins using SNAP&#8208;tag and RNA&#8208;TAG (transglycosylation at guanosine) technologies via a bifunctional preQ1&#8208;benzylguanine small molecule probe. We demonstrate the robust ability of this technology to assemble site&#8208;specific SNAP&#8208;tag &#8211; RNA conjugates with RNAs of varying length and use our conjugation strategy to recruit an endonuclease to an RNA of interest for targeted degradation. We foresee that combining SNAP&#8208;tag and RNA&#8208;TAG will facilitate researchers to predictably engineer novel macromolecular complexes.

         <title>Noncovalent Association Thermodynamics of Turn&#8208;On Fluorescent Probes with Human Serum Albumin: Dual&#8208;Concentration Ratio Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;concentration ratio method is developed for quantifying the binding affinity of turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes (L) and a given protein (P). Only two samples at different [L]0/[protein]0 are required. It is an easy way to greatly reduce the amounts of fluorescent probes and proteins, as well as the acquisition time.







Abstract
Efficient quantification of the affinity of a drug and the targeted protein is critical for strategic drug design. Among the various molecules, turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes are the most promising signal transducers to reveal the binding strength and site&#8208;specificity of designed drugs. However, the conventional method of measuring the binding ability of turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes by using the fractional occupancy under the law of mass action is time&#8208;consuming and a massive sample is required. Here, we report a new method, called dual&#8208;concentration ratio method, for quantifying the binding affinity of fluorescent probes and human serum albumin (HSA). Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity ratios of a one&#8208;to&#8208;one complex (L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HSA) for a turn&#8208;on fluorescent probe (L), e.&#8201;g., ThT (thioflavin T) or DG (dansylglycine), with HSA at two different values of [L]0/[HSA]0 under the constraint [HSA]0&gt;[L]0 were collected. The van't Hoff analysis on these association constants further resulted in the thermodynamic properties. Since only two samples at different [L]0/[HSA]0 are required without the need of [L]0/[HSA]0 at a wide range, the dual&#8208;concentration ratio method is an easy way to greatly reduce the amounts of fluorescent probes and proteins, as well as the acquisition time.

         <title>Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl Group&#8208;Derived Capmatinib: Synthesis, Biological Evaluation and Its Application in 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine atoms were introduced on Capmatinib to obtain a targeted 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, 9F&#8208;CAP, its imaging concentration limit was found to be 25&#8197;mM (FLASH sequence). Molecular docking simulation, SPR (KD=40.7&#8197;&#956;M), half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (IC50, 168&#8197;nM), Annexin V, and cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that the 9F&#8208;CAP targeted cMET protein.







Abstract
Capmatinib is an FDA&#8208;approved drug to treat metastatic non&#8208;small cell lung cancer with MET&#8208;exon 14 skipping. Herein, the perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group, which possesses nine chemically identical fluorine atoms, was introduced on Capmatinib to afford a targeted 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group&#8208;derived Capmatinib (9F&#8208;CAP). The 19F MRI concentration limit was found to be 25&#8197;mM in FLASH sequence. Molecular docking simulation, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (with a Kd of 40.7&#8197;&#956;M), half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (with a IC50 of 168&#8197;nM), Annexin V, and cytotoxicity assays jointly demonstrated that the 9F&#8208;CAP targeted cMET protein specifically. Therefore, the targeted imaging capability of 9F&#8208;CAP is of great significance for the preoperative diagnosis of specific cancers.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorine atoms were introduced on Capmatinib to obtain a targeted &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, &lt;b&gt;9F-CAP&lt;/b&gt;, its imaging concentration limit was found to be 25&#8197;mM (FLASH sequence). Molecular docking simulation, SPR (KD=40.7&#8197;&#956;M), half-inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, 168&#8197;nM), Annexin V, and cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that the &lt;b&gt;9F-CAP&lt;/b&gt; targeted cMET protein.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmatinib is an FDA-approved drug to treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with MET-exon 14 skipping. Herein, the perfluoro-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl group, which possesses nine chemically identical fluorine atoms, was introduced on Capmatinib to afford a targeted &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe, perfluoro-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl group-derived Capmatinib (&lt;b&gt;9F-CAP&lt;/b&gt;). The &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F MRI concentration limit was found to be 25&#8197;mM in FLASH sequence. Molecular docking simulation, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (with a &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of 40.7&#8197;&#956;M), half-inhibitory concentration (with a IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 168&#8197;nM), Annexin V, and cytotoxicity assays jointly demonstrated that the &lt;b&gt;9F-CAP&lt;/b&gt; targeted cMET protein specifically. Therefore, the targeted imaging capability of &lt;b&gt;9F-CAP&lt;/b&gt; is of great significance for the preoperative diagnosis of specific cancers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Ligands into Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances of a novel and efficient ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction platform functioned through a kinetic control upon the ligand binding are summarized and discussed in this Concept. This new strategy may provide great flexibility to integrate all kind of ligands into the sophisticated nucleic acid nanomachines for biosensors, nucleic acid computation and gene regulations.







Abstract
Signal transduction from non&#8208;nucleic acid ligands (small molecules and proteins) to structural changes of nucleic acids plays a crucial role in both biomedical analysis and cellular regulations. However, how to bridge between these two types of molecules without compromising the expandable complexity and programmability of the nucleic acid nanomachines is a critical challenge. Compared with the previously most widely applied transduction strategies, we review the latest advances of a kinetically controlled approach for ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction in this Concept article. This new design works through an intrinsic conformational alteration of the nucleic acid aptamer upon the ligand binding as a governing factor for nucleic acid strand displacement reactions. The functionalities and applications of this transduction system as a ligand converter on biosensing and DNA computation are described and discussed. Furthermore, we propose some potential scenarios for utilization of this ligand transduction design to regulate gene expression through synthetic RNA switches in the cellular contexts. Finally, future perspectives regarding this ligand&#8208;oligonucleotide transduction platform are also discussed.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins Bearing Base&#8208;Labile Post&#8208;Translational Modifications: Evolution of the Methods in Four Decades</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;palmitoylation on Cys residue and O&#8208;acetylation on Ser/Thr residues are base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications. Their lability to bases and nucleophiles makes them challenging synthetic targets. In this review, we summarized the efforts toward their preparation during the past 40&#8197;years, with the focus on the evolution of synthetic methods.







Abstract
The S&#8208;palmitoylation on Cys residue and O&#8208;acetylation on Ser/Thr residues are two types of base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in cells. The lability of these PTMs to bases and nucleophiles makes the peptides/proteins bearing S&#8208;palmitoyl or O&#8208;acetyl groups challenging synthetic targets, which cannot be prepared via the standard Fmoc&#8208;SPPS and native chemical ligation. In this review, we summarized the efforts towards their preparation in the past 40&#8197;years, with the focus on the evolution of synthetic methods.

         <title>Selective and Sustainable Production of Sub&#8208;terminal Hydroxy Fatty Acids by a Self&#8208;Sufficient CYP102 Enzyme from Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BAMF0695, a self&#8208;sufficient CYP102 enzyme, hydroxylates sub&#8208;terminal positions of fatty acids with broad temperature optimum and high thermostability. Mutants of BAMF0695 exhibit very high regioselectivity, generating a single hydroxy fatty acid regioisomer (&#969;&#8208;1 or &#969;&#8208;2) with up to 91&#8201;% selectivity. BAMF0695 can also utilize renewable microalgae fatty acids as a substrate feedstock.







Abstract
Enzymatic hydroxylation of fatty acids by Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) offers an eco&#8208;friendly route to hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), high&#8208;value oleochemicals with various applications in materials industry and with potential as bioactive compounds. However, instability and poor regioselectivity of CYPs are their main drawbacks. A newly discovered self&#8208;sufficient CYP102 enzyme, BAMF0695 from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 7, exhibits preference for hydroxylation of sub&#8208;terminal positions (&#969;&#8208;1, &#969;&#8208;2, and &#969;&#8208;3) of fatty acids. Our studies show that BAMF0695 has a broad temperature optimum (over 70&#8201;% of maximal enzymatic activity retained between 20 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) and is highly thermostable (T50 &gt;50&#8201;&#176;C), affording excellent adaptive compatibility for bioprocesses. We further demonstrate that BAMF0695 can utilize renewable microalgae lipid as a substrate feedstock for HFA production. Moreover, through extensive site&#8208;directed and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis, we isolated variants with high regioselectivity, a rare property for CYPs that usually generate complex regioisomer mixtures. BAMF0695 mutants were able to generate a single HFA regiosiomer (&#969;&#8208;1 or &#969;&#8208;2) with selectivities from 75&#8201;% up to 91&#8201;%, using C12 to C18 fatty acids. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of a recent CYP and its variants for sustainable and green production of high&#8208;value HFAs.

         <title>A Fluorescence&#8208;Based Assay for N5&#8208;Carboxyaminoimidazole Ribonucleotide Mutase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, fluorescence&#8208;based assay has been developed that relies on the reaction between the novel istain&#8208;fluorecein conjugate and the enzymatically generated compound, AIR. These compounds react non&#8208;enzymatically resulting in a highly fluorescent product. This unique reaction provides a new assay for monitoring the activity of the enzyme N5&#8208;CAIR mutase.







Abstract
The enzyme N5&#8208;carboxylaminoinidazole ribonucleotide (N5&#8208;CAIR) mutase is found in microbial de novo purine biosynthesis but is absent in humans making it an attractive antimicrobial target. N5&#8208;CAIR mutase catalyzes the synthesis of carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR) from N5&#8208;CAIR which is itself prepared from aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) by the enzyme N5&#8208;CAIR synthetase. During our research on identifying inhibitors of N5&#8208;CAIR mutase, we developed an innovative, fluorescence&#8208;based assay to measure the activity of this enzyme. This assay relies upon our recent serendipitous observation that AIR reversibly reacts with the compound isatin. Reaction of a fluorescently&#8208;tagged isatin with AIR resulted in a large increase in fluorescence intensity allowing a measurement of the concentration of AIR in solution. From this observation, we developed a reproducible, non&#8208;continuous assay that can replicate the known kinetic parameters of the enzyme and can readily detect a recognized inhibitor of the enzyme. This assay should find utility in screening for inhibitors targeting N5&#8208;CAIR mutase.

         <title>Exploring Photoswitchable Binding Interactions with Small Molecule&#8208; and Peptide&#8208;Based Inhibitors of Trypsin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to photochemically activate a drug, both when and where needed, requires optimisation of the difference in biological activity between each isomeric state. As a step to this goal, we report small molecule and peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of the same protease &#8211; trypsin &#8211; to better understand how photoswitchable drugs interact with their biological target. The best peptidic inhibitor displayed a &gt;5&#8208;fold difference in inhibitory activity between isomeric states, whereas the best small molecule inhibitor only showed a 3.4&#8208;fold difference.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to photochemically activate a drug, both when and where needed, requires optimisation of the difference in biological activity between each isomeric state. As a step to this goal, we report small molecule and peptide-based inhibitors of the same protease &#8211; trypsin &#8211; to better understand how photoswitchable drugs interact with their biological target. The best peptidic inhibitor displayed a &amp;gt;5-fold difference in inhibitory activity between isomeric states, whereas the best small molecule inhibitor only showed a 3.4-fold difference. Docking and molecular modelling suggests this result is due to a large change in 3D structure in the key binding residues of the peptidic inhibitor upon isomerisation, which is not observed for the small molecule inhibitor.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Poly(Amino Acid)s Mediated by Secondary Conformations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The factors influencing secondary conformational regulation of PAAs, especially order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational transitions, and specific methods for regulating the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of poly(amino acid)s through secondary conformations reported in recent years are summarized, in the hope of providing some insights for the future design and application of synthetic polypeptides.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers has recently drawn great attention due to its remarkable performance and wide variety of applications in biomedicine, biomaterials, microelectronics, photoelectric materials, catalysts, etc. Poly(amino acid)s (PAAs), formed by introducing synthetic amino acids into copolymer backbones, are able to fold into different secondary conformations when compared with traditional amphiphilic copolymers. Apart from changing the chemical composition and degree of polymerization of copolymers, the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of PAAs could be controlled by their secondary conformations, which are more flexible and adjustable for fine structure tailoring. In this article, we summarize the latest findings on the variables that influence secondary conformations, in particular the regulation of order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational changes and the approaches used to manage the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of PAAs. These strategies include controlling pH, redox reactions, coordination, light, temperature, and so on. Hopefully, we can provide valuable perspectives that will be useful for the future development and use of synthetic PAAs.

Post&#8208;translational modification: Recent progresses in cell penetrating techniques, chemical synthesis of cell&#8208;permeable ubiquitin and histone post&#8208;translational modifications tools, and some important use cases.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) regulate nearly all biological processes in eukaryotic cells, and synthetic PTM protein tools are widely used to detect the activity of the related enzymes and identify the interacting proteins in cell lysates. Recently, the study of these enzymes and the interacting proteome has been accomplished in live cells using cell&#8208;permeable PTM protein tools. In this concept, we will introduce cell penetrating techniques, the syntheses of cell&#8208;permeable PTM protein tools, and offer some future perspective.

         <title>The Wild&#8208;Type tRNA Adenosine Deaminase Enzyme TadA Is Capable of Sequence&#8208;Specific DNA Base Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenine base editors (ABEs) are genome editing tools that convert A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T base pairs to G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C by using an extensively evolved tRNA&#8208;adenosine deaminase enzyme, TadA. Here we show that wtTadA can perform DNA base editing, with a strict sequence motif requirement of TAC. We additionally investigate how the sequence recognition of TadA variants changes as they accumulate mutations to better edit DNA substrates.







Abstract
Base editors are genome editing tools that enable site&#8208;specific base conversions through the chemical modification of nucleobases in DNA. Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T to G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C base pairs in DNA by using an adenosine deaminase enzyme to modify target adenosines to inosine intermediates. Due to the lack of a naturally occurring adenosine deaminase that can modify DNA, ABEs were evolved from a tRNA&#8208;deaminating enzyme, TadA. Previous experiments with an ABE comprising a wild&#8208;type (wt) TadA showed no detectable activity on DNA, and directed evolution was therefore required to enable this enzyme to accept DNA as a substrate. Here we show that wtTadA can perform base editing in DNA in both bacterial and mammalian cells, with a strict sequence motif requirement of TAC. We leveraged this discovery to optimize a reporter assay to detect base editing levels as low as 0.01&#8201;%. Finally, we used this assay along with molecular dynamics simulations of full ABE:DNA complexes to better understand how the sequence recognition of mutant TadA variants change as they accumulate mutations to better edit DNA substrates.

         <title>Identifying E3 Ligase Substrates With Quantitative Degradation Proteomics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
E3 ligases catalyze the ubiquitination of substrates, often resulting in proteasomal degradation. Improving approaches to identify substrates of E3 ligases has been critical to understanding the cellular pathways they regulate. This work proposes a universal approach using differential degradation proteomics (degradomics) to identify the substrates of an E3 ligase in the native cellular context.







Abstract
Controlled protein degradation by the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome pathway is critical for almost all cellular processes. E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for targeting proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation with spatial and temporal precision. While studies have revealed various E3&#8208;substrate pairs involved in distinct biological processes, the complete substrate profiles of individual E3 ligases are largely unknown. Here we report a new approach to identify substrates of an E3 ligase for proteasomal degradation using unnatural amino acid incorporation pulse&#8208;chase proteomics (degradomics). Applying this approach, we determine the steady&#8208;state substrates of the C&#8208;terminal to LisH (CTLH) E3 ligase, a multi&#8208;component complex with poorly defined substrates. By comparing the proteome degradation profiles of active and inactive CTLH&#8208;expressing cells, we successfully identify previously known and new potential substrates of CTLH ligase. Altogether, degradomics can comprehensively identify degradation substrates of an E3 ligase, which can be adapted for other E3 ligases in various cellular contexts.

         <title>SNAP&#8208;Tag&#8208;Targeted MRI&#8208;Fluorescent Multimodal Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal MRI and fluorescent&#8208;imaging probe with an orthogonal targeting ligand has been created for labelling genetically defined cells expressing the SNAP&#8208;tag. We report an efficient synthesis of the probe, its biocompatibility and cell&#8208;specific imaging by MRI and light microscopy.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging modality, widely employed in research and clinical settings. However, MRI images suffer from low signals and a lack of target specificity. We aimed to develop a multimodal imaging probe to detect targeted cells by MRI and fluorescence microscopy. We synthesized a trifunctional imaging probe consisting of a SNAP&#8208;tag substrate for irreversible and specific labelling of cells, cyanine dyes for bright fluorescence, and a chelated GdIII molecule for enhancing MRI contrast. Our probes exhibit specific and efficient labelling of genetically defined cells (expressing SNAP&#8208;tag at their membrane), bright fluorescence and MRI signal. Our synthetic approach provides a versatile platform for the production of multimodal imaging probes, particularly for light microscopy and MRI.

However, MRI images suffer from low signals and a lack of target specificity. We aimed to develop a multimodal imaging probe to detect targeted cells by MRI and fluorescence microscopy. We synthesized a trifunctional imaging probe consisting of a SNAP-tag substrate for irreversible and specific labelling of cells, cyanine dyes for bright fluorescence, and a chelated Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; molecule for enhancing MRI contrast. Our probes exhibit specific and efficient labelling of genetically defined cells (expressing SNAP-tag at their membrane), bright fluorescence and MRI signal. Our synthetic approach provides a versatile platform for the production of multimodal imaging probes, particularly for light microscopy and MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Histidine phosphorylation is a post translation modification that occurs in all cells and is currently understudied. Using DFT calculations, we report the synthesis of a pyrazole &#964;&#8208;pHis and a pyridine &#960;&#8208;pHis analogue. The pyrazole and pyridine analogues were used to generate isomer&#8208;selective &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis antibodies, respectively. The antibodies were applicable in many immunological techniques.







Abstract
Nonhydrolysable stable analogues of &#964;&#8208;phosphohistidine (&#964;&#8208;pHis) and &#960;&#8208;pHis have been designed, aided by electrostatic surface potential calculations, and subsequently synthesized. The &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis analogues (phosphopyrazole 8 and pyridyl amino amide 13, respectively) were used as haptens to generate pHis polyclonal antibodies. Both &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis conjugates in the form of BSA&#8208;glutaraldehyde&#8208;&#964;&#8208;pHis and BSA&#8208;glutaraldehyde&#8208;&#960;&#8208;pHis were synthesized and characterized by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Commercially available &#964;&#8208;pHis (SC56&#8208;2) and &#960;&#8208;pHis (SC1&#8208;1; SC50&#8208;3) monoclonal antibodies were used to show that the BSA&#8722;G&#8208;&#964;&#8208;pHis and BSA&#8722;G&#8208;&#960;&#8208;pHis conjugates could be used to assess the selectivity of pHis antibodies in a competitive ELISA. Subsequently, the selectivity of the pHis antibodies generated by using phosphopyrazole 8 and pyridyl amino amide 13 as haptens was assessed by competitive ELISA against His, pSer, pThr, pTyr, &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis. Antibodies generated by using phosphopyrazole 8 as a hapten were found to be selective for &#964;&#8208;pHis, and antibodies generated by using pyridyl amino amide 13 were found to be selective for &#960;&#8208;pHis. Both &#964;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;pHis antibodies were shown to be effective in immunological experiments, including ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence. The &#964;&#8208;pHis antibody was also shown to be useful in the immunoprecipitation of proteins containing pHis.

         <title>Spectrophotometric and Fluorimetric High&#8208;Throughput Assays for Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic decarboxylation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxycinnamic acids was measured in two independent assays that follow fluorescence and absorbance changes during the reaction. Both assays are suitable for high&#8208;throughput measurements in cell lysates or with whole cells and greatly extend the currently available toolbox to quantify decarboxylation reactions.







Abstract
Biocatalytic decarboxylation of hydroxycinnamic acids yields phenolic styrenes, which are important precursors for antioxidants, epoxy coatings, adhesives and other polymeric materials. Bacillus subtilis decarboxylase (BsPAD) is a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of carbon dioxide from p&#8208;coumaric&#8208;, caffeic&#8208;, and ferulic acid with high catalytic efficiency. Real&#8208;time spectroscopic assays for decarboxylase reactions remove the necessity of extensive sample workup, which is required for HPLC, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, or NMR methods. This work presents two robust and sensitive assays based on photometry and fluorimetry that allow decarboxylation reactions to be followed with high sensitivity while avoiding product extraction and long analysis times. Optimized assay procedures were used to measure BsPAD activity in cell lysates and to determine the kinetic constants (KM and Vmax) of the purified enzyme for p&#8208;coumaric&#8208;, caffeic&#8208; and ferulic acid. Substrate inhibition was shown for caffeic acid.

         <title>Modulating Secondary Structure Motifs Through Photo&#8208;Labile Peptide Staples</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions of bioactive peptides with their target proteins are greatly affected by their 3D structure. Therefore, dynamically modulating their secondary structure can be achieved by using photo&#8208;labile staples. In this study, a coumarin&#8208;based staple was introduced over a range of distances and its effect on the peptide structure was analyzed using both spectroscopic techniques and in silico simulations.







Abstract
Peptide&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are facilitated by the well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structure of bioactive peptides, interesting compounds for the development of new therapeutic agents. Their secondary structure and thus their propensity to engage in PPIs can be influenced by the introduction of peptide staples on the side chains. In particular, light&#8208;controlled staples based on azobenzene photoswitches and their structural influence on helical peptides have been studied extensively. In contrast, photolabile staples bearing photocages as a structural key motif, have mainly been used to block supramolecular interactions. Their influence on the secondary structure of the target peptide is under&#8208;investigated. Thus, in this study we use a combination of spectroscopic techniques and in silico simulations to systematically study a series of helical peptides with varying length of the photo&#8208;labile staple to obtain a detailed insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship in such photoresponsive biomolecules.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Aryl Diazonium Installation onto Protein Surfaces at Neutral pH using a Maleimide&#8208;Functionalized Triazabutadiene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl diazonium cations are versatile reagents but their usage in bioconjugation has been hampered by both their short lifespan in aqueous solution and the harsh conditions required to generate them in&#8197;situ. Use of triazabutadienes as a photocleavable protecting groups for aryl diazonium cations can facilitate the site&#8208;selective installation of aryl diazonium cations onto protein surfaces under biologically&#8208;relevant conditions.







Abstract
Aryl diazonium cations are versatile bioconjugation reagents due to their reactivity towards electron&#8208;rich aryl residues and secondary amines, but historically their usage has been hampered by both their short lifespan in aqueous solution and the harsh conditions required to generate them in&#8197;situ. Triazabutadienes address many of these issues as they are stable enough to endure multiple&#8208;step chemical syntheses and can persist for several hours in aqueous solution, yet upon UV&#8208;exposure rapidly release aryl diazonium cations under biologically&#8208;relevant conditions. This paper describes the synthesis of a novel maleimide&#8208;functionalized triazabutadiene suitable for site&#8208;selectively installing aryl diazonium cations into proteins at neutral pH; we show reaction with this molecule and a surface&#8208;cysteine of a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase. Through photoactivation of the site&#8208;selectively installed triazabutadiene motifs, we generate aryl diazonium functionality, which we further derivatize via azo&#8208;bond formation to electron&#8208;rich aryl species, showcasing the potential utility of this strategy for the generation of photoswitches or protein&#8208;drug conjugates.

A new strategy of jointly depleting GSH is proposed to enhance the therapeutic effect of PDT by preparing a nanomicelle by self&#8208;assembly method from GSH&#8208;activated photosensitizer DMT, curcumin, and amphiphilic polymer TPGS.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one common ROS&#8208;generating therapeutic method with high tumor selectivity and low side effects. But the GSH&#8208;upregulation often alleviates its therapeutic efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy of jointly depleting GSH to enhance the therapeutic effect of PDT by preparing a nanomicelle by self&#8208;assembly method from GSH&#8208;activated photosensitizer DMT, curcumin, and amphiphilic polymer TPGS.

         <title>Establishment of an In Bacterio Assay for the Assessment of Carbon Storage Regulator A (CsrA) Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim to evaluated compounds capable of modulating microbial communities by targeting the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA/RsmA, we established an in bacterio assay using a luciferase reporter gene and qPCR expression assay to monitor CsrA&#8208;regulated mechanisms. CesT served as a positive control, demonstrating time&#8208;dependent increase in bioluminescence. This assay allows evaluation of the cellular effects of virulence&#8208;modulating compounds targeting CsrA/RsmA.







Abstract
Polymicrobial infections involving various combinations of microorganisms, such as Escherichia, Pseudomonas, or Yersinia, can lead to acute and chronic diseases in for example the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Our aim is to modulate microbial communities by targeting the posttranscriptional regulator system called carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) (or also repressor of secondary metabolites (RsmA)). In previous studies, we identified easily accessible CsrA binding scaffolds and macrocyclic CsrA binding peptides through biophysical screening and phage display technology. However, due to the lack of an appropriate in bacterio assay to evaluate the cellular effects of these inhibitor hits, the focus of the present study is to establish an in bacterio assay capable of probing and quantifying the impact on CsrA&#8208;regulated cellular mechanisms. We have successfully developed an assay based on a luciferase reporter gene assay, which in combination with a qPCR expression gene assay, allows for the monitoring of expression levels of different downstream targets of CsrA. The chaperone protein CesT was used as a suitable positive control for the assay, and in time&#8208;dependent experiments, we observed a CesT&#8208;mediated increase in bioluminescence over time. By this means, the cellular on&#8208;target effects of non&#8208;bactericidal/non&#8208;bacteriostatic virulence modulating compounds targeting CsrA/RsmA can be evaluated.

         <title>Conserved Active Site Architecture Between Bacterial Cellulose and Chitin Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural analysis of bacterial and cellulose synthases revealed a highly conserved catalytic active site across evolutionarily distant species, despite the very high dissimilarities among the overall amino acid sequences and 3D structures, potentially reminiscent of a broad range substrate common ancestor.







Abstract
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large and diverse group of enzymes responsible for catalyzing the formation of a glycosidic bond between a donor molecule, usually a monosaccharide, and a wide range of acceptor molecules, thus, playing critical roles in various essential biological processes. Chitin and cellulose synthases are two inverting processive integral membrane GTs, belonging to the type&#8208;2 family involved in the biosynthesis of chitin and cellulose, respectively. Herein, we report that bacterial cellulose and chitin synthases share an E&#8208;D&#8208;D&#8208;ED&#8208;QRW&#8208;TK active site common motif that is spatially co&#8208;localized. This motif is conserved among distant bacterial evolutionary species despite their low amino acid sequence and structural similarities between them. This theoretical framework offers a new perspective to the current view that bacterial cellulose and chitin synthases are substrate specific and that chitin and cellulose are organism specific. It lays the ground for future in&#8197;vivo and in silico experimental assessment of cellulose synthase catalytic promiscuity against uridine diphosphate N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and chitin synthase against uridine diphosphate glucose, respectively.

         <title>Front Cover: The Wild&#8208;Type tRNA Adenosine Deaminase Enzyme TadA Is Capable of Sequence&#8208;Specific DNA Base Editing (ChemBioChem 16/2023)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The directed evolution of the adenosine deaminase enzyme TadA from an RNA&#8208;editing enzyme to an efficient DNA&#8208;editing enzyme was crucial for the development of the adenine base editor (ABE). Previous experiments showed no detectable DNA&#8208;editing activity by an ABE utilizing wild&#8208;type TadA (ABE0.1), but here we show ABE0.1 is able to edit DNA strictly within TACG motifs. This sequence requirement is partially governed by the C&#8208;terminal &#945;5 helix of TadA, which accumulated many mutations during the directed evolution of TadA. The evolution of TadA to better access adenines within a diverse range of sequences is reflective of the Galapagos finches, which evolved different beak shapes in order to better access the food that was available to them. This cover art shows the protein structures of ecTadA (PDB: 1Z3A) and the evolved TadA8e (PDB: 6VCA), along with two species of Galapagos finches using the different &#945;5 helix structures to access a target adenine within different sequence contexts. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. C. Komor et al.

The cover image shows a possible scenario in which the active sites of cellulose synthase or chitin synthase can interchangeably catalyze reactions involving cellulose and chitin, irrespective of their protein shell. This discovery provides the foundation for future experimental validations on the substrate specificities of bacterial cellulose synthases and chitin synthases, paving the way for manipulating bacterial interactions with other organisms and designing tailored materials.

         <title>Sharing Failure as a Graduate Student</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Failure is a common experience amongst people, yet it can feel isolating. One graduate student reflects upon her own failures, how she shared them with others, and ponders if she would reverse her failures if given the opportunity.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure&lt;/b&gt; is a common experience amongst people, yet it can feel isolating. One graduate student reflects upon her own failures, how she shared them with others, and ponders if she would reverse her failures if given the opportunity.

         <title>Recent Advances in Metal Complexes for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of the last five years of progress in the field of metal complexes as photosensitizers (PSs) for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). The strategies used to develop new and potent PSs for aPDT to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are assessed herein.







Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global problem with more than 1 million deaths due to AMR infection in 2019 alone. New and innovative therapeutics are required to overcome this challenge. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a rapidly growing area of research poised to provide much needed help in the fight against AMR. aPDT works by administering a photosensitizer (PS) that is activated only when irradiated with light, allowing high spatiotemporal control and selectivity. The PS typically generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage a variety of key biological targets, potentially circumventing existing resistance mechanisms. Metal complexes are well known to display excellent optoelectronic properties, and recent focus has begun to shift towards their application in tackling microbial infections. Herein, we review the last five years of progress in the emerging field of small&#8208;molecule metal complex PSs for aPDT.

         <title>Dessert or Poison? The Roles of Glycosylation in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Do you want to know if glycans are poison or dessert for the central nervous system? Now, we are reviewing the roles of N/O&#8208;glycosylation, some other glycosylation, and glycosyltransferase in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.







Abstract
Ministry of Education and Key Laboratory of Neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are modified by glycosylation and rely on glycosylation to achieve normal neural function. Neurodegenerative disease is a common disease of the elderly, affecting their healthy life span and quality of life, and no effective treatment is currently available. Recent research implies that various glycosylation traits are altered during neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a potential implication of glycosylation in disease pathology. Herein, we summarized the current knowledge about glycosylation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis, focusing on their promising functional avenues. Moreover, we collected research aimed at highlighting the need for such studies to provide a wealth of disease&#8208;related glycosylation information that will help us better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms and hopefully specific glycosylation information to provide further diagnostic and therapeutic directions for neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches of Epoxysuccinate Chemical Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a detailed overview of the synthetic pathways of epoxysuccinate&#8208;based inhibitors for cysteine proteases, starting from the natural substrate (called E&#8208;64), with insights into the evolution of the structural complexity toward development of epoxysuccinate&#8208;based activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) for a wide range of enzymes (cysteine proteases), concomitant with related applications.







Abstract
Synthetic chemical probes are powerful tools for investigating biological processes. They are particularly useful for proteomic studies such as activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP). These chemical methods initially used mimics of natural substrates. As the techniques gained prominence, more and more elaborate chemical probes with increased specificity towards given enzyme/protein families and amenability to various reaction conditions were used. Among the chemical probes, peptidyl&#8208;epoxysuccinates represent one of the first types of compounds used to investigate the activity of the cysteine protease papain&#8208;like family of enzymes. Structurally derived from the natural substrate, a wide body of inhibitors and activity&#8208; or affinity&#8208;based probes bearing the electrophilic oxirane unit for covalent labeling of active enzymes now exists. Herein, we review the literature regarding the synthetic approaches to epoxysuccinate&#8208;based chemical probes together with their reported applications, from biological chemistry and inhibition studies to supramolecular chemistry and the formation of protein arrays.

         <title>Unfolding under Pressure: An NMR Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 16, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differences and similarities: The interaction of water molecules with hydrophobic groups of the core plays a role in cold denaturation and heat&#8208;induced unfolding. NMR spectroscopy can contribute to our understanding of the sequence of events and the mechanisms that determine the transition. In this review, these insights are extended to pressure&#8208;induced protein unfolding, and the common mechanisms and specific peculiarities of the processes are considered.







Abstract
This review aims to analyse the role of solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in pressure&#8208;induced in&#8197;vitro studies of protein unfolding. Although this transition has been neglected for many years because of technical difficulties, it provides important information about the forces that keep protein structure together. We first analyse what pressure unfolding is, then provide a critical overview of how NMR spectroscopy has contributed to the field and evaluate the observables used in these studies. Finally, we discuss the commonalities and differences between pressure&#8208;, cold&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced unfolding. We conclude that, despite specific peculiarities, in both cold and pressure denaturation the important contribution of the state of hydration of nonpolar side chains is a major factor that determines the pressure dependence of the conformational stability of proteins.

CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely explored and investigated for the precise manipulation of target DNA and enabled efficient genomic editing in cells and organisms. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, especially in nonviral nanocarriers, and discuss the challenges and prospects of the delivery methods.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has been widely explored for the precise manipulation of target DNA and has enabled efficient genomic editing in cells. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 has shown promising potential in biomedical applications, including disease treatment, transcriptional regulation and genome&#8208;wide screening. Despite these exciting achievements, efficient and controlled delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has remained a critical obstacle to its further application. Herein, we elaborate on the three delivery forms of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and discuss the composition, advantages and limitations of these forms. Then we provide a comprehensive overview of the carriers of the system, and focus on the nonviral nanocarriers in chemical methods that facilitate efficient and controlled delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of the delivery methods of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in depth, and propose strategies to address the intracellular and extracellular barriers to delivery in clinical applications.

         <title>The role of Trp79 in &#946;&#8208;actin on histidine methyltransferase SETD3 catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#964;&#8208;methylation of His73 in actin by histidine methyltransferase SETD3 plays an important role in stabilisation of actin filaments in eukaryotes. Mutations in actin and overexpression of SETD3 have been related to human diseases, including cancer. Herein, we investigated the importance of Trp79 in &#946;&#8208;actin on productive human SETD3 catalysis. Substitution of Trp79 in &#946;&#8208;actin peptides by its chemically diverse analogues reveals that the hydrophobic Trp79 binding pocket modulates the catalytic activity of SETD3, and that retaining a bulky and hydrophobic amino acid at the position 79 is important for efficient His73 methylation by SETD3. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Trp79 binding pocket of SETD3 is ideally shaped to accommodate large and hydrophobic Trp79, contributing to the favourable release of water molecules upon binding. Our results demonstrate that the distant Trp79 binding site plays an important role in efficient SETD3 catalysis, contributing to the identification of new SETD3 substrates and development of chemical probes targeting the biomedically important SETD3.</dc:description>

         <title>Serum&#8208;Based Detection of Liver Pathology Using a Fluorogenic Alkaline Phosphatase Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an ALP&#8208;activatable NIR fluorescent probe DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP with optimal pKa for the accurate detection of human serum ALP, especially in distinguishing ALP patients from healthy volunteers, as well as assessing the progress of liver disease, thus providing a potential toolbox for the accurate detection of ALP and warning the stage of hepatopathy.







Abstract
Development of &#8220;ultrahigh contrast&#8221; fluorogenic probes for trapping alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in human serum is highly desirable for clinical auxiliary diagnosis for hepatobiliary diseases. However, the intrinsic dilemma of incomplete ionization of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)&#8208;based ALP fluorophores and autofluorescence interference of serum result in low sensitivity and accuracy. Given that unique halogen effects could lead to a drastic decrease in the pKa value and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield, herein we report an enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared probe based on a difluoro&#8208;substituted dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenep for achieving fluorescent quantification of human serum ALP. Rational design strategy is demonstrated by altering the substituted halogen groups to well regulate the pKa for meeting the physiological precondition. Owing to the complete ionization at pH&#8197;7.4 with tremendous fluorescence enhancement, the difluoro&#8208;substituted DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP manifests a linear relationship between the emission intensity and ALP concentration in both solution and serum samples. Along with measuring 77 human serum samples, the DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP based fluorescence method not only exhibits significant correlations with clinical colorimetry, but also distinguishes ALP patients from healthy volunteers, as well as assessing the progress of liver disease, thus providing a potential toolbox for quantitatively detecting ALP and warning the stage of hepatopathy.

         <dc:description>The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has brought a widespread influence on the world, especially in the face of sudden coronavirus infections, and there is still an urgent need for specific small molecule therapies to cope with possible future pandemics. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and understanding its structure and lifecycle is beneficial for designing specific drugs of treatment for COVID&#8208;19. The main protease (Mpro) which has conservative and specific advantages is essential for viral replication and transcription. It is regarded as one of the most potential targets for anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 drug development.

         <title>A cell&#8208;free multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for the synthesis of CDP&#8208;glycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CDP&#8208;glycerol is a nucleotide&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;activated version of glycerol. In nature, it is required for the biosynthesis of teichoic acid in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, which is an appealing target epitope for the development of new vaccines. Here, a cell&#8208;free multi&#8208;enzyme cascade was developed to synthetize nucleotide&#8208;activated glycerol from the inexpensive and readily available substrates cytidine and glycerol. The cascade comprises five recombinant enzymes expressed in E. coli that were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. As part of the cascade, ATP is in&#8208;situ regenerated from polyphosphate to reduce synthesis costs. The enzymatic cascade was characterized at laboratory scale and the products analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC)&#8208;UV and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS). After the successful synthesis was confirmed, a design of experiments approach was used to screen for optimal operation conditions (temperature, pH value and MgCl2 concentration). Overall, a substrate conversion of 89% was achieved with respect to the substrate cytidine.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of a Synthetic Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired [4Fe4S]&#8208;Peptide Maquette as the Redox Partner for an [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquettes have been explored as effective models of FeS proteins, but they also hold untapped potential as tools for synthetic biology. Here we demonstrate the application of these maquettes beyond the modelling of electron transfer in biology by substituting the physiological redox partner of a Clostridium acetobutylicum [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase with a synthetic ferredoxin mimic to direct this enzyme&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;oxidation process.







Abstract
&#8216;Bacterial&#8208;type&#8217; ferredoxins host a cubane [4Fe4S]2+/+ cluster that enables these proteins to mediate electron transfer and facilitate a broad range of biological processes. Peptide maquettes based on the conserved cluster&#8208;forming motif have previously been reported and used to model the ferredoxins. Herein we explore the integration of a [4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquette into a H2&#8208;powered electron transport chain. While routinely formed under anaerobic conditions, we illustrate by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis that these maquettes can be reconstituted under aerobic conditions by using photoactivated NADH to reduce the cluster at 240&#8197;K. Attempts to tune the redox properties of the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster by introducing an Fe&#8208;coordinating selenocysteine residue were also explored. To demonstrate the integration of these artificial metalloproteins into a semi&#8208;synthetic electron transport chain, we utilize a ferredoxin&#8208;inspired [4Fe4S]&#8208;peptide maquette as the redox partner in the hydrogenase&#8208;mediated oxidation of H2.

         <title>&#8220;On&#8208;Off&#8221; Switching of Functional Guest Molecules via Exchange of Natural Product Solubilizing Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional guest molecules can be dissolved in water using natural products as host solubilizing agents and transferred between host solubilizing agents. Owing to the different functions of these host&#8208;guest complexes, the transfer of guest molecules is accompanied by the &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching of functions such as fluorescence emission, singlet oxygen generation ability, and photodynamic activity.







Abstract
For the development of delivery systems, the solubilization of hydrophobic guest molecules in water is an important yet challenging task. This can be achieved by preparing stable aqueous solutions with a high concentration of guest molecules using a natural product as a solubilizing agent and a mechanochemical high&#8208;speed vibration milling apparatus as a solubilizing method. Various solubilizing agent&#8208;guest molecule complexes can be obtained via the exchange between solubilizing agents, which enables the &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching of the properties of functional guest molecules, such as fluorescence intensity, and photodynamic activity. In the exchange method, guest molecules can transfer into cell membranes such as lysosomes and exosomes. Therefore, the exchange method of the solubilizing agents not only creates novel solubilizing agent&#8208;guest molecule complexes but also is applied to drug delivery systems.

         <title>Titin UN2A Acts as a Stable, Non&#8208;Polymorphic Scaffold in its Binding to CARP</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;distance restraints obtained by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed that the &#8220;unique N2A&#8221; (UN2A) domain of the sarcomeric protein titin shows a defined and structured three&#8208;helix bundle and preserves this conformation upon binding of the muscle stress response factor CARP (cardiac ankyrin repeat protein).







Abstract
The N2A segment of titin functions as a pivotal hub for signal transduction and interacts with various proteins involved in structural support, chaperone activities, and transcriptional regulation. Notably, the &#8220;unique N2A&#8221; (UN2A) subdomain has been shown to interact with the stress&#8208;regulated cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), which contributes to the regulation of sarcomeric stiffness. Previously, the UN2A domain's three&#8208;dimensional structure was modelled based on its secondary structure content identified by NMR spectroscopy, considering the domain in isolation. In this study, we report experimental long&#8208;range distance distributions by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy between the three helixes within the UN2A domain linked to the immunoglobulin domain I81 in the presence and absence of CARP. The data confirm the central three&#8208;helix bundle fold of UN2A and show that this adopts a compact and stable conformation in absence of CARP. After binding to CARP, no significant conformational change was observed, suggesting that the UN2A domain retains its structure upon binding to CARP thereby, mediating the interaction approximately as a rigid&#8208;body.

         <title>Platinum and Palladium Organometallic Compounds: Disrupting the Ergosterol Pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo compounds specifically target the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi. These compounds effectively inhibit two key enzymes involved in the pathway, namely lanosterol 14&#8208;&#945; demethylase (CYP51) and phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK). As a result of this inhibition, treated parasites exhibit a reduced level of ergosterol, which is essential for the structure and function of their membranes.







Abstract
Current treatment for Chagas&#8217; disease is based on two drugs, Nifurtimox and Benznidazol, which have limitations that reduce the effectiveness and continuity of treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new, safe and effective drugs. In previous work, two new metal&#8208;based compounds with trypanocidal activity, Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo, were fully characterized. To unravel the mechanism of action of these two analogous metal&#8208;based drugs, high&#8208;throughput omics studies were performed. A multimodal mechanism of action was postulated with several candidates as molecular targets. In this work, we validated the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway as a target for these compounds through the determination of sterol levels by HPLC in treated parasites. To understand the molecular level at which these compounds participate, two enzymes that met eligibility criteria at different levels were selected for further studies: phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) and lanosterol 14&#8208;&#945; demethylase (CYP51). Molecular docking processes were carried out to search for potential sites of interaction for both enzymes. To validate these candidates, a gain&#8208;of&#8208;function strategy was used through the generation of overexpressing PMK and CYP51 parasites. Results here presented confirm that the mechanism of action of Pd&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo and Pt&#8208;dppf&#8208;mpo compounds involves the inhibition of both enzymes.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of New Urushiol Derivatives as Potent Class I Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of 11 urushiol&#8208;based hydroxamic acid histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 showed potent HDAC1/2/3/8 inhibitory activity. Western blot analysis validated the privileged structure of these compounds was appropriate for targeting class I HDACs. Further antiproliferation assays revealed that synthesized compounds exerted greater in&#8197;vitro antiproliferative activity than SAHA against four human cancer cell lines.







Abstract
In the present study, a novel series of 11 urushiol&#8208;based hydroxamic acid histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Compounds 1&#8211;11 exhibited good to excellent inhibitory activities against HDAC1/2/3 (IC50: 42.09&#8211;240.17&#8197;nM) and HDAC8 (IC50: 16.11&#8211;41.15&#8197;nM) in&#8197;vitro, with negligible activity against HDAC6 (&gt;1409.59&#8197;nM). Considering HDAC8, docking experiments revealed some important features contributing to inhibitory activity. According to Western blot analysis, select compounds could notably enhance the acetylation of histone H3 and SMC3 but not&#8208;tubulin, indicating their privileged structure is appropriate for targeting class I HDACs. Furthermore, antiproliferation assays revealed that six compounds exerted greater in&#8197;vitro antiproliferative activity against four human cancer cell lines (A2780, HT&#8208;29, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, and HepG2, with IC50 values ranging from 2.31&#8211;5.13&#8197;&#956;M) than suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; administration of these compounds induced marked apoptosis in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Collectively, specific synthesized compounds could be further optimized and biologically explored as antitumor agents.

Highly substituted small molecule modular oxazoles having dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, aggregated in water to instigate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties through restriction in motion leading to illuminate sub&#8208;cellular ER, mitochondria and lysosomes.







Abstract
Organelles are the working hubs of the cells. Hence, visualizing these organelles inside the cells is highly important for understanding their roles in pathological states and development of therapeutic strategies. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly substituted oxazoles with modular scaffolds (AIE&#8208;ER, AIE&#8208;Mito, and AIE&#8208;Lyso), which can home into endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and lysosomes inside the cells. These oxazoles showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water and in the solid state due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, which was confirmed by pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence studies followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Confocal laser scanning microscopy studies revealed that AIE&#8208;ER, AIE&#8208;Mito, and AIE&#8208;Lyso efficiently homed into ER, mitochondria and lysosomes, respectively, in the HeLa cervical cancer cells and non&#8208;cancerous human retinal pigment epithelial RPE&#8208;1 cells within 3&#8197;h without showing any toxicity to the cells with high sub&#8208;cellular photostability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of highly substituted oxazole&#8208;based small molecule AIEgens for organelle imaging. We anticipate these novel AIEgens have promise to image sub&#8208;cellular organelles in different diseased states as well as understanding the inter&#8208;organelle interactions towards the development of novel therapeutics.

         <title>Towards Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Rhenium(I) Binuclear Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of a bimetallic complex, which combines the known photophysical properties of a rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex and a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex and that could act as a PS for PDT, is described.







Abstract
The search for new metal&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) for anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a fast&#8208;developing field of research. Knowing that polymetallic complexes bear a high potential as PDT PSs, in this study, we aimed at combining the known photophysical properties of a rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex and a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex to prepare a ruthenium&#8208;rhenium binuclear complex that could act as a PS for anticancer PDT. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of such a system and discuss its stability in aqueous solution.

     alt="Towards Ruthenium(II)-Rhenium(I) Binuclear Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation of a bimetallic complex, which combines the known photophysical properties of a rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex and a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex and that could act as a PS for PDT, is described.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for new metal-based photosensitizers (PSs) for anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a fast-developing field of research. Knowing that polymetallic complexes bear a high potential as PDT PSs, in this study, we aimed at combining the known photophysical properties of a rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex and a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex to prepare a ruthenium-rhenium binuclear complex that could act as a PS for anticancer PDT. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of such a system and discuss its stability in aqueous solution. In addition, one of our complexes prepared, which localized in mitochondria, was found to have some degree of selectivity towards two types of cancerous cells: human lung carcinoma A549 and human colon colorectal adenocarcinoma HT29, with interesting photo-index (PI) values of 135.1 and 256.4, respectively, compared to noncancerous retinal pigment epithelium RPE1 cells (22.4).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prevention of Swelling Phenomenon of Alginate Beads To Improve the Stability and Recyclability of Encapsulated Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new strategy to avoid alginate bead breakage by inhibiting the loss of calcium ions from the biocatalyst. Several techniques were employed to investigate how the addition of Ca2+ ions to buffer solutions affected their structure. Optimized biocatalyst exhibits significant improvements in terms of recycling, storage, and thermal stability.







Abstract
Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase (HLADH) has been immobilized on calcium&#8208;alginate beads and used for both oxidation and reduction reactions. To avoid swelling of the beads and their subsequent breakage, calcium ions were added to both reaction and storage solutions, allowing the beads to maintain the initial structural features. The techniques used for this purpose revealed that 2&#8197;mM Ca2+ is the optimal concentration, which does not significantly change the weight of the beads, the amount of water in them, and their external and internal structure. The optimized experimental procedure has been used to verify the properties of the enzyme in terms of reusability, storage, and thermal stability. The addition of calcium ions allows the enzyme to retain more than 80&#8201;% of its initial activity for fourteen cycles and approximately 50&#8201;% at the twentieth cycle. Moreover, when the biocatalyst has been stored in a buffer solution containing 2&#8197;mM Ca2+, the retention of enzyme activity after 30&#8197;days was 100&#8201;%, compared to that measured before incubation. The encapsulated enzyme exhibits greater thermal stability than free HLADH up to at least 60&#8201;&#176;C, preventing dimer dissociation into the two subunits.

         <title>The Evolutionary Pattern of Cocaine and Hyoscyamine Biosynthesis Provides Strategies To Produce Tropane Alkaloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to increase the availability of tropane alkaloids through metabolic engineering. This article highlights the latest advances in the biosynthetic pathway of cocaine, a tropane alkaloid produced by the Erythroxylaceae family and summarizes the conserved and specialized, characterized molecular mechanisms in tropane alkaloids synthesis that could guide, in a structured and efficient way, the production of these anticholinergic molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. Picture created with BioRender.







Abstract
Cocaine and hyoscyamine are two tropane alkaloids (TA) from Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae, respectively. These famous compounds possess anticholinergic properties that can be used to treat neuromuscular disorders. While the hyoscyamine biosynthetic pathway has been fully elucidated allowing its de novo synthesis in yeast, the cocaine pathway remained only partially elucidated. Recently, the Huang research group has completed the cocaine biosynthetic route by characterizing its two missing enzymes. This allowed the whole pathway to be transferring into Nicotiana benthamiana to achieve cocaine production. Here, besides highlighting the impact of this discovery, we discuss how TA biosynthesis evolved via the recruitment of two distinct and convergent pathways in Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae. Finally, while enriching our knowledge on TA biosynthesis, this diversification of the molecular actors involved in cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis opens perspectives in metabolic engineering by exploring enzyme biochemical plasticity that can ease and shorten TA pathway reconstitution in heterologous organisms.

         <title>Co&#8208;Immobilization of a Multi&#8208;Enzyme Cascade: (S)&#8208;Selective Amine Transaminases, l&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase and Catalase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;immobilization of hcLAAO4, hCAT and the (S)&#8208;selective ATA from Vibrio fluvialis (ATA&#8208;Vfl) resulted in faster reactions and allowed further reduction of the co&#8208;substrate amount to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% compared to the soluble enzyme cascade. An engineered ATA&#8208;Vfl&#8208;8M was used in the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade to produce an apremilast&#8208;intermediate.







Abstract
An enzyme cascade was established previously consisting of a recycling system with an l&#8208;amino acid oxidase (hcLAAO4) and a catalase (hCAT) for different &#945;&#8208;keto acid co&#8208;substrates of (S)&#8208;selective amine transaminases (ATAs) in kinetic resolutions of racemic amines. Only 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the co&#8208;substrate was required and l&#8208;amino acids instead of &#945;&#8208;keto acids could be applied. However, soluble enzymes cannot be reused easily. Immobilization of hcLAAO4, hCAT and the (S)&#8208;selective ATA from Vibrio fluvialis (ATA&#8208;Vfl) was addressed here. Immobilization of the enzymes together rather than on separate beads showed higher reaction rates most likely due to fast co&#8208;substrate channeling between ATA&#8208;Vfl and hcLAAO4 due to their close proximity. Co&#8208;immobilization allowed further reduction of the co&#8208;substrate amount to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% most likely due to a more efficient H2O2&#8208;removal caused by the stabilized hCAT and its proximity to hcLAAO4. Finally, the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade was reused in 3 cycles of preparative kinetic resolutions to produce (R)&#8208;1&#8208;PEA with high enantiomeric purity (97.3&#8201;%ee). Further recycling was inefficient due to the instability of ATA&#8208;Vfl, while hcLAAO4 and hCAT revealed high stability. An engineered ATA&#8208;Vfl&#8208;8M was used in the co&#8208;immobilized enzyme cascade to produce (R)&#8208;1&#8208;(3&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)ethanamine, an apremilast&#8208;intermediate, with a 1,000 fold lower input of the co&#8208;substrate.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ribosome collisions as the recognition platform of translation problems caused by various factors represents a cornerstone in the field of translation surveillance. We summarize our current knowledge about the pathways that target collided ribosomes. These pathways do so directly &#8208; by removing or recycling ribosomes, peptides, and mRNA &#8208; or indirectly &#8208; by modulating translation and cellular fate.







Abstract
During translation, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are decoded by ribosomes which can stall for various reasons. These include chemical damage, codon composition, starvation, or translation inhibition. Trailing ribosomes can collide with stalled ribosomes, potentially leading to dysfunctional or toxic proteins. Such aberrant proteins can form aggregates and favor diseases, especially neurodegeneration. To prevent this, both eukaryotes and bacteria have evolved different pathways to remove faulty nascent peptides, mRNAs and defective ribosomes from the collided complex. In eukaryotes, ubiquitin ligases play central roles in triggering downstream responses and several complexes have been characterized that split affected ribosomes and facilitate degradation of the various components. As collided ribosomes signal translation stress to affected cells, in eukaryotes additional stress response pathways are triggered when collisions are sensed. These pathways inhibit translation and modulate cell survival and immune responses. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge about rescue and stress response pathways triggered by ribosome collisions.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific and Multiple Fluorogenic Metabolic Glycan Labeling and Glycoproteomic Profiling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a multi&#8208;fluorescent MGL strategy combining ZIC&#8208;cHILIC StageTip enrichment and subsequent LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis for live cell glycan labeling and glycoprotein profiling in a single experiment. This approach enables the simultaneous site&#8208;specific labeling of cell&#8208;surface and intracellular sialylated glycoconjugates, global profiling, and identification of sialylated glycoproteins and glycans.







Abstract
Multicolor labeling for monitoring the intracellular localization of the same target type in the native environment using chemical fluorescent dyes is a challenging task. This approach requires both bioorthogonal and biocompatible ligations with an excellent fluorescence signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Here, we present a metabolic glycan labeling technique that uses homemade fluorogenic dyes to investigate glycosylation patterns in live cells. These dyes allowed us to demonstrate rapid and efficient simultaneous multilabeling of glycoconjugates with minimum fluorescence noise. Our results demonstrate that this approach is capable of not only probing sialylation and GlcNAcylation in cells but also specifically labeling the cell&#8208;surface and intracellular sialylated glycoconjugates in live cells. In particular, we performed site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;channel fluorescence imaging of extra and intracellular sialylated glycans in HeLa and PC9 cancer cells as well as identified fluorescently labeled sialylated glycoproteins and glycans by a direct enrichment approach combined with an MS&#8208;based proteomic analysis in the same experiment. In conclusion, this study provides multilabeling tools in cellular systems for simultaneous site&#8208;specific glycan imaging and glycoproteomic analysis to study potential cancer&#8208; and disease&#8208;associated glycoconjugates.

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated a multi-fluorescent MGL strategy combining ZIC-cHILIC StageTip enrichment and subsequent LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis for live cell glycan labeling and glycoprotein profiling in a single experiment. This approach enables the simultaneous site-specific labeling of cell-surface and intracellular sialylated glycoconjugates, global profiling, and identification of sialylated glycoproteins and glycans.

         <title>Tuning the Solution Self&#8208;Assembly of a Peptide&#8208;PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) Conjugate with &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on the aqueous solution self&#8208;assembly of peptide&#8208;polymer conjugate YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3K is examined. Cryo&#8208;TEM and SAXS show that the conjugate self&#8208;assembles into &#946;&#8208;sheet fibrils in aqueous solution, but complexation with &#945;CD leads to free&#8208;floating nanosheets in aqueous solution (with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure). The transition from fibrils to nanosheets is driven by an increase in the number of &#945;CD molecules threaded on the PEG chains, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cyclodextrins are saccharide ring&#8201;molecules which act as host cavities that can encapsulate small guest molecules or thread polymer chains. We investigate the influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on the aqueous solution self&#8208;assembly of a peptide&#8208;polymer conjugate YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3K previously studied by our group [Castelletto et&#8197;al., Polym. Chem., 2010, 1, 453&#8211;459]. This conjugate comprises a designed amyloid&#8208;forming peptide YYKLVFF that contains the KLVFF sequence from Amyloid &#946; peptide, A&#946;16&#8208;20, along with two aromatic tyrosine residues to enhance hydrophobicity, as well as polyethylene glycol PEG with molar mass 3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The conjugate self&#8208;assembles into &#946;&#8208;sheet fibrils in aqueous solution. Here we show that complexation with &#945;CD instead generates free&#8208;floating nanosheets in aqueous solution (with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure). The nanosheets comprise a bilayer with a hydrophobic peptide core and highly swollen PEG outer layers. The transition from fibrils to nanosheets is driven by an increase in the number of &#945;CD molecules threaded on the PEG chains, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These findings point to the use of cyclodextrin additives as a powerful means to tune the solution self&#8208;assembly in peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates and potentially other polymer/biomolecular hybrids.

         <title>Bacterial J&#8208;domains with C&#8208;terminal tags contact the substrate binding domain of DnaK and sequester chaperone activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional interactions between the molecular chaperone DnaK with cofactor J&#8208;proteins (DnaJs), and their homologs, are crucial to the maintenance of proteostasis across cell types. In the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, DnaK&#8208;DnaJ interactions are essential for cell growth and represent potential targets for antibiotic or adjuvant development. While the N&#8208;terminal J&#8208;domains of J&#8208;proteins are known to form important contacts with DnaK, C&#8208;terminal domains have varied roles. Here, we study the effect of adding C&#8208;terminal tags to N&#8208;terminal J&#8208;domain truncations of mycobacterial DnaJ1 and DnaJ2 to promote additional interactions with DnaK. We find that His6 tags uniquely promote binding to additional sites in the substrate binding domain on the C&#8208;terminus of DnaK. Other C&#8208;terminal tags attached to J&#8208;domains, even peptides known to interact with DnaK, do not produce the same effects. Expression of C&#8208;terminal&#8208;modified DnaJ1 or DnaJ2 J&#8208;domains in mycobacterial cells leads to suppression of chaperone activity following proteotoxic stress, which is exaggerated in the presence of a small molecule DnaK inhibitor. Hence, this work uncovers genetically&#8208;encodable J&#8208;protein variants that may be used to study chaperone&#8208;cofactor interactions in other organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Nanobarrel&#8208;Based Drug Delivery for Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubixin (DOX) delivery system was prepared, including Tn&#8208;PTX with different length of ssDNA tail (polythymine, Tn) and the DNA origami&#8208;based PTX\DOX\MUC&#8208;1 aptamer nanobarrel. In addition, the drug release, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake behaviors of Tn&#8208;PTX and nanobarrel in&#8197;vitro were evaluated.







Abstract
Co&#8208;delivery of anticancer drugs and target agents by endogenous materials is an inevitable approach towards targeted and synergistic therapy. Employing DNA base pair complementarities, DNA nanotechnology exploits a unique nanostructuring method and has demonstrated its capacity for nanoscale positioning and templated assembly. Moreover, the water solubility, biocompatibility, and modifiability render DNA structure suitable candidate for drug delivery applications. We here report single&#8208;stranded DNA tail conjugated antitumor drug paclitaxel (PTX), and the co&#8208;delivery of PTX, doxorubicin and targeting agent mucin 1 (MUC&#8208;1) aptamer on a DNA nanobarrel carrier. We investigated the effect of tail lengths on drug release efficiencies and dual drug codelivery&#8208;enabled cytotoxicity. Owing to the rapidly developing field of structural DNA nanotechnology, functional DNA&#8208;based drug delivery is promising to achieve clinical therapeutic applications.

         <title>Peptide Amphiphilic Supramolecular Nanogels: Competent Host for Notably Efficient Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Water&#8208;Insoluble Substrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembled nanogels in water have been developed from peptide amphiphile hydrogelators. The micro&#8208;heterogenous surface of the nanogels was judiciously utilized to catalyze the hydrolysis of water&#8208;insoluble substrates like p&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;n&#8208;alkanoates with remarkable efficiency by CV lipase immobilized at the interface of the gel nanoparticles. The rate enhancement of CV lipase in the presence of nanogels was significantly high in comparison to aqueous buffer and other self&#8208;aggregating systems.







Abstract
The present work depicts the development of stable nanogels in an aqueous medium that were exploited for efficient surface&#8208;active lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of water&#8208;insoluble substrates. Surfactant&#8208;coated gel nanoparticles (neutral NG1, anionic NG2, and cationic NG3) were prepared from peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator (G1, G2, and G3, respectively) at different hydrophilic and lipophilic balance (HLB). Chromobacterium viscosum (CV) lipase activity towards hydrolysis of water&#8208;insoluble substrates (p&#8208;nitrophyenyl&#8208;n&#8208;alkanoates (C4&#8211;C10)) in the presence of nanogels got remarkably improved by ~1.7&#8211;8.0 fold in comparison to that in aqueous buffer and other self&#8208;aggregates. An increase in hydrophobicity of the substrate led to a notable improvement in lipase activity in the hydrophilic domain (HLB&gt;8.0) of nanogels. The micro&#8208;heterogeneous interface of small&#8208;sized (10&#8211;65&#8197;nm) nanogel was found to be an appropriate scaffold for immobilizing surface&#8208;active lipase to exhibit superior catalytic efficiency. Concurrently, the flexible conformation of lipase immobilized in nanogels was reflected in its secondary structure having the highest &#945;&#8208;helix content from the circular dichroism spectra.

         <title>Development of On&#8208;DNA Cyclic Imide Synthesis for DNA Encoded Library Construction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;DNA synthesis of cyclic imides was developed. The transformation was achieved under mild conditions with high conversions and a broad functional group tolerance, suitable for DEL synthesis. The mechanism study of off&#8208;DNA and on&#8208;DNA chemical transformations revealed unique insights.







Abstract
Here, we describe a novel method for the on&#8208;DNA synthesis of cyclic imides, an important class of molecules that includes several well&#8208;known medications. Significantly, the new method enabled on&#8208;DNA synthesis under mild conditions with high conversions and a broad functional group tolerance, utilizing ubiquitous bifunctional amines and bis&#8208;carboxylic acid, or alkyl halides, and therefore served as the linchpin for DNA encoded library (DEL) synthesis. The mechanism study of off&#8208;DNA and on&#8208;DNA chemical transformations revealed unique insights in contrast to conventional chemical transformation.

         <title>Failure, Success, and Future Direction of Alzheimer Drugs Targeting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Cascade: Pros and Cons of Chemical and Biological Modalities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper examines immunotherapeutic and chemical drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and suggests a drug discovery strategy to overcome the obstacles in chemical&#8208;driven drug discovery. We evaluate the prospects of an alternative approach in chemical&#8208;based drug development that will help bypass the difficulties of chemical&#8208;driven drug development, capable of amyloid clearance just as immunotherapy candidates.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and has become a health concern worldwide urging for an effective therapeutic. The amyloid hypothesis, currently the most pursued basis of AD drug discovery, points the cause of AD to abnormal production and ineffective removal of pathogenic aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;). AD therapeutic research has been focused on targeting different species of A&#946; in the amyloidogenic process to control A&#946; content and recover cognitive decline. Among the different processes targeted, the clearance mechanism has been found to be the most effective, supported by the recent clinical approval of an A&#946;&#8208;targeting immunotherapeutic drug which significantly slowed cognitive decline. Although the current AD drug discovery field is extensively researching immunotherapeutic drugs, there are numerous properties of immunotherapy in need of improvements that could be overcome by an equally performing chemical drug. Here, we review chemical and immunotherapy drug candidates, based on their mechanism of modulating the amyloid cascade, selected from the AlzForum database. Through this review, we aim to summarize and evaluate the prospect of A&#946;&#8208;targeting chemical drugs.

         <title>Stable Binding of Full&#8208;Length Chemerin Is Driven by Negative Charges in the CMKLR1 N Terminus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemerin system is a key player in inflammatory diseases. The N terminus of the receptor CMKLR1 is crucial for high affinity ligand binding. A two&#8208;step binding mode is suggested. First, the C terminus binds deep in the transmembrane domain of the G protein&#8208;coupled receptor CMKLR1. In a second step, ionic interactions stabilize the binding of the protein chemerin.







Abstract
The adipokine chemerin is the endogenous ligand of the chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), a member of the family of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). This protein ligand plays an important role in obesity and inflammatory processes. Stable receptor&#8211;ligand interactions are highly relevant for its different physiological effects such as the migration of immune cells towards sites of inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that negative charges in the CMKLR1 N terminus are involved in the formation of strong contacts with a specific positively charged patch at the surface of full&#8208;length chemerin, which is absent in the short nonapeptide agonist chemerin&#8208;9, thus explaining its reduced affinity. Using receptor chimera of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and CMKLR1, we were able to identify the residues of this interaction and its relevance for stable full&#8208;length chemerin binding. This could help to develop more potent ligands for the treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (NDGA) Inhibits CsgA Polymerization, Bacterial Amyloid Biogenesis, and Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural product nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) found in the creosote bush is a curlicide. NDGA inhibits in&#8197;vitro polymerization of the bacterial amyloid protein CsgA and inhibits cellular amyloid biogenesis in E. coli. NDGA's curlicide activity is effective in inhibiting biofilm formation by pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium.







Abstract
Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae thrive in robust biofilm communities through the coproduction of curli amyloid fibers and phosphoethanolamine cellulose. Curli promote adhesion to abiotic surfaces and plant and human host tissues and are associated with pathogenesis in urinary tract infection and food&#8208;borne illness. The production of curli in the host has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. We report that the natural product nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is effective as a curlicide in E. coli. NDGA prevents CsgA polymerization in&#8197;vitro in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. NDGA selectively inhibits cell&#8208;associated curli assembly and inhibits uropathogenic E. coli biofilm formation. More broadly, this work emphasizes the ability to evaluate and identify bioactive amyloid assembly inhibitors by using the powerful gene&#8208;directed amyloid biogenesis machinery in E. coli.

         <title>Development and Characterization of Selective FAK Inhibitors and PROTACs with In Vivo Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PROteolysis&#8208;TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are a class of molecules that eliminate proteins through the cell's degradation machinery. Here, to degrade an attractive cancer drug target known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the Nabet and Jiang labs developed a novel FAK PROTAC (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146). They show that BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 triggers rapid and specific FAK degradation in cancer cells and in mouse models, and induces improved biological responses compared to small molecule inhibitors. The cover picture depicts a firefly (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146) luring a moth (FAK) to the carnivorous plant (proteasome) and was designed by DrawImpacts. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Jiang, B. Nabet et al.

         <title>Protein Modification via Nitrile Oxide&#8722;Dehydroalanine Cycloaddition: Formation of Isoxazoline Ring on the Protein Backbone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile Oxide&#8722;Dehydroalanine Cycloaddition is a bioconjugation strategy between dehydroalanine&#8208;containing proteins and nitrile oxides, remarkably, in fully aqueous&#8208;buffered systems without an additional catalyst. This novel method of chemical protein modification forms an isoxazoline ring enhancing the diversity of protein function and structure. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction adds a fluorescent label to the protein for applications like live&#8208;cell imaging and apoptosis detection. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Phanumartwiwath et al.

         <title>On the Role of Temperature in the Depolymerization of PET by FAST&#8208;PETase: an Atomistic Point of View on Possible Active&#8208;Site Pre&#8208;Organization and Substrate&#8208;Destabilization Effect</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme FAST&#8208;PETase, recently obtained by machine learning approach, can depolymerize polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a synthetic resin employed in plastics and in clothing fibers. Therefore it represents a promising solution for the recycling of PET&#8208;based materials. In the present study, a model of PET was adopted to describe the substrate, and all&#8208;atoms classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on apo&#8208; and substrate bound&#8208; FAST&#8208;PETase were carried out at 30&#176;C and 50&#176;C, to provide atomistic details on the binding step of the catalytic cycle. Comparative analysis sheds light on the interactions occurring between the FAST&#8208;PETase and 4PET at 50 &#176;C, the optimal working condition of the enzyme. Pre&#8208;organization of the enzyme active and binding sites has been highlighted while MD of FAST&#8208;PETase:4PET pointed out on the occurrence of solvent&#8208;inaccessible conformations of the substrate promoted by the enzyme. Indeed, neither of these conformations were observed during MD of substrate alone in solution performed at 30 &#176;C, 50 &#176;C and 150 &#176;C. The analysis led us to propose that, at 50 &#176;C, the FAST&#8208;PETase is pre&#8208;organized to bind the PET and that the interactions occurring in the binding site can promote more reactive conformation of PET substrate, thus enhancing the catalytic activity of the enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>3&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;Methoxypyrazines: Overview of Their Occurrence, Biosynthesis and Distribution in Edible Plants</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazines are ubiquitous in nature and biosynthesized by microorganisms, insects, and plants. Especially 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs) play a key role as important aroma compounds in foods. Recently, in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable isotope labeled compounds revealed l&#8208;leucine and l&#8208;serine as important precursors for IBMP. This discovery gave evidence for a metabolic interface between the MP&#8208;biosynthesis and photorespiration.







Abstract
Pyrazines are ubiquitous in nature &#8211; biosynthesized by microorganisms, insects, and plants. Due to their great structural diversity, they own manifold biological functions. Alkyl&#8208; and alkoxypyrazines for instance play a key role as semiochemicals, but also as important aroma compounds in foods. Especially 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs) have been of great research interest. MPs are associated with green and earthy attributes. They are responsible for the distinctive aroma properties of numerous vegetables. Moreover, they have a strong influence on the aroma of wines, in which they are primarily grape&#8208;derived. Over the years various methods have been developed and implemented to analyse the distribution of MPs in plants. In addition, the biosynthetic pathway of MPs has always been of particular interest. Different pathways and precursors have been proposed and controversially discussed in the literature. While the identification of genes encoding O&#8208;methyltransferases gave important insights into the last step of MP&#8208;biosynthesis, earlier biosynthetic steps and precursors remained unknown. It was not until 2022 that in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable isotope labeled compounds revealed l&#8208;leucine and l&#8208;serine as important precursors for IBMP. This discovery gave evidence for a metabolic interface between the MP&#8208;biosynthesis and photorespiration.

         <dc:description>One of the strategies for improved therapeutic effects in cancer therapy is combination chemotherapy. In this study, a flexible nano&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2) has been synthesized with the sonochemical process, co&#8208;loaded with alpha&#8208;tocopheryl succinate (TOS) and Curcumin (CCM). The anticancer activity of co&#8208;loaded Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 (Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2/TOS@CCM) against the HeLa cells has been compared with the single&#8208;loaded counterpart (Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2@CCM). MTT analysis indicates improved cytotoxicity of Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2/TOS@CCM. More investigations have been done with cell apoptosis assay, and the data indicates more apoptosis in the case of co&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;MOF. This study indicates the positive effect of the TOS presence on the anticancer effect enhancement of Fe&#8208;MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2@CCM to prepare a more efficient drug delivery nano&#8208;system.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the Selectivity of Light&#8208;Active Antimicrobial Agents &#8211; Or How To Get a Photosensitizer to the Desired Target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective targeting of light&#8208;active molecules to pathogens is a very attractive approach in modern drug discovery efforts. In this review, we summarize the current developments and highlights of recent literature dealing with the modification of photosensitizers to increase their target specificity.







Abstract
Photosensitizers combine the inherent reactivity of reactive oxygen species with the sophisticated reaction control of light. Through selective targeting, these light&#8208;active molecules have the potential to overcome certain limitations in drug discovery. Ongoing advances in the synthesis and evaluation of photosensitizer conjugates with biomolecules such as antibodies, peptides, or small&#8208;molecule drugs are leading to increasingly powerful agents for the eradication of a growing number of microbial species. This review article, therefore, summarizes challenges and opportunities in the development of selective photosensitizers and their conjugates described in recent literature. This provides adequate insight for newcomers and those interested in this field.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling in Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Reveals Broad Reactivity of a Carmofur&#8208;Derived Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activity&#8208;based protein profiling is a powerful chemoproteomic technique to detect active enzymes and identify targets and off&#8208;targets of drugs.&#160;Here, we report on the use of a carmofur&#8208;based activity&#8208;based probes to identify biologically relevant enzymes in the bacterial pathogen&#160;Staphylococcus aureus. Carmofur is an anti&#8208;neoplastic prodrug of 5&#8208;fluorouracil and also has&#160;&#160;antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity. Carmofur&#8208;probes were originally designed to target human acid ceramidase, a member of the NTN hydrolase family with an active&#8208;site cysteine nucleophile. Here, we first profiled the targets of a fluorescent carmofur&#8208;probe in live&#160;S. aureus&#160;under biofilm&#8208;promoting conditions and in liquid culture, before proceeding to target identification by liquid chromatograpy/mass spectrometry. Treatment with a carmofur&#8208;biotin probe led to enrichment of 20 enzymes from diverse families awaiting further characterization, including the NTN hydrolase&#8208;related IMP cyclohydrolase PurH. However, the probe preferentially labelled serine hydrolases, thus displaying a reactivity profile similar to carbamates. Our results suggest that the electrophilic&#160;N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;5&#8208;fluorouracil&#160;scaffold could potentially be optimized to achieve selectivity towards diverse enzyme families. The observed promiscuous reactivity profile suggests that the clinical use of carmofur presumably leads to inactivation of a number human and microbial enzymes that could lead to side&#8208;effects and/or contribute to therapeutic efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifunctional Dibromomaleimide Reagents Built Around A Lysine Scaffold Deliver Site&#8208;selective Dual&#8208;modality Antibody Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a rapid reduction&#8208;bridging&#8208;double click sequence to yield dual&#8208;modality antibody conjugates using aryl selenols as novel disulfide reducing reagents and trifunctional dibromomaleimides (DBMs) as bridging reagents. This work will provide more possibilities for the development of multi&#8208;functionalised antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and application of a selection of trifunctional reagents for the dual&#8208;modality modification of native, solvent accessible disulfide bonds in trastuzumab. The reagents were developed from the dibromomaleimide (DBM) platform with two orthogonal clickable functional groups built around a lysine core. We also describe the development of an aryl diselenide additive which enables antibody disulfide reduction in 4 minutes and a rapid overall reduction&#8208;bridging&#8208;double click sequence.

         <title>Delivering on Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Degradation Using Chemically Tailored PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pro&#8208;PROTAC, with precise and selective modulation within specific cell populations, would greatly enhance the target protein degradation process in a controllable manner. The development of such innovative chemistry holds significant promise for advancing the field of targeted protein degradation.







Abstract
PROTACs (Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras) have emerged as a groundbreaking class of chemical tools that facilitate the degradation of target proteins by leveraging the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS). However, the effective utilization of PROTACs in chemical biology studies and therapeutics encounters significant challenges when it comes to achieving cell&#8208;selective protein degradation and in&#8197;vivo applications. This review article aims to shed light on recent advancements in the development of Pro&#8208;PROTACs, which exhibit controlled protein degradation capabilities in response to external stimuli or disease&#8208;related endogenous biochemical signals. The article delves into the specific chemical strategies employed to regulate the interaction between PROTACs and E3 ubiquitin ligases or target proteins. These strategies enable spatial and temporal control over the protein degradation potential of Pro&#8208;PROTACs. Furthermore, the review summarizes recent investigations regarding the delivery of PROTACs using biodegradable nanoparticles for in&#8197;vivo applications and targeted protein degradation. Such delivery systems hold great promise for enabling efficient and selective protein degradation in&#8197;vivo. Lastly, the article provides a perspective on the future design of multifunctional PROTACs and their intracellular delivery mechanisms, with a particular focus on achieving cell&#8208;selective protein degradation.

         <dc:description>Three dinuclear coordination complexes generated from 1&#8208;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;((5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole (L), have been synthesized and characterized spectroscopically and structurally by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Reaction with iron(II) chloride and then copper(II) nitrate led to a co&#8208;crystal containing 78% of [Cu(NO3)(&#181;&#8208;Cl)(L&#8217;)]2 (C1) and 22% of [Cu(NO3)(&#181;&#8208;NO3)(L&#8217;)]2 (C2), where L was oxidized to a new ligand L&#8217;. A mechanism was provided. Reaction with copper chloride led to the dinuclear complex [Cu(Cl)(&#181;&#8208;Cl)(L)]2 (C3). The presence of N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure of C1 and C2, and C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N and C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl hydrogen bonding in the crystal structure of C3 led to supramolecular structures which were confirmed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. The ligands and their complexes were tested for free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power. The complex C1/C2 shows remarkable antioxidant activities as compared to the ligand L and reference compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleoside&#8208;driven specificity of DNA Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied adenosine binding specificities of two bacterial&#160;DNA methyltransferases&#160;Taq methyltransferase (M.TaqI), and HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI). While these DNA methyltransferases have similar cofactor binding pocket interactions, experimental data showed different specificity for novel cofactors&#160;((SNM) (S&#8208;guanosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SGM), S&#8208;cytidyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SCM), S&#8208;uridyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SUM)).Protein dynamics corroborate the experimental data on the cofactor specificities. For M.TaqI the specificity for S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) is governed by the tight binding on the nucleoside part of the cofactor, while for M.HhaI the degree of freedom of the nucleoside chain allows the acceptance of other bases. The experimental data proves a catalytically productive methylation by M.HhaI binding pocket for all the&#160;SNM (S&#8208;nucleobase&#8208;L&#8208;methionine).&#160;Our results suggest a new route for successful design of unnatural SNM analogues for methyltransferases as a tool for cofactor engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Biocatalytic Halogenation Cascades Involving a Single&#8208;Polypeptide Regeneration System for Diffusible FADH2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin dependent halogenases have attracted increasing interest for aryl halogenation at unactivated C&#8208;H positions because they are characterized by high regioselectivity, while requiring only FADH2, halide salts, and O2. Their use in combiCLEAs together with an NADH&#8208;dependent flavin reductase and a NADH&#8208;regeneration system for the preparative halogenation of tryptophan and indole derivatives has been previously described. However, multiple cultivations and protein purification steps are necessary for their production. We present a bifunctional regeneration enzyme for the two&#8208;step catalytic flavin regeneration using phosphite as an inexpensive sacrificial substrate. This fusion protein proved amenable to coexpression with various flavin dependent Trp&#8208;halogenases and enabled the carrier&#8208;free immobilization as combined cross&#8208;linked enzyme aggregates (combiCLEAs) for the preparative synthesis of halotryptophans. Scalability of this system was demonstrated by fed&#8208;batch fermentation in benchtop bioreactors at 2.5 L scale. Furthermore, the inclusion of a 6&#8208;halotryptophan specific dioxygenase into the coexpression strain further converts the halogenation product to the kynurenine derivative. This reaction cascade enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of l&#8208;4&#8208;Cl&#8208;kynurenine and its brominated analogue on preparative scale from a single cultivation for protein production.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Light&#8208;Driven Consortia for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia are promising for biotechnological applications. However, challenges still exist with these promises. Here, we discuss the progress of phototrophic consortia in biosynthesis and summarize present challenges that obstruct the progress of synthetic phototrophic communities, along with some suggestions on future research directions to make synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia more stable and controllable.







Abstract
Synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia composed of phototrophs and heterotrophs have attracted increasing attention owing to their potential to be used in sustainable biotechnology. In recent years, synthetic phototrophic consortia have been used to produce bulk chemicals, biofuels, and other valuable bioproducts. In addition, autotrophic&#8208;heterotrophic symbiosis systems have potential applications in wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and as a method for phytoplankton bloom control. Here, we discuss progress made on the biosynthesis of phototrophic microbial consortia. In addition, strategies for optimizing the synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia are summarized. Moreover, we highlight current challenges and future research directions for the development of robust and controllable synthetic light&#8208;driven consortia.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Anthrochelin, a Growth&#8208;Promoting Metallophore of the Human Pathogen Luteibacter anthropi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of the specialized metabolite anthrochelin enables the pathoadapted bacterium L. anthropi to achieve higher growth rates in the presence of copper. Insight into their function and biosynthesis reported herein could enable the development of therapeutics in the future.







Abstract
Various human pathogens have emerged from environmental strains by adapting to higher growth temperatures and the ability to produce virulence factors. A remarkable example of a pathoadapted bacterium is found in the genus Luteibacter, which typically comprises harmless soil microbes, yet Luteibacter anthropi was isolated from the blood of a diseased child. Up until now, nothing has been known about the specialized metabolism of this pathogen. By comparative genome analyses we found that L. anthropi has a markedly higher biosynthetic potential than other bacteria of this genus and uniquely bears an NRPS gene locus tentatively coding for the biosynthesis of a metallophore. By metabolic profiling, stable isotope labeling, and NMR investigation of a gallium complex, we identified a new family of salicylate&#8208;derived nonribosomal peptides named anthrochelins A&#8211;D. Surprisingly, anthrochelins feature a C&#8208;terminal homocysteine tag, which might be introduced during peptide termination. Mutational analyses provided insight into the anthrochelin assembly and revealed the unexpected involvement of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in oxazole formation. Notably, this heterocycle plays a key role in the binding of metals, especially copper(II). Bioassays showed that anthrochelin significantly promotes the growth of L. anthropi in the presence of low and high copper concentrations, which occur during infections.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Metal&#8208;Based Candidate Drugs as Modulators of the Cytoskeleton</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;based candidate drugs are promising modulators of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton&#8208;associated proteins. We summarise metal&#8208;based candidate molecules that influence the cytoskeleton, its associated proteins and discuss their potential to interfere in cancer&#8208;related processes.







Abstract
During recent years, accumulating evidence suggested that metal&#8208;based candidate drugs are promising modulators of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton&#8208;associated proteins. This was substantiated by the identification and validation of actin, vimentin and plectin as targets of distinct ruthenium(II)&#8208; and platinum(II)&#8208;based modulators. Despite this, structural information about molecular interaction is scarcely available. Here, we compile the scattered reports about metal&#8208;based candidate molecules that influence the cytoskeleton, its associated proteins and explore their potential to interfere in cancer&#8208;related processes, including proliferation, invasion and the epithelial&#8208;to&#8208;mesenchymal transition. Advances in this field depend crucially on determining binding sites and on gaining comprehensive insight into molecular drug&#8208;target interactions. These are key steps towards establishing yet elusive structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Construction of DNA Bilayer Tiles and Arrays Using Circular DNA Molecules as Scaffolds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer tHJ2 tiles have been constructed from previously reported monolayer tHJ motifs using small circular 84mer oligonucleotides as scaffolds. Both DNA porous wireframe nanotubes and planar arrays have been achieved with five tiling approaches.







Abstract
Using oligonucleotides to weave 2D tiles such as double crossovers (DX) and multi&#8208;arm junction (mAJ) tiles and arrays is well&#8208;known, but weaving 3D tiles is rare. Here, we report the construction of two new bilayer tiles in high yield using small circular 84mer oligonucleotides as scaffolds. Further, we designed five E&#8208;tiling approaches to construct porous nanotubes of microns long in medium yield via solution assembly and densely covered planar microscale arrays via surface&#8208;mediated assembly.

         <title>Photoradical&#8208;Mediated Catalyst&#8208;Independent Protein Cross&#8208;Link with Unusual Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible photo&#8208;activation of aryl residues solely with UV&#8208;irradiation at 282&#8197;nm in membrane and soluble proteins produces an unusual fluorophore with red&#8208;shifted fluorescence with emission of 430&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;actively modified natural amino acids have served as lucrative probes for precise mapping of the dynamics, interaction networks, and turnover of cytosolic proteins both in&#8197;vivo and ex vivo. In our attempts to extend the utility of photoreactive reporters to map the molecular characteristics of vital membrane proteins, we carried out site&#8208;selective incorporation of 7&#8208;fluoro&#8208;indole in the human mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2 (voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel isoform 2), with the aim of generating Trp&#8722;Phe/Tyr cross&#8208;links. Prolonged irradiation at 282&#8197;nm provided us with a surprisingly unusual fluorophore that displayed sizably red&#8208;shifted excitation (&#955;ex&#8208;max=280&#8197;nm&#8594;360&#8197;nm) and emission (&#955;em&#8208;max=330&#8197;nm&#8594;430&#8197;nm) spectra that was reversible with organic solvents. By measuring the kinetics of the photo&#8208;activated cross&#8208;linking with a library of hVDAC2 variants, we demonstrate that formation of this unusual fluorophore is kinetically retarded, independent of tryptophan, and is site&#8208;specific. Using other membrane (Tom40 and Sam50) and cytosolic (MscR and DNA Pol I) proteins, we additionally show that formation of this fluorophore is protein&#8208;independent. Our findings reveal the photoradical&#8208;mediated accumulation of reversible tyrosine cross&#8208;links, with unusual fluorescent properties. Our findings have immediate applications in protein biochemistry and UV&#8208;mediated protein aggregation and cellular damage, opening avenues for formulating therapeutics that prolong cell viability in humans.

         <title>Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Inducible PROTACs for Targeted Protein Degradation in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H2O2&#8208;inducible PROTAC precursors were developed, which can be more effectively activated in H2O2&#8208;rich cancer cells than that in H2O2&#8208;deficient normal cells to release the active PROTACs degrading BRD4/ER. This resulted in the intended cytotoxicity of cancer cells (A549 and H1299), while H2O2&#8208;deficent normal cells (WI38) were almost unaffected. Such strategy has the potential to improve the selectivity of PROTACs.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) provide a powerful technique to degrade targeted proteins utilizing the cellular ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The major concern is the host toxicity resulting from their poor selectivity. Inducible PROTACs responding to exogenous stimulus, such as light, improve their specificity, but it is difficult for photo&#8208;activation in deep tissues. Herein, we develop H2O2&#8208;inducible PROTAC precursors 2/5, which can be activated by endogenous H2O2 in cancer cells to release the active PROTACs 1/4 to effectively degrade targeted proteins. This results in the intended cytotoxicity towards cancer cells while targeted protein in normal cells remains almost unaffected. The higher Bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) degradation activity and cytotoxicity of 2 towards cancer cells is mainly due to the higher endogenous concentration of H2O2 in cancer cells (A549 and H1299), characterized by H2O2&#8208;responsive fluorescence probe 3. Western blot assays and cytotoxicity experiments demonstrate that 2 degrades BRD4 more effectively and is more cytotoxic in H2O2&#8208;rich cancer cells than in H2O2&#8208;deficient normal cells. This method is also extended to estrogen receptor (ER)&#8208;PROTAC precursor 5, showing H2O2&#8208;dependent ER degradation ability. Thus, we establish a novel strategy to induce targeted protein degradation in a H2O2&#8208;dependent way, which has the potential to improve the selectivity of PROTACs.

         <title>Garcinolic acid distinguishes between GACKIX domains and modulates interaction networks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products are often uniquely suited to modulate protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) due to their architectural and functional group complexity relative to synthetic molecules. Here we demonstrate that the natural product garcinolic acid allosterically blocks the CBP/p300 KIX PPI network and displays excellent selectivity over related GACKIX motifs. It does so via a strong interaction (KD 1 &#956;M) with a non&#8208;canonical binding site containing a structurally dynamic loop in CBP/p300 KIX. Garcinolic acid engages full&#8208;length CBP in the context of the proteome and in doing so effectively inhibits KIX&#8208;dependent transcription in a leukemia model. As the most potent small&#8208;molecule KIX inhibitor yet reported, garcinolic acid represents an important step forward in the therapeutic targeting of CBP/p300.</dc:description>

         <title>A Brief Guide to Preparing a Peptide&#8211;Drug Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly instructions: Peptide&#8211;drug conjugates (PDCs) are constituted of a peptide/peptidomimetic unit and a drug/probe unit. The conjugation between these two portions can be performed either in a click or a non&#8208;click reaction, based on the available functional groups on both the peptide/drug residues.







Abstract
Peptide&#8211;drug conjugates (PDCs) have recently emerged as interesting hybrid constructs not only for targeted therapy, but also for the early diagnosis of different pathologies. In most cases, the crucial step in the PDC synthesis is the final conjugation step, where a specific drug is bound to a particular peptide&#8208;/peptidomimetic&#8208;targeting unit. Thus, this concept paper aims to give a short guide to determining the finest conjugation reaction, by considering in particular the reaction conditions, the stability of the linker and the major pros and cons of each reaction. Based on the recent PDCs reported in literature, the most common and efficient conjugation methods will be systematically presented and compared, generating a short guide to consult while planning the synthesis of a novel peptide&#8211;drug conjugate.

         <title>Facile Production of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Factor LasB in Escherichia coli for Structure&#8208;Based Drug Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elastase LasB is one of the main virulence factors of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an important target for the development of novel anti&#8208;infectives. Thus far, LasB has had to be purified from the supernatant of P. aeruginosa cultures. We report a new protocol for the production of LasB in E. coli to accelerate drug development programs.







Abstract
The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a number of virulence factors at its disposal that play crucial roles in the progression of infection. LasB is one of the major virulence factors and exerts its effects through elastolytic and proteolytic activities aimed at dissolving connective tissue and inactivating host defense proteins. LasB is of great interest for the development of novel pathoblockers to temper the virulence, but access has thus far largely been limited to protein isolated from Pseudomonas cultures. Here, we describe a new protocol for high&#8208;level production of native LasB in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that this facile approach is suitable for the production of mutant, thus far inaccessible LasB variants, and characterize the proteins biochemically and structurally. We expect that easy access to LasB will accelerate the development of inhibitors for this important virulence factor.

         <title>Spirocyclic Chromenopyrazole Inhibitors Disrupting the Interaction between the RNA&#8208;Binding Protein LIN28 and Let&#8208;7</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclization of chromenopyrazoles improved inhibitory activity against the oncogenic RNA&#8208;binding protein LIN28. In cellular assays, antiproliferation activity against cancer cells and upregulation of mature let&#8208;7 miRNA were observed. The reported compounds serve as a starting point for the development of bifunctional molecules.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of the RNA&#8208;binding and regulating protein LIN28 have the potential to be developed as chemical probes for biological perturbation and as therapeutic candidates. Reported small molecules disrupting the interaction between LIN28 and let&#8208;7 miRNA suffer from moderate to weak inhibitory activity and flat structure&#8208;activity relationship, which hindered the development of next&#8208;generation LIN28 inhibitors that warrant further evaluations. We report herein the identification of new LIN28 inhibitors utilizing a spirocyclization strategy based on a chromenopyrazole scaffold. Representative compounds 2&#8211;5 showed potent in&#8197;vitro inhibitory activity against LIN28&#8208;let&#8208;7 interaction and single&#8208;digit micromolar potency in inhibiting the proliferation of LIN28&#8208;expressing JAR cancer cells. The spirocyclic compound 5 incorporated a position that is amenable for functional group appendage and further structural modifications. The binding mode of compound 5 with the LIN28 cold shock domain was rationalized via a molecular docking analysis.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Fluorescence Labeling Of Genomic DNA For Simultaneous Detection Of Global 5&#8208;methylcytosine And 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;methylcytosine and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine are epigenetic modifications involved in gene regulation and cancer. We present a new, simple, and high&#8208;throughput platform for multi&#8208;color epigenetic analysis. The novelty of our approach is the ability to multiplex methylation and de&#8208;methylation signals in the same assay. We utilize an engineered methyltransferase enzyme that recognizes and labels all unmodified CpG sites with a fluorescent cofactor. In combination with the already established labeling of the de&#8208;methylation mark 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine via enzymatic glycosylation, we obtained a robust platform for simultaneous epigenetic analysis of these marks. We assessed the global epigenetic levels in multiple samples of colorectal cancer and observed a 3.5&#8208;fold reduction in 5hmC levels but no change in DNA methylation levels between sick and healthy individuals. We also measured epigenetic modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and observed a decrease in both modification levels (5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine: whole blood 30%; peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 40%. 5&#8208;methylcytosine: whole blood 53%; PBMCs 48%). Our findings propose using a simple blood test as a viable method for analysis, simplifying sample handling in diagnostics. Importantly, our results highlight the assay's potential for epigenetic evaluation of clinical samples, benefiting research and patient management.</dc:description>

         <title>Faradaic Fenton Pixel: Reactive Oxygen Species Delivery Using Au/Cr Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically generated hydrogen peroxide and anodically corroded chromium ions meet to generate a cascade of reactive oxygen species that can be used to induce cancer cell death in a novel approach to DC cancer therapy.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an integral part of many anticancer therapies. Fenton&#8208;like processes involving reactions of peroxides with transition metal ions are a particularly potent and tunable subset of ROS approaches. Precise on&#8208;demand dosing of the Fenton reaction is an area of great interest. Herein, we present a concept of an electrochemical faradaic pixel that produces controlled amounts of ROS via a Fenton&#8208;like process. The pixel comprises a cathode and anode, where the cathode reduces dissolved oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The anode is made of chromium, which is electrochemically corroded to yield chromium ions. Peroxide and chromium interact to form a highly oxidizing mixture of hydroxyl radicals and hexavalent Cr ions. After benchmarking the electrochemical properties of this type of device, we demonstrate how it can be used under in&#8197;vitro conditions with a cancer cell line. The faradaic Fenton pixel is a general and scalable concept that can be used for on&#8208;demand delivery of redox&#8208;active products for controlling a physiological outcome.

Herein, we present a concept of an electrochemical faradaic pixel that produces controlled amounts of ROS via a Fenton-like process. The pixel comprises a cathode and anode, where the cathode reduces dissolved oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The anode is made of chromium, which is electrochemically corroded to yield chromium ions. Peroxide and chromium interact to form a highly oxidizing mixture of hydroxyl radicals and hexavalent Cr ions. After benchmarking the electrochemical properties of this type of device, we demonstrate how it can be used under in&#8197;vitro conditions with a cancer cell line. The faradaic Fenton pixel is a general and scalable concept that can be used for on-demand delivery of redox-active products for controlling a physiological outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chromenopyrazole&#8722;Peptide Conjugates as Small&#8208;Molecule Based Inhibitors Disrupting the Protein&#8722;RNA Interaction of LIN28&#8208;let&#8208;7</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctionalization strategy was developed to yield small&#8208;molecule&#8208;peptide conjugates that target the RNA&#8208;binding protein LIN28. A peptide&#8208;based fragment was introduced to known small&#8208;molecule inhibitors to form a new chemical modality. Contrary to the limitations associated with peptides, the conjugates proved to be stable and permeable in initial biophysical evaluations.







Abstract
Targeting the protein&#8722;RNA interaction of LIN28 and let&#8208;7 is a promising strategy for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. However, a limited number of small&#8208;molecule inhibitors disrupting the LIN28&#8208;let&#8208;7 interaction with potent efficacy are available. Herein, we developed a novel LIN28&#8208;inhibiting strategy by targeting selective hotspot amino acids at the LIN28&#8208;let&#8208;7 binding interface with small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based bifunctional conjugates. Starting from reported small&#8208;molecule LIN28 inhibitors, we identified a feasible linker&#8208;attachment position after performing a structure&#8208;activity relationship exploration based on the LIN28&#8208;targeting chromenopyrazoles. In parallel, a virtual alanine scan identified hotspot residues at the protein&#8722;RNA binding interface, based on which we designed a set of peptides to enhance the interaction with the identified hotspot residues. Conjugation of the tailor&#8208;designed peptides with linker&#8208;attached chromenopyrazoles yielded a series of bifunctional small&#8208;molecule&#8208;peptide conjugates, represented by compound 83 (PH&#8208;223), as a new LIN28&#8208;targeting chemical modality. Our result demonstrated an unexplored rational design approach using bifunctional conjugates to target protein&#8722;RNA interactions.

         <title>Computational Mechanistic Investigations of Biocatalytic Nitrenoid C&#8722;H Functionalizations via Engineered Heme Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic nitrenoid intra&#8208; and intermolecular C&#8722;H aminations/amidations via engineered heme proteins have been investigated by different computational methods to reveal mechanistic origins of reactivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity as well as effects of substrate substituent, axial ligand, metal center, and protein environment.







Abstract
Engineered heme proteins were developed to possess numerous excellent biocatalytic nitrenoid C&#8722;H functionalizations. Computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT), hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were employed to help understand some important mechanistic aspects of these heme nitrene transfer reactions. This review summarizes advances of computational reaction pathway results of these biocatalytic intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8722;H aminations/amidations, focusing on mechanistic origins of reactivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity as well as effects of substrate substituent, axial ligand, metal center, and protein environment. Some important common and distinctive mechanistic features of these reactions were also described with brief outlook of future development.

         <title>Examination of Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis in Apicomplexa</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apicomplexan polyketides: Protists, including pathogenic apicomplexan parasites, contain polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene clusters, but the function and metabolic products of the enzymes remain elusive. The domain architecture and biochemical properties of a Toxoplasma gondii polyketide synthase hint at distinct features compared to characterized systems. The presence of these clusters in a specific parasite subclass suggests they might facilitate walled forms of the parasite's lifecycle.







Abstract
Natural product discovery has traditionally relied on the isolation of small molecules from producing species, but genome&#8208;sequencing technology and advances in molecular biology techniques have expanded efforts to a wider array of organisms. Protists represent an underexplored kingdom for specialized metabolite searches despite bioinformatic analysis that suggests they harbor distinct biologically active small molecules. Specifically, pathogenic apicomplexan parasites, responsible for billions of global infections, have been found to possess multiple biosynthetic gene clusters, which hints at their capacity to produce polyketide metabolites. Biochemical studies have revealed unique features of apicomplexan polyketide synthases, but to date, the identity and function of the polyketides synthesized by these megaenzymes remains unknown. Herein, we discuss the potential for specialized metabolite production in protists and the possible evolution of polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters in apicomplexan parasites. We then focus on a polyketide synthase from the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii to discuss the unique domain architecture and properties of these proteins when compared to previously characterized systems, and further speculate on the possible functions for polyketides in these pathogenic parasites.

         <title>Extended Scope and Understanding of Zinc&#8208;Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases for Reduction of Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme catalysis: To this date, the alcohol dehydrogenase from Thauera aromatica was the only known enzyme with a distinct preference for selective reduction of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic diketones. Here we introduce three more enzymes with the same peculiar substrate acceptance elucidating structural features related with the activity.







Abstract
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) are important tools for generating chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones. Previously, only the ADH of Thauera aromatica was known to convert cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones with appropriate preference. Here, we extend the spectrum of suitable enzymes by three alcohol dehydrogenases from Citrifermentans bemidjiense (CibADH), Deferrisoma camini (DecADH), and Thauera phenylacetica (ThpADH). Of these, DecADH is characterized by very high thermostability; CibADH and ThpADH convert &#945;&#8208;halogenated cyclohexanones with increased activity. Otherwise, however, the substrate spectrum of all four ADHs is highly conserved. Structural considerations led to the conclusion that conversion of diketones requires not only the expansion of the active site into a large binding pocket, but also the circumferential modification of almost all amino acid residues that form the first shell of the binding pocket. The constellation appears to be overall highly specific for the relative positioning of the carbonyl functions and the size of the C&#8208;ring.

         <title>Lipase&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Protecting Group Silyl Ethers: An Unspecific Side Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silyl ethers are important protecting groups in organic synthesis and a selective cleavage or formation is highly desirable. The ability of lipases to catalyze the reactions has long been suspected. This study gives experimental and structural evidence that both cleavage and formation of trimethyl ethers are promoted by lipases, but not at the active site.







Abstract
Silyl ether protecting groups are important tools in organic synthesis, ensuring selective reactions of hydroxyl functional groups. Enantiospecific formation or cleavage could simultaneously enable the resolution of racemic mixtures and thus significantly increase the efficiency of complex synthetic pathways. Based on reports that lipases, which today are already particularly important tools in chemical synthesis, can catalyze the enantiospecific turnover of trimethylsilanol (TMS)&#8208;protected alcohols, the goal of this study was to determine the conditions under which such a catalysis occurs. Through detailed experimental and mechanistic investigation, we demonstrated that although lipases mediate the turnover of TMS&#8208;protected alcohols, this occurs independently of the known catalytic triad, as this is unable to stabilize a tetrahedral intermediate. The reaction is essentially non&#8208;specific and therefore most likely completely independent of the active site. This rules out lipases as catalysts for the resolution of racemic mixtures of alcohols through protection or deprotection with silyl groups.

     alt="Lipase-Mediated Conversion of Protecting Group Silyl Ethers: An Unspecific Side Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silyl ethers are important protecting groups in organic synthesis and a selective cleavage or formation is highly desirable. The ability of lipases to catalyze the reactions has long been suspected. This study gives experimental and structural evidence that both cleavage and formation of trimethyl ethers are promoted by lipases, but not at the active site.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Short Peptides with Perfluoroalkyl Side Chains and Evaluation of Their Cellular Uptake Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptides bearing RF&#8208;AAs were synthesized and the hydrophilic dye Alexa Fluor 647 (AF) was employed as a hydrophilic model cargo. AF&#8208;RF&#8208;tripeptides formed nanoparticles in aqueous media and were taken up by cells. Both the length of the RF group and the absolute configuration of the RF&#8208;AAs significantly affected the size of the nanoparticles, which is an important factor for efficient cellular uptake by endocytosis.







Abstract
With an increasing demand for macromolecular biotherapeutics, the issue of their poor cell&#8208;penetrating abilities requires viable and relevant solutions. Herein, we report tripeptides bearing an amino acid with a perfluoroalkyl (RF) group adjacent to the &#945;&#8208;carbon. RF&#8208;containing tripeptides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to transport a conjugated hydrophilic dye (Alexa Fluor 647) into the cells. RF&#8208;containing tripeptides with the fluorophore showed high cellular uptake efficiency and none of them were cytotoxic. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the absolute configuration of perfluoroalkylated amino acids (RF&#8208;AAs) affects not only nanoparticle formation but also the cell permeability of the tripeptides. These novel RF&#8208;containing tripeptides are potentially useful as short and noncationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs).

         <title>Caulobacter segnis dioxygenase CsO2: a practical biocatalyst for stilbenoid ozonolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ozonolysis is a useful as well as dangerous reaction for performing alkene cleavage. On the other hand, enzymes are considered a more sustainable and safer alternative. Among them, Caulobacter segnis dioxygenase (CsO2) known so far for its ability to catalyze the coenzyme&#8208;free oxidation of vinylguaiacol into vanillin, was selected and its substrate scope evaluated towards diverse natural and synthetic stilbenoids. Under optimized conditions, CsO2 catalyzed the oxidative cleavage of the C=C double bonds of various trans&#8208;stilbenes, providing that a hydroxyl moiety was necessary in para&#8208;position of the phenyl group (e.g., resveratrol and its derivatives) for the reaction to take place, which was confirmed by modelling studies. The reactions occurred rapidly (0.5&#8208;3 h) with high conversions (95&#8208;99%) and without formation of by&#8208;products. The resveratrol biotransformation was carried out on 50&#8208;mL scale thus confirming the feasibility of the biocatalytic system as a preparative method.</dc:description>

         <title>[4.3.1] Bicyclic FKBP ligands inhibit Legionella pneumophila infection by LpMip&#8208;dependent and LpMip independent mechanisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires&#8217; disease, a serious form of pneumonia. Its macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip), a member of a highly conserved family of FK506&#8208;binding proteins, plays a major role in the proliferation of the Gram&#8208;negative bacterium in host organisms. In this work, we test our library of &gt;1000 FKBP&#8208;focused ligands for inhibition of LpMip. The [4.3.1]&#8208;bicyclic sulfonamide turned out as a highly preferred scaffold and provided the most potent LpMip inhibitors known so far. Selected compounds were non&#8208;toxic to human cells, displayed antibacterial activity and block bacterial proliferation in cellular infection&#8208;assays as well as infectivity in human lung tissue explants. The results confirm [4.3.1]&#8208;bicyclic sulfonamides as anti&#8208;legionellal agents, although their anti&#8208;infective properties cannot be explained by inhibition of LpMip alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Formate Dehydrogenase for NADPH Regeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) constitute a major hydrogen donor for oxidative/reductive bio&#8208;transformations. NAD(P)H regeneration systems coupled with formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) represent a dreamful method. However, most of the native FDHs are NAD+&#8208;dependent and suffer from insufficient reactivity compared to other enzymatic tools such as glucose dehydrogenase. An efficient and competitive NADP+ utilizing FDH necessitates the availability and robustness of NADPH regeneration systems. Herein, we report the engineering of a new FDH from Candida dubliniensis (CdFDH) which showed no strict NAD+ preference by a structure guided rational/semi&#8208;rational design. A combinatorial mutant CdFDH&#8208;M4 (D197Q/Y198R/Q199N/A372S/K371T/&#8710;Q375/K167R/H16L/K159R) exhibited 75&#8208;fold intensification of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Moreover, CdFDH&#8208;M4 has been successfully employed in diverse asymmetric oxidative/reductive processes with cofactor total turnover number (TTN) ranging from 135 to 986, making it potentially useful for NADPH required biocatalytic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A degron blocking strategy towards improved CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTAC selectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules inducing protein degradation are important pharmacological tools to interrogate complex biology and are rapidly translating into clinical agents. However, to fully realise the potential of these molecules, selectivity remains a limiting challenge. Herein, we addressed the issue of selectivity in the design of CRL4CRBN recruiting PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). Thalidomide derivatives used to generate CRL4CRBN recruiting PROTACs have well described intrinsic monovalent degradation profiles by inducing the recruitment of neo&#8208;substrates such as GSPT1, Ikaros and Aiolos. We leveraged structural insights from known CRL4CRBN neo&#8208;substrates to attenuate and indeed remove this monovalent degradation function in well&#8208;known CRL4CRBN molecular glues degraders, namely CC&#8208;885 and Pomalidomide. We then applied these design principles on a previously published BRD9 PROTAC (dBRD9&#8208;A) and generated an analogue with improved selectivity profile. Finally, we implemented a computational modelling pipeline to show that our degron blocking design does not impact PROTAC induced ternary complex formation. We believe that the tools and principles presented in this work will be valuable to support the development of targeted protein degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative analysis of The High Yield Hydrolysis of Kelp by Laminarinase and Alginate Lyase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kelp is an abundant, farmable biomass containing laminarin and alginate as major polysaccharides, providing an excellent model substrate for study of their deconstruction by simple enzyme mixtures. Our previous study showed strong reactivity of glycoside hydrolase family 55 during hydrolysis of purified laminarin, raising the question of its reactivity with intact kelp. In this study, we determined that combination of a single glycoside hydrolase family 55 &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;exoglucanase with a broad specificity alginate lyase from polysaccharide lyase family 18 gives efficient hydrolysis of untreated kelp to a mixture of simple sugars glucose, gentiobiose, mannitol&#8208;end glucose, and mannuronic and guluronic acids and their soluble oligomers. Quantitative assignments from nanostructure initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) and 2D HSQC NMR and analysis of the reaction time&#8208;course are provided. The data suggests that binary combinations of enzymes targeted to the unique polysaccharide composition of marine biomass are sufficient to deconstruct kelp into soluble sugars for microbial fermentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogels with reversible cross&#8208;links for improved localised stem cell retention: a review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Successful stem cell applications could significantly impact the medical fields, where many lives are at stake. However, the translation of stem cells to the clinic could be improved by challenges in stem cell transplantation and in vivo retention at the site of tissue damage.&#160; This review aims to provide the most recent insights into developing hydrogels that can deliver, retain, and accommodate stem cells for tissue repair. Hydrogels can be used for tissue engineering as their flexibility and water content makes them excellent substitutes for the native extracellular matrix. Moreover, the mechanical properties of hydrogels are highly tuneable, and recognition moieties to control cell behaviour and fate can quickly be introduced. This review covers the parameters necessary for the physicochemical design of adaptable hydrogels, the variety of (bio)materials that can be used in such hydrogels, their application in stem cell delivery and some recently developed chemistries for reversible cross&#8208;linking. Implementing physical and dynamic covalent chemistry has resulted in adaptable hydrogels that can mimic the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix.</dc:description>
