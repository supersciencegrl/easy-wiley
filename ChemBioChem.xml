      <title>Chemical labelling of protein 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation</title>
      <dc:description>Nature utilizes a diverse array of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) to regulate protein structure, activity, localization, and function. Among them, protein 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation derived from Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential PTM for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To explore its functions, various chemical probes mimicking the natural structure of 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation have been developed. In this minireview, we summarize these chemical probes and describe their applications in direct and metabolic labelling of proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells.</dc:description>

      <title>An Economical High&#8208;Throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; Assay for Screening Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) involves in many cellular processes and selective OGT inhibitors are valuable tools to investigate O&#8208;GlcNAcylation functions, and could potentially lead to therapeutics. However, high&#8208;throughput OGT assays that are suitable for large&#8208;scale HTS, and can identify inhibitors targeting both acceptor, donor sites, and allosteric binding&#8208;sites are still lacking. Here, we report the development of a high&#8208;throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; OGT assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a low&#8208;cost and superior &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221;. With this assay, 2&#8208;methyleurotinone was identified as a low &#956;M&#8208;range OGT inhibitor. This type of assay with BSA as &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; would find more applications with other glycosyltransferases.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The poor solubility of many nucleosides and nucleobases in aqueous solution demands harsh reaction conditions (base, heat, cosolvent) in nucleoside phosphorylase&#8208;catalyzed processes to facilitate substrate loading beyond the low millimolar range. This, in turn, requires enzymes which withstand these conditions. Herein we report that the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from  Thermus thermophilus  is active over an exceptionally broad pH (4&#8722;10), temperature (up to 100&#160;&#176;C) and cosolvent space (up to 80% (v/v) non&#8208;aqueous medium) and displays tremendous stability under harsh reaction conditions with predicted total turnover numbers of more than 10  6  for various pyrimidine nucleosides. However, its use as a biocatalyst for preparative applications is critically limited due to its inhibition by nucleobases at low concentrations, which is unprecedented among non&#8208;specific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via estimation of the enzyme promiscuous activity in the perhydrolysis reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in the view of availability, atom&#8208;economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling the physiological processes, but unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to prevent the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the peracid formation. According to our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting the hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous media.</dc:description>

      <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
      <dc:description>Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp  Parachartergus fraternus  that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a non&#8208;toxic cell penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.</dc:description>

      <title>&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin encapsulation of synthetic AHLs: drug delivery implications and quorum&#8208;quenching exploits.</title>
      <dc:description>Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, regulate phenotypic switching in a population density&#8208;dependent manner through a phenomenon known as quorum sensing (QS). For Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, QS relies on the synthesis, transmission, and perception of low molecular weight signal molecules that are predominantly N&#8208;acyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactones (AHLs). Efforts to disrupt AHL&#8208;mediated QS have largely focused on the development of synthetic AHL analogues (SAHLAs) that are structurally similar to native AHLs. However, like AHLs, these molecules tend to be hydrophobic and are poorly soluble under aqueous conditions. Water&#8208;soluble macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), that encapsulate hydrophobic guests, have long been used by both agricultural and pharmaceutical industries to overcome solubility issues associated with hydrophobic compounds of interest. Conveniently, CDs have also demonstrated anti&#8208;AHL&#8208;mediated QS effects. Here, using fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and mass spectrometry, we evaluate the affinity of SAHLAs, as well as their hydrolysis products, for &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion. We also evaluated the ability of these complexes to inhibit wildtype P. aeruginosa virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans host infection study, for the first time. Our efforts confirm the potential of &#946;&#8208;CDs for the improved delivery of SAHLAs at the host:microbial interface, expanding the utility of this approach as a strategy for probing and controlling QS.</dc:description>

      <title>Biosynthetic Intermediate Probes for Visualizing and Identifying the Biosynthetic Enzymes of Plant Metabolites</title>
      <dc:description>
See what&#8216;s missing: Biosynthetic study of plant metabolites paves the way for manufacturing plant&#8208;derived drugs by synthetic biology. However, identifying any missing enzymes in a plant metabolic pathway is a formidable challenge. Biosynthetic intermediate probes make potentially useful tools to resolve the challenge by visualizing biosynthetic enzymes to facilitate transcriptome analysis or chemical proteomics approaches for identifying the biosynthetic enzymes.







Abstract
Plant metabolites play important roles in both plant physiology and drug discovery. Taking advantage of new emerging technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), whole genome assembly, bioinformatics, omics&#8208;based strategies have been demonstrated as popular and powerful ways to elucidate complex metabolic pathways in plants. In this viewpoint, biosynthetic intermediates probes have been proposed as the potentinal tools to study the plant natural product biosynthesis via chemical proteomics appoaches or transcriptome analysis.

      <title>How to quantify a genetic firewall? A polarity based metric for genetic code engineering</title>
      <dc:description>Genetic code engineering aims to produce organisms that translate genetic information in a different way than prescribed by the standard genetic code. This endeavor could eventually lead to a genetic isolation, where an organism that operates under a different genetic code won&#8217;t be able to transfer functional genes with other living species, thereby standing behind a genetic firewall. It is not clear however, how distinct the code should be, nor how to measure the distance. Herein, we developed the metric (&#8710;code), where we assign the amino acids with the polarity indices (  clogD7  ) to calculate the distances between pairs of genetic codes. We then calculated the distance between a set of 204 genetic codes, including the 24 known distinct natural codes, 11 extreme distance codes created computationally, 9 theoretical special purpose codes from literature and 160 codes where canonical amino acids were replaced by non&#8208;canonical chemical analogues. The metric can be used for building strategies towards creation of semantically alienated organisms, testing the strength of genetic firewalls. This metric provides the basis for a map of the genetic codes, which may guide future efforts towards novel biochemical worlds, biosafety and deep barcoding applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

      <title>Discovery and Engineering of a Novel Baeyer&#8211;Villiger Monooxygenase from Gordonia sihwensis with High Normal Regioselectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are remarkable biocatalysts for the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of ketones to generate esters or lactones. The regioselectivity of BVMOs is essential for determining the ratio of the two regioisomeric products (&#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;abnormal&#8221;) when catalyzing asymmetric ketone substrates. Starting from a known normal&#8208;preferring BVMO sequence from  Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 (  Pp  BVMO), a novel BVMO from  Gordonia sihwensis  (  Gs  BVMO) with higher normal regioselectivity (up to 97/3) was identified. Furthermore, protein engineering increased the specificity constant (  k  cat  /  K  M  ) 8.9&#8208;fold to 484 s  &#8208;1  mM  &#8208;1  for 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from oleic acid. Consequently, by using the variant  Gs  BVMO  C308L  as an efficient biocatalyst, 10&#8208;ketostearic acid was efficiently transformed into &#160;9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid, with a space&#8208;time yield of 60.5 g L  &#8208;1  d  &#8208;1  . This study showed that the mutant with higher regioselectivity and catalytic efficiency could be applied to prepare medium&#8208;chain &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids through biotransformation of long&#8208;chain aliphatic keto acids derived from renewable plant oils.</dc:description>

      <title>Courses Based on iGEM/BIOMOD Competitions Are the Ideal Format for Research&#8208;Based Learning of Xenobiology</title>
      <dc:description>
Competition experiments: &#8220;iGEM&#8208;Synthetic Biology&#8221; is a student&#8208;centered, research&#8208;based teaching format for xenobiology. Students conduct their own experiments in an interdisciplinary team with a focus on participation in an international competition. Such formats motivate students to show the highest performance and are possibly the best way to teach novel emerging research fields within the Humboldtian model of higher education.







Abstract
Synthetic biology and especially xenobiology, as emerging new fields of science, have reached an intellectual and experimental maturity that makes them suitable for integration into the university curricula of chemical and biological disciplines. Novel scientific fields that include laboratory work are perfect playgrounds for developing highly motivating research&#8208;based teaching modules. We believe that research&#8208;based learning enriched by digital tools is the best approach for teaching new emerging essentials of academic education. This is especially true when the scientific field as such is still not canonized with text books and best&#8208;practice examples. Our experience shows that iGEM/BIOMOD competitions represent an excellent basis for designing research&#8208;based courses in xenobiology. Therefore, we present a report on &#8220;iGEM&#8211;Synthetic Biology&#8221; offered at the Technische Universit&#228;t Berlin as an example.

      <title>Engineering the Next Generation of Matched Models for Chemical Translational Biology</title>
      <dc:description>
Matched models: The translation of drug compounds from high&#8208;throughput models to high&#8208;order, low&#8208;throughput biological models is a major obstacle facing chemical biology. I present here a case for considering the next generation of matched biological models to address this bottleneck.







Abstract
In order to achieve patient personalization and translate compounds through the discovery phase into the clinic, high throughput test models should be designed to be as closely matched to the patient as possible. Engineering high throughput and physiologically relevant biological models is the idealized scenario for testing next generation modulators. I present here a cautionary example of a misaligned model as well as my viewpoint on how overcoming this bottleneck is one of the next frontiers in chemical biology.

      <title>Metabolic Glycoengineering with Azide&#8208; and Alkene&#8208;Modified Hexosamines: Quantification of Sialic Acid Levels</title>
      <dc:description>Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) is an established method to incorporate chemical reporter groups into cellular glycans for subsequent bioorthogonal labeling. The method has found broad application for the visualization and isolation of glycans allowing to probe their biological roles. Furthermore, targeting of drugs to cancer cells, that present high concentrations of sialic acids on their surface, is an attractive approach. We report the application of a labeling reaction using 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,5&#8208;methylenedioxybenzene for the quantification of sialic acid derivates after MGE with various azide&#8208; and alkene&#8208;modified ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc derivatives. We followed the time course of sialic acid production and were able to detect sialic acids modified with the chemical reporter group not only after addition of ManNAc derivatives to the cell culture. A cyclopropane&#8208;modified ManNAc derivative, being a model for the corresponding cyclopropene analog that undergoes fast inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines, resulted in the highest incorporation efficiency. Furthermore, we investigated whether feeding of the cells with natural and unnatural ManNAc derivative results in increased levels of sialic acids and found that this is strongly dependent on the investigated cell type and cell fraction. For HEK 293T cells, a strong increase of free sialic acids in the cell interior was found whereas cell&#8208;surface sialic acid levels are only moderately increased.</dc:description>

      <title>Superior Proton Transfer Catalytic Promiscuity of Cytochrome C in Self&#8208;organized Media</title>
      <dc:description>Evolutionarily elderly proteins commonly feature greater catalytic promiscuity. Cytochrome c (cyt c) is one among first set of proteins in evolution with known prospects in electron transport and peroxidative property. Here we report that cyt c is a proficient proton transfer catalyst too and enhances the Kemp elimination (KE) (model reaction to show proton transfer catalytic property) by ~750 fold on self&#8208;organized systems like&#8208; micelles and vesicles. The self&#8208;organized systems mimic the mitochondrial environment in&#8208;vitro for cyt c. Using an array of biophysical and biochemical mutational assays, mechanistic pathways involving both acid/base and redox have been explored. The histidine (His&#8208;18) moiety close to hemin group is mainly responsible for proton abstraction to promote the concerted E2 pathway for KE catalysis when cyt c is in oxidized form which has also been confirmed by a H18A mutant version of cyt c. However, redox pathway is more predominant under reducing condition in presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH range 6 to 7.4. Interestingly, we have found an almost 750&#8208;fold enhanced KE catalysis by cyt c compared to aqueous buffer. Overall, the presented data apart from providing mechanistic insights, it reveals an unprecedented catalytic property of cyt c which can be of high importance in evolutionary perspective considering its role in delineating phylogenic tree and also towards generating programmable designer biocatalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Biocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple and selective: A standing challenge in modern drug development is to simplify synthetic routes to complex molecules. Capitalizing on their exquisite selectivity, biocatalysts provide a complementary solution to traditional chemical synthesis. This viewpoint highlights the strategic application of biocatalyst to enable efficient access to complex drug molecules.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is a continuously expanding subfield in chemical biology. Herein, I describe two categories of biocatalysts, the LEGO&#8208;brick&#8208;like and game&#8208;console&#8208;like type, both of which can streamline the synthetic routes to therapeutics. A multi&#8208;disciplinary approach to expand the biocatalytic toolkit will open up opportunities to develop new therapeutics.

      <title>Electrochemical Quantification of Neurotransmitters in Single Live Cell Vesicles Shows Exocytosis is Predominantly Partial</title>
      <dc:description>
Partial release mechanism of exocytosis: This minireview highlights the recent progress in amperometric measurement for monitoring exocytosis from single cells, and electrochemical cytometry measurement of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Evidence from several studies supports the hypothesis that partial release is the primary mechanism during regular exocytosis.







Abstract
Exocytosis plays an essential role in the communication between cells in the nervous system. Understanding the regulation of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis and the amount of neurotransmitter content that is stored in vesicles is of importance, as it provides fundamental insights to understand how the brain works and how neurons elicit a certain behavior. In this minireview, we summarize recent progress in amperometric measurements for monitoring exocytosis in single cells and electrochemical cytometry measurements of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Important steps have increased our understanding of the different mechanisms of exocytosis. Increasing evidence is firmly establishing that partial release is the primary mechanism of release in multiple cell types.

      <title>Efficient Editing of Silver Nanoclusters by Changing Simply One Cytosine in DNA Template</title>
      <dc:description>DNA with genetic information was edited to regulate and repair the structure and function of the protein. In DNA nanotechnology, DNA with programmable information can be designed to edit fluorescence intensity and emissive colors of DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCS). By introducing and moving one cytosine in spacer of emitter domain, we have built up a simple strategy to regulate excitation and emission wavelength of AgNCs. With replacement of thymine in the spacer of emitter with one cytosine, the expected excitation and emission change don&#8217;t occur. However, after moving the introduced cytosine, DNA templates produce AgNCs with extremely different excitation and emission wavelength compared to the initial template, obtaining one template for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive species with the highest fluorescence intensity. The formation of AgNCs induces DNA template into condensed secondary structure based on altered migration rate on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The simple strategy by moving one cytosine in spacer in emitter domain can enrich the library of templates for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs and have a great potential in bioimaging and probe design.</dc:description>

      <title>Time to Get Turned on by Chemical Biology</title>
      <dc:description>
Turn it on: Efficacy of traditional small molecules/inhibitors relies on achieving optimal target/ligand occupancy. New concepts, such as gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, are beginning to break these shackles. Discussed herein is the current knowledge about small molecule&#8208;induced gain&#8208;of&#8208;function and how emerging data and paradigms could prove useful in harnessing this powerful concept.







Abstract
The pressing need for innovation in drug discovery is spurring the emergence of drugs that turn on protein function, as opposed to shutting activity down. Several pharmacophores usher protein target gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, for instance: PROTACs promote protein target degradation; other drug candidates have been reported to function through dominant&#8208;negative inhibition of their target enzyme. Such classes of molecules are typically active at low target occupancy and display numerous advantages relative to canonical inhibitors, whose function is intrinsically tied to achieving, or exceeding a threshold occupancy. However, our ability to generally tap into gain&#8208;of&#8208;function processes through small molecule interventions is overall in its infancy. Herein, I outline how chemical biology is poised to help us bring this powerful idea to fruition. I further outline means through which gain&#8208;of&#8208;function events can be identified and harnessed.

      <title>A luminescence based coupled enzyme assay enables high throughput quantification of the bacterial second messenger 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;AMP</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclic dinucleotide signaling systems are found ubiquitously throughout nature allowing organisms to rapidly and dynamically sense and respond to alterations in their environments. In recent years, the secondary messenger, cyclic di&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP), has been identified as an essential signaling molecule in a diverse array of bacterial genera. We and others have shown that defects in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP homeostasis result in severe physiological defects and virulence attenuation in many bacterial species. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP levels. To address this limitation, we describe here the development of a luciferase&#8208;based coupled enzyme assay that leverages the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, for the sensitive and high throughput quantification of 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for the quantification of the cyclic oligonucleotide&#8208;based anti&#8208;phage signaling system (CBASS) effector, 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP. These findings establish CDA&#8208;Luc as a more affordable and sensitive alternative to conventional c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP detection tools with broad utility for the study of bacterial cyclic dinucleotide physiology.</dc:description>

To address this limitation, we describe here the development of a luciferase&#8208;based coupled enzyme assay that leverages the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, for the sensitive and high throughput quantification of 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for the quantification of the cyclic oligonucleotide&#8208;based anti&#8208;phage signaling system (CBASS) effector, 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP. These findings establish CDA&#8208;Luc as a more affordable and sensitive alternative to conventional c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP detection tools with broad utility for the study of bacterial cyclic dinucleotide physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Optical Biosensors for Virus Detection: Prospects for COVID&#8208;19</title>
      <dc:description>The recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) caused massive worldwide disruptions due to the lack of available testing locations and equipment. The use of optical techniques for viral detection has flourished in the past 15 years, providing more reliable, inexpensive, and accurate detection methods. In the current minireview, optical phenomena including fluorescence, surface plasmons, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and colorimetry are discussed in the context of detecting virus pathogens. The sensitivity of a viral detection method can be dramatically improved by utilizing materials that exhibit surface plasmons or SERS, but often it requires advanced instrumentation for detection. Although fluorescence and colorimetry lack high sensitivities, they show promise as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics because of their relatively less complicated instrumentation, ease of use, lower costs, and they do not require nucleic acid amplification. Advantages and disadvantages of each optical detection method are presented, and prospects for applying optical biosensors in COVID&#8208;19 detection are discussed.</dc:description>

The bioactivity of these compounds may be seen to be attenuated.

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
