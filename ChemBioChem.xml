         <title>U1 SNRNP BIOGENESIS DEFFECTS IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) plays a pivotal role in the intricate process of gene expression, specifically within nuclear RNA processing. By initiating the splicing reaction and modulating 3&#8217;&#8208;end processing, U1 snRNP exerts precise control over RNA metabolism and gene expression. This ribonucleoparticle is abundantly present, and its complex biogenesis necessitates shuttling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Over the past three decades, extensive research has illuminated the crucial connection between disrupted U snRNP biogenesis and several prominent human diseases, notably various neurodegenerative conditions. The perturbation of U1 snRNP homeostasis has been firmly established in diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and FUS&#8208;mediated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Intriguingly, compelling evidence suggests a potential correlation in Fronto&#8208;temporal dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease as well. Although the U snRNP biogenesis pathway is conserved across all eukaryotic cells, neurons, in particular, appear to be highly susceptible to alterations in spliceosome homeostasis. In contrast, other cell types exhibit a greater resilience to such disturbances. This vulnerability underscores the intricate relationship between U1 snRNP dynamics and the health of neuronal cells, shedding light on potential avenues for understanding and addressing neurodegenerative disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterial hydrazine biosynthetic pathways featuring cupin/methionyl tRNA synthetase&#8208;like enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;Nitrogen (N&#8211;N) bond&#8208;containing functional groups in natural products and synthetic drugs play significant roles in exerting biological activities. The mechanisms of N&#8211;N bond formation in natural organic molecules have garnered increasing attention over the decades. Recent advances have illuminated various enzymatic and nonenzymatic strategies, and our understanding of natural N&#8211;N bond construction is rapidly expanding. A group of didomain proteins with zinc&#8208;binding cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like domains, also known as hydrazine synthetases, generates amino acid&#8208;based hydrazines, which serve as key biosynthetic precursors of diverse N&#8211;N bond&#8208;containing functionalities such as hydrazone, diazo, triazene, pyrazole, and pyridazinone groups. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on hydrazine synthetase mechanisms and the various pathways employing this unique bond&#8208;forming machinery.</dc:description>

         <title>Measuring Ligand&#8208;bound Protein Complexes with Proximity Labeling: A Practical Guide.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying the drug&#8208;target interactome of small molecule therapeutics is essential for understanding the full pharmacological effects of a compound. These therapies often induce changes within the cellular proteome, leading to unexpected consequences such as changes in the targets complexation state or off&#8208;target interactions between the compound and additional proteins. Currently, unbiased target&#8208;ID approaches are being used to embark on this task. Here we provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of these methods, and a practical step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol for using the BioTAC system to assist with drug target and interactome ID.</dc:description>

         <title>High cell density cultivation combined with high specific enzyme activity: Cultivation protocol for the production of an amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium in E. coli.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High cell density cultivation is an established method for the production of various industrially important products such as recombinant proteins. However, these protocols are often not suitable for biocatalytic processes as often the focus lies on biomass production rather than high specific activities of the enzyme. In contrast, a range of shake flask protocols are well known with high specific activities but rather low cell densities. To overcome this gap, we established a tailor&#8208;made fed&#8208;batch protocol combining both aspects: high cell density and high specific activities of heterologously produced enzyme. Using the example of an industrially relevant amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium, we describe a strategy to optimize the cultivation yield based on the feed rate, IPTG concentration and post&#8208;induction temperature. By adjusting these key parameters, we were able to increase the specific activity by 2.6&#8208;fold and the wet cell weight by even 17&#8208;fold compared to shake flasks. Finally, we were able to verify our established protocol by transferring it to another operator. With that, our optimization strategy can serve as a template for the production of high titers of active heterologously produced enzymes and might enable the availability of these catalysts for upscaling of biocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>OptoProfilin: A Single Component Biosensor of Applied Cellular Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to ageing, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and viral infection. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin (&#8216;OptoProfilin&#8217;) can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of preexisting work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress&#8208;induced changes in the cytoskeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Biophysical Investigation of RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triple helix and RNA:DNA heteroduplex formation by the lncRNAs MEG3 and Fendrr</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long non&#8208;coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and can associate with DNA as RNA:DNA heteroduplexes or RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triple helix structures. Here, we review in vitro biochemical and biophysical experiments including electromobility shift assays (EMSA), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, thermal melting analysis, microscale thermophoresis (MST), single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triple helix and RNA:DNA heteroduplex formation. We present the investigations of the antiparallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA MEG3 targeting the gene TGFB2 and the parallel triplex&#8208;forming lncRNA Fendrr with its target gene Emp2. The thermodynamic properties of these oligonucleotides lead to concentration&#8208;dependent heterogeneous mixtures, where a DNA duplex, an RNA:DNA heteroduplex and an RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triplex coexist and their relative populations are modulated in a temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The in vitro data provide a reliable readout of triplex structures, as RNA&#8226;DNA:DNA triplexes show distinct features compared to DNA duplexes and RNA:DNA heteroduplexes. Our experimental results can be used to validate computationally predicted triple helix formation between novel disease&#8208;relevant lncRNAs and their DNA target genes.</dc:description>

A new generation of DNA computers is evolving to solve biological and medical problems. DNA logic gates are used to create integrated circuits with biocompatibility and programmability. This minireview highlights the efforts in the development of DNA circuits by integration of DNA logic gates into long chains localized on DNA substrates. This approach of all&#8208;DNA integrated circuits (DNA ICs) has the advantage of biocompatibility, increased circuit response due to precise gate localization, increased circuit density, reduced unit concentration, and facilitated cell uptake.







Abstract
Due to nucleic acid's programmability, it is possible to realize DNA structures with computing functions, and thus a new generation of molecular computers is evolving to solve biological and medical problems. Pioneered by Milan Stojanovic, Boolean DNA logic gates created the foundation for the development of DNA computers. Similar to electronic computers, the field is evolving towards integrating DNA logic gates and circuits by positioning them on substrates to increase circuit density and minimize gate distance and undesired crosstalk. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the integration of DNA logic gates into circuits localized on DNA substrates. This approach of all&#8208;DNA integrated circuits (DNA ICs) offers the advantages of biocompatibility, increased circuit response, increased circuit density, reduced unit concentration, facilitated circuit isolation, and facilitated cell uptake. DNA ICs can face similar challenges as their equivalent circuits operating in bulk solution (bulk circuits), and new physical challenges inherent in spatial localization. We discuss possible avenues to overcome these obstacles.

         <title>Aldehyde Reductase Activity of Carboxylic Acid Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids is a challenge that the enzyme carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) is mastering. The R&#8208;domains of CARs, however, can additionally catalyze carbonyl reduction. This activity is a minor side reaction for many substrate/enzyme pairs but may be significant for others.







Abstract
Carboxylic acid reductase enzymes (CARs) are well known for the reduction of a wide range of carboxylic acids to the respective aldehydes. One of the essential CAR domains &#8208; the reductase domain (R&#8208;domain) &#8208; was recently shown to catalyze the standalone reduction of carbonyls, including aldehydes, which are typically considered to be the final product of carboxylic acid reduction by CAR. We discovered that the respective full&#8208;length CARs were equally able to reduce aldehydes. Herein we aimed to shed light on the impact of this activity on aldehyde production and acid reduction in general. Our data explains previously inexplicable results and a new CAR from Mycolicibacterium wolinskyi is presented.

         <title>Identification of a 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazole scaffold that potentiates gram&#8208;positive selective antibiotics against gram&#8208;negative bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel therapeutic approaches is crucial in the fight against multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, particularly gram&#8208;negative species. Small molecule adjuvants that enhance the activity of otherwise gram&#8208;positive selective antibiotics against gram&#8208;negative bacteria have the potential to expand current treatment options. We have previously reported adjuvants based upon a 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (2&#8208;AI) scaffold that potentiate macrolide antibiotics against several gram&#8208;negative pathogens. Herein, we report the discovery and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) investigation of an additional class of macrolide adjuvants based upon a 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazole (2&#8208;ABI) scaffold. The lead compound lowers the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clarithromycin (CLR) from 512 to 2 &#181;g/mL at 30 &#181;M against Klebsiella pneumoniae 2146, and from 32 to 2 &#181;g/mL at 5 &#181;M, against Acinetobacter baumannii 5075. Preliminary investigation into the mechanism of action suggests that the compounds are binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in K. pneumoniae, and modulating lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis, assembly, or transport in A. baumannii.</dc:description>

         <title>Biophysical and Biochemical Characterization of Structurally Diverse Small Molecule Hits for KRAS Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biophysical and biochemical characterization of six compounds is presented. The target biding and inhibitory profiles described here suggest that these compounds can serves as useful starting points for the development of allosteric, non&#8208;covalent inhibitors of KRAS for cancer therapy.







Abstract
We describe six compounds as early hits for the development of direct inhibitors of KRAS, an important anticancer drug target. We show that these compounds bind to KRAS with affinities in the low micromolar range and exert different effects on its interactions with binding partners. Some of the compounds exhibit selective binding to the activated form of KRAS and inhibit signal transduction through both the MAPK or the phosphatidylinositide 3&#8208;kinase PI3K&#8208;protein kinase B (AKT) pathway in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Most inhibit intrinsic and/or SOS&#8208;mediated KRAS activation while others inhibit RAS&#8208;effector interaction. We propose these compounds as starting points for the development of non&#8208;covalent allosteric KRAS inhibitors.

         <title>Functional and Mechanistic Characterization of the 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;Isoishwarane Synthase from the Liverwort Radula lindenbergiana</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microbial type and multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase RlMTPSL4 from the liverwort Radula lindenbergiana produces the new sesquiterpene hydrocarbon 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane as the main product, besides the known compounds germacrene A, &#945;&#8208;selinene, eremophilene and 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;aristolochene. The enzyme mechanism for the formation of the main product and its absolute configuration were determined through isotopic labeling experiments.







Abstract
The microbial type sesquiterpene synthase RlMTPSL4 from the liverwort Radula lindenbergiana was investigated for its products, showing the formation of several sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The main product was structurally characterized as the new compound 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane, while the side products included the known hydrocarbons germacrene A, &#945;&#8208;selinene, eremophilene and 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;aristolochene. The cyclization mechanism towards 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane catalyzed by RlMTPSL4 was investigated through isotopic labeling experiments, revealing the stereochemical course for the deprotonation step to the neutral intermediate germacrene A, a reprotonation for its further cyclization, and a 1,2&#8208;hydride shift along the cascade. The absolute configuration of 4,5&#8208;diepi&#8208;isoishwarane was determined using a stereoselective deuteration approach, revealing an absolute configuration typically observed for a microbial type sesquiterpene.

         <title>Oxygen Activation in Aromatic Ring Cleaving Salicylate Dioxygenase: Detection of Reaction Intermediates with a Nitro&#8208;substituted Substrate Analog</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylate dioxygenase performs aromatic C&#8722;C bond scission of its substrates, salicylate and gentisate, with the aid of iron cofactor tethered to a 3&#8208;His binding motif. By utilizing a nitro substituted substrate analog, which attenuates the enzymatic kcat by 500&#8208;fold, detection and kinetics characterization two reaction intermediates was performed with stopped&#8208;flow optical absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cupin dioxygenases such as salicylate 1,2&#8208;dioxygense (SDO) perform aromatic C&#8722;C bond scission via a 3&#8208;His motif tethered iron cofactor. Here, transient kinetics measurements are used to monitor the catalytic cycle of SDO by using a nitro&#8208;substituted substrate analog, 3&#8208;nitrogentisate. Compared to the natural substrate, the nitro group reduces the enzymatic kcat by 500&#8208;fold, thereby facilitating the detection and kinetic characterization of reaction intermediates. Sums and products of reciprocal relaxation times derived from kinetic measurements were found to be linearly dependent on O2 concentration, suggesting reversible formation of two distinct intermediates. Dioxygen binding to the metal cofactor takes place with a forward rate of 5.9&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1: two orders of magnitude slower than other comparable ring&#8208;cleaving dioxygenses. Optical chromophore of the first intermediate is distinct from the in&#8197;situ generated SDO Fe(III)&#8722;O2&#8901;&#8722; complex but closer to the enzyme&#8208;substrate precursor.

Here, transient kinetics measurements are used to monitor the catalytic cycle of SDO by using a nitro-substituted substrate analog, 3-nitrogentisate. Compared to the natural substrate, the nitro group reduces the enzymatic &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; by 500-fold, thereby facilitating the detection and kinetic characterization of reaction intermediates. Sums and products of reciprocal relaxation times derived from kinetic measurements were found to be linearly dependent on O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, suggesting reversible formation of two distinct intermediates. Dioxygen binding to the metal cofactor takes place with a forward rate of 5.9&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;: two orders of magnitude slower than other comparable ring-cleaving dioxygenses. Optical chromophore of the first intermediate is distinct from the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; generated SDO Fe(III)&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complex but closer to the enzyme-substrate precursor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of the Reversible Monoacylglycerol Lipase PET Tracer (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132: Application in Drug Development and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

(R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 is a specific and selective PET tracer for MAGL brain imaging. It has the potential to accelerate MAGL drug discovery and may be used to stage neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) plays a crucial role in the degradation of 2&#8208;arachidonoylglycerol (2&#8208;AG), one of the major endocannabinoids in the brain. Inhibiting MAGL could lead to increased levels of 2&#8208;AG, which showed beneficial effects on pain management, anxiety, inflammation, and neuroprotection. In the current study, we report the characterization of an enantiomerically pure (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 as a novel MAGL PET tracer. It demonstrates an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to its racemate. High in&#8197;vitro MAGL specificity of (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 was confirmed by autoradiography studies using mouse and rat brain sections. In vivo, (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 displayed a high brain penetration, and high specificity and selectivity toward MAGL by dynamic PET imaging using MAGL knockout and wild&#8208;type mice. Pretreatment with a MAGL drug candidate revealed a dose&#8208;dependent reduction of (R)&#8208;[11C]YH132 accumulation in WT mouse brains. This result validates its utility as a PET probe to assist drug development. Moreover, its potential application in neurodegenerative diseases was explored by in&#8197;vitro autoradiography using brain sections from animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Conversion of &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucans to gentiobiose using an endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase PsGly30A from Paenibacillus sp. GKG</title>

         <dc:description>A plethora of di&#8208; and oligosaccharides isolated from the natural sources are used in food and pharmaceutical industry. An enzymatic hydrolysis of fungal cell wall &#946;&#8208;glucans is a good alternative to produce the desired oligosaccharides with different functionalities, such as the flavour enhancer gentiobiose. We have previously identified PsGly30A as a potential yeast cell wall degrading &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glycosidase. The aim of this study is to characterise the PsGly30A enzyme, a member of the GH30 family, and to evaluate its suitability for the production of gentiobiose from &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucans. An endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase PsGly30A encoding gene from Paenibacillus sp. GKG has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme has been active towards pustulan and yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan, but not on laminarin from the Laminaria digitata, confirming the endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucanase mode of action. The PsGly30A shows the highest activity at pH 5.5 and 50&#176;C. The specific activity of PsGly30A on pustulan (1262&#177;82 U/mg) is among the highest reported for GH30 &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glycosidases. Moreover, gentiobiose is the major reaction product when pustulan, yeast &#946;&#8208;glucan or yeast cell walls has been used as a substrate. Therefore, PsGly30A is a promising catalyst for valorisation of the yeast&#8208;related by&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Influence of Hemipiperazine Photochromism on the Early Development of Zebrafish Embryo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the potential of controlling organismal development with light by using reversible photomodulation of activity in bioactive compounds. Specifically, our research focuses on plinabulin 1, an inhibitor of tubulin dynamics that contains a photochromic motif called hemipiperazine. The two isomeric forms, Z&#8208;1 and E&#8208;1, can partially interconvert with light, yet show remarkable thermal stability in darkness. The Z&#8208;isomer exhibits higher cytotoxicity due to stronger binding to &#945;&#8208;tubulin's colchicine site. The less toxic E&#8208;1 form, considered a "pro&#8208;drug", can be isolated in vitro and stored. Upon activation by blue or cyan light, it predominantly generates the more toxic Z&#8208;1 form. Here we demonstrate that 1 can effectively photomodulate epiboly, a critical microtubule&#8208;dependent cell movement during gastrulation in zebrafish embryos. This research highlights the potential of photomodulation for precise and reversible control of cellular activities and organismal development.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Macrodomain Binding of Gln&#8208;carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a dynamic post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) with important roles in cell signalling. This modification occurs on a wide variety of amino acids, and one of the canonical modification sites within proteins is the side chain of glutamic acid. Given the transient nature of this modification (acylal linkage) and the high sensitivity of ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamic acid, stabilized isosteres are required for structural and biochemical studies. Here, we report the synthesis of a mimic of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide derived from histone H2B that contains carba&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated glutamine as a potential mimic for Glu&#8208;ADPr. We synthesized a cyclopentitol&#8208;ribofuranosyl derivative of 5'&#8208;phosphoribosylated Fmoc&#8208;glutamine and used this in the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of the carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide mimicking the ADP&#8208;ribosylated N&#8208;terminal tail of histone H2B. Binding studies with isothermal calorimetry demonstrate that the macrodomains of human MacroD2 and TARG1 bind to carba&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide in the same way as ADPr&#8208;peptides containing the native ADP&#8208;riboside moiety connected to the side chain of glutamine in the same peptide sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;gene Reporter&#8208;amplifier Architecture for Enhancing the Sensitivity of Molecular MRI by Water Exchange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of genetic reporters for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for investigating biological functions in vivo. However, current MRI reporters have low sensitivity, making it challenging to create significant contrast against the tissue background, especially when only a small fraction of cells express the reporter. To overcome this limitation, we developed an approach for amplifying the sensitivity of molecular MRI by combining a chemogenetic contrast mechanism with a biophysical approach to increase water diffusion through the co&#8208;expression of a dual&#8208;gene construct comprising an organic anion transporting polypeptide, Oatp1b3, and a water channel, Aqp1. We first show that the expression of Aqp1 amplifies MRI contrast in cultured cells engineered to express Oatp1b3. We demonstrate that the contrast amplification is caused by Aqp1&#8208;driven increase in water exchange, which provides the gadolinium ions internalized by Oatp1b3&#8208;expressing cells with access to a larger water pool compared with exchange&#8208;limited conditions. We further show that our methodology allows cells to be detected using approximately 10&#8208;fold lower concentrations of gadolinium than that in the Aqp1&#8208;free scenario. Finally, we show that our approach enables the imaging of mixed&#8208;cell cultures containing a low fraction of Oatp1b3labeled cells that are undetectable on the basis of Oatp1b3 expression alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Methylation of Phenyl Rings in Ester&#8208;Stabilized Phosphorus Ylides Vastly Enhances Their Protonophoric Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ester&#8208;stabilized triphenylphosphonium ylide precursor can carry protons across artificial and natural membranes. Methylation of aryl groups together with alkyl length shortening of this protonophore preserving its lipophilicity resulted in a 20&#8208;fold increase in the flip&#8208;flop rate constant of its cationic form. Accordingly, increased proton transport across lipid membranes and enhanced uncoupling of mitochondria were observed.







Abstract
We have recently discovered that ester&#8208;stabilized phosphorus ylides, resulting from deprotonation of a phosphonium salt such as [Ph3PCH2COOR], can transfer protons across artificial and biological membranes. To create more effective cationic protonophores, we synthesized similar phosphonium salts with one ((heptyloxycarbonylmethyl)(p&#8208;tolyl)bromide) or two ((butyloxycarbonylmethyl)(3,5&#8208;xylyl)osphonium bromide) methyl substituents in the phenyl groups. The methylation enormously augmented both protonophoric activity of the ylides on planar bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) and uncoupling of mammalian mitochondria, which correlated with strongly accelerated flip&#8208;flop of their cationic precursors across the BLM.

         <title>Bifunctional Sildenafil Diazeniumdiolates Acting as Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors and Nitric Oxide Donors &#822; Towards Wound Healing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inefficient wound healing poses a global health challenge with a lack of efficient treatments. Wound healing issues often correlate with low endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels. While exogenous delivery with NO&#8208;releasing compounds represents a promising therapeutic strategy, controlling the release of the highly reactive NO remains challenging. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, like sildenafil, have also been shown to promote wound healing. This study explores hybrid compounds, combining NO&#8208;releasing diazeniumdiolates with a sildenafil&#8208;derived PDE5 inhibitor. One compound demonstrated a favorable NO&#8208;release profile, triggered by an esterase (prodrug), and displayed in vitro nanomolar inhibition potency against PDE5 and thrombin&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. Both factors are known to promote blood flow and oxygenation. Thus, our findings unveil promising prospects for effective wound healing treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>The Guidelines for the Design and Synthesis of Transition Metal Atom Doped Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept elucidates the formation mechanism of transition metal atoms&#8208;doped carbon dots (TMAs&#8208;doped CDs) and offers design principles for TMAs&#8208;doped CDs, including ligand selection and specific TMAs choices. It also describes the challenges encountered by TMA&#8208;doped CDs and offers insights into their future prospects.







Abstract
Atoms doping is a practical approach to modulate the physicochemical properties of carbon dots (CDs) and thus has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Compared to non&#8208;metal atoms, transition metal atoms (TMAs) possess more unoccupied orbitals and larger atomic radii. TMAs doping can significantly alter the electronic structure of CDs and bestow them with new intrinsic characteristics. TMAs&#8208;doped CDs have exhibited widespread application potential as a new class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;based nanomaterials. However, challenges remain for the successful preparation and precise design of TMAs&#8208;doped CDs. The key to successfully preparing TMA&#8208;doped CDs lies in anchoring TMAs to the carbon precursors before the reaction. Herein, taking the formation mechanism of TMAs&#8208;doped CDs as a starting point, we systematically summarized the ligands employed for synthesizing TMAs&#8208;doped CDs and proposed the synthetic strategy involving multiple ligands. Additionally, we summarize the functional properties imparted to CDs by different TMA dopants to guide the design of TMA&#8208;doped CDs with different functional characteristics. Finally, we describe the bottlenecks TMAs&#8208;doped CDs face and provide an outlook on their future development.

         <title>A Mutagen Acts as a Potent Reducing Agent of Glycated Hemoglobin: a Combined Ultrafast Electron Transfer and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin (GHb): Ethidium bromide (EtBr) in its excited state behaves as a potential reducing agent for hemoglobin (Hb). EtBr transfers its excited state electron to the iron (Fe(III)) residing inside the heme&#8208;group of Hb and reduces it to its lower ionic state. Due to structural modification and electrostatic interaction between GHb and EtBr, this ultrafast reduction increases.







Abstract
Glycated hemoglobin (GHb) found in mammals undergoes irreversible damage when exposed to external redox agents, which is much more vulnerable than its normal counterpart hemoglobin (Hb). Besides the oxygen regulation throughout the body, Hb plays a vital role in balancing immunological health and the redox cycle. Photoinduced ultra&#8208;fast electron transfer phenomena actively participate in regulation of various kind of homeostasis involved in such biomacromolecules. In the present study we have shown that a well&#8208;known mutagen Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) reduces GHb in femtosecond time scale (efficiently) upon photoexcitation after efficient recognition in the biomolecule. We have performed similar experiment by colocalizing EtBr and Iron (Fe(III)) on the micellar surface as Hb mimic in order to study the excited state EtBr dynamics to rationalize the time scale obtained from EtBr in GHb and Hb. While other experimental techniques including Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta potential, absorbance and emission spectroscopy have been employed for the confirmation of structural perturbation of GHb compared to Hb, a detailed computational studies involving molecular docking and density functional theory (DFT) have been employed for the explanation of the experimental observations.

         <title>Unveiling PET Hydrolase Surface Dynamics through Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article uses Total Internal Reflection Microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching to uncover the behavior of PET hydrolase enzymes at a PET surface, and will aid in future design of these enzymes. For the first time, association and dissociation rates have been measured, and a dynamic model dominated by adsorption and desorption, rather than lateral diffusion, has been demonstrated.







Abstract
PET hydrolases are an emerging class of enzymes that are being heavily researched for their use in bioprocessing polyethylene terephthalate (PET). While work has been done in studying the binding of PET oligomers to the active site of these enzymes, the dynamics of PET hydrolases binding to a bulk PET surface is an unexplored area. Here, methods were developed for total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy to study the adsorption and desorption dynamics of these proteins onto a PET surface. TIRF microscopy was employed to measure both on and off rates of two of the most commonly studied PET hydrolases, PHL7 and LCC, on a PET surface. It was found that these proteins have a much slower off rates on the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;s&#8722;1, comparable to non&#8208;productive binding in enzymes such as cellulose. In combination with FRAP microscopy, a dynamic model is proposed in which adsorption and desorption dominates over lateral diffusion over the surface. The results of this study could have implications for the future engineering of PET hydrolases, either to target them to a PET surface or to modulate interaction with their substrate.

Adrenodoxin reductase (AdxR) is a crucial protein for mitochondrial electron transfer. Kinetic studies on human AdxR reveal efficient utilization of NADPH. Low NADPH concentrations hinder flavin reduction, but MgCl2 alleviates this and simplifies kinetics. In yeast, in vitro experiments demonstrate a NADPH&#8208;AdxR&#8208;Yah1p&#8208;Coq6p electron transfer chain, elucidating the roles of Yah1p and AdxR homolog, Arh1p, in coenzyme Q biosynthesis.







Abstract
Adrenodoxin reductase (AdxR) plays a pivotal role in electron transfer, shuttling electrons between NADPH and iron/sulfur adrenodoxin proteins in mitochondria. This electron transport system is essential for P450 enzymes involved in various endogenous biomolecules biosynthesis. Here, we present an in&#8208;depth examination of the kinetics governing the reduction of human AdxR by NADH or NADPH. Our results highlight the efficiency of human AdxR when utilizing NADPH as a flavin reducing agent. Nevertheless, akin to related flavoenzymes such as cytochrome P450 reductase, we observe that low NADPH concentrations hinder flavin reduction due to intricate equilibrium reactions between the enzyme and its substrate/product. Remarkably, the presence of MgCl2 suppresses this complex kinetic behavior by decreasing NADPH binding to oxidized AdxR, effectively transforming AdxR into a classical Michaelis&#8208;Menten enzyme. We propose that the addition of MgCl2 may be adapted for studying the reductive half&#8208;reactions of other flavoenzymes with NADPH. Furthermore, in&#8197;vitro experiments provide evidence that the reduction of the yeast flavin monooxygenase Coq6p relies on an electron transfer chain comprising NADPH&#8208;AdxR&#8208;Yah1p&#8208;Coq6p, where Yah1p shuttles electrons between AdxR and Coq6p. This discovery explains the previous in&#8197;vivo observation that Yah1p and the AdxR homolog, Arh1p, are required for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q in yeast.

         <title>Influence of Seed structure on Volume distribution of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Oligomer at Early Stages of Aggregation using nanopipette</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the influence of seeds on the volume of &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers during the early stages of aggregation. Our study revealed a significant impact, demonstrating that seeds induced the formation of larger oligomers compared to the control without seeds. Moreover, our findings indicate that fibrillar aggregates exhibit superior seed competency over fiber aggregates containing 4&#8208;hydroxynonenal (HNE) and oligomers. Notably, this study underscores the effectiveness of nanopore technology for elucidating the diverse species present during the initial phases of aggregation.







Abstract
Understanding &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation is crucial in the context of Parkinson's disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of aggregation induced by preformed seeding on the volume of oligomers during the early stages, using a label&#8208;free, single&#8208;molecule characterization approach. By utilizing nanopipettes of varying sizes, the volume of the oligomers can be calculated from the amplitude of the current blockade and pipette geometry. Further investigation of the aggregates formed over time in the presence of added seeds revealed an acceleration in the formation of large aggregates and the existence of multiple distinct populations of oligomers. Additionally, we observed that spontaneously formed seeds inhibited the formation of smaller oligomers, in contrast to the effect of HNE seeds. These results suggest that the seeds play a crucial role in the formation of oligomers and their sizes during the early stages of aggregation, whereas the classical thioflavin T assay remains negative.

         <title>Heterochiral modifications enhance robustness and function of DNA in living human cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mirror&#8208;image, &#671;&#8208;DNA nucleotides are used to produce heterochiral oligonucleotides that resist degradation in cells. These remain intact after 18&#8197;hours in living human cells and can activate a DNA strand displacement reporter.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide therapeutics are becoming increasingly important as more are approved by the FDA, both for treatment and vaccination. Similarly, dynamic DNA nanotechnology is a promising technique that can be used to sense exogenous input molecules or endogenous biomarkers and integrate the results of multiple sensing reactions in&#8197;situ via a programmed cascade of reactions. The combination of these two technologies could be highly impactful in biomedicine by enabling smart oligonucleotide therapeutics that can autonomously sense and respond to a disease state. A particular challenge, however, is the limited lifetime of standard nucleic acid components in living cells and organisms due to degradation by endogenous nucleases. In this work, we address this challenge by incorporating mirror&#8208;image, &#671;&#8208;DNA nucleotides to produce heterochiral &#8220;gapmers&#8221;. We use dynamic DNA nanotechnology to show that these modifications keep the oligonucleotide intact in living human cells for longer than an unmodified strand. To this end, we used a sequential transfection protocol for delivering multiple nucleic acids into living human cells while providing enhanced confidence that subsequent interactions are actually occurring within the cells. Taken together, this work advances the state of the art of &#671;&#8208;nucleic acid protection of oligonucleotides and DNA circuitry for applications in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Identification of glycosylated nucleosides in small synthetic glyco&#8208;RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl lactose was conjugated to Y5 RNA, and its product was characterized after nuclease digestion via liquid&#8208;chromatography mass&#8208;spectrometry. The conjugation products were also evaluated for their ability to trigger an interferon response in Human Foreskin Fibroblasts.







Abstract
Recently, the post&#8208;transcriptional modification of RNA with N&#8208;glycans was reported, changing the paradigm that RNAs are not commonly N&#8208;glycosylated. Moreover, glycan modifications of RNA are investigated for therapeutic targeting purposes. But the glyco&#8208;RNA field is in its infancy with many challenges to overcome. One question is how to accurately characterize glycosylated RNA constructs. Thus, we generated glycosylated forms of Y5 RNA mimics, a short non&#8208;coding RNA. The simple glycans lactose and sialyllactose were attached to the RNA backbone using azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions. Using nuclease digestion followed by LC&#8722;MS, we confirmed the presence of the glycosylated nucleosides, and characterized the chemical linkage. Next, we probed if glycosylation would affect the cellular response to Y5 RNA. We treated human foreskin fibroblasts in culture with the generated compounds. Key transcripts in the innate immune response were quantified by RT&#8208;qPCR. We found that under our experimental conditions, exposure of cells to the Y5 RNA did not trigger an interferon response, and glycosylation of this RNA did not have an impact. Thus, we have identified a successful approach to chemically characterize synthetic glyco&#8208;RNAs, which will be critical for further studies to elucidate how the presence of complex glycans on RNA affects the cellular response.

         <title>Identification of Ligands for Ion Channels: TRPM2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collision&#8208;induced affinity selection mass spectrometry (CIAS&#8208;MS) can be utilized to directly identify ligands binding to the ion channel TRPM2. CIAS&#8208;MS circumvents the need for high mass detection typically associated with mass spectrometry of large membrane proteins. Instead, it focuses on the detection of small molecules dissociated from the ligand&#8208;protein&#8208;detergent complexes, with all affinity selection steps conducted inside the mass spectrometer.







Abstract
Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a calcium&#8208;permeable, nonselective cation channel with a widespread distribution throughout the body. It is involved in many pathological and physiological processes, making it a potential therapeutic target for various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancers. New analytical techniques are beneficial for gaining a deeper understanding of its involvement in disease pathogenesis and for advancing the drug discovery for TRPM2&#8208;related diseases. In this work, we present the application of collision&#8208;induced affinity selection mass spectrometry (CIAS&#8208;MS) for the direct identification of ligands binding to TRPM2. CIAS&#8208;MS circumvents the need for high mass detection typically associated with mass spectrometry of large membrane proteins. Instead, it focuses on the detection of small molecules dissociated from the ligand&#8208;protein&#8208;detergent complexes. This affinity selection approach consolidates all affinity selection steps within the mass spectrometer, resulting in a streamlined process. We showed the direct identification of a known TRPM2 ligand dissociated from the protein&#8208;ligand complex. We demonstrated that CIAS&#8208;MS can identify binding ligands from complex mixtures of compounds and screened a compound library against TRPM2. We investigated the impact of voltage increments and ligand concentrations on the dissociation behavior of the binding ligand, revealing a dose&#8208;dependent relationship.

We showed the direct identification of a known TRPM2 ligand dissociated from the protein-ligand complex. We demonstrated that CIAS-MS can identify binding ligands from complex mixtures of compounds and screened a compound library against TRPM2. We investigated the impact of voltage increments and ligand concentrations on the dissociation behavior of the binding ligand, revealing a dose-dependent relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A desthiobiotin labelled NAD+ analogue to uncover Poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase 1 protein targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling PARP&#8208;selective protein targets is crucial for a better understanding of ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Here, we report a novel chemically modified NAD+ analog which can be applied in the &#8220;bump&#8208;and&#8208;hole&#8221; strategy for PARP1. The analog bears an ethyl group (&#8220;bump&#8221;) at the nicotinamide moiety that drives selectivity towards a PARP1 mutant. An affinity tag linked to the adenine moiety enables affinity enrichment of PARP1 specific ADP&#8208;ribosylation targets.







Abstract
ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by the enzyme family of polyadenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribose) polymerases (PARPs). This enzymatic process involves the transfer of single or multiple ADP&#8208;ribose molecules onto proteins, utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate. It, thus, plays a pivotal role in regulating various biological processes. Unveiling PARP&#8208;selective protein targets is crucial for a better understanding of their biological functions. Nonetheless, this task proves challenging due to overlapping targets shared among PARP family members. Therefore, we applied the &#8220;bump&#8208;and&#8208;hole&#8221; strategy to modify the nicotinamide binding site of PARP1 by introducing a hydrophobic pocket (&#8220;hole&#8221;). This PARP1&#8208;mutant binds an orthogonal NAD+ (Et&#8208;DTB&#8208;NAD+) containing an ethyl group (&#8220;bump&#8221;) at the nicotinamide moiety. Furthermore, we added a desthiobiotin (DTB) tag directly to the adenosine moiety, enabling affinity enrichment of ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteins. Employing this approach, we successfully identified protein targets modified by PARP1 in cell lysate. This strategy expands the arsenal of chemically modified NAD+ analogs available for studying ADP&#8208;ribosylation, providing a powerful tool to study these critical post&#8208;translational modifications.

         <title>Assessing Lanthanide&#8208;Dependent Methanol Dehydrogenase Activity: The Assay Matters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
No Lu&#8208;ck with lutetium! We compare a widely used artificial dye&#8208;coupled assay to assess the enzyme activity of lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases with a protein&#8208;coupled assay and show why the assay matters. Furthermore, we explain quickly why the metal content of metalloenzymes should be determined before any experiments and how this can help to obtain accurate and reliable data.







Abstract
Artificial dye&#8208;coupled assays have been widely adopted as a rapid and convenient method to assess the activity of methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Lanthanide(Ln)&#8208;dependent XoxF&#8208;MDHs are able to incorporate different lanthanides (Lns) in their active site. Dye&#8208;coupled assays showed that the earlier Lns exhibit a higher enzyme activity than the late Lns. Despite widespread use, there are limitations: oftentimes a pH of 9 and activators are required for the assay. Moreover, Ln&#8208;MDH variants are not obtained by isolation from the cells grown with the respective Ln, but by incubation of an apo&#8208;MDH with the Ln. Herein, we report the cultivation of Ln&#8208;dependent methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV with nine different Lns, the isolation of the respective MDHs and the assessment of the enzyme activity using the dye&#8208;coupled assay. We compare these results with a protein&#8208;coupled assay using its physiological electron acceptor cytochrome cGJ (cyt cGJ). Depending on the assay, two distinct trends are observed among the Ln series. The specific enzyme activity of La&#8208;, Ce&#8208; and Pr&#8208;MDH, as measured by the protein&#8208;coupled assay, exceeds that measured by the dye&#8208;coupled assay. This suggests that early Lns also have a positive effect on the interaction between XoxF&#8208;MDH and its cyt cGJ thereby increasing functional efficiency.

         <title>Se&#8208;Glargine: Chemical Synthesis of a Basal Insulin Analogue Stabilized by an Internal Diselenide Bridge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulin glargine (clinical formulations Lantus&#174; and Toujeo&#174;; Sanofi) is one of the most prescribed basal insulin for diabetes. Here we describe the chemical synthesis of glargine analogue stabilized by substitution of an internal cystine (A6&#8211;A11) by a diselenide bridge. The synthesis provided Se&#8208;glargine in good yield and enhance thermodynamic stability compared to regular glargine.







Abstract
Insulin has long provided a model for studies of protein folding and stability, enabling enhanced treatment of diabetes mellitus via analogue design. We describe the chemical synthesis of a basal insulin analogue stabilized by substitution of an internal cystine (A6&#8211;A11) by a diselenide bridge. The studies focused on insulin glargine (formulated as Lantus&#174; and Toujeo&#174;; Sanofi). Prepared at pH&#8197;4 in the presence of zinc ions, glargine exhibits a shifted isoelectric point due to a basic B chain extension (ArgB31&#8722;ArgB32). Subcutaneous injection leads to pH&#8208;dependent precipitation of a long&#8208;lived depot. Pairwise substitution of CysA6 and CysA11 by selenocysteine was effected by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis; the modified A chain also contained substitution of AsnA21 by Gly, circumventing acid&#8208;catalyzed deamidation. Although chain combination of native glargine yielded negligible product, in accordance with previous synthetic studies, the pairwise selenocysteine substitution partially rescued this reaction: substantial product was obtained through repeated combination, yielding a stabilized insulin analogue. This strategy thus exploited both (a) the unique redox properties of selenocysteine in protein folding and (b) favorable packing of an internal diselenide bridge in the native state, once achieved. Such rational optimization of protein folding and stability may be generalizable to diverse disulfide&#8208;stabilized proteins of therapeutic interest.

         <title>Direct Functionalization of Polysaccharide&#8208;Based Xylan Phenyl Carbonate Nanoparticles with Tumor Cell Specific Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach is presented that allows direct immobilization of tumor&#8208;specific antibodies (Cetuximab, Atezolizumab) to biocompatible polysaccharide&#8208;based nanoparticles. The coupling is efficient, easy to, and does not impair the antibody specific bioactivities (growth inhibition, induction of T&#8208;cell cytotoxicity). It is shown that the antibody&#8208;labeled nanoparticles specifically bind to their target cells, thus enabling targeted drug delivery.







Abstract
An efficient and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use approach is presented for obtaining biocompatible polysaccharide&#8208;based nanoparticles (NP) that can act as tumor&#8208;specific drug delivery agents. Two antibodies are directly immobilized onto reactive xylan phenyl carbonate (XPC) NP; namely Cetuximab (CTX) that binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Atezolizumab (ATZ) that binds to programmed death&#8208;ligand&#8197;1 (PD&#8208;L1). High coupling efficiency (up to 100&#8201;%) are achieved without any pre&#8208;activation and no aggregation occurs during antibody immobilization. By quartz crystal microbalance experiments with dissipation monitoring (QCM&#8208;D), flow cytometry assays, and confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging it is demonstrated that the functionalized XPC&#8208;NP specifically bind to cells carrying the corresponding antigens. Moreover, the NP retain the antibody specific bioactivities (growth inhibition for CTX and induction of T&#8208;cell cytotoxicity for ATZ).

         <title>Amylose Dimerization in Solution Can Be Studied Using a Model System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amylose forms left&#8208;handed double helices in the solid state, but dimerization in solution has never been directly detected. We show that sufficiently long &#945;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucans with an aromatic label at the reducing&#8208;end form dimers in aqueous solution that are observable using NMR spectroscopy. Using these model compounds, we could investigate the thermodynamics of dimerization and quantify the &#8216;per glucose&#8217; interactions between amylose chains in water.







Abstract
Amylose, the linear polymer of &#945;&#8208;1,4&#8208;linked glucopyranose units, is known to crystallize as a parallel double helix, but evidence of this duplex forming in solution has remained elusive for decades. We show how the dimerization of short amylose chains can be detected in solution using NMR spectroscopy when the glucans are labeled at the reducing&#8208;end with an aromatic moiety that overcomes chemical shift degeneracy leading to distinct signals for the single&#8208;stranded and duplex amylose. A set of &#945;&#8208;1,4 glucans with varying lengths of 6, 12, 18, and 22 glucose units and a 4&#8208;aminobenzamide label were synthesized, enabling the first systematic thermodynamic study of the association of amylose in solution. The dimerization is enthalpically driven, entropically unfavorable and beyond a minimum length of 12, each additional pair of glucose residues stabilizes the duplex by 0.85&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This fundamental knowledge provides a basis for a quantitative understanding of starch structure, gelation and enzymatic digestion, and lays the foundations for the strategic use of &#945;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucans in the development of self&#8208;assembled materials.

         <title>Enhancing 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Efficiency by High&#8208;Throughput Mass&#8208;Spectrometric Quantification and In&#8197;Vitro/In&#8197;Vivo Catalytic Performance Correlation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To rationalize how the enzymatic performance in&#8197;vivo is correlated with the enzyme catalytic parameters measured in&#8197;vitro, we have applied a mass&#8208;spectrometry based high&#8208;throughput quantitative method as well as synthetic biology tools to systematically improve the performance of 2&#8208;pyrone synthase for triacetic acid lactone biosynthesis in E. coli.







Abstract
Engineering efficient biocatalysts is essential for metabolic engineering to produce valuable bioproducts from renewable resources. However, due to the complexity of cellular metabolic networks, it is challenging to translate success in&#8197;vitro into high performance in cells. To meet such a challenge, an accurate and efficient quantification method is necessary to screen a large set of mutants from complex cell culture and a careful correlation between the catalysis parameters in&#8197;vitro and performance in cells is required. In this study, we employed a mass&#8208;spectrometry based high&#8208;throughput quantitative method to screen new mutants of 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS) for triacetic acid lactone (TAL) biosynthesis through directed evolution in E. coli. From the process, we discovered two mutants with the highest improvement (46&#8197;fold) in titer and the fastest kcat (44&#8197;fold) over the wild type 2PS, respectively, among those reported in the literature. A careful examination of the correlation between intracellular substrate concentration, Michaelis&#8208;Menten parameters and TAL titer for these two mutants reveals that a fast reaction rate under limiting intracellular substrate concentrations is important for in&#8208;cell biocatalysis. Such properties can be tuned by protein engineering and synthetic biology to adopt these engineered proteins for the maximum activities in different intracellular environments.

         <title>Illuminating the Path to Enhanced Bioimaging by Phosphole&#8208;based Fluorophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new class of phosphole&#8208;based fluorophores for advanced biological research. These fluorophores outperform existing options, are easily synthesized, and can be coupled to peptides with high selectivity. Labeled peptides maintain stability and low toxicity while exhibiting receptor activation, making them ideal for biolabeling. In fluorescence microscopy, these fluorophores remain visible at low concentrations without bleaching.







Abstract
As the research of biological systems becomes increasingly complex, there is a growing demand for fluorophores with a diverse range of wavelengths. In this study, we introduce phosphole&#8208;based fluorophores that surpass existing options like dansyl chloride. The reactive S&#8722;Cl bond in chlorosulfonylimino&#8208;5&#8208;phenylphosphole derivatives allows rapid and direct coupling to peptides making the fluorophores easily introducible to peptides. This coupling process occurs under mild conditions, demonstrated for [F7,P34]&#8208;NPY and its shorter analogues. Peptides linked with our fluorophores exhibit similar receptor activation to the control peptide, while maintaining high stability and low toxicity, making them ideal biolabeling reagents. In fluorescence microscopy experiments, they can be easily visualized even at low concentrations, without suffering from the typical issue of bleaching. These phosphole&#8208;based fluorophores represent a significant leap forward in the field. Their versatility, ease of modification, superior performance, and applicability in biological labeling make them a promising choice for researchers seeking advanced tools to unravel the details of complex biological systems.

         <title>Carbohydrate Co&#8208;Solutes Stabilize Collagen Triple Helices</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six common carbohydrate co&#8208;solutes stabilize the collagen triple helix. A 4&#8197;M solution of glucose increased the melting temperature (Tm) by as much as 17&#8201;&#176;C. Unlike for other proteins, trehalose is not a special bioprotectant for collagen. All tested saccharides stabilize the collagen triple helix to a similar extent.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are common co&#8208;solutes for the stabilization of proteins. The effect of carbohydrate solutions on the stability of collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, is, however, underexplored. In this work, we studied the thermal stability of collagen triple helices derived from a molecularly defined collagen model peptide (CMP), Ac&#8208;(Pro&#8208;Hyp&#8208;Gly)7&#8208;NH2, in solutions of six common mono&#8208; and disaccharides. We show that the carbohydrates stabilize the collagen triple helix in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, with an increase of the melting temperature of up to 17&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, we show that the stabilizing effect is similar for all studied sugars, including trehalose, which is otherwise considered a privileged bioprotectant. The results provided insight into the effects of sugar co&#8208;solutes on collagen triple helices and can aid the selection of storage environments for collagen&#8208;based materials and probes.

         <title>Unravelling HDAC Selectivity for Erasing Acetyl Mark on Lys&#8208;5&#8201;of Histone H2B</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mark and Erase: Acetyl marks on specific Lysine residues of histones in nucleosomes are installed by HATs and erased by HDACs. We have assembled designer nucleosomes embedded with semisynthetic H2B carrying a defined acetyl mark to delineate its specific eraser human HDACs. Our studies have led to the identification of preferred erasers of acetyl mark at Lys&#8208;5 in H2B.







Abstract
The reversible acetylation of specific Lysine residues of histones plays crucial role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin activity. Importantly, perturbations of acetylation&#8208;deacetylation dynamics have important implications for cancer and neurological disorders. There are 18 human HDACs including sirtuins. The site&#8208;selective acetyl eraser specificity of HDACs is poorly defined. Deciphering the site specificity preference of HDACs from a gamut of lysine in histones may be critical for targeted inhibitor development and delineation of regulatory mechanisms associated with chromatin. Here, we have interrogated the propensity of HDACs to erase acetyl mark at Lys&#8208;5 of H2B namely, H2BK5Ac engineered by a peptide ligation reaction catalyzed by transpeptidase sortase. HDACs and Sirtuins were individually over&#8208;expressed in HEK293 cells and the deacetylation propensity of respective cell lysates was evaluated against H2BK5Ac for initial screening of potential acetyl erasers. This screen indicated HDAC1 as the prime eraser of acetyl mark in H2BK5Ac. The propensity of HDAC1 to erase acetyl mark of H2BK5Ac was further probed using semisynthetic designer nucleosomes with whole cell lysates, recombinant enzyme, and specific inhibitors. Consistent with the above data, siRNA knockdown of HDAC1 and closely related HDAC3 in HEK293 cells prevented the loss of H2BK5 acetylation.

     alt="Unravelling HDAC Selectivity for Erasing Acetyl Mark on Lys-5&#8201;of Histone H2B"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark and Erase&lt;/b&gt;: Acetyl marks on specific Lysine residues of histones in nucleosomes are installed by HATs and erased by HDACs. We have assembled designer nucleosomes embedded with semisynthetic H2B carrying a defined acetyl mark to delineate its specific eraser human HDACs. Our studies have led to the identification of preferred erasers of acetyl mark at Lys-5 in H2B.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversible acetylation of specific Lysine residues of histones plays crucial role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin activity. Importantly, perturbations of acetylation-deacetylation dynamics have important implications for cancer and neurological disorders. There are 18 human HDACs including sirtuins. The site-selective acetyl eraser specificity of HDACs is poorly defined. Deciphering the site specificity preference of HDACs from a gamut of lysine in histones may be critical for targeted inhibitor development and delineation of regulatory mechanisms associated with chromatin. Here, we have interrogated the propensity of HDACs to erase acetyl mark at Lys-5 of H2B namely, H2BK5Ac engineered by a peptide ligation reaction catalyzed by transpeptidase sortase. HDACs and Sirtuins were individually over-expressed in HEK293 cells and the deacetylation propensity of respective cell lysates was evaluated against H2BK5Ac for initial screening of potential acetyl erasers. This screen indicated HDAC1 as the prime eraser of acetyl mark in H2BK5Ac. The propensity of HDAC1 to erase acetyl mark of H2BK5Ac was further probed using semisynthetic designer nucleosomes with whole cell lysates, recombinant enzyme, and specific inhibitors. Consistent with the above data, siRNA knockdown of HDAC1 and closely related HDAC3 in HEK293 cells prevented the loss of H2BK5 acetylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We investigate the enzyme activity of eight lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases through two different activity assays. Contrasting trends emerge from the widely used artificial dye&#8208;coupled assay (left) versus the protein coupled assay (right), underscoring the significance of why the choice of assay matters. The cover features a well plate illustrating results from both assays with a maze overlay distinguishing the misleading from the &#8220;straightforward&#8221; assay.

         <title>Exploiting the Photo&#8208;Physical Properties of Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite nanocrystals show great potential in bioimaging due to their outstanding photophysical properties. Unleashing their capabilities across various imaging modalities requires a deep understanding of the origin of their photophysical properties. This review explores these crucial aspects, demonstrating how the distinctive features of perovskite nanocrystals can be harnessed for visible light, near&#8208;infrared, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.







Abstract
Perovskite nanomaterials have recently been exploited for bioimaging applications due to their unique photo&#8208;physical properties, including high absorbance, good photostability, narrow emissions, and nonlinear optical properties. These attributes outperform conventional fluorescent materials such as organic dyes and metal chalcogenide quantum dots and endow them with the potential to reshape a wide array of bioimaging modalities. Yet, their full potential necessitates a deep grasp of their structure&#8208;attribute relationship and strategies for enhancing water stability through surface engineering for meeting the stringent and unique requirements of each individual imaging modality. This review delves into this evolving frontier, highlighting how their distinctive photo&#8208;physical properties can be leveraged and optimized for various bioimaging modalities, including visible light imaging, near&#8208;infrared imaging, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>A tale of dual functions of SERF family proteins in regulating amyloid formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 5, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we briefly summarize four neuro&#8208;degenerative diseases related amyloidogenic proteins, focusing on the dual functions of the SERF family proteins in regulating the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory functions of SERF proteins, highlighting the critical role of electrostatic interactions in both the acceleration and the inhibition of amyloid fibril formation by SERF family proteins.







Abstract
The abnormal aggregation of proteins is a significant pathological hallmark of diseases, such as the amyloid formation associated with fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Understanding which cellular components and how these components regulate the process of abnormal protein aggregation in living organisms is crucial for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. MOAG&#8208;4/SERF is a conserved family of proteins with rich positive charged residues, which was initially identified as an enhancer for the formation of amyloids in C.&#8197;elegans. Knocking out SERF impedes the amyloid formation of various proteins, including &#945;&#8208;synuclein and &#946;&#8208;amyloid, which are linked to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, respectively. However, recent studies revealed SERF exhibited dual functions, as it could both promote and inhibit the fibril formation of the neurodegenerative disease&#8208;related amyloidogenic proteins. The connection between functions and structure basis of SERF in regulating the amyloid formation is still unclear. This review will outline the hallmark proteins in neurodegenerative diseases, summarize the contradictory role of the SERF protein family in promoting and inhibiting the aggregation of neurodegenerative proteins, and finally explore the potential structural basis and functional selectivity of the SERF protein.

         <title>Discovery of a Photoaffinity Probe that Captures the Active Conformation of the Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a series of bifunctional photoaffinity CB2R selective probes based on the 5&#8208;fluoropyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;benzyl&#8208;imidazoleidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione derivative LEI&#8208;102, with both inverse agonist and partial agonist behaviour in&#8197;vitro. These photoaffinity probes have improved affinity and potency compared to previously published LEI&#8208;121.







Abstract
The cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) is a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor with therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Fluorescent probes are desirable to study its receptor localization, expression and occupancy. Previously, we have reported a photoaffinity probe LEI&#8208;121 that stabilized the inactive conformation of the CB2R. Here, we report the structure&#8208;based design of a novel bifunctional probe that captures the active conformation of the CB2R upon irradiation with light. An alkyne handle was incorporated to visualize the receptor using click&#8208;chemistry with fluorophore&#8208;azides. These probes may hold promise to study different receptor conformations in relation to their cellular localization and function.

         <title>O&#8208;nitrobenzyl Caged Molecule Enables Photo&#8208;controlled Release of Thiabendazole</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NP&#8208;TBZ is developed by covalently linking o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (NP) with thiabendazole (TBZ). Compound NP&#8208;TBZ can be controlled to release TBZ in dependent to light, which resulted in controllable in&#8208;vivo activity against wheat scab. It is promising for spatiotemporal controlled&#8208;release of TBZ in factual applications, posing a theoretical guidance in development of controlled&#8208;release pesticides.







Abstract
Pesticides are essential in agricultural development. Controlled&#8208;release pesticides have attracted great attentions. Base on a principle of spatiotemporal selectivity, we extended the photoremovable protective group (PRPG) into agrochemical agents to achieve controllable release of active ingredients. Herein, we obtained NP&#8208;TBZ by covalently linking o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (NP) with thiabendazole (TBZ). Compound NP&#8208;TBZ can be controlled to release TBZ in dependent to light. The irradiated and unirradiated NP&#8208;TBZ showed significant differences on fungicidal activities both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. In addition, the irradiated NP&#8208;TBZ displayed similar antifungal activities to the directly&#8208;used TBZ, indicating a factual applicability in controllable release of TBZ. Furthermore, we explored the action mode and microcosmic variations by SEM analysis, and demonstrated that the irradiated NP&#8208;TBZ retained a same action mode with TBZ against mycelia growth.

Base on a principle of spatiotemporal selectivity, we extended the photoremovable protective group (PRPG) into agrochemical agents to achieve controllable release of active ingredients. Herein, we obtained &lt;b&gt;NP-TBZ&lt;/b&gt; by covalently linking &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl (&lt;b&gt;NP&lt;/b&gt;) with thiabendazole (&lt;b&gt;TBZ&lt;/b&gt;). Compound &lt;b&gt;NP-TBZ&lt;/b&gt; can be controlled to release &lt;b&gt;TBZ&lt;/b&gt; in dependent to light. The irradiated and unirradiated &lt;b&gt;NP-TBZ&lt;/b&gt; showed significant differences on fungicidal activities both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. In addition, the irradiated &lt;b&gt;NP-TBZ&lt;/b&gt; displayed similar antifungal activities to the directly-used &lt;b&gt;TBZ&lt;/b&gt;, indicating a factual applicability in controllable release of &lt;b&gt;TBZ&lt;/b&gt;. Furthermore, we explored the action mode and microcosmic variations by SEM analysis, and demonstrated that the irradiated &lt;b&gt;NP-TBZ&lt;/b&gt; retained a same action mode with &lt;b&gt;TBZ&lt;/b&gt; against mycelia growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Biological Activities of Polyether Ionophore Antibiotic Routiennocin is Independent of Absolute Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis was used to access both enantiomers of the polyether antibiotic routiennocin, and a diastereomeric variant, to probe the biological consequences of altering the naturally configured stereochemistry. Testing these compounds against a broad panel of bacteria and mammalian cells revealed independence of absolute stereochemistry in all tested cells.







Abstract
Carboxylic polyether ionophores (CPIs) are among the most prevalent agricultural antibiotics (notably in the US) and these compounds have been in use for decades. The potential to reposition CPIs beyond veterinary use, e.&#8201;g. through chemical modifications to enhance their selectivity window, is an exciting challenge and opportunity, considering their general resilience towards resistance development. Given the very large societal impact of these somewhat controversial compounds, it is surprising that many aspects of their mechanisms and activities in cells remain unclear. Here, we report comparative biological activities of the CPI routiennocin and two stereoisomers, including its enantiomer. We used an efficient convergent synthesis strategy to access the compounds and conducted a broad survey of antibacterial activities against planktonic cells and biofilms as well as the compounds&#8217; effects on mammalian cells, the latter assessed both via standard cell viability assays and broad morphological profiling. Interestingly, similar bioactivity of the enantiomeric pair was observed across all assays, strongly suggesting that chiral interactions do not play a decisive role in the mode of action. Overall, our findings are consistent with a mechanistic model involving highly dynamic behaviour of CPIs in biological membranes.

         <title>Fus&#8208;SMO: Kinetics, Biochemical Characterisation and In Silico Modelling of a Chimeric Styrene Monooxygenase Demonstrating Quantitative Coupling Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fus&#8208;SMO, a chimera of StyA and StyB in styrene monooxygenase, has a trimeric structure with one bound flavin. In silico modelling indicated a well&#8208;distanced arrangement due to the flexible linker. Pre&#8208;steady&#8208;state kinetics highlighted the intricacies of FADox reduction and aerobic FADH2 oxidation. NADH consumption vs. styrene epoxidation revealed quantitative coupling efficiency. These findings advance our understanding of FADH2 transfer mechanisms in SMO and underscore protein fusion&#8216;s role in enhancing biocatalysis.







Abstract
The styrene monooxygenase, a two&#8208;component enzymatic system for styrene epoxidation, was characterised through the study of Fus&#8208;SMO &#8211; a chimera resulting from the fusion of StyA and StyB using a flexible linker. Notably, it remains debated whether the transfer of FADH2 from StyB to StyA occurs through diffusion, channeling, or a combination of both. Fus&#8208;SMO was identified as a trimer with one bound FAD molecule. In silico modelling revealed a well&#8208;distanced arrangement (45&#8211;50&#8197;&#197;) facilitated by the flexible linker&#8216;s loopy structure. Pre&#8208;steady&#8208;state kinetics elucidated the FADox reduction intricacies (kred=110&#8197;s&#8722;1 for bound FADox), identifying free FADox binding as the rate&#8208;determining step. The aerobic oxidation of FADH2 (kox=90&#8197;s&#8722;1) and subsequent decomposition to FADox and H2O2 demonstrated StyA&#8242;s protective effect on the bound hydroperoxoflavin (kdec=0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1) compared to free cofactor (kdec=1.8&#8197;s&#8722;1). At varied styrene concentrations, kox for FADH2 ranged from 80 to 120&#8197;s&#8722;1. Studies on NADH consumption vs. styrene epoxidation revealed Fus&#8208;SMO&#8242;s ability to achieve quantitative coupling efficiency in solution, surpassing natural two&#8208;component SMOs. The results suggest that Fus&#8208;SMO exhibits enhanced FADH2 channelling between subunits. This work contributes to comprehending FADH2 transfer mechanisms in SMO and illustrates how protein fusion can elevate catalytic efficiency for biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Human 2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;Phosphate N&#8208;Hydrolase 1: The Catalytic Roles of Tyr24 and Asp80</title>

         <dc:description>
The human enzyme 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate N&#8208;hydrolase 1 (HsDNPH1) is a promising target for inhibition towards anticancer drug development. Crystal structures, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analysis, including pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent deuterium isotope effects, help quantify contributions from conserved residues Tyr24 and Asp80 to HsDNPH1&#8208;catalysed hydrolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate. These include nucleophile and substrate positioning and general&#8208;acid catalysis.







Abstract
The human enzyme 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate N&#8208;hydrolase 1 (HsDNPH1) catalyses the hydrolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate to generate 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil and 2&#8208;deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate via a covalent 5&#8208;phospho&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyribosylated enzyme intermediate. HsDNPH1 is a promising target for inhibitor development towards anticancer drugs. Here, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of conserved active&#8208;site residues, followed by HPLC analysis of the reaction and steady&#8208;state kinetics are employed to reveal the importance of each of these residues in catalysis, and the reaction pH&#8208;dependence is perturbed by each mutation. Solvent deuterium isotope effects indicate no rate&#8208;limiting proton transfers. Crystal structures of D80N&#8208;HsDNPH1 in unliganded and substrate&#8208;bound states, and of unliganded D80A&#8208; and Y24F&#8208;HsDNPH1 offer atomic level insights into substrate binding and catalysis. The results reveal a network of hydrogen bonds involving the substrate and the E104&#8208;Y24&#8208;D80 catalytic triad and are consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby D80 is important for substrate positioning, for helping modulate E104 nucleophilicity, and as the general acid in the first half&#8208;reaction. Y24 positions E104 for catalysis and prevents a catalytically disruptive close contact between E104 and D80.

         <title>Effect of DNA Origami Nanostructures on Bacterial Growth</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacteria can use DNA origami nanostructures as a nutrient source, leading to increased population growth. This process depends not only on the competence signal and uptake mechanisms of each species, but also on DNA origami shape and superstructure. It should thus be considered in the design and development of antimicrobial DNA origami nanostructures.







Abstract
DNA origami nanostructures are a powerful tool in biomedicine and can be used to combat drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. However, the effect of unmodified DNA origami nanostructures on bacteria is yet to be elucidated. With the aim to obtain a better understanding of this phenomenon, the effect of three DNA origami shapes, i.e., DNA origami triangles, six&#8208;helix bundles (6HBs), and 24&#8208;helix bundles (24HBs), on the growth of Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis is investigated. The results reveal that while triangles and 24HBs can be used as a source of nutrients by E. coli and thereby promote population growth, their effect is much smaller than that of genomic single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA. However, no effect on E. coli population growth is observed for the 6HBs. On the other hand, B. subtilis does not show any significant changes in population growth when cultured with the different DNA origami shapes or genomic DNA. The detailed effect of DNA origami nanostructures on bacterial growth thus depends on the competence signals and uptake mechanism of each bacterial species, as well as the DNA origami shape. This should be considered in the development of antimicrobial DNA origami nanostructures.

The detailed effect of DNA origami nanostructures on bacterial growth thus depends on the competence signals and uptake mechanism of each bacterial species, as well as the DNA origami shape. This should be considered in the development of antimicrobial DNA origami nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis and DNA Interactive Studies of New 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidines Hybrids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalyzed reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates and aryl azides resulted in the metal&#8208;free synthesis of novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidine hybrids in good yields. Spectroscopic methods (absorption and emission), viscosimetry, and molecular docking were employed to assess the interactions between the synthesized compounds and DNA, revealing promising results for the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting DNA&#8208;related processes.







Abstract
An organocatalytic [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;ketoester 1 and aryl azides 2 was employed to synthesize new 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidine hybrids 3. In this metal&#8208;free approach, twelve compounds were isolated in yields ranging from 23&#8201;% to 96&#8201;% by using diethylamine (10&#8197;mol%) and DMSO at 75&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;hours. DNA&#8208;binding assays were conducted through absorption, emission spectroscopy and viscosimetry analysis, to evaluate the interaction capacity of the studied derivatives with nucleic acids. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their interactions with a specific group of compounds containing the pharmacophoric groups triazole and thiazolidine through a molecular docking speculative study, aimed at identifying the interaction profile of these compounds with DNA. The obtained results suggest that 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;thiazolidine hybrids could be a promising approach in the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting DNA&#8208;related processes.

         <title>Selective Aza&#8208;Michael Addition to Dehydrated Amino Acids in Natural Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global public health problem that has made the search for new antibiotics essential. Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides are a promising new class of antibiotics and in this work, we report site&#8208;selective modification of their dehydroamino acids by &#946;&#8208;amination in order to increase water solubility: the singly modified thiopeptide Thiostrepton showed an increase up to 35&#8208;fold and minimum inhibitory concentration tests demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity was still good, albeit lower than the natural peptide.







Abstract
We report the efficient and site selective modification of non&#8208;canonical dehydroamino acids in ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;transationally modified peptides (RiPPs) by &#946;&#8208;amination. The singly modified thiopeptide Thiostrepton showed an up to 35&#8208;fold increase in water solubility, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays showed that antimicrobial activity remained good, albeit lower than the unmodified peptide. Also the lanthipeptide nisin could be modified using this method.

         <title>Identification, characterization and application of M16AT, a new organic solvent&#8211;tolerant (R)&#8211;enantio&#8211;selective type IV amine transaminase from Mycobacterium sp. ACS1612</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new (R)&#8208;selective amine transaminase (R&#8208;ATA) from Mycobacterium sp. ACS1612 was identified via in silico prediction combined with genome and protein database information. The newly identified and characterized R&#8208;ATA displayed a broad substrate spectrum and strong tolerance to organic solvents. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of M16AT was demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;fendiline.







Abstract
Biocatalysis has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional chemical methods, especially for asymmetric synthesis. As biocatalysts usually exhibit excellent chemical, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, they facilitate and simplify many chemical processes for the production of a broad range of products. Here, a new biocatalyst called, R&#8208;selective amine transaminases (R&#8208;ATAs), was obtained from Mycobacterium sp. ACS1612 (M16AT) using in&#8211;silico prediction combined with a genome and protein database. A two&#8211;step simple purification process could yield a high concentration of pure enzyme, suggesting that industrial application would be inexpensive. Additionally, the newly identified and characterized R&#8208;ATAs displayed a broad substrate spectrum and strong tolerance to organic solvents. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of M16AT has been demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;fendiline from of (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine.

         <title>The Biocatalytic Potential of Aromatic Ammonia&#8208;Lyase from Loktanella atrilutea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Characterization of the aromatic ammonia&#8208;lyase from Loktanella atrilutea (LaAAL) revealed reduced activity towards canonical AAL substrates: L&#8208;Phe, L&#8208;Tyr, and L&#8208;His, contrasted by its pronounced efficiency towards 3,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine. Assessing optimal conditions, LaAAL exhibited maximal activity at pH 9.5 in the ammonia elimination reaction route, distinct from the typical pH ranges of most PALs and TALs. Within the exploration of the ammonia source for the opposite, synthetically valuable ammonia addition reaction, the stability of LaAAL, exhibited a positive correlation with the ammonia concentration, with the highest stability in 4 M ammonium carbamate of unadjusted pH of ~9.5. While the enzyme activity increased with rising temperatures yet, the highest operational stability and highest stationary conversions of LaAAL were observed at 30 &#176;C. The substrate scope analysis highlighted the catalytic adaptability of LaAAL in the hydroamination of diverse cinnamic acids, especially of meta&#8208;substituted and di&#8208;/multi&#8208;substituted analogues, with structural modelling exposing steric clashes between the substrates&#8217; ortho&#8208;substituents and catalytic site residues. LaAAL showed a predilection for ammonia elimination, while classifying as a tyrosine ammonia&#8208;lyase (TAL) among the natural AAL classes. However, its distinctive attributes, such as genomic context, unique substrate specificity and catalytic fingerprint, suggest a potential natural role beyond those of known AAL classes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Carbamate Self&#8208;Immolative Spacers Counterintuitively Release 3&#176; Alcohol at Much Faster Rates than 1&#176; Alcohol Payloads</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;immolative (SI) spacers are degradable chemical connectors widely used in prodrugs and drug conjugates to release pharmaceutical ingredients in response to specific stimuli. Amine&#8208;carbamate SI spacers are particularly versatile, as they have been used to release different hydroxy cargos, ranging from 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohols to phenols and oximes. In this work, we describe the ability of three amine&#8208;carbamate SI spacers to release three structurally similar imidazoquinoline payloads, bearing either a 1&#176;, a 2&#176; or a 3&#176; alcohol as the leaving group. While the spacers showed comparable efficacy at releasing the 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohols, the liberation of the 1&#176; alcohol was much slower, unveiling a counterintuitive trend in nucleophilic acyl substitutions. The release of the 1&#176; alcohol payload was only possible using a SI spacer bearing a pyrrolidine ring and a tertiary amine handle, which opens the way to future applications in drug delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether Bond Cleavage of a Phenylcoumaran &#946;&#8208;5 Lignin Model Compound and Polymeric Lignin Catalysed by a LigE&#8208;type Etherase from Agrobacterium sp.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A LigE&#8208;type beta&#8208;etherase enzyme from lignin&#8208;degrading Agrobacterium sp. has been identified, which assists degradation of polymeric lignins. Testing against lignin dimer model compounds revealed that it does not catalyse the previously reported reaction of Sphingobium SYK&#8208;6 LigE, but instead shows activity for a &#946;&#8208;5 phenylcoumaran lignin dimer. The reaction products did not contain glutathione, indicating a catalytic role for reduced glutathione in this enzyme. Three reaction products were identified: the major product was a cis&#8208;stilbene arising from C&#8208;C fragmentation involving loss of formaldehyde; two minor products were an alkene arising from elimination of glutathione, and an oxidised ketone, proposed to arise from reaction of an intermediate with molecular oxygen. Testing of the recombinant enzyme against a soda lignin revealed the formation of new signals by two&#8208;dimensional NMR analysis, whose chemical shifts are consistent with the formation of a stilbene unit in polymeric lignin.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoisomerization and light&#8208;controlled antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolone&#8208;azoisoxazole hybrids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photopharmacology holds a huge untapped potential to locally treat diseases involving photoswitchable drugs to eliminate drugs&#8217; off&#8208;target effects. The growth of this field has created a pressing demand to develop such light&#8208;active drugs. We explored the potential for creating photoswitchable antibiotic hybrids by attaching pharmacophores norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin and azoisoxazole (photoswitch). All compounds exhibited a moderate to a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, long thermal cis half&#8208;lives, and impressive photoresistance. Gram&#8208;negative pathogens were found to be insensitive to these hybrids, while against Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, all hybrids in their trans states exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to the parent drugs. Notably, the toxicity of the irradiated hybrid 6 was 2&#8208;fold lower than the nonirradiated trans isomer, indicating that the pre&#8208;inactivated cis&#8211;enriched drug can be employed for the site&#8208;specific treatment of bacterial infection using light, which could potentially eliminate the unwanted exposure of toxic antibiotics to both beneficial and untargeted harmful microbes in our body. Molecular docking studies revealed different binding affinity of the cis and trans isomers of 6 with the topoisomerase IV enzyme, due to their different shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Analysis of the MIO&#8208;forming Residues of Aromatic Ammonia Lyases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic analysis of protein sequences, several protein clusters of AAL&#8208;like enzymes with unusual MIO&#8208;forming motifs (ACG, TSG, SSG, and CSG) were identified, including two novel HALs with CSG motifs, one PAM with a TSG motif, and three novel ETLs without MIO motif. The systematic study and mutagenesis of MIO&#8208;groups in this work enable thus functional prediction and mutagenesis research of AALs.







Abstract
Aromatic ammonia lyases (AALs) and tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia mutases (TAM/PAM) are 3,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5&#8208;methylidene&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;one (MIO)&#8208;dependent enzymes. Usually, the MIO moiety is autocatalytically formed from the tripeptide Ala&#8208;Ser&#8208;Gly (ASG) and acts as an electrophile during the enzymatic reaction. However, the MIO&#8208;forming residues (ASG) have some diversity in this enzyme class. In this work, a systematic investigation on the variety of MIO&#8208;forming residues was carried out using in&#8208;depth sequence analyses. Several protein clusters of AAL&#8208;like enzymes with unusual MIO&#8208;forming residues such as ACG, TSG, SSG, and CSG were identified, including two novel histidine ammonia lyases and one PAM with CSG and TSG residues, respectively, as well as three novel ergothioneine trimethylammonia lyases without MIO motif. The mutagenesis of common MIO&#8208;groups confirmed the function of these MIO variants, which provides good starting points for future functional prediction and mutagenesis research of AALs.

&lt;p&gt;Aromatic ammonia lyases (AALs) and tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia mutases (TAM/PAM) are 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO)-dependent enzymes.

         <dc:description>Peptide and protein nanostructures with tunable structural features, multifunctionality, biocompatibility and biomolecular recognition capacity enable development of efficient targeted drug delivery tools for precision medicine applications. In this review article, we present various techniques employed for the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of peptides and proteins into nanostructures. We discuss design strategies utilized to enhance their stability, drug&#8208;loading capacity, and controlled release properties, in addition to the mechanisms by which peptide nanostructures interact with target cells, including receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and cell&#8208;penetrating capabilities. We also explore the potential of peptide and protein nanostructures for precision medicine, focusing on applications in personalized therapies and disease&#8208;specific targeting for diagnostics and therapeutics in diseases such as cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Phylogeny&#8208;guided Characterization of Bacterial Hydrazine Biosynthesis Mediated by Cupin/methionyl tRNA Synthetase&#8208;like Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cupin/methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like didomain enzymes catalyze nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8211;N) bond formation between Nw&#8208;hydroxylamines and amino acids to generate hydrazines, key biosynthetic intermediates of various natural products containing N&#8211;N bonds. While the combination of these two building blocks leads to the creation of diverse hydrazine products, the full extent of their structural diversity remains largely unknown. To explore this, we herein conducted phylogeny&#8208;guided genome&#8208;mining of related hydrazine biosynthetic pathways consisting of two enzymes: flavin&#8208;dependent Nw&#8208;hydroxylating monooxygenases (NMOs) that produce Nw&#8208;hydroxylamine precursors and cupin/MetRS&#8208;like enzymes that couple the Nw&#8208;hydroxylamines with amino acids via N&#8211;N bonds. A phylogenetic analysis identified the largely unexplored sequence spaces of these enzyme families. The biochemical characterization of NMOs demonstrated their capabilities to produce various Nw&#8208;hydroxylamines, including those previously not known as precursors of N&#8211;N bonds. Furthermore, the characterization of cupin/MetRS&#8208;like enzymes identified five new hydrazine products with novel combinations of building blocks, including one containing non&#8208;amino acid building blocks: 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane and putrescine. This study substantially expanded the variety of N&#8211;N bond forming pathways mediated by cupin/MetRS&#8208;like enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterial Glycolipid Acting on Protein Transport across Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The process of protein transport across membranes involves a variety of factors and has been extensively investigated. Traditionally, proteinaceous translocons and chaperones have been recognized as crucial factors in this process. However, recent studies have highlighted the significant roles played by lipids and a glycolipid present in biological membranes in membrane protein transport. Membrane lipids can influence transport efficiency by altering the physicochemical properties of membranes. Notably, our studies have revealed that diacylglycerol (DAG) attenuates mobility in the membrane core region, leading to a dramatic suppression of membrane protein integration. Conversely, a glycolipid in Escherichia coli inner membranes, named membrane protein integrase (MPIase), enhances integration not only through the alteration of membrane properties but also via direct interactions with membrane proteins. This review explores the mechanisms of membrane protein integration mediated by membrane lipids, specifically DAG, and MPIase. Our results, along with the employed physicochemical analysis methods such as fluorescence measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance, surface plasmon resonance, and docking simulation, are presented to elucidate these mechanisms.</dc:description>

The cover shows the homodimeric neryl diphosphate synthase, a short&#8208;chaincis&#8208;prenyltransferase from tomato. The two active sites of the enzyme alternate in function, condensing two substrates on one site (represented by green tomatoes, front) while the other excretes the product (represented by red tomatoes, back). The conserved C&#8208;terminal motif of this enzyme changes its secondary structure during turnover and may, cooperatively with the unique N&#8208;terminal region, be important for the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Exploring a Solvent Dependent Strategy to Control Self&#8208;Assembling Behavior and Cellular Interaction in Laminin&#8208;Mimetic Short Peptide based Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled hydrogels, fabricated through diverse non&#8208;covalent interactions, have been extensively studied in regenerative medicines. Inspired from bioactive functional motifs of ECM protein, short peptide sequences have shown remarkable abilities to replicate the intrinsic features of the natural extracellular milieu. In this direction, we have fabricated two short hydrophobic bioactive sequences derived from the laminin protein i.e., IKVAV and YIGSR. Based on the substantial hydrophobicity of these peptides, we selected a co&#8208;solvent approach as a suitable gelation technique that included different concentrations of DMSO as an organic phase along with an aqueous solution containing 0.1% TFA. These hydrophobic laminin&#8208;based bioactive peptides which had limited solubility in aqueous physiological environment showed significantly enhanced solubility with higher DMSO content in water. The enhanced solubility resulted in extensive intermolecular interactions that led to the formation of hydrogels with a higher&#8208;order entangled network along with improved mechanical properties. Interestingly, by simply modulating DMSO content, highly tunable gels were accessed in the same gelator domain that displayed differential physicochemical properties. Further, the cellular studies substantiated the potential of these laminin&#8208;derived hydrogels in enhancing cell&#8208;matrix interactions, thereby reinforcing their applications in tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonlinear impact of electrolyte solutions on protein dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halophilic organisms have adapted to multi&#8208;molar salt concentrations, their cytoplasmic proteins functioning despite stronger attraction between hydrophobic groups. These proteins, of interest in biotechnology because of decreasing fresh&#8208;water resources, have excess acidic amino acids.&#160; &#160;It has been suggested that conformational fluctuations &#8208;&#8208; critical for protein function &#8208;&#8208; decrease in the presence of a stronger hydrophobic effect, and that an acidic proteome would counteract this decrease. However, our understanding of the salt&#8208; and acidic amino acid dependency of enzymatic activity is limited. Here, using solution NMR relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations for in total 14 proteins, we show that salt concentration has a limited and moreover non&#8208;monotonic impact on protein dynamics. The results speak against the conformational&#8208;fluctuations model, instead indicating that maintaining protein dynamics to ensure protein function is not an evolutionary driving force behind the acidic proteome of halophilic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifications of Protein&#8208;Bound Substrates by Trans&#8208;Acting Enzymes in Natural Products Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic modifications of small molecules are a common phenomenon in natural product biosynthesis, leading to the production of diverse bioactive compounds. In polyketide biosynthesis, modifications commonly take place after the completion of the polyketide backbone assembly by the polyketide synthases and the mature products are released from the acyl&#8208;carrier protein (ACP). However, exceptions to this rule appear to be widespread, as on&#8208;line hydroxylation, methyl transfer, and cyclization during polyketide assembly process are common, particularly in&#160;trans&#8208;AT PKS systems. Many of these modifications are catalyzed by specific domains within the modular PKS systems. However, several of the on&#8208;line modifications are catalyzed by stand&#8208;alone proteins. Those include the on&#8208;line Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation,&#160;&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, halogenation, epoxidation, and methyl esterification during polyketide assembly, dehydrogenation of ACP&#8208;bound short fatty acids by acyl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase&#8208;like enzymes, and glycosylation of ACP&#8208;bound intermediates by discrete glycosyltransferase enzymes. This review article highlights some of these&#160;trans&#8208;acting proteins that catalyze enzymatic modifications of ACP&#8208;bound small molecules in natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mushroom Tyrosinase: Six Isoenzymes Catalyzing Distinct&#160;Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;Mushroom tyrosinase&#8221; from the common button mushroom is the most frequently used source of tyrosinase activity, both for basic and applied research. Here, the complete tyrosinase family from Agaricus bisporus var. bisporus (abPPO1&#8208;6) was cloned from mRNA and expressed heterologously using a single protocol. All six isoenzymes accept a wide range of phenolic and catecholic substrates, but display pronounced differences in their specificity and enzymatic reaction rate. AbPPO3 ignores &#947;&#8208;l&#8208;glutaminyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzene (GHB), a natural phenol present in mM concentrations in A. bisporus, while AbPPO4 processes 100 &#181;M GHB at 4&#8208;times the rate of the catechol l&#8208;DOPA. All six AbPPOs are biochemically distinct enzymes fit for different roles in the fungal life cycle, which challenges the traditional concept of isoenzymes as catalyzing the same chemical reaction and varying only in secondary properties. Transferring this approach to other enzymes and organisms will greatly stimulate both the study of the in vivo function(s) of enzymes and the application of these highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an Enzyme Cascade System for the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure&#160;D&#8208;Amino Acids Utilizing Ancestral&#160;L&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiomerically pure&#160;D&#8208;amino acids hold significant potential as precursors for synthesizing various fine chemicals, including peptide&#8208;based drugs and other pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on establishing an enzymatic cascade system capable of converting various&#160;L&#8208;amino acids into their&#160;D&#8208;isomers. The system integrates four enzymes: ancestral&#160;L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (AncLAAO&#8208;N4),&#160;D&#8208;amino acid dehydrogenase (DAADH),&#160;D&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and catalase. AncLAAO&#8208;N4 initiates the process by converting&#160;L&#8208;amino acids to corresponding keto acids, which are then stereo&#8208;selectively aminated to&#160;D&#8208;amino acids by DAADH using NADPH and NH4Cl. Concurrently, any generated H2O2&#160;is decomposed into O2&#160;and H2O by catalase, while GDH regenerates NADPH from&#160;D&#8208;glucose. Optimization of reaction conditions and substrate concentrations enabled the successful synthesis of five&#160;D&#8208;amino acids, including a&#160;D&#8208;Phe derivative, three&#160;D&#8208;Trp derivatives, and&#160;D&#8208;phenylglycine, all with high enantiopurity (&gt;99%&#160;ee) at a preparative scale (&gt;100 mg). This system demonstrates a versatile approach for producing a diverse array of&#160;D&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Production and Vibrational Analysis of Heavy&#8208;Isotope&#8208;Labeled Peptides from Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microcystis aeruginosa cultures were grown in 15N&#8208; and 13C&#8208;enriched medium to produce heavy&#8208;labeled cyanopeptides, which were characterized with vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Up to 98&#8201;% heavy isotope incorporation was observed for the peptides, which displayed strong vibrational bands associated with diene, thiazole, and phenyl functional groups.







Abstract
Stable isotope labeling is an extremely useful tool for characterizing the structure, tracing the metabolism, and imaging the distribution of natural products in living organisms using mass&#8208;sensitive measurement techniques. In this study, a cyanobacterium was cultured in 15N/13C&#8208;enriched media to endogenously produce labeled, bioactive oligopeptides. The extent of heavy isotope incorporation in these peptides was determined with LC&#8211;MS, while the overall extent of heavy isotope incorporation in whole cells was studied with nanoSIMS and AFM&#8208;IR. Up to 98&#8201;% heavy isotope incorporation was observed in labeled cells. Three of the most abundant peptides, microcystin&#8208;LR (MCLR), cyanopeptolin&#8208;A (CYPA), and aerucyclamide&#8208;A (ACAA), were isolated and further studied with Raman and FTIR spectroscopies and DFT calculations. This revealed several IR and Raman active vibrations associated with functional groups not common in ribosomal peptides, like diene, ester, thiazole, thiazoline, and oxazoline groups, which could be suitable for future vibrational imaging studies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Microcystis aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; cultures were grown in &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N- and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched medium to produce heavy-labeled cyanopeptides, which were characterized with vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable isotope labeling is an extremely useful tool for characterizing the structure, tracing the metabolism, and imaging the distribution of natural products in living organisms using mass-sensitive measurement techniques. In this study, a cyanobacterium was cultured in &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched media to endogenously produce labeled, bioactive oligopeptides. The extent of heavy isotope incorporation in these peptides was determined with LC&#8211;MS, while the overall extent of heavy isotope incorporation in whole cells was studied with nanoSIMS and AFM-IR. Up to 98&#8201;% heavy isotope incorporation was observed in labeled cells. Three of the most abundant peptides, microcystin-LR (MCLR), cyanopeptolin-A (CYPA), and aerucyclamide-A (ACAA), were isolated and further studied with Raman and FTIR spectroscopies and DFT calculations. This revealed several IR and Raman active vibrations associated with functional groups not common in ribosomal peptides, like diene, ester, thiazole, thiazoline, and oxazoline groups, which could be suitable for future vibrational imaging studies. More broadly, this study outlines a simple and relatively inexpensive method for producing heavy-labeled natural products.

         <title>Biocatalytic regioselective O&#8208;acylation of sesquiterpene lactones from chicory: a pathway to novel ester derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the first biocatalytic modification of sesquiterpene lactones (STL) found in chicory plants. Regioselective O&#8208;acylation of their primary alcohol group is achieved by the immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica, with various aliphatic vinyl esters as acyl donors. High conversion rates were observed, facilitating the synthesis of novel semi&#8208;synthetic STL ester derivatives with promising pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
We report the first biocatalytic modification of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) found in the chicory plants, specifically lactucin (Lc), 11&#946;,13&#8208;dihydrolactucin (DHLc), lactucopicrin (Lp), and 11&#946;,13&#8208;dihydrolactucopicrin (DHLp). The selective O&#8208;acylation of their primary alcohol group was carried out by the lipase B from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8208;B) using various aliphatic vinyl esters as acyl donors. Perillyl alcohol, a simpler monoterpenoid, served as a model to set up the desired O&#8208;acetylation reaction by comparing the use of acetic acid and vinyl acetate as acyl donors. Similar conditions were then applied to DHLc, where five novel ester chains were selectively introduced onto the primary alcohol group, with conversions going from &gt;99&#8201;% (acetate and propionate) to 69&#8201;% (octanoate). The synthesis of the corresponding O&#8208;acetyl esters of Lc, Lp, and DHLp was also successfully achieved with near&#8208;quantitative conversion. Molecular docking simulations were then performed to elucidate the preferred enzyme&#8208;substrate binding modes in the acylation reactions with STLs, as well as to understand their interactions with crucial amino acid residues at the active site. Our methodology enables the selective O&#8208;acylation of the primary alcohol group in four different STLs, offering possibilities for synthesizing novel derivatives with significant potential applications in pharmaceuticals or as biocontrol agents.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Indole&#8208;Based Imidazopyridine using &#945;&#8208;Amylase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic process for synthesizing clinically important indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives using the &#945;&#8208;amylase catalyzed Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehyde, and isocyanide has been developed. Further, &#945;&#8208;amylase from Aspergillus oryzae was immobilized onto magnetic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials [Fe3O4@MIL&#8208;100(Fe)] to make it a robust and reusable catalyst for this transformation.







Abstract
The imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine scaffold has gained significant attention due to its presence as a lead structure in several commercially available pharmaceuticals like zolimidine, zolpidem, olprinone, soraprazan, etc. Further, indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives have been found interesting due to their anticancer and antibacterial activities. However, limited methods have been reported for the synthesis of indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. In this study, we have successfully developed a biocatalytic process for synthesizing indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives using the &#945;&#8208;amylase enzyme catalyzed Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienayme (GBB) multicomponent reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehyde, and isocyanide. The generality and robustness of this protocol were shown by synthesizing differently substituted indole&#8208;based imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in good isolated yields. Furthermore, to make &#945;&#8208;amylase a reusable catalyst for GBB multicomponent reaction, it was immobilized onto magnetic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials [Fe3O4@MIL&#8208;100(Fe)] and found reusable up to four consecutive catalytic cycles without the significant loss in catalytic activity.

         <title>13C&#946;&#8208;Valine and 13C&#947;&#8208;Leucine Methine Labeling To Probe Protein Ligand Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel labeling approach introduces isolated 13C&#8722;H spin systems to the methyl&#8208;deuterated side chains of leucine and valine residues. Ligands with known binding geometries have been analyzed in combination with corresponding protein samples, showing that chemical shift perturbation data correlate well with the distance&#8208; and angle parameters of CH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Precise information regarding the interaction between proteins and ligands at molecular resolution is crucial for effectively guiding the optimization process from initial hits to lead compounds in early stages of drug development. In this study, we introduce a novel aliphatic side chain isotope&#8208;labeling scheme to directly probe interactions between ligands and aliphatic sidechains using NMR techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, we selected a set of Brd4&#8208;BD1 binders and analyzed 1H chemical shift perturbation resulting from CH&#8208;&#960; interaction of H&#946;&#8208;Val and H&#947;&#8208;Leu as CH donors with corresponding ligand aromatic moieties as &#960; acceptors.

         <title>Engineering A&#8208;type Dye&#8208;decolorizing Peroxidases by Modification of a Conserved Glutamate Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dye&#8208;decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) are recently identified microbial enzymes that have been used in several Biotechnology applications from wastewater treatment to lignin valorization. However, their properties and mechanism of action still have many open questions. Their heme&#8208;containing active site is buried by three conserved flexible loops with a putative role in modulating substrate access and enzyme catalysis. Here, we investigated the role of a conserved glutamate residue in stabilizing interactions in loop 2 of A&#8208;type DyPs. First, we did site saturation mutagenesis of this residue, replacing it with all possible amino acids in bacterial DyPs from Bacillus subtilis (BsDyP) and from Kitasatospora aureofaciens (KaDyP1), the latter being characterized here for the first time. We screened the resulting libraries of variants for activity towards ABTS and identified variants with increased catalytic efficiency. The selected variants were purified and characterized for activity and stability. We furthermore used Molecular Dynamics simulations to rationalize the increased catalytic efficiency and found that the main reason is the electron channeling becoming easier from surface&#8208;exposed tryptophans. Based on our findings, we also propose that this glutamate could work as a pH switch in the wild&#8208;type enzyme, preventing intracellular damage.</dc:description>

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of Azabenzimidazole&#8208;Based PET Radioligands for &#947;&#8208;8 Dependent Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Protein Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azabenzimidazoles&#8208;based18F&#8208;labeled positron emission tomography (PET) ligand ([18F]TARP&#8208;2205) is synthesized and preliminarily evaluated. In vitro autoradiography studies indicate that these PET ligands possess high in&#8197;vitro specific binding to TARP &#947;&#8208;8.







Abstract
AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play a pivotal role in excitatory neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus where the TARP &#947;&#8208;8 subunit is enriched and serves as a target for emerging anti&#8208;epileptic drugs. To enable in&#8197;vivo visualization of TARP &#947;&#8208;8 distribution and expression by positron emission tomography (PET), this study focuses on the development of novel 18F&#8208;labeled TARP &#947;&#8208;8 inhibitors and their corresponding precursors, stemming from the azabenzimidazole scaffold. The resulting radioligands [18F]TARP&#8208;2204 and [18F]TARP&#8208;2205 were successfully synthesized with acceptable radiochemical yield, high molar activity, and excellent radiochemical purity. In vitro autoradiography demonstrates high level of specific binding of [18F]TARP&#8208;2205 to TARP &#947;&#8208;8 in both rat and nonhuman primate brain tissues. However, unexpected radiodefluorination in PET imaging studies of rodents emphasizes the need for further structural refinement. This work serves as an excellent starting point for the development of future 18F&#8208;labeled TARP &#947;&#8208;8 PET tracers, offering valuable insights into medicinal chemistry design, radiosynthesis and subsequent PET evaluation.

         <title>Title: Photo&#8208;affinity and Metabolic Labeling Probes Based on the Opioid Alkaloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leon Duque, Vallavoju, and colleagues report the design and development of photo&#8208;affinity and metabolic labeling probes based on the opioid alkaloids. These chemical probes are used to measure localization and protein interactions in a cellular context by confocal microscopy and chemical proteomics. These insights will inform the development of future probes inspired by the opioid alkaloids.







Abstract
The opioids are powerful analgesics yet possess contingencies that can lead to opioid&#8208;use disorder. Chemical probes derived from the opioid alkaloids can provide deeper insight into the molecular interactions in a cellular context. Here, we designed and developed photo&#8208;click morphine (PCM&#8208;2) as a photo&#8208;affinity probe based on morphine and dialkynyl&#8208;acetyl morphine (DAAM) as a metabolic acetate reporter based on heroin. Application of these probes to SH&#8208;SY5Y, HEK293T, and U2OS cells revealed that PCM&#8208;2 and DAAM primarily localize to the lysosome amongst other locations inside the cell by confocal microscopy and chemical proteomics. Interaction site identification by mass spectrometry revealed the mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein, solute carrier family 25 member 3, SLC25A3, and histone H2B as acylation targets of DAAM. These data illustrate the utility of chemical probes to measure localization and protein interactions in a cellular context and will inform the design of probes based on the opioids in the future.

         <title>A Facile Access to Green Fluorescent Albumin Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adduct (MBHA) derivative bearing a triphenylamine moiety was found to react with human serum albumin (HSA) shifting its emission from the blue to the green&#8208;yellow thus leading to green fluorescent albumin (GFA) derivatives and enlarging the platform of probes for aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescent&#8208;based detection techniques. A possible interaction of MBHA derivative 7 with a lipophilic pocket within the HSA structure was suggested by docking studies. DLS experiments showed that the reaction with HSA induce a conformational change of the protein contributing to the aggregation process of GFA derivatives. The results of investigations on the biological properties suggested that GFA retained the ability of binding drug molecules such as warfarin and diazepam. Finally, cytotoxicity evaluation studies suggested that, although the MBHA derivative 7 at 0.1 &#181;g/mL affected the percentage of cell viability in comparison to the negative control, it cannot be considered cytotoxic, whereas at all the other concentrations &#8805; 0.5 &#181;g/mL resulted cytotoxic at different extent.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activatable Photocaged UNC2025 for Triggering TAM Kinase Inhibition in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photopharmacology is an emerging field that utilizes photo&#8208;responsive molecules to enable control over the activity of a drug using light. The aim is to limit the therapeutic action of a drug at the level of diseased tissues and organs. Considering the well&#8208;known implications of protein kinases in cancer and the therapeutic issues associated with protein kinase inhibitors, the photopharmacology is seen as an innovative and alternative solution with great potential in oncology. In this context, we developed the first photocaged TAM kinase inhibitors based on UNC2025, a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule kinase inhibitor. These prodrugs showed good stability in biologically relevant buffer and rapid photorelease of the photoremovable protecting group upon UV&#8208;light irradiation (&lt;10 min.). These light&#8208;activatable prodrugs led to a 16&#8208;fold decrease to a complete loss of kinase inhibition, depending on the protein and the position at which the coumarin&#8208;type phototrigger was introduced. The most promising candidate was the N,O&#8208;dicaged compound, showing the superiority of having two photolabile protecting groups on UNC2025 for being entirely inactive on TAM kinases. Under UV&#8208;light irradiation, the N,O&#8208;dicaged compound recovered its inhibitory potency in enzymatic assays and displayed excellent antiproliferative activity in RT112 cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational design of a circularly permuted flavin&#8208;based fluorescent protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;based fluorescent proteins are oxygen&#8208;independent reporters that hold great promise for imaging anaerobic and hypoxic biological systems. In this study, we explored the feasibility of applying circular permutation, a valuable method for the creation of fluorescent sensors, to flavin&#8208;based fluorescent proteins. We used rational design and structural data to identify a suitable location for circular permutation in iLOV, a flavin&#8208;based reporter derived from A. thaliana. However, relocating the N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini to this position resulted in a significant reduction in fluorescence. This loss of fluorescence was reversible, however, by fusing dimerizing coiled coils at the new N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini to compensate for the increase in local chain entropy. Additionally, by inserting protease cleavage sites in circularly permuted iLOV, we developed two protease sensors and demonstrated their application in mammalian cells. In summary, our work establishes the first approach to engineer circularly permuted FbFPs optimized for high fluorescence and further showcases the utility of circularly permuted FbFPs to serve as a scaffold for sensor engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;enzymatic derivatization of glycerol&#8208;based oligomers: structural elucidation and potential applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acids&#8208; and peptide&#8208;functionalized glycerol&#8208;based oligoesters synthesized in this work and their potential applications based on the performed derivatization.







Abstract
Switching from oil&#8208;based to bio&#8208;based feedstocks to ensure the green transition to a sustainable and circular future is one of the most pressing challenges faced by many industries worldwide. For the cosmetics and personal and house care industries there is a strong drive to accelerate this transition from the customers that starts favoring the purchase of naturally derived and bio&#8208;degradable products over the traditionally available products. In this work we developed a series of fully biobased macromolecules constituted of a glycerol&#8208;based oligoester backbone. Based on the subsequent derivatization with fatty acids or peptides, the resulting products may find application as emulsifiers, wetting agents, and potential vectors for the delivery of bioactive peptides. All steps of the resulting macromolecules were conducted following the green chemistry principles with no toxic or environmentally damaging compounds that were used in the overall production process.

         <title>Tunable electrospun scaffolds of polyacrylonitrile loaded with carbon nanotubes: from synthesis to biological applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Growing cells in a biomimetic environment is critical for tissue engineering as well for studying the cell biology underlying disease mechanisms. To this aim a range of 3D matrices have been developed, from hydrogels to decellularized matrices. They need to mimic the extracellular matrix to ensure the optimal growth and function of cells. Electrospinning has gained in popularity due to its capacity to individually tune chemistry and mechanical properties and as such influence cell attachment, differentiation or maturation. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) derived electrospun fibres scaffolds have shown exciting potential due to reports of mechanical tunability and biocompatibility. Building on previous work we fabricate here a range of PAN fibre scaffolds with different concentrations of carbon nanotubes. We characterize them in&#8208;depth in respect to their structure, surface chemistry and mechanical properties, using scanning electron microscopy, image processing, ultramicrotomic transmission electron microscopy, x&#8208;ray nanotomography, infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation. Together the data demonstrates this approach to enable finetuning the mechanical properties, while keeping the structure and chemistry unaltered and hence offering ideal properties for comparative studies of the cellular mechanobiology. Finally, we confirm the biocompatibility of the scaffolds using primary rat cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle (A7r5) and myoblast (C2C12) cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Functional Globular &#946;&#8208;Sheet Miniproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not just the beta versions. Miniprotein design has long been dominated by the well&#8208;understood &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil scaffolds. With increasing understanding, globular &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds, which are generally considered to be prone to aggregation, are also becoming accessible. We review the design of &#946;&#8208;hairpins and WW domains and discuss strategies for engineering these scaffolds into receptors, molecular switches and catalysts.







Abstract
The design of discrete &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides is far less advanced than e.&#8201;g. the design of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides. The reputation of &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides as being poorly soluble and aggregation&#8208;prone often hinders active design efforts. Here, we show that this reputation is unfounded. We demonstrate this by looking at the &#946;&#8208;hairpin and WW domain. Their structure and folding have been extensively studied and they have long served as model systems to investigate protein folding and folding kinetics. The resulting fundamental understanding has led to the development of hyperstable &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds that fold at temperatures of 100&#8201;&#176;C or high concentrations of denaturants. These have been used to design functional miniproteins with protein or nucleic acid binding properties, in some cases with such success that medical applications are conceivable. The &#946;&#8208;sheet scaffolds are not always completely rigid, but can be specifically designed to respond to changes in pH, redox potential or presence of metal ions. Some engineered &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides also exhibit catalytic properties, although not comparable to those of natural proteins. Previous reviews have focused on the design of stably folded and non&#8208;aggregating &#946;&#8208;sheet sequences. In our review, we now also address design strategies to obtain functional miniproteins from &#946;&#8208;sheet folding motifs.

         <title>The Impact of Activating Agents on Non&#8208;Enzymatic Nucleic Acid Extension Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension of RNA and DNA reveals an intrinsic battle between fidelity and rate. This review highlights pathways towards the optimization of these reactions to enable rapid, sequence&#8208;specific and scalable RNA and DNA synthesis.







Abstract
Non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension is increasingly being studied for the production of RNA and DNA. These reactions benefit from producing RNA or DNA in an aqueous, protecting group free system, without the need for expensive enzymes. However, these primer extension reactions suffer from a lack of fidelity, low reaction rates, low overall yields, and short primer extension lengths. This review outlines a detailed mechanistic pathway for non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension and presents a review of the thermodynamic driving forces involved in entropic templating. Through the lens of entropic templating, the rate and fidelity of a reaction are shown to be intrinsically linked to the reactivity of the activating agent used. Thus, a strategy is discussed for the optimization of non&#8208;enzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension, providing a path towards cost&#8208;effective in&#8197;vitro synthesis of RNA and DNA.

         <title>Synthesis of Amino Acid&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids and Study of the Role of the Cationic Head Group for Enhanced Drug and Nucleic Acid Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positively charged or basic amino acid&#8208;derived cationic amphiphiles exhibit promising outcomes in drug and nucleic acid delivery. Among these, histidine&#8208;containing amphiphiles demonstrate the highest potential in this regard. Notably, the drug and nucleic acid delivery efficiency of these amphiphiles is directly proportional to the number of histidine moieties incorporated. These findings underscore the significance of histidine&#8208;rich structures in optimizing and enhancing the efficacy of drug and nucleic acid delivery systems.







Abstract
Leveraging liposomes for drug and nucleic acid delivery, though promising due to reduced toxicity and ease of preparation, faces challenges in stability and efficiency. To address this, we synthesized cationic amphiphiles from amino acids (arginine, lysine, and histidine). Histidine emerged as the superior candidate, leading to the development of three histidine&#8208;rich cationic amphiphiles for liposomes. Using the hydration method, we have prepared the liposomes and determined the optimal N/P ratios for lipoplex formation via gel electrophoresis. In vitro transfection assays compared the efficacy of our lipids to Fugene, while MTT assays gauged biocompatibility across cancer cell lines (MDA&#8208;MB 231 and MCF&#8208;7). The histidine&#8208;based lipid demonstrated marked potential in enhancing drug and nucleic acid delivery. This improvement stemmed from increased zeta potential, enhancing electrostatic interactions with nucleic acids and cellular uptake. Our findings underscore histidine&#8216;s crucial role over lysine and arginine for effective delivery, revealing a significant correlation between histidine abundance and optimal performance. This study paves the way for histidine&#8208;enriched lipids as promising candidates for efficient drug and nucleic acid delivery, addressing key challenges in the field.

         <title>Investigating Protein Binding with the Isothermal Ligand&#8208;induced Resolubilization Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal Ligand&#8208;Induced Resolubilization Assay (ILIRA) is a new screening method for identifying protein ligands that relies on differences in solubility between unliganded and liganded proteins under lyotropic stress conditions. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we demonstrate the application of ILIRA to different protein targets and present alternative assay modalities.







Abstract
Target engagement assays typically detect and quantify the direct physical interaction of a protein of interest and its ligand through stability changes upon ligand binding. Commonly used target engagement methods detect ligand&#8208;induced stability by subjecting samples to thermal or proteolytic stress. Here we describe a new variation to these approaches called Isothermal Ligand&#8208;induced Resolubilization Assay (ILIRA), which utilizes lyotropic solubility stress to measure ligand binding through changes in target protein solubility. We identified distinct buffer systems and salt concentrations that compromised protein solubility for four diverse proteins: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), nucleoside diphosphate&#8208;linked moiety X motif 5 (NUDT5), poly [ADP&#8208;ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1), and protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Ligand&#8208;induced solubility rescue was demonstrated for these proteins, suggesting that ILIRA can be used as an additional target engagement technique. Differences in ligand&#8208;induced protein solubility were assessed by Coomassie blue staining for SDS&#8208;PAGE and dot blot, as well as by NanoOrange, Thioflavin T, and Proteostat fluorescence, thus offering flexibility for readout and assay throughput.

The novel N&#8208;[[4&#8208;(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]methyl]&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinemethanamine (L) coordinates Pt(II) and Pd(II) giving two complexes of formula [MLCl2]. The ligand and Pd(II) complex impaired 65&#8201;% and 59&#8201;%, respectively, of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication at the viable concentrations of 50&#8197;&#956;M. In the in&#8197;vitro antitumor evaluation, Pt(II) complex showed significant cytotoxicity with a GI50 of 10&#8197;&#956;M, and no selectivity in the panel of tumor cells evaluated.







Abstract
Pt(II) and Pd(II) coordinating N&#8208;donor ligands have been extensively studied as anticancer agents after the success of cisplatin. In this work, a novel bidentate N&#8208;donor ligand, the N&#8208;[[4&#8208;(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]methyl]&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinemethanamine, was designed to explore the antiparasitic, antiviral and antitumor activity of its Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes. Chemical and spectroscopic characterization confirm the formation of [MLCl2] complexes, where M=Pt(II) and Pd(II). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed a square&#8208;planar geometry for the Pd(II) complex. Spectroscopic characterization of the Pt(II) complex suggests a similar structure. 1H NMR, 195Pt NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS(+) analysis of DMSO solution of complexes indicated that both compounds exchange the chloride trans to the pyridine for a solvent molecule with different reaction rates. The ligand and the two complexes were tested for in&#8197;vitro antitumoral, antileishmanial, and antiviral activity. The Pt(II) complex resulted in a GI50 of 10.5&#8197;&#956;M against the NCI/ADR&#8208;RES (multidrug&#8208;resistant ovarian carcinoma) cell line. The ligand and the Pd(II) complex showed good anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 activity with around 65&#8201;% reduction in viral replication at a concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>How many Mutations are needed to Evolve the Chemical Makeup of a Synthetic Cell?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating new biochemistries in living organisms requires adaptation for learning how to use new resources, a process governed by genetic mutations. When fed with tryptophan analogs, Escherichia coli cells learned to repress their general stress response and other molecular bioprocesses. This discovery creates more opportunities for the incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids with benefits in Xenobiology, Metabolic Engineering and Biocatalysis.







Abstract
The chemical evolution of a synthetic cell endowed with a synthetic amino acid as building block, analog to tryptophan, required the emergence of key mutations in genes involved in, inter alia, the general stress response, amino acid metabolism, stringent response, and chemotaxis. Understanding adaptation mechanisms to non&#8208;canonical biomass components will inform strategies for engineering synthetic metabolic pathways and cells.

         <dc:description>
Saraya and O'Flaherty report the use of a commercially available building block, typically used for chemical phosphorylation, to perform Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis (TOS). The TOS strategy allows the facile preparation of multiple DNA/RNA oligomers separated by a cleavable linker. The immolation of these linkers occurs during the standard ammonium hydroxide deprotection. (designed by Tiffany A. Mills). More information can be found in the Research Article by J. S. Saraya, D.

Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis (TOS) of (chemically modified) DNA and RNA using a commercially available cleavable linker. We show that the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldiethylene linker is effectively incorporated in DNA/RNA sequences, and efficiently cleaved during standard nucleic acid deprotection protocols. Moreover, we utilize our TOS approach to perform ligation experiments to incorporate N3&#8242;&#8594;P5&#8242; phosphoramidate, and pyrophosphate linkages in DNA strands







Abstract
Tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (TOS) is an attractive strategy to increase automated oligonucleotide synthesis efficiency. TOS is accomplished via the introduction of an immolative linker within a single sequence composed of multiple oligonucleotide fragments. Here, we report the use of a commercially available building block, typically utilized for the chemical phosphorylation of DNA/RNA oligomers, to perform TOS. We show that the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldiethylene linker is efficiently self&#8208;immolated during the standard deprotection of DNA and RNA and presents itself as a generalizable methodology for nucleic acid TOS. Furthermore, we show the utility of this methodology by assembling a model siRNA construct, and showcase a template&#8208;directed ligation pathway to incorporate phosphoramidate or pyrophosphate linkages within DNA oligomers.

         <title>Structural&#8208;Functional Correlations between Unique N&#8208;terminal Region and C&#8208;terminal Conserved Motif in Short&#8208;chain cis&#8208;Prenyltransferase from Tomato</title>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the unique N&#8208;terminal region and the C&#8208;terminal conserved RXG motif of neryl diphosphate synthase function with cooperative structural transitions in the dimer. X&#8208;ray crystallography employing massive data collections and a hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a heterogeneity of the active site and polymorphs of substrate binding mode.







Abstract
Neryl diphosphate (C10) synthase (NDPS1), a homodimeric soluble cis&#8208;prenyltransferase from tomato, contains four disulfide bonds, including two inter&#8208;subunit S&#8722;S bonds in the N&#8208;terminal region. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the S&#8722;S bond formation affects not only the stability of the dimer but also the catalytic efficiency of NDPS1. Structural polymorphs in the crystal structures of NDPS1 complexed with its substrate and substrate analog were identified by employing massive data collections and hierarchical clustering analysis. Heterogeneity of the C&#8208;terminal region, including the conserved RXG motifs, was observed in addition to the polymorphs of the binding mode of the ligands. One of the RXG motifs covers the active site with an elongated random coil when the ligands are well&#8208;ordered. Conversely, the other RXG motif was located away from the active site with a helical structure. The heterogeneous C&#8208;terminal regions suggest alternating structural transitions of the RXG motifs that result in closed and open states of the active sites. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the conserved glycine residue cannot be replaced. We propose that the putative structural transitions of the order/disorder of N&#8208;terminal regions and the closed/open states of C&#8208;terminal regions may cooperate and be important for the catalytic mechanism of NDPS1.

This review highlights the key lessons learned on Mo&#8722;Cu interaction in Mo/Cu&#8208;CODH and ORP and how it controls the elevated cellular Cu level involved in WD and cancer through Cu&#8722;TTM therapy.







Abstract
The connection between 3d (Cu) and 4d (Mo) via the &#8220;Mo&#8722;S&#8722;Cu&#8221; unit is called Mo&#8722;Cu antagonism. Biology offers case studies of such interactions in metalloproteins such as Mo/Cu&#8722;CO Dehydrogenases (Mo/Cu&#8722;CODH), and Mo/Cu Orange Protein (Mo/Cu&#8722;ORP). The CODH significantly maintains the CO level in the atmosphere below the toxic level by converting it to non&#8211;toxic CO2 for respiring organisms. Several models were synthesized to understand the structure&#8211;function relationship of these native enzymes. However, this interaction was first observed in ruminants, and they convert molybdate (MoO42&#8722;) into tetrathiomolybdate (MoS42&#8722;; TTM), reacting with cellular Cu to yield biological unavailable Mo/S/Cu cluster, then developing Cu&#8208;deficiency diseases. These findings inspire the use of TTM as a Cu&#8208;sequester drug, especially for treating Cu&#8208;dependent human diseases such as Wilson diseases (WD) and cancer. It is well known that a balanced Cu homeostasis is essential for a wide range of biological processes, but negative consequence leads to cell toxicity.

&lt;p&gt;This review highlights the key lessons learned on Mo&#8722;Cu interaction in Mo/Cu-CODH and ORP and how it controls the elevated cellular Cu level involved in WD and cancer through Cu&#8722;TTM therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between 3d (Cu) and 4d (Mo) via the &#8220;Mo&#8722;S&#8722;Cu&#8221; unit is called Mo&#8722;Cu antagonism. Biology offers case studies of such interactions in metalloproteins such as Mo/Cu&#8722;CO Dehydrogenases (Mo/Cu&#8722;CODH), and Mo/Cu Orange Protein (Mo/Cu&#8722;ORP). The CODH significantly maintains the CO level in the atmosphere below the toxic level by converting it to non&#8211;toxic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for respiring organisms. Several models were synthesized to understand the structure&#8211;function relationship of these native enzymes. However, this interaction was first observed in ruminants, and they convert molybdate (MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) into tetrathiomolybdate (MoS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; TTM), reacting with cellular Cu to yield biological unavailable Mo/S/Cu cluster, then developing Cu-deficiency diseases. These findings inspire the use of TTM as a Cu-sequester drug, especially for treating Cu-dependent human diseases such as Wilson diseases (WD) and cancer. It is well known that a balanced Cu homeostasis is essential for a wide range of biological processes, but negative consequence leads to cell toxicity.

         <title>Tripartite split&#8208;GFP for high throughput screening of small molecules: a powerful strategy for targeting transient/labile interactors like E2&#8208;E3 ubiquitination enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the in cellulo tripartite split&#8208;GFP assay for High Throughput Screening (HTS) of small molecules inhibiting an E2&#8208;E3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction (PPI). E3 and E2 are fused to GFP10 and GFP11 tags. When an E3 and an E2 interact, GFP10 and GFP11 come close together and reconstitute functional GFP. Molecules preventing the E2&#8208;E3 interaction prevent the reconstitution of a functional GFP







Abstract
The search for inhibitors of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an expanding area, due to the crucial role of UPS enzymes in several diseases. The complexity of the UPS and the multiple protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) involved, either between UPS proteins themselves or between UPS components and theirs targets, offer an incredibly wide field for the development of chemical compounds for specifically modulating or inhibiting metabolic pathways. However, numerous UPS PPIs are transient/labile, due the processivity of the system (Ubiquitin [Ub] chain elongation, Ub transfer, etc.). Among the different strategies that can be used either for deciphering UPS PPI or for identifying/characterizing small compounds inhibitors, the split&#8208;GFP approach offers several advantages notably for high throughput screening of drugs. Split&#8208;GFP is based on the principle of protein&#8208;fragment complementation assay (PCA). PCA allows addressing PPIs by coupling each protein of interest (POI) to fragments of a reporter protein whose reconstitution is linked to the interaction of the POI. Here, we review the evolution of the split&#8208;GFP approach from bipartite to tripartite Split&#8208;GFP and its recent applicability for screening chemical compounds targeting the UPS.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Regulators for Gene Switches to Program Mammalian Cell Behaviour</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules have been widely utilized within the synthetic biology community as trigger input for regulating implemented genetic circuit in engineered mammalian cells. Here, we described the most commonly used small molecules and their associated genetic switches, employed to program cell behaviors, particularly within a cell and gene therapy context.







Abstract
Synthetic or natural small molecules have been extensively employed as trigger signals or inducers to regulate engineered gene circuits introduced into living cells in order to obtain desired outputs in a controlled and predictable manner. Here, we provide an overview of small molecules used to drive synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;based gene circuits in mammalian cells, together with examples of applications at different levels of control, including regulation of DNA manipulation, RNA synthesis and editing, and protein synthesis, maturation, and trafficking. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of these small&#8208;molecule&#8208;responsive gene circuits, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of using small molecules as triggers, the mechanisms involved, and the requirements for selecting suitable molecules, including efficiency, specificity, orthogonality, and safety. Finally, we explore potential future directions for translation of these devices to clinical medicine.

         <title>In&#8208;Bridge Stereochemistry: A Determinant of Stapled Peptide Conformation and Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significance of in&#8208;bridge stereochemistry has been underscored as a decisive factor influencing stapled peptides&#8217; &#945;&#8208;helicity, protease resistance, protein&#8208;binding affinity, and various other properties. This aspect introduces fresh opportunities for the innovative design and development of novel peptide tools and therapeutics.







Abstract
Peptide side chain stapling has been proven to be an effective strategy for fine&#8208;tuning peptide properties. This innovative approach leads to the creation of stapled peptides characterized by stabilized &#945;&#8208;helical conformations, enhanced protein&#8208;binding affinity, improved cell permeability, superior enzymatic stability, and numerous other advantages. Extensive research has explored the impact of various stapling bridges on the properties of these peptides, with limited investigation into the influence of bridge chirality, until very recently. In this concise review, we provide a brief overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the stereochemistry within the bridges of stapled peptides, offering insights into the potential applications of chiral bridges in the design and development of stapled peptides.

         <title>Biotin&#8208;based strategies to explore the world of ubiquitin and ubiquitin&#8208;like modifiers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile biotin&#8208;based tools are highlighted here for studying ubiquitin&#8208; and ubiquitin&#8208;like modifications in cells and organisms. These powerful proteomic methods can eventually be coupled with other chemical biology concepts (e.&#8201;g. induced proximity pharmacology, targeted protein degradation, PROTACs, molecular glues, etc.) for addressing specificity and unraveling mechanisms in the complex ubiquitin signaling system.

Abstract
A complex code of cellular signals is mediated by ubiquitin and ubiquitin&#8208;like (Ub/UbL) modifications on substrate proteins. The so&#8208;called Ubiquitin Code specifies protein fates, such as stability, subcellular localization, functional activation or suppression, and interactions. Hundreds of enzymes are involved in placing and removing Ub/UbL on thousands of substrates, while the consequences of modifications and the mechanisms of specificity are still poorly defined. Challenges include rapid and transient engagement of enzymes and Ub/UbL interactors, low stoichiometry of modified versus non&#8208;modified cellular substrates, and protease&#8208;mediated loss of Ub/UbL in lysates. To decipher this complexity and confront the challenges, many tools have been created to trap and identify substrates and interactors linked to Ub/UbL modification. This review focuses on an assortment of biotin&#8208;based tools developed for this purpose (for example BioUbLs, UbL&#8208;ID, BioE3, BioID), taking advantage of the strong affinity of biotin&#8208;streptavidin and the stringent lysis/washing approach allowed by it, paired with sensitive mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based proteomic methods. Knowing how substrates change during development and disease, the consequences of substrate modification, and matching substrates to particular UbL&#8208;ligating enzymes will contribute new insights into how Ub/UbL signaling works and how it can be exploited for therapies.

         <title>Formation of Bridged Disulfide in Epidithiodioxopiperazines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epidithiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) alkaloids possess complex structures and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this concept, we summarize the biosynthesis of &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide bridged ETPs and outline the catalytic machineries for the transannular disulfide construction. This will facilitate the medical and industrial applications of ETPs.







Abstract
Epidithiodioxopiperazine (ETP) alkaloids, featuring a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine core and transannular disulfide bridge, exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. However, the structural complexity has prevented efficient chemical synthesis and further clinical research. In the past few decades, many achievements have been made in the biosynthesis of ETPs. Here, we discuss the biosynthetic progress and summarize them as two comprehensible metabolic principles for better understanding the complex pathways of &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide bridged ETPs. Specifically, we systematically outline the catalytic machineries to install &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208; and &#945;, &#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by flavin&#8208;containing oxygenases. This concept would contribute to the medical and industrial applications of ETPs.

         <title>A Tight Contact: The Expanding Application of Salicylaldehydes in Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylaldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands can bind the protein targets forming imines with lysine&#8208;amino groups. This drug design improves the affinity and selectivity for specific biological targets. Given the abundance of lysine residues in proteins and the reversible covalent (RC) nature of ligand&#8208;protein interaction, SA&#8208;bearing ligands hold significant promise for future pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
The installation of aldehydes into synthetic protein ligands is an efficient strategy to engage protein lysine residues in remarkably stable imine bonds and augment the compound affinity and selectivity for their biological targets. The high frequency of lysine residues in proteins and the reversibility of the covalent ligand&#8208;protein bond support the application of aldehyde&#8208;bearing ligands, holding promises for their future use as drugs. This review highlights the increasing exploitation of salicylaldehyde modules in various classes of protein binders, aimed at the reversible&#8208;covalent engagement of lysine residues.
