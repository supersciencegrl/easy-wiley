         <title>Two&#8208;Step Validation Approach for Tools To Study the DNA Repair Enzyme SNM1A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step validation approach can evaluate metal&#8208;binding groups that are suitable for targeting the active site of the DNA damage&#8208;repair enzyme SNM1A. A fragment&#8208;based screening approach first identified metal&#8208;binding fragments suitable for targeting the enzyme. Effective fragments were then incorporated into oligonucleotides using a CuAAC reaction; the modified oligonucleotides showed effective recognition by SNM1A.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step validation approach to evaluate the suitability of metal&#8208;binding groups for targeting DNA damage&#8208;repair metalloenzymes using model enzyme SNM1A. A fragment&#8208;based screening approach was first used to identify metal&#8208;binding fragments suitable for targeting the enzyme. Effective fragments were then incorporated into oligonucleotides using the copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. These modified oligonucleotides were recognised by SNM1A at &gt;1000&#8208;fold lower concentrations than their fragment counterparts. The exonuclease SNM1A is a key enzyme involved in the repair of interstrand crosslinks, a highly cytotoxic form of DNA damage. However, SNM1A and other enzymes of this class are poorly understood, as there is a lack of tools available to facilitate their study. Our novel approach of incorporating functional fragments into oligonucleotides is broadly applicable to generating modified oligonucleotide structures with high affinity for DNA damage&#8208;repair enzymes.

         <title>Quinolyl&#8208;Based PGM Metallarectangles: Antiproliferative Activity, DNA and BSA Protein Interactions, and a Molecular Docking Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a different angle: We explored the incorporation of a quinolyl motif, ubiquitous to antimalarial chemotherapy, as part of PGM metallarectangles, intending to gain insight into the anticancer properties exemplified by this structure.







Abstract
The increased success of small metal&#8208;containing molecules as pharmaceutical agents has prompted investigations into the pharmacological activity of a different class of metal&#8208;based compounds; supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs). Such complexes have been extensively investigated for their anticancer activity, with many displaying activities comparable or superior to available clinical chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we evaluated a series of quinoline&#8208;containing binuclear complexes and metallarectangles for their in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity in the hormone receptor positive MCF&#8208;7 and triple negative MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cell lines. The preliminary cytotoxic screen, in the MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell line, revealed that the ligand (7&#8208;chloro&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)quinoline, L) and metallarectangle [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(Cp*)}4(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 display superior activity to cisplatin, while [{Ru(p&#8208;cymene)}4(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;C2O4)2(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 was more potent than cisplatin in the triple&#8208;negative MDA&#8208;MD&#8208;231&#8197;cell line. Upon evaluation in a multidose screen, ligand L and metallarectangle [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(Cp*)}4(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 displayed antiproliferative activity almost two&#8208;fold greater than cisplatin in the MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell line, while [{Ru(p&#8208;cymene)}4(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;C2O4)2(&#956;&#8208;L)2](OTf)4 was over two&#8208;times more active than cisplatin in the MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line. Additionally, using the non&#8208;tumorigenic MCF&#8208;12&#8197;A breast epithelial cell line, the compounds demonstrate increased selectivity toward breast cancer cells over non&#8208;tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, investigations into the interactions of ligand L and selected complexes with calf thymus DNA (CT&#8208;DNA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) indicate favourable binding.

         <title>A Hairpin Ribozyme Derived Spliceozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hairpin ribozyme derived spliceozyme supports the removal of a defined segment (intron) out of a parent RNA and ligates the remaining fragments (exons). The intron then acts as a positive regulator of the activity of a bipartite DNAzyme.







Abstract
The vast majority of RNA splicing in today&#8216;s organisms is achieved by the highly regulated and precise removal of introns from pre&#8208;mRNAs via the spliceosome. Here we present a model of how RNA splicing may have occurred in earlier life forms. We have designed a hairpin ribozyme derived spliceozyme that mediates two RNA cleavages and one ligation event at specific positions and thus cuts a segment (intron) out of a parent RNA and ligates the remaining fragments (exons). The cut&#8208;out intron then performs a downstream function, acting as a positive regulator of the activity of a bipartite DNAzyme. This simple scenario shows how small RNAs can perform complex RNA processing dynamics, involving the generation of new phenotypes by restructuring segments of given RNA species, as well as delivering small RNAs that may play a functional role in downstream processes.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted JNK Inhibitor and Its Protective Effect on Parkinson's Disease Phenotypes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of location: P2 specifically inhibited the activation of mitochondrial JNK, but did not affect the activation of nuclear JNK signaling. The mitochondrial&#8208;targeting JNK inhibitor P2 rescued mitochondrial dysfunction and climbing disorder in both cellular and Drosophila Parkinson's disease models and could be a potential therapeutic method for PD.







Abstract
C&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase (JNK) is a key mediator involved in a variety of physiological processes. JNK activation is regulated in a complex manner by upstream kinases and phosphatases, and plays an important role in physiological processes such as the immune response and neuronal function. Therefore, JNK has become a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, arthritis and other diseases. Inhibition of JNK activation in mitochondria holds great potential for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. However, no specific mitochondrial&#8208;targeted JNK inhibitor has been reported. We have developed a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted JNK inhibitor, P2, by linking a mitochondrial&#8208;specific cell&#8208;penetrating peptide to SP600125 (SP), a commercialized specific inhibitor of JNK. We found that P2 specifically inhibited mitochondrial JNK phosphorylation instead of nuclear JNK signaling. Further studies showed that P2 effectively rescued PD phenotypes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, thus indicating that it is a potential therapeutic for PD.

         <title>Definition of an Index Parameter To Screen Highly Functional Enzymes Derived from a Biochemical and Thermodynamic Analysis of Ancestral meso&#8208;Diaminopimelate Dehydrogenases</title>

Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is broadly applied to protein engineering; however, screening highly functional enzymes from the designed sequences remains a time&#8208;consuming task.

Abstract
Sequence&#8208;based protein design approaches are being adopted to generate highly functional enzymes; however, screening the enzymes remains a time&#8208;consuming task. In this study, by analyzing the enzymatic properties of four ancestral meso&#8208;2,6&#8208;diaminopimelate dehydrogenases (AncDAPDHs), AncDAPDH&#8208;N1, &#8208;N2, &#8208;N3, and &#8208;N4, we attempted to define a new index parameter that is helpful for efficiently screening the enzymes. Biochemical and thermodynamic analyses indicated that only AncDAPDH&#8208;N4 exhibited greater thermal stability than and activity similar to those of native DAPDHs. Structural and sequence comparisons between DAPDH from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgDAPDH) and the AncDAPDHs suggested that &#8220;quality of mutations&#8221; is a potential index parameter. In fact, the mutations introduced from CgDAPDH to AncDAPDH&#8208;N4 correlated highly with the mutations accumulated during the evolution process from mesophiles to thermophiles. These results suggest that, although there are several exceptions, the correlation coefficient can be used as an index parameter for screening high&#8208;functioning enzymes from sequence data.

         <title>The Wild&#8208;Type tRNA Adenosine Deaminase Enzyme TadA Is Capable of Sequence&#8208;Specific DNA Base Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The directed evolution of the adenosine deaminase enzyme TadA from an RNA&#8208;editing enzyme to an efficient DNA&#8208;editing enzyme was crucial for the development of the adenine base editor (ABE). Previous experiments showed no detectable DNA&#8208;editing activity by an ABE utilizing wild&#8208;type TadA (ABE0.1), but here we show ABE0.1 is able to edit DNA strictly within TACG motifs. This sequence requirement is partially governed by the C&#8208;terminal &#945;5 helix of TadA, which accumulated many mutations during the directed evolution of TadA. The evolution of TadA to better access adenines within a diverse range of sequences is reflective of the Galapagos finches, which evolved different beak shapes in order to better access the food that was available to them. This cover art shows the protein structures of ecTadA (PDB: 1Z3A) and the evolved TadA8e (PDB: 6VCA), along with two species of Galapagos finches using the different &#945;5 helix structures to access a target adenine within different sequence contexts. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. C. Komor et al.

         <title>Unique Crosslinking Properties of Psoralen&#8208;Conjugated Oligonucleotides Developed by Novel Psoralen N&#8208;Hydroxysuccinimide Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Psoralens and their derivatives have unique crosslinking features to DNA. With the development of psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides (Ps&#8208;Oligos), sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking with target DNA has become achievable. In this study, we developed novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters that allow the introduction of psoralens into any amino&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. We found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide via a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target DNA. We believe our findings are essential information for the development of Ps&#8208;Oligos as novel gene regulation tools. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Yamayoshi et al.

         <title>Glycosphingolipid and Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Affect Each Other in and on the Cell</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double act: Glycosphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositols are compartmentalized in the lipid rafts of the cell membrane to interact with each other and with other molecules and so play a critical role in many biological events.







Abstract
Glycosphingolipid (GSL) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) are the two major glycolipids expressed by eukaryotic cells, and their metabolisms share the same machineries. Moreover, both GSLs and GPI&#8208;anchored proteins (GPI&#8208;APs) are localized in the cholesterol&#8208;rich regions, namely the lipid rafts, of the cell membrane, where many other signaling molecules are compartmentalized as well. Therefore, the interaction between GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs and their interactions with other molecules in the lipid rafts are inevitable. This review is focused on the influences of GSLs and GPI&#8208;APs on each other's biosynthesis, trafficking, cell membrane distribution, and biological functions, such as signal transduction.

         <title>Development of a Novel Tool To Demystify Drug Distribution at Tissue&#8208;Blood Barriers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blood&#8208;tissue barriers directly affect the efficacy and toxicity of small&#8208;molecule drugs, and yet the chemical logic of these barriers remains largely enigmatic. Here we curate/reconcile in&#8208;vivo literature data on 73 drugs across four mouse models of barrier function. This dataset enables visualization and computational analyses on the tissue&#8208;distribution of clinical drugs.







Abstract
Tissue endothelial cells express ABC&#8208;transporter enzymes that change the concentration of small molecules within different tissue compartments. These &#8220;blood&#8208;tissue barriers&#8221; have been shown to directly affect the efficacy and toxicity of anticancer, antimicrobial, psychiatric, and anti&#8208;epileptic drugs. Currently this phenomenon is best studied for the blood&#8208;brain barrier, but remains enigmatic for most other tissues. In addition, canonical pharmacokinetic theory specifically assumes an equal concentration of free drug within all tissue compartments. Inspired by Lipinski's &#8220;rule of 5,&#8221; we here clarify current knowledge on drug&#8211;tissue distribution by: 1)&#8197;curating the in&#8208;vivo literature on 73 drugs across 23 tissues and 2)&#8197;developing two graphical web&#8208;based applications to visually describe and interpret data. These curated in&#8208;vivo dataset and visualization tools enabled us to achieve new insights into the logic of the barrier&#8208;tissue organization and showed remarkable correspondence to whole&#8208;body imaging of radiolabeled molecules.

         <title>Boronic Acid Moieties Stabilize Adhesion of Microalgal Biofilms on Glassy Substrates: A Chemical Tool for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

A biofilm of diatoms microalgae is stably anchored on glassy substrates by covalent boronic acid&#8208;diol condensation: it efficiently bioremediates seawater from heavy metals.







Abstract
Photosynthetic organisms such as diatoms microalgae provide innovative routes to eco&#8208;friendly technologies for environmental pollution bioremediation. Living diatoms are capable to incorporate in&#8197;vivo a wide variety of chemical species dispersed in seawater, thus being promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly removal of toxic contaminants. However, their exploitation requires immobilization methods that allow to confine microalgae during water treatment. Here we demonstrate that a biofilm of Phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom cells grown on the surface of a glassy substrate bearing boronic acid protruding moieties is stably anchored to the substrate resisting mechanical stress and it is suitable for removal of up to 80&#8201;% metal ions (As, Cr, Cu, Zn, Sn, Pb, Sb) in a model polluted water sample. Control experiments also suggest that stabilization of the biofilm adhesion occurs by interaction of boronic acid surface groups of the substrate with the hydroxyl groups of diatoms extracellular polysaccharides.

Living diatoms are capable to incorporate &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; a wide variety of chemical species dispersed in seawater, thus being promising candidates for eco-friendly removal of toxic contaminants. However, their exploitation requires immobilization methods that allow to confine microalgae during water treatment. Here we demonstrate that a biofilm of &lt;i&gt;Phaeodactylum tricornutum&lt;/i&gt; diatom cells grown on the surface of a glassy substrate bearing boronic acid protruding moieties is stably anchored to the substrate resisting mechanical stress and it is suitable for removal of up to 80&#8201;% metal ions (As, Cr, Cu, Zn, Sn, Pb, Sb) in a model polluted water sample. Control experiments also suggest that stabilization of the biofilm adhesion occurs by interaction of boronic acid surface groups of the substrate with the hydroxyl groups of diatoms extracellular polysaccharides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Metabolite Interactions: Discovery and Significance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of protein function upon metabolite binding is a key mechanism driving cellular physiology. In this review, we examine major technological advances that have enabled the discovery of global cellular metabolite&#8208;interacting proteomes with special emphasis on mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomic platforms, and discuss the ramifications of these discoveries on drug development.







Abstract
Metabolites orchestrate cellular processes as either substrates, co&#8208;enzymes, inhibitors, or activators of cellular proteins such as enzymes and receptors. Although traditional biochemical and structural biology&#8208;based approaches have been successfully employed for the discovery of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions, they often fail to detect transient and low&#8208;affinity biomolecular relationships. Another limitation of these approaches is that they are performed under in vitro conditions lacking the physiological context. Recently developed mass spectrometry&#8208;based methodologies overcome both these shortcomings, and have resulted in the discovery of global protein&#8208;metabolite cellular interaction networks. Herein, we describe traditional and modern approaches for the discovery of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions, and discuss the impact of these discoveries on our understanding of cellular physiology and on drug development.

         <title>Deciphering the Mechanistic Basis for Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Although rarely used in nature, fluorine has emerged as an important elemental ingredient in the design of engineered proteins. Adding to the molecular modification toolbox, here we report the ability of privileged perfluorinated amphiphiles to noncovalently decorate proteins to alter their conformational plasticity and potentiate their dispersion into fluorous phases.







Abstract
Although rarely used in nature, fluorine has emerged as an important elemental ingredient in the design of proteins with altered folding, stability, oligomerization propensities, and bioactivity. Adding to the molecular modification toolbox, here we report the ability of privileged perfluorinated amphiphiles to noncovalently decorate proteins to alter their conformational plasticity and potentiate their dispersion into fluorous phases. Employing a complementary suite of biophysical, in&#8208;silico and in&#8208;vitro approaches, we establish structure&#8208;activity relationships defining these phenomena and investigate their impact on protein structural dynamics and intracellular trafficking. Notably, we show that the lead compound, perfluorononanoic acid, is 106 times more potent in inducing non&#8208;native protein secondary structure in select proteins than is the well&#8208;known helix inducer trifluoroethanol, and also significantly enhances the cellular uptake of complexed proteins. These findings could advance the rational design of fluorinated proteins, inform on potential modes of toxicity for perfluoroalkyl substances, and guide the development of fluorine&#8208;modified biologics with desirable functional properties for drug discovery and delivery applications.

         <title>Taking Synthetic Biology to the Seas: From Blue Chassis Organisms to Marine Aquaforming</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marine bacteria have recently been established as chassis organisms for synthetic biology. Their unique capabilities for sustainable bioproduction and large&#8208;scale bioremediation are summarized in this review, and recent advances in genetic tool development, use of marine raw materials, and emerging technologies for aquaforming are highlighted.







Abstract
Oceans cover 71&#8201;% of Earth's surface and are home to hundreds of thousands of species, many of which are microbial. Knowledge about marine microbes has strongly increased in the past decades due to global sampling expeditions, and hundreds of detailed studies on marine microbial ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry. However, the translation of this knowledge into biotechnological applications or synthetic biology approaches using marine microbes has been limited so far. This review highlights key examples of marine bacteria in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and outlines possible future work based on the emerging marine chassis organisms Vibrio natriegens and Halomonas bluephagenesis. Furthermore, the valorization of algal polysaccharides by genetically enhanced microbes is presented as an example of the opportunities and challenges associated with blue biotechnology. Finally, new roles for marine synthetic biology in tackling pressing global challenges, including climate change and marine pollution, are discussed.

         <title>Light Chain Q166C Mutation Permits One&#8208;step Site Specific Conjugation on Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When engineered cysteines are used for site&#8208;specific conjugation in antibody&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC) development, the sulfhydryl groups on the engineered cysteines are mostly in an oxidized form post cell culture process. In this study, we screened for potential cysteine mutation sites in the constant region of bevacizumab heavy and light chains to identify mutation sites where engineered cysteine can maintain its free thiol group during the cell culture and purification process, enabling single&#8208;step site&#8208;specific conjugation. Q166C mutation in the light chain (Ava&#8208;166C) was identified that showed high free thiol ratio upon cell culture and subsequent purification and a nearly complete conjugation of two Ang&#8208;2 binding peptides on bevacizumab (one on each light chain) can be achieved. The mutation has no negative impact on the binding of bevacizumab to VEGF. The bispecific antibody&#8208;peptide, named Ava&#8208;Plus, showed high affinity to both VEGF and Ang&#8208;2 and higher activity than bevacizumab and/or the anti&#8208;Ang&#8208;2 peptide to neutralize VEGF and Ang&#8208;2, which promote the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In in&#8197;vivo experiments, Ava&#8208;Plus showed strong anti&#8208;angiogenesis effects on chicken chorioallantoic membrane and higher anti&#8208;tumor activity than bevacizumab and Ava&#8208;166C in a COLO 205 human colorectal tumor cell xenograft model in mice. Meanwhile, lower CD31, an angiogenesis indicator, expression in Ava&#8208;Plus treated tissue was observed. The Q166C mutation holds the potential to be generally applied to all antibodies with kappa light chains.







Abstract
Engineered cysteines are frequently used for site&#8208;specific conjugation in antibody&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC) development. When cysteine&#8208;engineered mAbs are produced in the cell culture process, the sulfhydryl groups on the engineered cysteines are mostly in an oxidized form. The oxidized cysteines require multiple steps (such as reduction, reoxidation, and buffer exchanges) to reactivate for bioconjugation, which complicates the ADC production process and reduces yields. In this study, we identified a Q166C mutation in the light chain that allows the presence of free sulfhydryl groups during cell culture and purification process. This mutation is in the constant region and away from sites involved in antigen binding or Fc&#8208;mediated functions. The free sulfhydryl reacts readily with maleimide in a mild solution at a high conjugation rate. This is only the second such site reported (the first one is Q124C in the light chain). Using the Q166C mutation, we conjugated an anti&#8208;angiopoietin&#8208;2 (Ang&#8208;2) peptide on bevacizumab, an anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, to construct a peptide antibody conjugate, Ava&#8208;Plus, which could block two pro&#8208;angiogenic factors simultaneously. Ava&#8208;Plus showed high affinity for both VEGF and Ang&#8208;2 and demonstrated higher activity than bevacizumab in in&#8197;vitro cell migration and in&#8197;vivo mouse xenograft models.

         <title>Quantum Computing for Molecular Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A road map for quantum computing in molecular biology with a potentially ground&#8208;breaking quantum advantage is presented. Key concepts are introduced to connect the terminology of biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science that are all relevant for this transdisciplinary endeavor. Molecular simulations of biochemical reactions are the most promising target, but quantum computing might also benefit data&#8208;driven approaches and structure prediction of biomacromolecules.







Abstract
Molecular biology and biochemistry interpret microscopic processes in the living world in terms of molecular structures and their interactions, which are quantum mechanical by their very nature. Whereas the theoretical foundations of these interactions are well established, the computational solution of the relevant quantum mechanical equations is very hard. However, much of molecular function in biology can be understood in terms of classical mechanics, where the interactions of electrons and nuclei have been mapped onto effective classical surrogate potentials that model the interaction of atoms or even larger entities. The simple mathematical structure of these potentials offers huge computational advantages; however, this comes at the cost that all quantum correlations and the rigorous many&#8208;particle nature of the interactions are omitted. In this work, we discuss how quantum computation may advance the practical usefulness of the quantum foundations of molecular biology by offering computational advantages for simulations of biomolecules. We not only discuss typical quantum mechanical problems of the electronic structure of biomolecules in this context, but also consider the dominating classical problems (such as protein folding and drug design) as well as data&#8208;driven approaches of bioinformatics and the degree to which they might become amenable to quantum simulation and quantum computation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular biology and biochemistry interpret microscopic processes in the living world in terms of molecular structures and their interactions, which are quantum mechanical by their very nature. Whereas the theoretical foundations of these interactions are well established, the computational solution of the relevant quantum mechanical equations is very hard. However, much of molecular function in biology can be understood in terms of classical mechanics, where the interactions of electrons and nuclei have been mapped onto effective classical surrogate potentials that model the interaction of atoms or even larger entities. The simple mathematical structure of these potentials offers huge computational advantages; however, this comes at the cost that all quantum correlations and the rigorous many-particle nature of the interactions are omitted. In this work, we discuss how quantum computation may advance the practical usefulness of the quantum foundations of molecular biology by offering computational advantages for simulations of biomolecules. We not only discuss typical quantum mechanical problems of the electronic structure of biomolecules in this context, but also consider the dominating classical problems (such as protein folding and drug design) as well as data-driven approaches of bioinformatics and the degree to which they might become amenable to quantum simulation and quantum computation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fusion Enzymes Involved in Biosynthetic Tailoring Reactions in Fungi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion enzymes are single proteins consisting of two or more functional domains, which have been increasingly reported from the biosynthesis of fungal natural products. This concept provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date summary of the characterized fusion enzymes responsible for catalyzing biosynthetic tailoring reactions in fungi.







Abstract
Enzyme fusion, the fusion of enzymes with different domains to a single protein, has been widely recognized as a promising strategy in the development of biocatalysts. Nature has evolved gene fusion to combine different catalytic enzymes to function as a fusion enzyme, and this strategy is utilized in many natural product biosynthetic pathways. Owing to rapid advances in genome sequencing and biosynthetic pathway characterization, there is increasing interest in fusion enzymes from fungal biosynthetic pathways, particularly those involved in tailoring steps. This concept aims to provide an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of fusion enzymes that catalyze tailoring reactions in the biosynthesis of fungal secondary metabolites. Since fungal fusion enzymes are often associated with novel metabolites, this pioneering work may stimulate the exploration of the structural diversity of fungal natural products through genome mining of the untapped biosynthetic pathways involving fusion enzymes.

         <title>Advances in Synthetic Biology of Fungi and Contributions to the Discovery of New Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput activation of cryptic BGCs. Putative biosynthetic gene clusters can be identified by screening all available fungal genomes. The relevant genes are then assembled to promote simultaneous expression of the involved genes. Plasmids are transferred into chassis organisms, and positive colonies are cultivated to identify new metabolites.







Abstract
The sequencing of fungal genomes is becoming increasingly accessible, with a wealth of data already available. In parallel, the prediction of the putative biosynthetic pathways responsible for the synthesis of potential new natural products is also increasing. The difficulty of translating computational analyses into available compounds is becoming evident, slowing down a process that was thought to be faster with the advent of the genomic era. Advances in gene techniques made it possible to genetically modify a wider range of organisms, including fungi typically considered recalcitrant to DNA manipulation. However, the possibility of screening many gene cluster products for new activities in a high&#8208;throughput manner remains unfeasible. Nonetheless, some updates on the synthetic biology of fungi could provide interesting insights that could help to achieve this goal in the future.

         <title>Protein Ligation&#8208;Assisted Reconstitution of Split HRP Fragments for Facile Production of HRP Fusion Proteins in E.&#8197;coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a split protein system and protein ligation using SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry enables the efficient production of covalently reconstituted, biologically functional HRP&#8208;fusion proteins. This strategy can facilitate the construction of various kinds of stable bio&#8208;composites based on split protein fragments in an irreversible manner.







Abstract
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is a pivotal biocatalyst for biosensor development and fine chemical synthesis. HRP proteins are mostly extracted and purified from the roots of horseradish because the solubility and productivity of recombinant HRP in bacteria are significantly low. In this study, we investigate the reconstitution system of split HRP fragments to improve its soluble expression levels in E.&#8197;coli allowing the cost&#8208;effective production of bioactive HRPs. To promote the effective association between two HRP fragments (HRPn and HRPc), we exploit SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry, a versatile protein coupling method with high affinity and selectivity. Each HRP fragment was genetically fused with SpyTag and SpyCatcher, respectively, exhibiting soluble expression in the E.&#8197;coli cytoplasm. The engineered split HRPs were effectively and irreversibly reconstituted into a biologically active and stable assembly that can catalyze intrinsic enzymatic reactions. Compared to the chaperone co&#8208;expression system, our approach shows that the production yield of soluble HRP is comparable, but the purity of the final product is relatively high. Therefore, our results can be applied to the high&#8208;yield production of recombinant HRP variants and other difficult&#8208;to&#8208;express proteins in bacteria without complex downstream processes.

         <title>Bioinformatic Analysis of Immobilized Enzymes: Towards a Better Understanding of The Guiding Forces</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deciphering enzyme immobilization: Using bioinformatic tools in a case&#8208;by&#8208;case study of immobilized enzymes, allows rational decision making to be applied to a process currently linked to a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Here, we apply these tools to rationalize and investigate the guiding forces that affect a set of enzymes during their immobilization.







Abstract
Protein bioinformatics has been applied to a myriad of opportunities in biocatalysis from enzyme engineering to enzyme discovery, but its application in enzyme immobilization is still very limited. Enzyme immobilization brings clear advantages in terms of sustainability and cost&#8208;efficiency but is still limited in its implementation. This, because it is a technique that remains tied to a quasi&#8208;blind protocol of trial and error, and therefore, is regarded as a time&#8208;intensive and costly approach. Here, we present the use of a set of bioinformatic tools to rationalize the results of protein immobilization that have been previously described. The study of proteins with these new tools allows the discovery of key driving forces in the process of immobilization that explain the obtained results, moving us a step closer to the final goal: predictive enzyme immobilization protocols.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Investigation of Foldamer&#8208;Based Iodine&#8208;Supported Artificial Glycosidases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>

Ersatz enzyme: A foldamer was found to be highly efficient at hydrolysing ethers and glycoside carbohydrates in the presence of iodine at room temperature. The backbone conformation of the enzyme mimetic remains almost unchanged after the glycosidase reaction.







Abstract
Glycosidases are a type of enzyme that hydrolytically cleave carbohydrates and form glycans for biologically important processes. The inadequacies of glycosidases or their genetic abnormalities are responsible for various diseases. Thus, the development of glycosidase mimetics is of great importance. We have designed and synthesized an enzyme mimetic containing l&#8208;phenylalanine, &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), l&#8208;leucine, and m&#8208;Nifedipine. From X&#8208;ray crystallography, the foldamer adopts a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation stabilized by two 10&#8208;member and one 18&#8208;member NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the foldamer was found to be highly efficient in hydrolysing ethers and glycosides in the presence of iodine at room temperature. Further, X&#8208;ray analysis shows the backbone conformation of the enzyme mimetic to be almost unchanged after the glycosidase reaction. This is the first example of iodine&#8208;supported artificial glycosidase activity with an enzyme mimic at ambient conditions.

         <title>Differential Chemoproteomics Reveals MARK2/3 as Cell Migration&#8208;Relevant Targets of the ALK Inhibitor Brigatinib</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting two hallmarks: In addition to inhibiting cancer cell viability, some targeted drugs can also affect cell migration. Using differential quantitative chemoproteomics we identified cross&#8208;phenotype polypharmacology of the clinical ALK inhibitor brigatinib, which kills EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;positive lung cancer cells through inhibition of ALK and inhibits cancer cell migration through targeting MARK2/3.







Abstract
Metastasis poses a major challenge in cancer management, including EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;rearranged non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As cell migration is a critical step during metastasis, we assessed the anti&#8208;migratory activities of several clinical ALK inhibitors in NSCLC cells and observed differential anti&#8208;migratory capabilities despite similar ALK inhibition, with brigatinib displaying superior anti&#8208;migratory effects over other ALK inhibitors. Applying an unbiased in&#8197;situ mass spectrometry&#8208;based chemoproteomics approach, we determined the proteome&#8208;wide target profile of brigatinib in EML4&#8208;ALK+ NSCLC cells. Dose&#8208;dependent and cross&#8208;competitive chemoproteomics suggested MARK2 and MARK3 as relevant brigatinib kinase targets. Functional validation showed that combined pharmacological inhibition or genetic modulation of MARK2/3 inhibited cell migration. Consistently, brigatinib treatment induced inhibitory YAP1 phosphorylation downstream of MARK2/3. Collectively, our data suggest that brigatinib exhibits unusual cross&#8208;phenotype polypharmacology as, despite similar efficacy for inhibiting EML4&#8208;ALK&#8208;dependent cell proliferation as other ALK inhibitors, it more effectively prevented migration of NSCLC cells due to co&#8208;targeting of MARK2/3.

         <title>Incorporating a Polyethyleneglycol Linker to Enhance the Hydrophilicity of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Triphenylphosphonium Constructs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation is widely used for selective delivery of compounds into mitochondria. This study demonstrated that the replacement of an alkyl chain with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain in TPP&#8208;conjugated compounds can reduce the membrane adsorption of the compounds, leading to fine&#8208;tuning of mitochondria targeting strategies.







Abstract
The targeting of bioactive molecules and probes to mitochondria can be achieved by coupling to the lipophilic triphenyl phosphonium (TPP) cation, which accumulates several hundred&#8208;fold within mitochondria in response to the mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#968;m). Typically, a simple alkane links the TPP to its &#8220;cargo&#8221;, increasing overall hydrophobicity. As it would be beneficial to enhance the water solubility of mitochondria&#8208;targeted compounds we explored the effects of replacing the alkyl linker with a polyethylene glycol (PEG). We found that the use of PEG led to compounds that were readily taken up by isolated mitochondria and by mitochondria inside cells. Within mitochondria the PEG linker greatly decreased adsorption of the TPP constructs to the matrix&#8208;facing face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. These findings will allow the distribution of mitochondria&#8208;targeted TPP compounds within mitochondria to be fine&#8208;tuned.

Cyclize or diversify. The novel amino acid pCPF is compatible with in&#8197;vitro translation and allows spontaneous macrocyclization with peptides containing cysteine or diversification through its reactivity with thiols.







Abstract
Macrocyclization has proven to be a beneficial strategy to improve upon some of the disadvantages of peptides as therapeutics. Nevertheless, many peptide cyclization strategies are not compatible with in&#8197;vitro display technologies like mRNA display. Here we describe the novel amino acid p&#8208;chloropropynyl phenylalanine (pCPF). pCPF is a substrate for a mutant phenylalanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase and its introduction into peptides via in&#8197;vitro translation leads to spontaneous peptide macrocyclization in the presence of peptides containing cysteine. Macrocyclization occurs efficiently with a wide variety of ring sizes. Moreover, pCPF can be reacted with thiols after charging onto tRNA, enabling the testing of diverse ncAAs in translation. The versatility of pCPF should facilitate downstream studies of translation and enable the creation of novel macrocyclic peptide libraries.

         <title>Efficient Chemical and Enzymatic Syntheses of FAD Nucleobase Analogues and Their Analysis as Enzyme Cofactors

         <dc:description>
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the cofactor version of vitamin B2, is essential for redox reactions in cellular metabolism. Here, we report efficient chemical and enzymatic approaches for the synthesis of FAD nucleobase analogues, their biosynthesis in cellular systems, and finally, their utilization as a catalyst for&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;glutathione reductase.







Abstract
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is an essential redox cofactor in cellular metabolism. The organic synthesis of FAD typically involves coupling flavin mononucleotide (FMN) with adenosine monophosphate, however, existing synthesis routes present limitations such as multiple steps, low yields, and/or difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain starting materials. In this study, we report the synthesis of FAD nucleobase analogues with guanine/cytosine/uracil in place of adenine and deoxyadenosine in place of adenosine using chemical and enzymatic approaches with readily available starting materials, achieved in 1&#8211;3 steps with moderate yields (10&#8211;57&#8201;%). We find that the enzymatic route using Methanocaldococcus jannaschii FMN adenylyltransferase (MjFMNAT) is versatile and can produce these FAD analogues in high yields. Further, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli glutathione reductase is capable of binding and using these analogues as cofactors. Finally, we show that FAD nucleobase analogues can be synthesized inside a cell from cellular substrates FMN and nucleoside triphosphates by the heterologous expression of MjFMNAT. This lays the foundation for their use in studying the molecular role of FAD in cellular metabolism and as biorthogonal reagents in biotechnology and synthetic biology.

         <title>Protein Backbone Alteration in Non&#8208;Hairpin &#946;&#8208;Turns: Impacts on Tertiary Folded Structure and Folded Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone modification in &#946;&#8208;turns is vital in the development of protein mimetics. Prior work has focused on the subset of turns that join strands of a &#946;&#8208;sheet. Here we report the evaluation of complementary strategies that stabilize &#946;&#8208;turns found in other structural contexts. Optimal artificial residue placement in a helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix domain yields variants with folded structure identical to the prototype and improved thermal stability (Tm).







Abstract
The importance of &#946;&#8208;turns to protein folding has motivated extensive efforts to stabilize the motif with non&#8208;canonical backbone connectivity. Prior work has focused almost exclusively on turns between strands in a &#946;&#8208;sheet (i.&#8201;e., hairpins). Turns in other structural contexts are also common in nature and have distinct conformational preferences; however, design principles for their mimicry remain poorly understood. Here, we report strategies that stabilize non&#8208;hairpin &#946;&#8208;turns through systematic evaluation of the impacts of backbone alteration on the high&#8208;resolution folded structure and folded stability of a helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix prototype protein. Several well&#8208;established hairpin turn mimetics are shown detrimental to folded stability and/or hydrophobic core packing, while less&#8208;explored modification schemes that reinforce alternate turn types lead to improved stability and more faithful structural mimicry. Collectively, these results have implications in control over protein folding through chemical modification as well as the design of protein mimetics.

Here we report the evaluation of complementary strategies that stabilize &#946;-turns found in other structural contexts. Optimal artificial residue placement in a helix-loop-helix domain yields variants with folded structure identical to the prototype and improved thermal stability (T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of &#946;-turns to protein folding has motivated extensive efforts to stabilize the motif with non-canonical backbone connectivity. Prior work has focused almost exclusively on turns between strands in a &#946;-sheet (i.&#8201;e., hairpins). Turns in other structural contexts are also common in nature and have distinct conformational preferences; however, design principles for their mimicry remain poorly understood. Here, we report strategies that stabilize non-hairpin &#946;-turns through systematic evaluation of the impacts of backbone alteration on the high-resolution folded structure and folded stability of a helix-loop-helix prototype protein. Several well-established hairpin turn mimetics are shown detrimental to folded stability and/or hydrophobic core packing, while less-explored modification schemes that reinforce alternate turn types lead to improved stability and more faithful structural mimicry. Collectively, these results have implications in control over protein folding through chemical modification as well as the design of protein mimetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Potent Pyrazoline&#8208;Based Covalent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using covalent chemoproteomic strategies, structure&#8208;guided medicinal chemistry, and modular synthesis of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted pyrazolines bearing either chloroacetamide or vinyl sulfonamide cysteine&#8208;reactive warheads, we have discovered nanomolar potency inhibitors against Mpro from not only SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but across many other coronaviruses.







Abstract
While vaccines and antivirals are now being deployed for the current SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic, we require additional antiviral therapeutics to not only effectively combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants, but also future coronaviruses. All coronaviruses have relatively similar genomes that provide a potential exploitable opening to develop antiviral therapies that will be effective against all coronaviruses. Among the various genes and proteins encoded by all coronaviruses, one particularly &#8220;druggable&#8221; or relatively easy&#8208;to&#8208;drug target is the coronavirus Main Protease (3CLpro or Mpro), an enzyme that is involved in cleaving a long peptide translated by the viral genome into its individual protein components that are then assembled into the virus to enable viral replication in the cell. Inhibiting Mpro with a small&#8208;molecule antiviral would effectively stop the ability of the virus to replicate, providing therapeutic benefit. In this study, we have utilized activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;based chemoproteomic approaches to discover and further optimize cysteine&#8208;reactive pyrazoline&#8208;based covalent inhibitors for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro. Structure&#8208;guided medicinal chemistry and modular synthesis of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted pyrazolines bearing either chloroacetamide or vinyl sulfonamide cysteine&#8208;reactive warheads enabled the expedient exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR), yielding nanomolar potency inhibitors against Mpro from not only SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but across many other coronaviruses. Our studies highlight promising chemical scaffolds that may contribute to future pan&#8208;coronavirus inhibitors.

         <title>Toward &#8220;E&#8208;Ring&#8208;Free&#8221; Lamellarin Analogues: Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, several pentacyclic E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarin analogues were prepared using a new facile and straightforward synthetic method based on [3+2] cycloaddition. Their cytotoxicity was assessed in a panel of cancer cell lines in comparison with several hexacyclic lamellarins. E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarins were devoid of cytotoxicity due to their poor solubility in cellular environment.







Abstract
Since the discovery of anticancer properties of a naturally occurring hexacyclic marine alkaloid Lamellarin D, the attempts have been made to prepare its synthetic analogues and elucidate the effects of each structural component on their activity profile. While F&#8208;ring&#8208;free, A&#8208;ring&#8208;free and B&#8208;ring&#8208;open lamellarins are known, E&#8208;ring&#8208;free analogues have never been investigated. In this work, we developed a facile and straightforward synthetic method toward E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarin analogues based on the [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition. For the first time, we prepared several pentacyclic lamellarin analogues without E&#8208;ring in their structure and assessed their cytotoxicity in a panel of cancer cell lines in comparison with several hexacyclic lamellarins. E&#8208;ring&#8208;free lamellarins were devoid of cytotoxicity due to their poor solubility in cellular environment.

         <title>Rapid, Label&#8208;Free Screening of Diverse Biotransformations by Flow&#8208;Injection Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separation not required: Mass spectrometry without prior chromatographic separation, carried out on a single&#8208;quadrupole HPLC&#8208;MS, can be used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of diverse biotransformations. This flow&#8208;injection analysis mass spectrometry (FIA&#8208;MS) approach represents an attractive alternative to more traditional photometric, fluorometric, and chromatographic methods for screening enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening methods combine the advantages of photometric or fluorometric assays and analytical chromatography, as they are reasonably fast (throughput &#8805;1 sample/min) and broadly applicable, with no need for labelled substrates or products. However, the established MS&#8208;based screening approaches require specialised and expensive hardware, which limits their broad use throughout the research community. We show that a more common instrumental platform, a single&#8208;quadrupole HPLC&#8208;MS, can be used to rapidly analyse diverse biotransformations by flow&#8208;injection mass spectrometry (FIA&#8208;MS), that is, by automated infusion of samples to the ESI&#8208;MS detector without prior chromatographic separation. Common organic buffers can be employed as internal standard for quantification, and the method provides readily validated activity and selectivity information with an analytical run time of one minute per sample. We report four application examples that cover a broad range of analyte structures and concentrations (0.1&#8211;50&#8197;mM before dilution) and diverse biocatalyst preparations (crude cell lysates and whole microbial cells). Our results establish FIA&#8208;MS as a versatile and reliable alternative to more traditional methods for screening enzymatic reactions.

         <title>Controlled Release of a Dual Zinc&#8208;Sensing and Gene Regulating Small Molecule from DNA Micelles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>

In this study the small molecule zinc chelator TPEN is given enhanced solubility and therapeutic capabilities through localized delivery by a nucleic acid nanocapsule. The TPEN NAN is shown to successfully suppress Eotaxin, a key chemokine involved in asthma at significantly reduced concentrations.







Abstract
Intracellular zinc ions are essential for various biological cell processes and are often dysregulated in many diseases de&#8208;pending on their location, protein binding affinity, and concentration in the cell. Due to their prevalence in diseases, it is important to not only effectively sense but chelate the often excess amount of zinc in a cell to alleviate further disease progression. N, N, N&#8242;, N&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis (2&#8208;pyridinylmethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine (TPEN) is a selective zinc chelator but its water&#8208;insoluble nature and general cytotoxicity limit its therapeutic potential. To address these challenges, TPEN loaded nucleic acid nanocapsules (TL&#8208;NANs) were synthesized, and its dual ability to sense and suppress zinc levels intracellularly were evaluated. Additionally, TL&#8208;NANs were incubated in lung cells and shown to down regulate Eotaxin, a protein up&#8208;regulated during asthma, at significantly reduced concentrations of TPEN showcasing the therapeutic potential of this drug for asthma.

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;Based Inhibitors of the Peptidoglycan O&#8208;Acetylesterase Ape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehyde&#8208;based inhibitors of the peptidoglycan deacetylase Ape were shown to act as competitive inhibitors with Ki values in the low micromolar range. Reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol abolishes inhibition, suggesting that the binding may involve the formation of a tetrahedral adduct with the active site serine nucleophile.







Abstract
The O&#8208;acetylation of the muramic acid residues in peptidoglycan (PG) is a modification that protects the bacteria from lysis due to the action of lysozyme. In Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, deacetylation is required to allow lytic transglycosylases to promote PG cleavage during cell growth and division. This deacetylation is catalyzed by O&#8208;acetylpeptidoglycan esterase (Ape) which is a serine esterase and employs covalent catalysis via a serine&#8208;linked acyl enzyme intermediate. Loss of Ape activity affects the size and shape of bacteria and dramatically reduces virulence. In this work, we report the first rationally designed aldehyde&#8208;based inhibitors of Ape from Campylobacter jejuni. The most potent of these acts as a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 13&#8197;&#956;M. We suspect that the inhibitors are forming adducts with the active site serine that closely mimic the tetrahedral intermediate of the normal catalytic cycle. Support for this notion is found in the observation that reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol effectively abolishes the inhibition.

         <title>The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;Cluster of HydF is not Required for the Binding and Transfer of the Diiron Site of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial mimic of the [2Fe&#8208;2S]&#8208;precursor was shown to be integrated into variants of HydF from Thermosipho melanesiensis in which the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster was absent. Surprisingly, these semi&#8208;artificial HydF constructs were still able to bind and subsequently transfer the precursor to the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, rendering the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster dispensable for this process.







Abstract
The active site of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases contains a cubane [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster and a unique diiron cluster with biologically unusual CO and CN&#8722; ligands. The biogenesis of this diiron site, termed [2FeH], requires the maturation proteins HydE, HydF and HydG. During the maturation process HydF serves as a scaffold protein for the final assembly steps and the subsequent transfer of the [2FeH] precursor, termed [2FeP], to the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase. The binding site of [2FeP] in HydF has not been elucidated, however, the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster of HydF was considered as a possible binding partner of [2FeP]. By targeting individual amino acids in HydF from Thermosipho melanesiensis using site directed mutagenesis, we examined the postulated binding mechanism as well as the importance and putative involvement of the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster for binding and transferring [2FeP]. Surprisingly, our results suggest that binding or transfer of [2FeP] does not involve the proposed binding mechanism or the presence of a [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;cluster at all.

         <title>Synthesis of Muramyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;Lactam in Spore Peptidoglycan of Clostridioides difficile</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Muramate in the Clostridioides difficile cell&#8208;wall peptidoglycan is converted to muramyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactam on conversion to spores. This transformation is instigated by proteins CwlD, GerS, and PdaA1.







Abstract
Clostridioides difficile is a spore&#8208;forming human pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Infections by this pathogen ensue dysbiosis of the intestinal tract, which leads to germination of the spores. The process of spore formation requires a transition for the cell&#8208;wall peptidoglycan of the vegetative C. difficile to that of spores, which entails the formation of muramyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactam. We describe a set of reactions for three recombinant C. difficile proteins, GerS, CwlD, and PdaA1, with the use of four synthetic peptidoglycan analogs. CwlD and PdaA1 excise the peptidoglycan stem peptide and the acetyl moiety of N&#8208;acetyl muramate, respectively. The reaction of CwlD is accelerated in the presence of GerS. With the use of a suitable substrate, we document that PdaA1 catalyzes a novel zinc&#8208;dependent transamidation/transpeptidation reaction, an unusual reaction that requires excision of the stem peptide as a pre&#8208;requisite.

Backbone modification in &#946;&#8208;turns is vital in the development of protein mimetics. Prior work has focused on the subset of turns that join strands of a &#946;&#8208;sheet. The cover image, rendered in a style inspired by Pittsburgh native Andy Warhol, depicts four modification schemes among a series examined in a helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix domain. Optimal artificial residue placement yields variants of the prototype sequence with native&#8208;like tertiary structure and improved thermal stability.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Ligands: Design, Synthesis and Their Utilization for Optical Assignment of Polymorphic&#8208;Disease&#8208;Associated Protein Aggregates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 24, Issue 11, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformation&#8208;sensitive thiophene&#8208;based ligands have emerged as a class of molecular tools for efficient optical imaging of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates. This review summarizes the design and chemical evolution of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, as well as describes how this class of ligands has been used for fluorescent assignment of polymorphic disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
The development of ligands for detecting protein aggregates is of great interest, as these aggregated proteinaceous species are the pathological hallmarks of several devastating diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In this regard, thiophene&#8208;based ligands have emerged as powerful tools for fluorescent assessment of these pathological entities. The intrinsic conformationally sensitive photophysical properties of poly&#8208; and oligothiophenes have allowed optical assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections, as well as real&#8208;time in&#8197;vivo imaging of protein deposits. Herein, we recount the chemical evolution of different generations of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, and exemplify their use for the optical distinction of polymorphic protein aggregates. Furthermore, the chemical determinants for achieving a superior fluorescent thiophene&#8208;based ligand, as well as the next generation of thiophene&#8208;based ligands targeting distinct aggregated species are described. Finally, the directions for future research into the chemical design of thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can aid in resolving the scientific challenges around protein aggregation diseases are discussed.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Crosslinking Enables Identification of Multivalent Ubiquitin&#8208;Deubiquitylating Enzyme Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ubiquitin (Ub) proteoforms control nearly every aspect of eukaryotic cell biology through their diversity. Inspired by the widely used Ub C&#8208;terminal electrophiles (Ub&#8208;E), here we report the identification of multivalent binding of Ub with deubiquitylating enzymes (Dubs) using genetic code expansion (GCE) and crosslinking mass spectrometry. While the Ub&#8208;Es only gather structural information with the S1 Dub sites, we demonstrate that GCE of Ub with p&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine enables identification of interaction modes beyond the S1 site with a panel of Dubs of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic origin. Collectively, this represents the next generation of Ub&#8208;based affinity probes with a unique ability to unravel Ub interaction landscapes beyond what is afforded by cysteine&#8208;based chemistries.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Structural Tuning Yields Hydrazonyl Sultones for Faster Bioorthogonal Protein Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a series of hydrazonyl sultones (HS) containing an ortho&#8208;CF3 group, a five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered sultone ring, and a varying N&#8208;aryl substituent, and characterization of their aqueous stability and reactivity toward bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) in a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction. To avoid purification of highly polar intermediates, we employed two protecting groups in our synthetic schemes. With optimized reaction conditions, the majority of HS were obtained in moderate to good yields. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of two HS revealed that the partially negative&#8208;charged fluorine atoms in CF3 electrostatically shield the electrophilic nitrile imine (NI) center from a nucleophilic attack, underpinning their extraordinary aqueous stability. In addition, the N&#8208;aryl substituents further modulate HS reactivity and stability, with the electron&#8208;rich six&#8208;membered HS displaying excellent aqueous stability and increased cycloaddition reactivity. The utility of these improved HS reagents was demonstrated through fast and selective modification of a BCNK&#8208;encoded nanobody with second&#8208;order rate constants as high as 1500&#160;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline&#8722;ethanol (9:1), representing the fastest HS&#8722;BCN ligation reported in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Independent Logical Regulation of the Assembly and Disassembly of DNA Polyhedra</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the self&#8208;assembly of DNA nanostructures using rationally designed logic gates is a major goal of dynamic DNA nanotechnology, which could facilitate the development of biomedicine, molecular computation, et al. In previous works, the regulations mostly relied on either toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement or stimuli&#8208;driven conformational switch, requiring elaborately&#8208;designed or specific DNA sequences. Herein, we reported a facile, base&#8208;sequence&#8208;independent strategy for logically controlling DNA self&#8208;assembly through external molecules. The INHIBIT and XOR logic controls over the assembly/disassembly of DNA polyhedra were realized through cystamine (Cyst) and ethylenediamine (EN) respectively, which were further integrated into a half subtractor circuit thanks to the sharing of the same inputs. Our work provides a sequence&#8208;independent strategy in logically controlling DNA self&#8208;assembly, which may open up new possibilities for dynamic DNA nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>The effect of &#947; phosphate modified deoxynucleotide substrates on PCR activity and fidelity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling PCR fidelity is an important issue for molecular biology and high&#8208;fidelity PCR is essential for gene cloning. In general, fidelity control is achieved by protein engineering of polymerases. In contrast, only a few studies have reported controlling fidelity using chemically modified nucleotide substrates. In this report, we synthesized nucleotide substrates possessing a modification on P&#947; and evaluated the effect of this modification on PCR fidelity. One of the substrates, nucleotide tetraphosphate, caused a modest decrease in Taq DNA polymerase activity and the effect on PCR fidelity was dependent on the type of mutation. The use of deoxyadenosine tetraphosphate enhanced the A:T&#8594;G:C mutation dramatically, which is common when using Taq polymerase. Conversely, deoxyguanosine tetraphosphate (dG4P) suppressed this mutation but increased the G:C&#8594;A:T mutation during PCR. Using an excess amount of dG4P suppressed both mutations successfully and total fidelity was improved.</dc:description>

         <title>The evolutionary pattern of cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis provides strategies to produce tropane alkaloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cocaine and hyoscyamine are two tropane alkaloids (TA) from Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae, respectively. These famous compounds possess anticholinergic properties that can be used to treat neuromuscular disorders. While the hyoscyamine biosynthetic pathway has been fully elucidated allowing its de novo synthesis in yeast, the cocaine pathway remained partially elucidated. Recently, the Huang research group has completed the cocaine biosynthetic route by characterizing its two missing enzymes. This allowed transferring this whole pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to achieve cocaine production. In this spotlight, besides highlighting the impact of this discovery, we discuss how TA biosynthesis evolved via the recruitment of two distinct and convergent pathways in Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae. Finally, while enriching our knowledge on TA biosynthesis, this diversification of the molecular actors involved in cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis opens perspectives in metabolic engineering by exploring enzyme biochemical plasticity that can ease and shorten TA pathway reconstitution in heterologous organisms</dc:description>

         <title>Conserved active site architecture between bacterial cellulose and chitin synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large and diverse group of enzymes responsible for catalyzing the formation of a glycosidic bond between a donor molecule, usually a monosaccharide, and a wide range of acceptor molecules, thus, playing critical roles in various essential biological processes. Chitin and cellulose synthases are two inverting processive integral membrane GTs, belonging to the type&#8208;2 family involved in the biosynthesis of chitin and cellulose, respectively. Herein, we report that bacterial cellulose and chitin synthases share an E&#8208;D&#8208;D&#8208;ED&#8208;QRW&#8208;TK common motif spatially co&#8208;localized among distant bacterial evolutionary species despite their low amino acid sequence and structural similarities. This theoretical framework offers a new perspective to the current view that bacterial cellulose and chitin synthases are substrate specific and that chitin and cellulose are organism specific. It lays the ground for future in vivo and in silico experimental assessment of cellulose synthase catalytic promiscuity against uridine diphosphate N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and chitin synthase against uridine diphosphate glucose, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxy Acid Activation in Fungal Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis Assessed by Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fungal cyclodepsipeptides (CDPs) enniatin, beauvericin, bassianolide and PF1022 consist of alternating N&#8208;methylated l&#8208;amino and d&#8208;hydroxy acids. They are synthesized by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). The amino acid and hydroxy acid substrates are activated by adenylation (A) domains. Although various A domains have been characterized thus giving insights into the mechanism of substrate conversion, little is known about the utilization of hydroxy acids in NRPSs. Therefore, we used homology modelling and molecular docking of the A1 domain of enniatin synthetase (EnSyn) to gain insights into the mechanism of hydroxy acid activation. We introduced point mutations into the active site and used a photometric assay to study the substrate activation. The results suggest that the hydroxy acid is selected by interaction with backbone carbonyls rather than by a specific side chain. These insights enhance the understanding of non&#8208;amino acid substrate activation and could contribute to the engineering of depsipeptide synthetases.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Amphiphilic Supramolecular Nanogel: Competent Host for Notably Efficient Lipase Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Water Insoluble Substrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work depicts the development of stable nanogels in aqueous medium that were exploited for efficient surface&#8208;active lipase catalyzed hydrolysis of water insoluble substrates. Surfactant coated gel nanoparticles (neutral NG1, anionic NG2 and cationic NG3) were prepared from peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator (G1, G2 and G3, respectively) at different hydrophilic and lipophilic balance (HLB). Chromobacterium viscosum (CV) lipase activity towards hydrolysis of water insoluble substrates (p&#8208;nitrophyenyl&#8208;n&#8208;alkanoates (C4&#8208;C10)) in presence of nanogels got remarkably improved by ~1.7&#8208;8.0 fold in comparison to that in aqueous buffer and other self&#8208;aggregates. Increase in hydrophobicity of substrate led to notable improvement in lipase activity in hydrophilic domain (HLB&gt;8.0) of nanogels. Micro&#8208;heterogeneous interface of small sized (10&#8208;65 nm) nanogel was found to be an appropriate scaffold for immobilizing surface&#8208;active lipase to exhibit superior catalytic efficiency. Concurrently, the flexible conformation of lipase immobilized in nanogels was reflected in its secondary structure having highest a&#8208;helix content from the circular dichroism spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoradical&#8211;mediated catalyst&#8211;independent protein cross&#8208;link with unusual fluorescence properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;activated modification of natural amino acids has served as lucrative probes for precise mapping of the dynamics, interaction networks, and turnover of cytosolic proteins both in vivo and ex vivo. In our attempts to extend the utility of photoreactive reporters to map the molecular characteristics of vital membrane proteins, we carried out site&#8208;selective incorporation of 7fluoro&#8208;indole in the human mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2 (voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel isoform 2), with the aim of generating Trp&#8211;Phe/Tyr cross&#8208;links. Prolonged irradiation at 282 nm provided us with a surprisingly unusual fluorophore that displayed sizably red&#8211;shifted excitation (&#955;ex&#8208;max=280nm&#8594;360nm) and emission (&#955;em&#8208;max=330nm&#8594;430nm) spectra that was reversible with organic solvents. By measuring the kinetics of the photoactivated cross&#8208;linking with a library of hVDAC2 variants, we demonstrate that formation of this unusual fluorophore is kinetically retarded, independent of tryptophan, and is site&#8208;specific. Using other membrane (Tom40 and Sam50) and cytosolic (MscR and DNA Pol I) proteins, we additionally show that formation of this fluorophore is protein&#8211;independent. Our findings reveal the photoradical&#8211;mediated accumulation of reversible tyrosine cross&#8208;links, with unusual fluorescent properties. Our findings have immediate applications in protein biochemistry and UV&#8211;mediated protein aggregation and cellular damage, opening avenues for formulating therapeutics that prolong cell viability in humans.</dc:description>

         <title>Dispersion function of a protein, DP&#8208;1, identified in Collimonas sp. D&#8208;25, for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collimonas sp. (D&#8208;25), found in the soil of Akita Prefecture, is a gram&#8208;negative bacterium with the ability to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). During the synthesis of AuNPs, one specific protein (DP&#8208;1) was found to have disappeared in the sonicated solution of the bacterium. Recombinant DP&#8208;1 (rDP&#8208;1) from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was used to study the effect of DP&#8208;1 on the synthesis of AuNPs. AuNPs synthesized with rDP&#8208;1 result in small, stabilized nanoparticles. AuNPs synthesized by DP&#8208;1 retained the stability of both the dispersion and nano&#8208;size particles under high salt concentrations. Isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to investigate the bonding ratio of rDP&#8208;1 to AuNPs. Several thousand rDP&#8208;1 proteins are attached to the surface of an AuNP to form a protein corona containing multiple layers. These results suggest that DP&#8208;1 obtained from D&#8208;25 has a size and stability control function during AuNP synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Production of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Hydroxy Acetophenone by Multi&#8208;Enzyme Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biosynthetic route from m&#8208;nitroacetophenone (1a) to 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy acetophenone (1c) via 3&#8208;hydroxy amino acetophenone (1b) using a direct reaction method with three enzymes and supersaturated substrates. Through enzyme molar ratios, expression, and structure optimization, we obtained the optimal mutant with a biosynthetic yield of 580&#8197;mg/L.







Abstract
We developed a synthetic route for producing 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy acetophenone (3AHAP) from m&#8208;nitroacetophenone (3NAP) using an in&#8197;vitro approach. Various reaction systems were evaluated, and a direct reaction method with crude enzyme and supersaturated substrates for optimal catalytic efficiency was chosen. The reaction system included three enzymes and was enhanced by adjusting enzyme molar ratios and optimizing ribosomal binding sites. We performed substrate docking and alanine scanning to identify key sites in the enzymes nitrobenzene nitroreductase (nbzA) and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase (habA). The optimal mutant was obtained through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and incorporated into the reaction system, resulting in increased product yield. After optimization, the yield of 3AHAP increased from 75&#8197;mg/L to 580&#8197;mg/L within 5&#8197;hours, the highest reported yield using biosynthesis. This work provides a promising strategy for the efficient and sustainable production of 3AHAP, which has critical applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Characterization of an Unusual &#945;&#8208;Oxoamine Synthase Off&#8208;Loading Domain from a Cyanobacterial Type I Fatty Acid Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) usually releases its products by hydrolysis or transesterification. Here, an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase off&#8208;loading domain is identified in a cyanobacterial type I FAS. This domain releases the fatty acyl chain by condensing it with L&#8208;serine, thereby representing a novel route to &#945;&#8208;amino ketones.







Abstract
Type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) are known from higher eukaryotes and fungi. We report the discovery of FasT, a rare type I FAS from the cyanobacterium Chlorogloea sp. CCALA695. FasT possesses an unusual off&#8208;loading domain, which was heterologously expressed in E. coli and found to act as an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase (AOS) in&#8197;vitro. Similar to serine palmitoyltransferases from sphingolipid biosynthesis, the AOS off&#8208;loading domain catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen condensation between l&#8208;serine and a fatty acyl thioester. While the AOS domain was strictly specific for l&#8208;serine, thioesters with saturated fatty acyl chains of six carbon atoms and longer were tolerated, with the highest activity observed for stearoyl&#8722;coenzyme A (C18). Our findings suggest a novel route to &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the direct condensation of iteratively produced long&#8208;chain fatty acids with l&#8208;serine by a FAS with a cis&#8208;acting AOS off&#8208;loading domain.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Glycopeptides to Explore the Role of Mucin&#8197;1 Glycosylation in Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of MUC1 glycopeptides was prepared by SPPS implemented by site&#8208;selective chemoenzymatic glycosylation. They were used to investigate the influence of precise MUC1 glycosylation patterns on peptide conformation and on the adhesion of breast cancer cell line MCF&#8208;7. Our studies demonstrate that changes in glycosylation have only small, local effects on peptide structure, while cell&#8208;cell interaction is directly affected by the glycans&#8217; nature and density.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications affect protein biology under physiological and pathological conditions. Efficient methods for the preparation of peptides and proteins carrying defined, homogeneous modifications are fundamental tools for investigating these functions. In the case of mucin&#8197;1 (MUC1), an altered glycosylation pattern is observed in carcinogenesis. To better understand the role of MUC1 glycosylation in the interactions and adhesion of cancer cells, we prepared a panel of homogeneously O&#8208;glycosylated MUC1 peptides by using a quantitative chemoenzymatic approach. Cell&#8208;adhesion experiments with MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells on surfaces carrying up to six differently glycosylated MUC1 peptides demonstrated that different glycans have a significant impact on adhesion. This finding suggests a distinct role for MUC1 glycosylation patterns in cancer cell migration and/or invasion. To decipher the molecular mechanism for the observed adhesion, we investigated the conformation of the glycosylated MUC1 peptides by NMR spectroscopy. These experiments revealed only minor differences in peptide structure, therefore clearly relating the adhesion behaviour to the type and number of glycans linked to MUC1.

         <title>Expression and Characterization of a New Self&#8208;Sufficient P450 Monooxygenase (P450 AZC1) from Azorhizobium caulinodans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The expression conditions of a new self&#8208;sufficient P450 monooxygenase from Azorhizobium caulinodans (P450 AZC1) were optimized for enhanced expression of the P450 content. Furthermore, the purified enzyme is biochemically and bioinformatically characterized to elucidate its industrial potential.







Abstract
Oxyfunctionalization of non&#8208;activated carbon bonds by P450 monooxygenases has drawn great industrial attraction. Self&#8208;sufficient P450s containing catalytic heme and reductase domains in a single polypeptide chain offer many advantages since they do not require external electron transfer partners. Here, we report the first P450 enzyme identified and expressed from Azorhizobium caulinodans. Firstly, expression conditions of P450 AZC1 were optimized for enhanced expression in E.coli. The highest P450 content was obtained in E.coli Rosetta DE3 plysS when it was incubated in TB media supplemented with 0.75&#8197;mM IPTG, 0.5&#8197;mM ALA, and 0.75&#8197;mM FeCl3 at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;hours. Subsequently, the purified enzyme showed a broad substrate spectrum including fatty acids, linear and cyclic alkanes, aromatics, and pharmaceuticals. Finally, P450 AZC1 showed optimal activity at pH&#8197;6.0 and 40&#8201;&#176;C and a broad pH and temperature profile, making it a promising candidate for industrial applications.

         <title>The Wild&#8208;Type tRNA Adenosine Deaminase Enzyme TadA Is Capable of Sequence&#8208;Specific DNA Base Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenine base editors (ABEs) are genome editing tools that convert A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T base pairs to G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C by using an extensively evolved tRNA&#8208;adenosine deaminase enzyme, TadA. Here we show that wtTadA can perform DNA base editing, with a strict sequence motif requirement of TAC. We additionally investigate how the sequence recognition of TadA variants changes as they accumulate mutations to better edit DNA substrates.







Abstract
Base editors are genome editing tools that enable site&#8208;specific base conversions through the chemical modification of nucleobases in DNA. Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T to G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C base pairs in DNA by using an adenosine deaminase enzyme to modify target adenosines to inosine intermediates. Due to the lack of a naturally occurring adenosine deaminase that can modify DNA, ABEs were evolved from a tRNA&#8208;deaminating enzyme, TadA. Previous experiments with an ABE comprising a wild&#8208;type (wt) TadA showed no detectable activity on DNA, and directed evolution was therefore required to enable this enzyme to accept DNA as a substrate. Here we show that wtTadA can perform base editing in DNA in both bacterial and mammalian cells, with a strict sequence motif requirement of TAC. We leveraged this discovery to optimize a reporter assay to detect base editing levels as low as 0.01&#8201;%. Finally, we used this assay along with molecular dynamics simulations of full ABE:DNA complexes to better understand how the sequence recognition of mutant TadA variants change as they accumulate mutations to better edit DNA substrates.

         <title>Curse and Blessing of Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Parts in Computational Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational enzyme design is a cornerstone of rational protein engineering, and a plethora of methods exists. But how do these tools deal with enzymes containing cofactors, nucleic, or non&#8208;canonical amino acids? Here, we review important computational tools and well&#8208;known and less&#8208;documented caveats and remedies in engineering enzymes with non&#8208;proteogenic parts.







Abstract
Enzyme engineering aims to improve or install a new function in biocatalysts for applications ranging from chemical synthesis to biomedicine. For decades, computational techniques have been developed to predict the effect of protein changes and design new enzymes. However, these techniques may have been optimized to deal with proteins composed of the standard amino acid alphabet, while the function of many enzymes relies on non&#8208;proteogenic parts like cofactors, nucleic acids, and post&#8208;translational modifications. Enzyme systems containing such molecules might be handled or modeled improperly by computational tools, and thus be unsuitable, or require additional tweaking, parameterization, or preparation. In this review, we give an overview of common and recent tools and workflows available to computational enzyme engineers. We highlight the various pitfalls that come with including non&#8208;proteogenic compounds in computations and outline potential ways to address common issues. Finally, we showcase successful examples from the literature that computationally engineered such enzymes.

In this review, we give an overview of common and recent tools and workflows available to computational enzyme engineers. We highlight the various pitfalls that come with including non-proteogenic compounds in computations and outline potential ways to address common issues. Finally, we showcase successful examples from the literature that computationally engineered such enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tethered Ribosomes: Toward the Synthesis of Nonproteinogenic Polymers in Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joining ribosomal subunits with a small RNA linker has recently given rise to tethered ribosomes. Their ability to process orthogonal mRNAs (o&#8208;mRNA) independent of endogenous ribosomes allowed the identification of otherwise lethal, gain&#8208;of&#8208;function mutations. Thus, engineering tethered ribosomes promises to significantly expand the scope of building blocks amenable to translation and, ultimately, enable the sequence&#8208;selective synthesis of tailor&#8208;made (bio)polymers.







Abstract
The ribosome is the core element of the translational apparatus and displays unrivaled fidelity and efficiency in the synthesis of long polymers with defined sequences and diverse compositions. Repurposing ribosomes for the assembly of nonproteinogenic (bio)polymers is an enticing prospect with implications for fundamental science, bioengineering and synthetic biology alike. Here, we review tethered ribosomes, which feature inseparable large and small subunits that can be evolved for novel function without interfering with native translation. Following a tutorial summary of ribosome structure, function, and biogenesis, we introduce design and optimization strategies for the creation of orthogonal and tethered ribosomes. We also highlight studies, in which (rational) engineering efforts of these designer ribosomes enabled the evolution of new functions. Lastly, we discuss future prospects and challenges that remain for the ribosomal synthesis of tailor&#8208;made (bio)polymers.

         <title>Systematic Investigation of Metabolic Oligosaccharide Engineering Efficiency in Intestinal Cells Using a Dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;Monosaccharide Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) of intestinal cells and mucous layer using a dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;monosaccharide conjugate. It highlights the potential for using MOE to target azide&#8208;functionalised probes to intestinal tissues for drug delivery applications.







Abstract
Metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) of cells with synthetic monosaccharides can introduce functionality to the glycans of cell membranes. Unnatural sugars (e.&#8201;g., peracetylated mannose&#8208;azide) can be expressed on the cell surface with the azide group in place. After MOE, the azide group can participate in a copper&#8208;free click reaction with an alkyne (e.&#8201;g., dibenzocyclooctyne, DBCO) probe. This allows the metabolic fate of monosaccharides in cells to be understood. However, in a drug delivery context it is desirable to have azide groups on the probe (e.&#8201;g. a drug delivery particle) and the alkyne (e.&#8201;g. DBCO) on the cell surface. Consequently, the labelling efficiency of intestinal cell lines (Caco&#8208;2 and HT29&#8208;MTX&#8208;E12) treated with N&#8208;dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;tetra&#8208;acetylmannosamine, and the concentration&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent labelling were determined. Furthermore, the labelling of mucus in HT29&#8208;MTX&#8208;E12 cells with DBCO was shown. This study highlights the potential for using MOE to target azide&#8208;functionalised probes to intestinal tissues for drug delivery applications.

         <title>Metal Complexes and Nanoparticles for Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imaging techniques are used to identify, localize, and monitor the growth or reduction of cancerous tumors. Among the emerging methods, much research effort has been devoted to photoacoustic imaging. This method effectively combines the benefits of ultrasound and fluorescence imaging while minimizing their respective drawbacks using a light&#8208;in and ultrasound&#8208;out approach. Herein, the fundamental concept, recent advancements, and strategies for contrast agents based on molecular metal complexes or nanoparticles for photoacoustic imaging are reviewed. More information can be found in the Review by Axel Steinbrueck, Johannes Karges.

         <title>Lipase&#8208;mediated conversion of protecting group silyl ethers: An unspecific side reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silyl ether protecting groups are important tools in organic synthesis, ensuring selective reactions of hydroxyl functional groups. Enantiospecific formation or cleavage could simultaneously enable the resolution of racemic mixtures and thus significantly increase the efficiency of complex synthetic pathways. Based on reports that lipases, which today are already particularly important tools in chemical synthesis, can catalyze the enantiospecific turnover of trimethylsilanol (TMS)&#8208;protected alcohols, the goal of this study was to determine the conditions under which such a catalysis occurs. Through detailed experimental and mechanistic investigation, we demonstrated that although lipases mediate the turnover of TMS&#8208;protected alcohols, this occurs independently of the known catalytic triad, as this is unable to stabilize a tetrahedral intermediate. The reaction is essentially non&#8208;specific and therefore most likely completely independent of the active site. This rules out lipases as catalysts for the resolution of racemic mixtures of alcohols through protection or deprotection with silyl groups.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Targeting the protein&#8211;RNA interaction of LIN28 and let&#8208;7 is a promising strategy for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. However, a limited number of small&#8208;molecule inhibitors disrupting the LIN28&#8211;let&#8208;7 interaction with potent efficacy are available. Herein, we developed a novel LIN28&#8208;inhibiting strategy by targeting selective hotspot amino acids at the LIN28&#8211;let&#8208;7 binding interface with small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based bifunctional conjugates. Starting from reported small&#8208;molecule LIN28 inhibitors, we identified a feasible linker&#8208;attachment position after performing a structure&#8208;activity relationship exploration based on LIN28&#8208;targeting chromenopyrazoles. In parallel, a virtual alanine scan identified hotspot residues at the protein&#8211;RNA binding interface, based on which we designed a set of peptides to enhance the interaction with the identified hotspot residues. Conjugation of the tailor&#8208;designed peptides with linker&#8208;attached chromenopyrazoles yielded a series of bifunctional small&#8208;molecule&#8211;peptide conjugates, represented by 83 (PH&#8208;223), as a new LIN28&#8208;targeting chemical modality.

         <title>Hydrogels with reversible cross&#8208;links for improved localised stem cell retention: a review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Successful stem cell applications could significantly impact the medical fields, where many lives are at stake. However, the translation of stem cells to the clinic could be improved by challenges in stem cell transplantation and in vivo retention at the site of tissue damage.&#160; This review aims to provide the most recent insights into developing hydrogels that can deliver, retain, and accommodate stem cells for tissue repair. Hydrogels can be used for tissue engineering as their flexibility and water content makes them excellent substitutes for the native extracellular matrix. Moreover, the mechanical properties of hydrogels are highly tuneable, and recognition moieties to control cell behaviour and fate can quickly be introduced. This review covers the parameters necessary for the physicochemical design of adaptable hydrogels, the variety of (bio)materials that can be used in such hydrogels, their application in stem cell delivery and some recently developed chemistries for reversible cross&#8208;linking. Implementing physical and dynamic covalent chemistry has resulted in adaptable hydrogels that can mimic the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplexes as Key Transcriptional Regulators in Neglected Trypanosomatid Parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article, we discuss the potential roles of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) secondart structures, in modulating the transcriptional control of neglected trypanosomatid parasites, which cause deadly diseases in the poorest populations worldwide. We provide an overview of experimental approaches that can be used to exploit the regulatory roles and relevance of G4s to fight parasitic infections.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid secondary structures that have been linked to the functional regulation of eukaryotic organisms. G4s have been extensively characterised in humans and emerging evidence suggests that they might also be biologically relevant for human pathogens. This indicates that G4s might represent a novel class of therapeutic targets for tackling infectious diseases. Bioinformatic studies revealed a high prevalence of putative quadruplex&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in the genome of protozoans, which highlights their potential roles in regulating vital processes of these parasites, including DNA transcription and replication. In this work, we focus on the neglected trypanosomatid parasites, Trypanosoma and Leishmania spp., which cause debilitating and deadly diseases across the poorest populations worldwide. We review three examples where G4&#8208;formation might be key to modulate transcriptional activity in trypanosomatids, providing an overview of experimental approaches that can be used to exploit the regulatory roles and relevance of these structures to fight parasitic infections.

         <title>Cladosporin, A Highly Potent Antimalaria Drug?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarises recent studies on cladosporin, which is a highly potent inhibitor of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum at the nanomole level that targets lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase. The chemical synthesis, biosynthesis, the synthesis of analogs, the bioactivity and molecular target, and investigations on the structure&#8208;activity relationship are covered.







Abstract
Cladosporin, a unique natural product from the fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides, exhibits nanomolar inhibitory activity against Plasmodium falciparum by targeting its cytosolic lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PfKRS) to inhibit protein biosynthesis. Due to its exquisite selectivity towards pathogenic parasites, cladosporin has become a very promising lead compound for developing antiparasitic drugs to treat drug&#8208;resistant malaria and cryptosporidiosis infections. Here we review the recent research progress of cladosporin covering aspects of the chemical synthesis, biosynthesis, bioactivity, cellular target and structure&#8211;activity relationship.

         <title>Unique Crosslinking Properties of Psoralen&#8208;Conjugated Oligonucleotides Developed by Novel Psoralen N&#8208;Hydroxysuccinimide Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides developed by novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters, we found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide via a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target double&#8208;stranded DNA.







Abstract
Psoralens and their derivatives, such as trioxsalen, have unique crosslinking features to DNA. However, psoralen monomers do not have sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking ability with the target DNA. With the development of psoralen&#8208;conjugated oligonucleotides (Ps&#8208;Oligos), sequence&#8208;specific crosslinking with target DNA has become achievable, thereby expanding the application of psoralen&#8208;conjugated molecules in gene transcription inhibition, gene knockout, and targeted recombination by genome editing. In this study, we developed two novel psoralen N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters that allow the introduction of psoralens into any amino&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. Quantitative evaluation of the photo&#8208;crosslinking efficiencies of the Ps&#8208;Oligos to target single&#8208;stranded DNAs revealed that the crosslinking selectivity to 5&#8208;mC is the unique feature of trioxsalen. We found that the introduction of an oligonucleotide via a linker at the C&#8208;5 position of psoralen can promote favorable crosslinking to target double&#8208;stranded DNA. We believe our findings are essential information for the development of Ps&#8208;Oligos as novel gene regulation tools.

Seek a cell anchorage galectin bridge: Transforming the wildtype Galectin (Gal)&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 to a tandem&#8208;repeat type variant via rational protein engineering enhanced cis&#8208;binding activity with O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptides of &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan (DG). Furthermore, the Gal&#8208;1 variants (but not Gal&#8208;3 variants) demonstrated trans&#8208;bridging activity with the prepared &#945;&#8208;DG core&#8208;M1 glycoconjugates and laminins in situ via the carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Thus, Gal&#8208;1 and its variants are exciting candidates for treating several forms of muscular dystrophy. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kaltner, H.

         <title>HaloTag&#8208;Based Reporters for Fluorescence Imaging and Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;labelling HaloTag offers a unique opportunity to generate imaging tools leveraging the excellent properties of small&#8208;molecule dyes. Synthetic chemistry and protein engineering offer complementary strategies to optimize these optical reporters and tailor them to specific applications. Here, we review molecular probes for fluorescence imaging and biosensing based on HaloTag, highlighting recent developments and emerging engineering strategies.







Abstract
Visualizing the structure and dynamics of biomolecules is critical to understand biological function, and requires methods to fluorescently label targets of interest in their cellular context. Self&#8208;labelling proteins, which combine a genetically encoded tag with a small&#8208;molecule fluorophore, have attracted considerable attention for this purpose, as they can overcome limitations of fluorescent proteins. Among them, the HaloTag protein is the most broadly used, showing fast specific labelling with a small, easy to functionalize and cell&#8208;permeant ligand. Synthetic chemistry and protein engineering have provided a portfolio of powerful imaging tools exploiting HaloTag, along with general methods to optimize and adapt them to specific applications. Here, we provide an overview of fluorescent reporters based on the HaloTag protein for imaging and biosensing, highlighting engineering strategies and general applications.

         <title>Serum&#8208;based detection of liver pathology using a fluorogenic alkaline phosphatase probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of &#8220;ultrahigh contrast&#8221; fluorogenic probes for trapping alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in human serum is highly desirable for clinical auxiliary diagnosis for hepatobiliary diseases. However, the intrinsic dilemma of incomplete ionization of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)&#8208;based ALP fluorophores and autofluorescence interference of serum result in low sensitivity and accuracy. Given that unique halogen effects could lead to a drastic decrease in the pKa value and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield, herein we report an enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared probe based on a difluoro&#8208;substituted dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;chromene for achieving fluorescent quantification of human serum ALP. Rational design strategy is demonstrated by altering the substituted halogen groups to well regulate the pKa for meeting the physiological precondition. Owing to the complete ionization at pH 7.4 with tremendous fluorescence enhancement, the difluoro&#8208;substituted DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP manifests a linear relationship between the emission intensity and ALP concentration in both solution and serum samples. Along with measuring 77 human serum samples, the DCM&#8208;2F&#8208;HP based fluorescence method not only exhibits significant correlations with clinical colorimetry, but also distinguishes ALP patients from healthy volunteers, as well as assessing the progress of liver disease, thus providing a potential toolbox for quantitatively detecting ALP and warning the stage of hepatopathy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Development of &#8220;ultrahigh contrast&#8221; fluorogenic probes for trapping alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in human serum is highly desirable for clinical auxiliary diagnosis for hepatobiliary diseases. However, the intrinsic dilemma of incomplete ionization of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)-based ALP fluorophores and autofluorescence interference of serum result in low sensitivity and accuracy. Given that unique halogen effects could lead to a drastic decrease in the pKa value and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield, herein we report an enzyme-activatable near-infrared probe based on a difluoro-substituted dicyanomethylene-4H-chromene for achieving fluorescent quantification of human serum ALP. Rational design strategy is demonstrated by altering the substituted halogen groups to well regulate the pKa for meeting the physiological precondition. Owing to the complete ionization at pH 7.4 with tremendous fluorescence enhancement, the difluoro-substituted DCM-2F-HP manifests a linear relationship between the emission intensity and ALP concentration in both solution and serum samples. Along with measuring 77 human serum samples, the DCM-2F-HP based fluorescence method not only exhibits significant correlations with clinical colorimetry, but also distinguishes ALP patients from healthy volunteers, as well as assessing the progress of liver disease, thus providing a potential toolbox for quantitatively detecting ALP and warning the stage of hepatopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Secondary Structure Motifs through Photo&#8208;labile Peptide Staples</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are facilitated by the well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structure of bioactive peptides, interesting compounds for the development of new therapeutic agents. Their secondary structure and thus their propensity to engage in PPIs can be influenced by the introduction of peptide staples on the side chains. In particular, light&#8208;controlled staples based on azobenzene photoswitches and their structural influence on helical peptides have been studied extensively. In contrast, photolabile staples bearing photocages as a structural key motif, have mainly been used to block supramolecular interactions. Their influence on the secondary structure of the target peptide is under&#8208;investigated. Thus, in this study we use a combination of spectroscopic techniques and in silico simulations to systematically study a series of helical peptides with varying length of the photo&#8208;labile staple to obtain a detailed insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship in such photoresponsive biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1916 is an Acetyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isocitrate lyase (ICL) isoform 2 is an essential enzyme for some clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains during infection. In the laboratory Mtb strain H37Rv, the icl2 gene encodes two distinct gene products &#8211; Rv1915 and Rv1916 &#8211; due to a frameshift mutation. This study aims to characterise these two gene products to understand their structure and function. While we were unable to produce Rv1915 recombinantly, soluble Rv1916 was obtained with sufficient yield for characterisation. Kinetic studies using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometry and 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy showed that recombinant Rv1916 does not possess isocitrate lyase activity, while waterLOGSY binding experiments demonstrated that it could bind acetyl&#8208;CoA. Finally, X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed structural similarities between Rv1916 and the C&#8208;terminal domain of ICL2. &#160;Considering the probable differences between full&#8208;length ICL2 and the gene products Rv1915 and Rv1916, care must be taken when using Mtb H37Rv as a model organism to study central carbon metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Multifunctional Chemotherapeutic Prodrugs for Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescence Imaging&#8208;guided Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional chemotherapeutic prodrugs that possess an effective combination of tumor targeting capability, activable chemotherapeutic activity, photodynamic therapy (PDT) assistance and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) guidance are desirable to be engineered for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery, distribution, and synergistic chemo&#8208;PDT in cancer treatment.







Abstract
Conventional chemotherapy (CT) is associated with severe side effects and inducible resistance, making it difficult to meet clinical requirements, forcing the development of new multifunctional prodrugs for precision medicine. In recent decades, researchers and clinicians have focused on developing of multifunctional chemotherapeutic prodrugs with tumor&#8208;targeting capability, activatable and traceable chemotherapeutic activity, as a powerful tool to improve theranostic outcomes in cancer treatment. The conjugates of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic fluorophores and chemotherapy reagents create an exciting avenue for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery and distribution, as well as the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Therefore, there are great opportunities for researchers to conceive and exploit multifunctional prodrugs that can visualize chemo&#8208;drugs release and tumor treatment in&#8197;vivo. In this review, the design strategy and the recent progress of multifunctional organic chemotherapeutic prodrugs for activating NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided therapy are described and discussed in detail. Finally, the prospects and challenges of multifunctional chemotherapeutic prodrugs for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided therapy are provided.

         <dc:description>Here we describe a novel catalyst&#8208;free 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition bioconjugation approach for chemical modification of proteins. The dehydroalanine (Dha)&#8208;containing protein reacts with nitrile oxides generated in situ through 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition in fully aqueous&#8208;buffered systems. This leads to the formation of a new isoxazoline ring at a pre&#8208;defined site (Dha) of the protein. Furthermore, the 1&#8208;pyrene isoxazoline&#8208;installed annexin V acts as a fluorescent probe, which successfully labels the outer cellular membranes of human cholangiocarcinoma (HuCCA&#8208;1) cells for detection of apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (NDGA) Inhibits CsgA Polymerization, Bacterial Amyloid Biogenesis, and Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae thrive in robust biofilm communities through the coproduction of curli amyloid fibers and phosphoethanolamine cellulose. Curli promote adhesion to abiotic surfaces and plant and human host tissues and are associated with pathogenesis in urinary tract infection and foodborne illness. As amyloid, curli production in the host has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. We report that the natural product nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is effective as a curlicide in E. coli. NDGA prevents CsgA polymerization in vitro in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. NDGA selectively inhibits cellassociated curli assembly in E. coli and inhibits biofilm formation among uropathogenic E. coli in a curli&#8208;specific manner. More broadly, our work emphasizes the ability to evaluate and identify bioactive amyloid assembly inhibitors using the powerful gene&#8208;directed amyloid biogenesis machinery in E. coli.</dc:description>

         <title>Etoposide&#8208;Entrapped Progesterone&#8208;Cationic Lipid Nanoaggregates as Selective Therapeutics against Etoposide&#8208;Resistant Colorectal Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcoming cancer's defences: Etoposide treatment causes upregulation of ABCB1 drug efflux protein in CT26 colorectal cancer cells causing etoposide resistance. However, with PR10:etoposide nanoaggregates, ABCB1 expression remains at basal level allowing etoposide to cause its effect for longer, causing increased toxicity in these cancer cells.







Abstract
Drug resistance has a major impact on the treatment of several cancers. This is mainly due to the overexpression of cellular drug efflux proteins. Hence, drug&#8208;delivery systems that can avoid this resistance are needed. We report PR10, a progesterone&#8208;cationic lipid conjugate, as a self&#8208;assembling nanoaggregate that delivers a drug cargo of etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor, selectively to cancer cells. In this study, we observed that etoposide nanoaggregates (P&#8201;:&#8201;E) caused selective and enhanced toxicity in etoposide&#8208;resistant CT26 cancer cells (IC50 9&#8197;&#956;M) compared to when etoposide (IC50&gt;20&#8197;&#956;M) was used alone. Concurrently, no toxicity was observed in etoposide&#8208;sensitive HEK293 cells for P&#8201;:&#8201;E treatment (IC50&gt;20&#8197;&#956;M). The P&#8201;:&#8201;E&#8208;treated cancer cells seem to have no effect on ABCB1 expression, but etoposide&#8208;treated cells exhibited a twofold increase in ABCB1 expression, a potent efflux protein for several xenobiotic compounds. This observation supports the notion that the enhanced toxicity of P&#8201;:&#8201;E nanoaggregates is due to their ability to keep the expression of ABCB1 low, thus allowing longer intracellular residence of etoposide. In a BALB/c orthotopic colorectal cancer model, the nanoaggregates led to enhanced survival (45&#8197;days) compared to etoposide&#8208;treated mice (39&#8197;days). These findings suggest that PR10 could be used as a potential cancer&#8208;selective etoposide delivery vehicle to treat several etoposide&#8208;resistant cancers with fewer side effects due to the nonspecific toxicity of the drug.

However, with PR10:etoposide nanoaggregates, ABCB1 expression remains at basal level allowing etoposide to cause its effect for longer, causing increased toxicity in these cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug resistance has a major impact on the treatment of several cancers. This is mainly due to the overexpression of cellular drug efflux proteins. Hence, drug-delivery systems that can avoid this resistance are needed. We report PR10, a progesterone-cationic lipid conjugate, as a self-assembling nanoaggregate that delivers a drug cargo of etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor, selectively to cancer cells. In this study, we observed that etoposide nanoaggregates (P&#8201;:&#8201;E) caused selective and enhanced toxicity in etoposide-resistant CT26 cancer cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 9&#8197;&#956;M) compared to when etoposide (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;20&#8197;&#956;M) was used alone. Concurrently, no toxicity was observed in etoposide-sensitive HEK293 cells for P&#8201;:&#8201;E treatment (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;20&#8197;&#956;M). The P&#8201;:&#8201;E-treated cancer cells seem to have no effect on ABCB1 expression, but etoposide-treated cells exhibited a twofold increase in ABCB1 expression, a potent efflux protein for several xenobiotic compounds. This observation supports the notion that the enhanced toxicity of P&#8201;:&#8201;E nanoaggregates is due to their ability to keep the expression of ABCB1 low, thus allowing longer intracellular residence of etoposide. In a BALB/c orthotopic colorectal cancer model, the nanoaggregates led to enhanced survival (45&#8197;days) compared to etoposide-treated mice (39&#8197;days). These findings suggest that PR10 could be used as a potential cancer-selective etoposide delivery vehicle to treat several etoposide-resistant cancers with fewer side effects due to the nonspecific toxicity of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Ionic Strength on the Thermal Stability of DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The melting of five different 2D and 3D DNA origami nanostructures is assessed experimentally at different Mg2+ concentrations and compared to calculated staple ensemble melting temperatures. While the calculated melting temperatures show the expected logarithmic dependence on ionic strength, the increasing importance of mechanical strain leads to the saturation of the measured DNA origami melting temperatures at high Mg2+ concentrations.







Abstract
The stability of DNA origami nanostructures in aqueous media is closely tied to the presence of cations that screen electrostatic inter&#8208;helix repulsion. Here, the thermal melting behavior of different DNA origami nanostructures is investigated in dependence on Mg2+ concentration and compared to calculated ensemble melting temperatures of the staple strands used in DNA origami folding. Strong deviations of the measured DNA origami melting temperatures from the calculated ones are observed, in particular at high ionic strength where the melting temperature saturates and becomes independent of ionic strength. The degree of deviation between the measured and calculated melting temperatures further depends on the superstructure and in particular the mechanical properties of the DNA origami nanostructures. This indicates that thermal stability of a given DNA origami design at high ionic strength is governed predominantly not by electrostatic inter&#8208;helix repulsion but mostly by mechanical strain.

         <title>Facile Production of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Factor LasB in E. coli for Structure&#8208;Based Drug Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a number of virulence factors at its disposal that play crucial roles in the progression of infection. LasB is one of the major virulence factors and exerts its effects through elastolytic and proteolytic activities aimed at dissolving connective tissue and inactivating host defense proteins. LasB is of great interest for the development of novel patho&#8208;blockers to temper the virulence, but access has thus far largely been limited to protein isolated from Pseudomonas cultures. Here, we describe a new protocol for high&#8208;level production of native LasB in E. coli. We demonstrate that this facile approach is suitable for the production of mutant, thus far inaccessible LasB variants, and characterize the proteins biochemically and structurally. We expect that easy access to LasB is going to accelerate the development of inhibitors for this important virulence factor.</dc:description>

Zwitterionic molecules are attracting attention for application in new methods that can be used to loosen tight cell wall networks of plant cell in a biocompatible manner. Herein, we provide an overview of the recent progress and future perspectives of such molecules that function as boosters for cell wall&#8208;penetrating nanocarriers to improve genetic modification efficiency.







Abstract
Zwitterionic molecules, such as zwitterionic liquids (ZILs) and polypeptides (ZIPs), are attracting attention for application in new methods that can be used to loosen tight cell wall networks in a biocompatible manner. These novel methods can enhance the cell wall permeability of nanocarriers and increase their transfection efficiency into targeted subcellular organelles in plants. Herein, we provide an overview of the recent progress and future perspectives of such molecules that function as boosters for cell wall&#8208;penetrating nanocarriers.

         <title>Metal Complexes and Nanoparticles for Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imaging techniques are clinically used to identify, localize, and monitor the growth or reduction of cancerous tumors. Among the emerging methods, much research efforts have been devoted to photoacoustic imaging. Herein, the fundamental concept, recent advancements, and strategies for contrast agents based on molecular metal complexes or nanoparticles for photoacoustic imaging are reviewed.







Abstract
Clinical imaging techniques are widely used to detect, locate, and track the growth or shrinkage of cancerous tumors. Although these techniques have shown impressive results, they often come with health risks due to the use of toxic contrast agents or ionizing radiation. To address these limitations, research efforts have been focused on the development of new imaging techniques. Among the emerging medicinal methods, photoacoustic imaging is receiving much attention. This method effectively combines the most important benefits of both ultrasound and fluorescence imaging, while minimizing their respective drawbacks via a light&#8208;in and ultrasound&#8208;out approach. This review article focuses on the fundamental concept, recent advances, and strategies for novel contrast agents based on molecular metal complexes or metallic nanoparticles for use in photoacoustic imaging.

         <title>Altering the Modular Architecture of Galectins Affects its Binding with Synthetic &#945;&#8208;Dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated Core M1 Glycoconjugates In situ</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

The alteration of galectin modular architecture effectively revealed the design&#8208;functionality relationship of lectin binding towards &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptides in&#8197;situ. Altering galectin modular architecture via rational protein engineering revealed the design&#8208;functionality relationship within this lectin family towards its affinity to &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptides in&#8197;situ. Transforming galectin&#8208;1 and &#8722;3 into tandem&#8208;repeat&#8208; and proto&#8208;types, respectively, significantly enhanced cis&#8208;binding with the prepared ligands. Moreover, Gal&#8208;1 variants demonstrated higher trans&#8208;bridging capabilities between &#945;&#8208;dystoglycan glycoconjugates and laminins compared to Gal&#8208;1 wild&#8208;type.







Abstract
The multifunctionality of galectins helps regulate a broad range of fundamental cellular processes via cis&#8208;binding and trans&#8208;bridging activities and has gained widespread attention with respect to the importance of the natural specificity/selectivity of this lectin family to its glycoconjugate receptors. Combining galectin (Gal)&#8208;1, &#8722;3, &#8722;4, and &#8722;9 variant test panels, achieved via rational protein engineering, and a synthetic &#945;&#8208;dystroglycan (DG) O&#8208;Mannosylated core M1 glycopeptide library, a detailed comparative analysis was performed, utilizing microarray experiments to delineate the design&#8208;functionality relationships within this lectin family. Enhancement of prototype Gal&#8208;1 and chimera&#8208;type Gal&#8208;3 cis&#8208;binding toward the prepared ligands is possible by transforming these lectins into tandem&#8208;repeat type and prototypes, respectively. Furthermore, Gal&#8208;1 variants demonstrated improved trans&#8208;bridging capabilities between core M1 &#945;&#8208;DG glycopeptides and laminins in microarray, suggesting the possible translational applications of these galectin variants in the treatment of some forms of &#945;&#8208;dystroglycanopathy.

         <title>Derivatization of Mirror&#8208;Image l&#8208;Nucleic Acids with 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe Modification for Thermal and Structural Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the synthesis of a novel mirror&#8208;image nucleoside monomer, as well as its oligonucleotides, containing 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe modification. Incorporation of 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe into l&#8208;nucleic acids greatly enhances the thermal and structural stability, as shown by UV melting data and crystallographic structures. This modified nucleic acid with unusual chirality provides a useful strategy for future biochemical investigations.







Abstract
To further expand the functionality and enhance the stability of mirror&#8208;image nucleic acids as advanced agents for basic research and therapeutic design, we have synthesized 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;l&#8208;uridine phosphoramidite and incorporated it into l&#8208;DNA and l&#8208;RNA by solid&#8208;phase synthesis quantitatively. We found that the thermostability of l&#8208;nucleic acids is dramatically improved after introducing the modifications. Moreover, we successfully crystallized both l&#8208;DNA and l&#8208;RNA duplexes containing the 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe modifications and sharing identical sequences. Crystal structure determination and analysis revealed the overall structures of the mirror&#8208;image nucleic acids, and for the first time it was possible to interpret the structural deviations caused by 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe and 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups in the oligonucleotides, which are very similar. This novel chemical nucleic acid modification has the potential to be used to design nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics and materials in the future.

         <title>Phenylalanine Residues Are Very Rapidly Damaged by Nitrate Radicals (NO3&#8901;) in an Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phe residues are highly susceptible to oxidation by nitrate radicals (NO3&#8901;) in an aqueous environment. Because NO3&#8901; can be formed in&#8197;situ upon inhalation of the noxious gases nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#8901;) and ozone (O3), this study highlights the health&#8208;damaging potential of exposure to the combination of these air pollutants.







Abstract
Kinetic studies revealed that nitrate radicals (NO3&#8901;), which are formed through reaction of the noxious air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#8901;) and ozone (O3), very rapidly oxidize phenylalanine residues in an aqueous environment, with overall rate coefficients in the 108&#8211;109&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range. With amino acids and dipeptides as model systems, the data suggest that the reaction proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;complex between NO3&#8901; and the aromatic ring in Phe, which subsequently decays into a charge transfer (CT) complex. The stability of the &#960;&#8208;complex is sequence&#8208;dependent and is increased when Phe is at the N terminus of the dipeptide. Computations revealed that the considerably more rapid radical&#8208;induced oxidation of Phe residues in both neutral and acidic aqueous environments, compared to acetonitrile, can be attributed to stabilization of the CT complex by the protic solvent; this clearly highlights the health&#8208;damaging potential of exposure to combined NO2&#8901; and O3.

         <title>A Detailed View on Geosmin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new geosmin synthase from Allokutzneria albata was characterised for its detailed reaction mechanism through isotopic labelling experiments and its metal dependency. Incubations in the presence of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin gave insights into the mode of interaction of the N&#8208;terminal and C&#8208;terminal domains of this bifunctional enzyme.







Abstract
The bacterial geosmin synthase is a fascinating bifunctional enzyme that has been discovered almost two decades ago. Several aspects of the cyclisation mechanism from FPP to geosmin are known, but a detailed picture of the stereochemical course of this reaction is unknown. This article reports on a deep investigation of the mechanism of geosmin synthase through isotopic labelling experiments. Furthermore, the effects of divalent cations on geosmin synthase catalysis were investigated. The addition of cyclodextrin to enzymatic reactions, a molecule that can capture terpenes, suggests that the biosynthetic intermediate (1(10)E,5E)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;11&#8208;ol produced by the N&#8208;terminal domain is passed to the C&#8208;terminal domain not through a tunnel, but rather through release into the medium and uptake by the C&#8208;terminal domain.

         <title>A RaPID Macrocyclic Peptide That Inhibits the Formation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although inhibition of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation is an appealing approach for the prevention of this neurodegenerative pathology, the development of a binder has been yet challenging because of the disordered nature of &#945;&#8208;synuclein. Here, by means of the RaPID system, we discovered a macrocycle inhibitor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation at low stoichiometries.







Abstract
There is considerable interest in drug discovery targeting the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) since this molecular process is closely associated with Parkinson's disease. However, inhibiting &#945;Syn aggregation remains a major challenge because of its highly dynamic nature which makes it difficult to form a stable binding complex with a drug molecule. Here, by exploiting Random non&#8208;standard Peptides Integrated Discovery (RaPID) system, we identified a macrocyclic peptide, BD1, that could interact with immobilized &#945;Syn and inhibit the formation of fibrils. Furthermore, improving the solubility of BD1 suppresses the co&#8208;aggregation with &#945;Syn fibrils while it kinetically inhibits more effectively without change in their morphology. We also revealed the molecular mechanism of kinetic inhibition, where peptides bind to fibril ends of &#945;Syn, thereby preventing further growth of fibrils. These results suggest that our approach for generating non&#8208;standard macrocyclic peptides is a promising approach for developing potential therapeutics against neurodegeneration.

         <title>Constraining and Modifying Peptides Using Pd&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Allylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;mediated cysteine allylation allows to constrain and rigidify peptides by linking two cysteine side chains with a large set of easily available stapling reagents. The staple itself can be further functionalized based on its inherent reactivity thereby allowing construction of a large variety of solid peptides.

         <title>Lysosomes Targeting pH Activable Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential photodynamic activity of prototypical acidic pH&#8208;responsive BODIPYs targeting cellular lysosomes have been demonstrated by a comprehensive study going from the synthesis to the biological evaluation and including photophysical and theoretical studies. It provides an efficient strategy to design smart theranostic agents for more selective and efficient photodynamic PDT.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemistry&#8208;based medical treatment combining light at a specific wavelength and a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of oxygen.

     alt="Lysosomes Targeting pH Activable Imaging-Guided Photodynamic Agents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential &lt;b&gt;photodynamic activity&lt;/b&gt; of prototypical acidic pH-responsive BODIPYs targeting cellular lysosomes have been demonstrated by a comprehensive study going from the synthesis to the biological evaluation and including photophysical and theoretical studies. It provides an efficient strategy to design smart theranostic agents for more selective and efficient photodynamic PDT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemistry-based medical treatment combining light at a specific wavelength and a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of oxygen. Application of PDT as a conventional treatment is limited and clearly the approval in clinics of new PS is challenging. The selective accumulation of the PS in the targeted malignant cells is of paramount importance to reduce the side effects that are typical of the current worldwide approved PS. Here we report a new series of aniline- and iodine-substituted BODIPY derivatives (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) as promising lysosome-targeting and pH-responsive theranostic PS, which displayed a significant &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; light-induced cytotoxicity, efficient imaging properties and low dark toxicity (for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). These compounds were obtained in few reproducible synthetic steps and good yields. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations confirmed the quenching of the emissive properties of the PS, while both fluorescence and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission were obtained only under acidic conditions inducing amine protonation. The p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values and pH-dependent emissive properties of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; being established, their cellular uptake and activation in the lysosomal vesicles (pH&#8776;4-5) were confirmed by their co-localization with the commercial LysoTracker deep red and light-induced cytotoxicity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; between 0.16 and 0.06&#8197;&#956;M) against HeLa cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Anthrochelin, a Growth&#8208;Promoting Metallophore of the Human Pathogen Luteibacter anthropi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various human pathogens have emerged from environmental strains by adapting to higher growth temperatures and the ability to produce virulence factors. A remarkable example of pathoadapted bacteria is found in the genus Luteibacter, which typically comprises harmless soil microbes, yet Luteibacteranthropi was isolated from the blood of a diseased child. To date, nothing has been known about the specialized metabolism of this pathogen. By comparative genome analyses we found that L. anthropi has a markedly higher biosynthetic potential than other bacteria of this genus and uniquely bears an NRPS gene locus tentatively coding for the biosynthesis of a metallophore. By metabolic profiling, stable isotope labeling, and NMR investigation of a gallium complex, we identified a new family of salicylate&#8208;derived non&#8208;ribosomal peptides named anthrochelin A&#8211;D. Surprisingly, anthrochelins feature a C&#8208;terminal homocysteine tag, which may be introduced during peptide termination. Mutational analyses provided insight into the anthrochelin assembly and revealed the unexpected involvement of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in oxazole formation. Notably, this heterocycle plays a key role in metal binding, especially copper (II). Bioassays showed that anthrochelin significantly promotes the growth of L. anthropi in the presence of low and high copper concentrations, which occur during infections.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ H2O2 Generation by Choline Oxidase and Its Application in Amino Polysaccharide Degradation by Coupling to Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chitin, the most abundant amino polysaccharide in Nature, has many applications in different fields. However, processing of this recalcitrant biopolymer in an environmentally friendly manner remains a major challenge. In this context, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are of interest, as they can act on the most recalcitrant parts of chitin and related insoluble biopolymers such as cellulose. Efficient LPMO catalysis can be achieved by feeding reactions with H2O2, but careful control of H2O2 is required to avoid autocatalytic enzyme inactivation. Herein, we present a coupled enzyme system in which a choline oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis is employed for controlled in situ generation of H2O2 that fuels LPMO&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation of chitin. We show that the rate, stability and extent of the LPMO reaction can be manipulated by varying the amount of choline oxidase and/or its substrate, choline chloride, and that efficient peroxygenase reactions may be achieved using sub&#8208;&#956;M concentrations of the H2O2&#8208;generating enzyme. This coupled system requires only sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of the reductant that is needed to keep the LPMO in its active, reduced state. It is conceivable that this enzyme system may be used for bioprocessing of chitin in choline&#8208;based natural deep eutectic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectrophotometric and fluorimetric high&#8208;throughput assays for phenolic acid decarboxylase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic decarboxylation of hydroxycinnamic acids yields phenolic styrenes, which are important precursors for antioxidants, epoxy coatings, adhesives and other polymeric materials. Bacillus subtilis decarboxylase (BsPAD) is a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of carbon dioxide from p&#8208;coumaric&#8208;, caffeic&#8208;, and ferulic acid with high catalytic efficiency. Real&#8208;time spectroscopic assays for decarboxylase reactions remove the necessity of extensive sample workup, which is required for HPLC, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, or NMR methods. This work presents two robust and sensitive assays based on photometry and fluorimetry that allow following decarboxylation reactions with high sensitivity while avoiding product extraction and long analysis times. Optimized assay procedures were used to measure BsPAD activity in cell lysates and to determine the kinetic constants (KM and Vmax) of the purified enzyme for p&#8208;coumaric&#8208;, caffeic&#8208; and ferulic acid. Substrate inhibition was shown for caffeic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipid, Inorganic, Polymer, and DNA Based Nanocarriers for Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has been widely explored for the precise manipulation of target DNA and enabled efficient genomic editing in cells. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 has shown promising potential in biomedical applications, including disease treatment, transcriptional regulation and genome&#8208;wide screening. Despite these exciting achievements, the efficient and controlled delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 system remained a critical obstacle to the further application. Herein, we elaborated on the three delivery forms of CRISPR/Cas9 system, and discussed the compositions, advantages and limitations of these forms. Then we provided a comprehensive overview of the delivery carriers of CRISPR/Cas9 system, and focused on the non&#8208;viral nanocarriers in chemical methods that facilitated efficient and controlled delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 system. Finally, we deeply discussed the challenges and prospects of the delivery methods of CRISPR/Cas9 system, and proposed strategies to address the intracellular and extracellular barriers for delivery in clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Faradaic Fenton Pixel &#8211; Reactive Oxygen Species Delivery using Au/Cr Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an integral part of many anticancer therapies. Fenton&#8208;like processes involving reactions of peroxides with transition metal ions are a particularly potent and tunable subset of ROS approaches. Precise on&#8208;demand dosing of the Fenton reaction is an area of great interest. Herein, we present a concept of an electrochemical faradaic pixel which produces controlled amounts of ROS via a Fenton&#8208;like process. The pixel comprises a cathode and anode, where the cathode reduces dissolved oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The anode is made of chromium, which is electrochemically corroded to yield chromium ions. Peroxide and chromium interact to form a highly oxidizing mixture of hydroxyl radicals and hexavalent Cr&#8208;ions. After benchmarking the electrochemical properties of this type of device, we demonstrate how it can be used under in vitro conditions with a cancer cell line. The faradaic Fenton pixel is a general and scalable concept that can be used for on&#8208;demand delivery of redox&#8208;active products for controlling a physiological outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Binding of Full&#8208;Length Chemerin is Driven by Negative Charges in the CMKLR1 N&#8208;terminus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adipokine chemerin is the endogenous ligand of the chemokine&#8208;like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), a member of the family of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR). This protein ligand plays an important role in obesity and inflammatory processes. Stable receptor&#8208;ligand interactions are highly relevant for its different physiological effects, e. g. the migration of immune cells towards sites of inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that negative charges in the CMKLR1 N&#8208;terminus are involved in the formation of strong contacts with a specific positively charged patch at the surface of full&#8208;length chemerin, which is absent in the short nonapeptide agonist chemerin&#8208;9 explaining its reduced affinity. Using receptor chimera of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and CMKLR1, we were able to identify the residues of this interaction and its relevance for stable full&#8208;length chemerin binding. This may help to develop more potent ligands for the treatment of inflammatory related diseases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The adipokine chemerin is the endogenous ligand of the chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). This protein ligand plays an important role in obesity and inflammatory processes. Stable receptor-ligand interactions are highly relevant for its different physiological effects, e. g. the migration of immune cells towards sites of inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that negative charges in the CMKLR1 N-terminus are involved in the formation of strong contacts with a specific positively charged patch at the surface of full-length chemerin, which is absent in the short nonapeptide agonist chemerin-9 explaining its reduced affinity. Using receptor chimera of G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and CMKLR1, we were able to identify the residues of this interaction and its relevance for stable full-length chemerin binding. This may help to develop more potent ligands for the treatment of inflammatory related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Tools for study of Phosphohistidine: Generation of &#160;Selective &#932;&#8208;phosphohistidine and &#928;&#8208;phosphohistidine Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;hydrolysable stable analogues of &#964;&#8208;phosphohistidine (&#964;&#8208;pHis) and &#960;&#8208;pHis have been designed aided by electrostatic surface potential calculations, and subsequently synthesized. The &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis analogues (phosphopyrazole 8 and pyridyl amino amide 13, respectively) were used as haptens to generate pHis polyclonal antibodies. Both &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis conjugates in the form of a BSA&#8208;glutaraldehyde&#8208;&#964;&#8208;pHis and BSA&#8208;glutaraldehyde&#8208;&#960;&#8208;pHis were synthesized and characterized by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Commercially available &#964;&#8208;pHis (SC56&#8208;2) and &#960;&#8208;pHis (SC1&#8208;1; SC50&#8208;3) monoclonal antibodies were used to show that the BSA&#8208;G&#8208;&#964;&#8208;pHis and BSA&#8208;G&#8208;&#960;&#8208;pHis conjugates could be used to assess the selectivity of pHis antibodies in a competitive ELISA. Subsequently, the selectivity of the generated pHis antibodies generated using phosphopyrazole 8 and pyridyl amino amide 13 as haptens was assessed by competitive ELISA against His, pSer, pThr, pTyr, &#964;&#8208;pHis and &#960;&#8208;pHis. Antibodies generated using the phosphopyrazole 8 as a hapten were found to be selective for &#964;&#8208;pHis, and antibodies generated using the pyridyl amino amide 13 were found to be selective for &#960;&#8208;pHis. Both &#964;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;pHis antibodies were shown to be effective in immunological experiments, including ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence. The &#964;&#8208;pHis antibody was also shown to be useful in the immunoprecipitation of proteins containing pHis.</dc:description>

         <title>CYPArm2 is a CYP450 monooxygenase with protoilludene 13&#8208;hydroxylase activity involved in the biosynthesis of armillyl orsellinate&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The melleolides are a family of structurally and functionally diverse sesquiterpenoids with potential applications as fungicides, antimicrobials and cancer therapeutics. The initial and terminal steps of the biosynthesis pathway in Armillaria spp. have been characterized, but the intermediate steps are unclear. Biosynthetic gene clusters in A.&#160;mellea and A. gallica were shown to encode a terpene cyclase, a polyketide synthase, and four CYP450 monooxygenases. We have characterized CYPArm3, which is responsible for the hydroxylation of &#916;&#8208;6&#8208;protoilludene, but the functions of the other CYP450s remain to be determined. Here we describe CYPArm2, which accepts &#916;&#8208;6&#8208;protoilludene and 8&#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;protoilludene as substrates. To investigate the products in more detail, we generated recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains overexpressing CYPArm2 in combination with the previously characterized protoilludene synthase and 8&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase. Using this total biosynthesis approach, sufficient quantities of product were obtained for NMR spectroscopy. This allowed the identification of 8&#945;,13&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;protoilludene, confirming that CYPArm2 is a protoilludene 13&#8208;hydroxylase.</dc:description>

         <title>Examination of Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis in Apicomplexa</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural product discovery has traditionally relied on the isolation of small molecules from producing species, but genome sequencing technology and advances in molecular biology techniques have expanded efforts to a wider array of organisms. Protists represent an underexplored kingdom for specialized metabolite searches despite bioinformatic analysis that suggests they harbor distinct biologically active small molecules. Specifically, pathogenic apicomplexan parasites, responsible for billions of global infections, have been found to possess multiple biosynthetic gene clusters, which hints at their capacity to produce polyketide metabolites. Biochemical studies have revealed unique features of apicomplexan polyketide synthases, but to date, the identity and function of polyketides synthesized by these megaenzymes remains unknown. Herein, we discuss the potential for specialized metabolite production in protists and the possible evolution of polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters in apicomplexan parasites. We then focus on a polyketide synthase from the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii to discuss the unique domain architecture and properties of these proteins when compared to previously characterized systems, and further speculate on the possible functions for polyketides in these pathogenic parasites.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures and mechanisms of a novel bacterial transport system for fatty acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial acquisition of metabolites is largely facilitated by transporters with unique substrate scopes. The tripartite ATP&#8208;independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters comprise a large family of bacterial proteins that facilitate the uptake of a variety of small molecules. It has been reported that some TRAP systems encode a fourth protein, the T component. The T&#8208;component, or TatT, is predicted to be a periplasmic&#8208;facing lipoprotein that enables the uptake of metabolites from the outer membrane. However, no substrates were revealed for any TatT and their functional role(s) remained enigmatic. We recently identified a homolog in Methylococcus capsulatus that binds to sterols, and herein, we report two additional homologs that demonstrate a preference for long&#8208;chain fatty acids. Our bioinformatics, quantitative analyses of protein&#8208;ligand interactions, and high&#8208;resolution crystal structures suggest that TatTs might facilitate the trafficking of hydrophobic or lipophilic substrates and represent a new class of bacterial lipid and fatty acid transporters.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing multicomponent strategies to macrobicyclic peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclization of peptides is typically used to fix specific bioactive conformations and improve their pharmacological prop&#8208;erties. Recently, macrobicyclic peptides have received special attention owing to their capacity to mimic protein structures or be key components of peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Here, we describe the development of novel synthetic strategies for two distinctive types of peptide macrobicycles. A multicomponent macrocyclo&#8208;dimerization approach is introduced for the production of interconnected &#946;&#8208;turns, allowing two macrocyclic rings to be formed and dimerized in one pot. Also, an on&#8208;resin double stapling strategy is described for the assembly of lactam&#8208;bridged macrobicycles with stable tertiary folds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one common ROS&#8208;generating therapeutic method with high tumor selectivity and low side effects. But the GSH&#8208;upregulation often alleviates its therapeutic efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy of jointly depleting GSH to enhance the therapeutic effect of PDT by preparing a nanomicelle by self&#8208;assembly method from GSH&#8208;activated photosensitizer DMT, curcumin and amphiphilic polymer TPGS.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying E3 ligase substrates with quantitative degradation proteomics.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled protein degradation by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway is critical for almost all cellular processes. E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for targeting proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation with spatial and temporal precision. While studies have revealed various E3&#8208;substrate pairs involved in distinct biological processes, the complete substrate profiles of individual E3 ligases are largely unknown. Here we report a new approach to identify substrates of an E3 ligase for proteasomal degradation using unnatural amino acid incorporation pulse&#8208;chase proteomics (degradomics). Applying this approach, we determine the steadystate substrates of the  C &#8208; t erminal to  L is H  (CTLH) E3 ligase, a multicomponent complex with poorly defined substrates. By comparing the proteome degradation profiles of active and inactive CTLH&#8208;expressing cells, we successfully identify previously known and new potential substrates of CTLH ligase. Altogether, degradomics can comprehensively identify degradation substrates of an E3 ligase, which can be adapted for other E3 ligases in various cellular contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Ureidopeptide Natural Products Macrocyclized via Indole N&#8208;acylation in Marine Microbulbifer spp. Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, and possible molecular logic of bulbiferamides &#8211; macrocyclic ureidopeptides containing N&#8208;acyl tryptophan indoles.







Abstract
Commensal bacteria associated with marine invertebrates are underappreciated sources of chemically novel natural products. Using mass spectrometry, we had previously detected the presence of peptidic natural products in obligate marine bacteria of the genus Microbulbifer cultured from marine sponges. In this report, the isolation and structural characterization of a panel of ureidohexapeptide natural products, termed the bulbiferamides, from Microbulbifer strains is reported wherein the tryptophan side chain indole participates in a macrocyclizing peptide bond formation. Genome sequencing identifies biosynthetic gene clusters encoding production of the bulbiferamides and implicates the involvement of a thioesterase in the indolic macrocycle formation. The structural diversity and widespread presence of bulbiferamides in commensal microbiomes of marine invertebrates point toward a possible ecological role for these natural products.

         <title>Extended scope and understanding of zinc&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenases for reduction of cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) are important tools for generating chiral a&#8208;hydroxyketones. Previously, only the ADH of Thauera aromatica was known to convert cyclic a&#8208;diketones with appropriate preference. Here, we extend the spectrum of suitable enzymes by three alcohol dehydrogenases from Citrifermentans bemidjiense (CibADH), Deferrisoma camini (DecADH), and Thauera phenylacetica (ThpADH). Of these, DecADH is characterized by very high thermostability; CibADH and ThpADH convert a&#8208;halogenated cyclohexanones with increased activity. Otherwise, however, the substrate spectrum of all four ADHs is highly conserved. Structural considerations led to the conclusion that conversion of diketones requires not only the expansion of the active site into a large binding pocket, but also the circumferential modification of almost all amino acid residues that form the first shell of the binding pocket. The constellation appears to be overall highly specific for the relative positioning of the carbonyl functions and the size of the C&#8208;ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Hybrid Peptide&#8722;DNA Nanostructures using Homotrimeric Coiled&#8208;Coil/Nucleic Acid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modified a peptide that forms a homotrimeric coiled&#8208;coil with DNA handles, leading to a three&#8208;way peptide&#8722;DNA junction. This hybrid assembly could organize DNA tiles into trimeric species, or close up a triangular DNA base into a hybrid peptide&#8722;DNA tetrahedron. This new peptide&#8722;DNA building block could enable new functional nanomaterials.







Abstract
Peptides and DNA are two of the most commonly used self&#8208;assembling biological molecules for the construction of nanomaterials. However, there are only a few examples that combine these two self&#8208;assembly motifs as key structural elements in a nanostructure. We report on the synthesis of a peptide&#8722;DNA conjugate that self&#8208;assembles into a stable homotrimer based on the coiled&#8208;coil motif. The hybrid peptide&#8722;DNA trimer was then used as a novel three&#8208;way junction to link together either small DNA tile nanostructures, or to close up a triangular wireframe DNA structure. The resulting nanostructures were characterized by atomic force microscopy, and compared with a scrambled, non&#8208;assembling peptide as a control. These hybrid nanostructures enable the integration of peptide motifs and potentially bio&#8208;functionality with DNA nanostructures, and open the door to novel nano&#8208;materials that have the advantages of both molecules.

         <title>Unfolding under pressure: an NMR perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review aims at analysing the role of solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in pressure&#8208;induced in vitro studies of protein unfolding. Although this transition has for many years been neglected because of technical difficulties, it provides important information about the forces that keep together protein structure. We first analyse what is pressure unfolding. We then provide a critical overview of how NMR has contributed to the field and evaluate the observables used in these studies. Finally, we discuss the commonalities and differences between pressure&#8208;, cold&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced unfolding. We conclude that, while within specific peculiarities, cold and pressure denaturation both rely on the important contribution of the state of hydration of non&#8208;polar side&#8208;chains as a major factor that determines the pressure dependence of the conformational stability of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Constraining and Modifying Peptides Using Pd&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Allylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cysteine allylation is used for peptide stapling and the resulting alkene&#8208;containing staples are further modified via biorthogonal reactions to introduce additional probes.







Abstract
Over the past decades, several strategies for inducing and stabilizing secondary structure formation in peptides have been developed to increase their proteolytic stability and their binding affinity to specific interaction partners. Here, we report how our recently introduced chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cysteine allylation reaction can be extended to stapling and how the resulting alkene&#8208;containing staples themselves can be further modified to introduce additional probes into such stabilized peptides. The latter is demonstrated by introducing a fluorophore as well as a PEG moiety into different stapled peptides using bioorthogonal thiol&#8208;ene and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Furthermore, we investigated structural implications of our allyl staples when used to replace conformationally relevant disulfide bridges. To this end, we chose a selective binder of integrin &#945;3&#946;1 (LXY3), which is only active in its cyclic disulfide form. We replaced the disulfide bridge by different stapling reagents in order to increase stability and binding affinity towards integrin &#945;3&#946;1.

         <title>Engineering Glucose Dehydrogenase to Favor&#160;Totally Synthetic Biomimetic&#160;containing carboxyl group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of unnatural nicotinamide cofactors for reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases has gained increasing interest. Totally synthetic nicotinamide cofactor biomimetics (NCBs) are cost&#8208;effective and convenient to synthesize. Thus, it has becoming increasingly important to develop enzymes that accept NCBs. Here, we have engineered SsGDH to favor a newly synthesized unnatural cofactor 3&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybenzyl) pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium (BANA+). Using in situ ligand minimization tool, sites 44 and 114 were identified as hotspots for mutagenesis. All the double mutants demonstrated 2.7&#8211;7.7&#8208;fold improvements in catalytic activity, and the best double mutant E44D/E114L exhibited 10.6&#8208;fold increased catalytic efficiency toward BANA+. These results provide valuable information for the rational engineering of oxidoreductases with versatile NCBs&#8208;dependency, as well as the design of novel biomimetic cofactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the selectivity of light active anti&#8208;microbial agents &#8211; or how to get a photosensitizer to the desired target?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitizers combine the inherent reactivity of reactive oxygen species with the sophisticated reaction control of light. Through selective targeting these light&#8208;active molecules have the potential to overcome certain limitations in drug discovery. Ongoing advances in the synthesis and evaluation of photosensitizer conjugates with biomolecules such as antibodies, peptides or small molecule drugs are leading to increasingly powerful agents for the eradication of a growing number of microbial species. This review article therefore summarizes challenges and opportunities in the development of selective photosensitizers and their conjugates described in recent literature. This provides adequate insight for newcomers and those interested in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Mechanistic Investigations of Biocatalytic Nitrenoid C&#8208;H Functionalizations via Engineered Heme Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineered heme proteins were developed to possess numerous excellent biocatalytic nitrenoid C&#8208;H functionalizations. Computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT), hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were employed to help understand some important mechanistic aspects of these heme nitrene transfer reactions. This review summarizes advances of computational reaction pathway results of these biocatalytic intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8208;H aminations/amidations, focusing on mechanistic origins of reactivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity as well as effects of substrate substituent, axial ligand, metal center, and protein environment. Some important common and distinctive mechanistic features of these reactions were also described with brief outlook of future development.</dc:description>

         <title>Spirocyclic Chromenopyrazole Inhibitors Disrupting the Interaction between the RNA&#8208;binding protein LIN28 and Let&#8208;7</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of the RNA&#8208;binding and regulating protein LIN28 have the potential to be developed as chemical probes for biological perturbation and as therapeutic candidates. Reported small molecules disrupting the interaction between LIN28 and let&#8208;7 miRNA suffer from moderate to weak inhibitory activity and flat structure&#8208;activity relationship, which hindered the development of next&#8208;generation LIN28 inhibitors that warrant further evaluations. We report herein the identification of new LIN28 inhibitors utilizing a spirocyclization strategy based on a chromenopyrazole scaffold. Representative compounds 2&#8208;5 showed potent in vitro inhibitory activity against LIN28&#8211;let&#8208;7 interaction and single&#8208;digit micromolar potency in inhibiting the proliferation of LIN28&#8208;expressed JAR cancer cells. The spirocyclic compound 5 incorporated a position that is amenable for functional group appendage and further structural modifications. The binding mode of compound 5 with the LIN28 cold shock domain was rationalized via a molecular docking analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled E. coli aggregation mediated by DNA and XNA hybridization.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Summary Chemical cell surface modification is a fast&#8208;growing field of research, due to a common interest of chemists and synthetic biologists in tissue engineering, cell&#8208;based immunotherapy, and regenerative medicine. Few works, however, have been realized with bacteria, to engineer in this way the formation of bacterial tissues. We present here, an orthogonal nucleic acid&#8208;protein conjugation strategy to promote artificial bacterial aggregation. This system gathers the high selectivity and stability of linkage to a protein Tag expressed at the cell surface and the modularity and reversibility of aggregation due to oligonucleotide hybridization. For the first time, XNA (xeno nucleic acids in the form of 1,5&#8208;anhydrohexitol nucleic acids) were immobilized at cell surface to induce bacterial aggregation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic approaches of epoxysuccinate chemical probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic chemical probes are powerful tools for investigation of biological processes. They are particularly useful for proteomic studies such as Activity Based Protein Profiling (ABPP). These chemical methods initially used mimics of natural substrates. As the techniques gained prominence, more and more elaborated chemical probes with increased specificity towards given enzyme/protein families and amenability to various reaction conditions have been used. Among chemical probes, peptidyl&#8208;epoxysuccinates represent one of the first type of compounds used to investigate activity of cysteine proteases papain&#8208;like family of enzymes. Structurally derived from the natural substrate to date exists a wide body of inhibitors and activity&#8208; or affinity&#8208;based probes bearing the electrophilic oxirane unit for covalent labelling of active enzymes. Herein we review the literature regarding the synthetic approaches to epoxysuccinate&#8208;based chemical probes together with the reported applications, from biological chemistry and inhibition studies to supramolecular chemistry and formation of protein arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>A clickable photosystem I, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin NADP+ reductase fusion system for light&#8208;driven NADPH regeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic organisms like plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use light for the regeneration of dihydronicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The process starts with the light&#8208;driven oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII) and the released electrons are transferred via the cytochrome b6f complex towards photosystem I (PSI). This membrane protein complex is responsible for the light&#8208;driven reduction of the soluble electron mediator ferredoxin (Fd), which passes the electrons to ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR). Finally, NADPH is regenerated by FNR at the end of the electron transfer chain. In this study, we established a clickable fusion system for in vitro NADPH regeneration with PSI&#8208;Fd and PSI&#8208;Fd&#8208;FNR, respectively. For this, we fused immunity protein 7 (Im7) to the C&#8208;terminus of the PSI&#8208;PsaE subunit in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Furthermore, colicin DNase E7 (E7) fusion chimeras of Fd and FNR with varying linker domains were expressed in E. coli. Isolated Im7&#8208;PSI was coupled with the E7&#8208;Fd or E7&#8208;Fd&#8208;FNR fusion proteins through highaffinity binding of the E7/Im7 protein pair. The corresponding complexes were tested for NADPH regeneration capacity in comparison to the free protein systems demonstrating the general applicability of the strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>SNAP&#8208;targeted MRI&#8208;Fluorescent agents for multimodal imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging modality, highly employed in research and clinical settings. However, MRI images suffers from low signals and lack of target specificity. We aimed to develop a multimodal imaging probe to detect targeted&#8208;cells by MRI and fluorescence microscopy. We synthesized a tri&#8208;functional imaging probe consisting of a SNAP&#8208;tag substrate for irreversible and specific labeling of cells, cyanine dyes for bright fluorescence, and a chelated Gd(III) molecule for enhancing MRI&#8208;contrast. Our probes exhibit specific and efficient labelling of genetically&#8208;defined cells (expressing SNAP at their membrane), bright fluorescence and MRI signal. Our synthetic approach provides a versatile platform for production of multimodal imaging probes, particularly for light microscopy and MRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and characterization of selective FAK inhibitors and PROTACs with in vivo activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an attractive drug target due to its overexpression in cancer. FAK functions as a non&#8208;receptor tyrosine kinase and scaffolding protein, coordinating several downstream signaling effectors and cellular processes. While drug discovery efforts have largely focused on targeting FAK kinase activity, FAK inhibitors have failed to show efficacy as single agents in clinical trials. Here, using structure&#8208;guided design, we report the development of a selective FAK inhibitor (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;175) and degrader (BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146) to evaluate the consequences and advantages of abolishing all FAK activity in cancer models. BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 achieves rapid and potent FAK degradation with high proteome&#8208;wide specificity in cancer cells and induces durable degradation in mice. Compared to kinase inhibition, targeted degradation of FAK exhibits pronounced improved activity on downstream signaling and cancer cell viability and migration. Together, BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;175 and BSJ&#8208;04&#8208;146 are valuable chemical tools to dissect the specific consequences of targeting FAK through small molecule inhibition or degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Effects of Mutagenesis on FusionRed by Using Excited&#8208;State QM/MM Dynamics and Classical Force Field Simulations
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three computationally tested variants of the FusionRed protein are on display in glass cloche bells. All three platforms are colored by the excitation wavelength of FusionRed, while each protein structure is colored by the emission wavelengths. Additionally, the experimentally demonstrated increased fluorescence of C158I is represented by the brighter light emission strength of the structure, and our predicted return of the A157N/C158I variant to a WT&#8208;like behavior is shown by the reduced brightness. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. R. Walker et al.

         <title>Precision and Controlled Modification of Proteins using Multifunctional Chemical Constructs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioconjugation of chemical entities to biologically active proteins has increased our insight in the inner workings of a cell and resulted in novel therapeutic agents. A current challenge is the efficient generation of homogeneous conjugates of native proteins, not only when isolated, but also when still present in their native environment. To do this, various features of protein&#8208;modifying enzymes have been combined in artificial constructs. In this concept, the current status of this approach is evaluated, and the interplay between designs and protein modification will be discussed. Particular focus is directed on the protein&#8208;binding anchor, the chemistry that is used for the modification, and the linker that connects these two units. Suggestions how to include additional elements such as a trigger&#8208;responsive switch that regulated protein modification are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical zymogens: specificity and steroidal control of reactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activation and masking of enzymatic activity on demand is of the highest importance in nature. It is achieved via chemical interconversion of enzymes and the corresponding zymogens through, for example, proteolytic processing or reversible phosphorylation, and affords on&#8208;demand activation of enzymes, controlled in space and/or time. In stark contrast, examples of chemical zymogens are very few, and in most cases these are based on the disulfide chemistry, which is largely indiscriminate to the nature of the activating thiol. In this work, we address an outstanding challenge of specificity of reactivation of chemical zymogens. We achieve this through engineering affinity between the chemical zymogen and the activator. Additional, higher level control over zymogen reactivation is installed in a nature&#8208;mimicking approach using steroidal hormones. Taken together, results of this study take a step towards establishing specificity of reactivation of synthetic, chemical zymogens. We anticipate that results of this study contribute significantly to the development of chemical zymogens as tools for diverse use in chemical biology and biotechnology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A transfection vector based on a peptide dendrimer (1) was developed and its ability for DNA binding and transport
investigated. By attaching a fluorophore to the vector system (1*), several steps in the transfection process could be monitored

eukaryotic cells. Co&#8208;localization experiments revealed that the ligand/plasmid complex is taken upviathe endosomal pathway
followed by an endosomal escape or lysosomal degradation. Afterwards, the plasmid DNA seems to enter the nucleus due to a
breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis, as only cells that have recently undergone mitosis showed H2B&#8208;GFP expression.</dc:description>

         <title>Phospholipid&#8208;Coated Boronic Oxide Nanoparticles as a Boron Agent for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minimally invasive boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is one of the elegant approaches for cancer treatment. The deliverability of boron agents to cancer cells with high selectivity and efficiency is the key to maximizing the therapeutic benefits of BNCT. In addition, the enhancement of the frequencies to achieve a boron neutron capture reaction is also significant in improving therapeutic efficacy by providing a highly concentrated boron agent in each boron nanoparticle. Since the density of the thermal neutron beam remains low, it is unable to induce high&#8208;efficiency cell destruction. Herein, we report phospholipid&#8208;coated boronic oxide nanoparticles as a boron agent for BNCT, which can provide a highly concentrated boron atom in each nanoparticle. The current system exhibited BNCT activity seven&#8208;fold higher than the commercially applicable boron agents in vitro. Furthermore, the system could penetrate cancer spheroids deeply, efficiently suppressing thermal neutron irradiation&#8208;induced growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Styryl&#8208;NIR Mitochondrial Probes with Rapid HOCl Detection in Live&#8208;Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is critical for maintaining immune system balance, but it can harm mitochondria by hindering enzyme activity, leading to decreased ATP and increased cell death. In this study, we have designed a fluorophore with a pyridinium scaffold for selective staining of the mitochondria and to detect hypochlorite. The fluorophore exhibits strong solvatochromic emission due to intramolecular charge transfer and excellent sub&#8208;cellular localization in the mitochondria. Additionally, it shows a rapid response to HOCl with high selectivity among different reactive oxygen/nitrogen compounds with a detection limit of 2.31&#956;M.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is critical for maintaining immune system balance, but it can harm mitochondria by hindering enzyme activity, leading to decreased ATP and increased cell death. In this study, we have designed a fluorophore with a pyridinium scaffold for selective staining of the mitochondria and to detect hypochlorite. The fluorophore exhibits strong solvatochromic emission due to intramolecular charge transfer and excellent sub-cellular localization in the mitochondria. Additionally, it shows a rapid response to HOCl with high selectivity among different reactive oxygen/nitrogen compounds with a detection limit of 2.31&#956;M. Moreover, it is also utilized for the exogenous and endogenous detection of HOCl in live cells, which may help study the role of hypochlorite in organelles at the cellular level. DFT and TDDFT calculations have been carried out to understand the relationship between the structure and properties of the cationic probes with respect to the &#945;-cyano substitution and extension of &#960;-conjugation. The selective detection of HOCl by C4 over other cationic probes has also been well-demonstrated, showing how the binding of HOCl affects the electronic properties of C4 through the analysis of non-bonding orbitals (NBO) population, electrostatic potential surface (ESP), and density of states (DOS) projected DOS investigations&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Effects of Mutagenesis on FusionRed by Using Excited&#8208;State QM/MM Dynamics and Classical Force Field Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Predicted mutation of FusionRed variants leads to partial restoration of photoisomerization activity via enhanced solvent effects and reduced hydrophobic interactions in the barrel. We apply QM/MM excited state dynamics to reveal the effects of protein structure on fluorescence quantum yield of FusionRed in WT, C158I, and A157N/C158I variants.







Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are a powerful tool for examining tissues, cells, and subcellular components in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. FusionRed is a particular FP variant mutated from mKate2 that, in addition to lower cytotoxicity and aggregation rates, has shown potential for acting as a tunable photoswitch. This was posited to stem partially from the presence of a bulky side chain at position 158 and a further stabilizing residue at position 157. In this work, we apply computational techniques including classical molecular dynamics (MD) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations (QM/MM) to explore the effect of mutagenesis at these locations in FusionRed on the chromophore structure, the excited&#8208;state surface, and relative positional stability of the chromophore in the protein pocket. We find specific connections between the statistical sampling of the underlying protein structure and the nonradiative decay mechanisms from excited&#8208;state dynamics. A single mutation (C158I) that restricts the motion of the chromophore through a favorable hydrophobic interaction corresponds to an increase in fluorescence quantum yield (FQY), while a second rescue mutation (C158I&#8208;A157N) partially restores the flexibility of the chromophore and photoswitchability with favorable water interactions on the surface of the protein that counteracts the original interaction. We suggest that applying this understanding of structural features that inhibit or favor rotation on the excited state can be applied for rational design of new, tunable and red photoswitches.

         <title>Epitopes displayed in a cyclic peptide scaffold bind SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus that causes COVID&#8208;19 is a global health issue. The spread of the virus has resulted in more than six million deaths to date. The emergence of new viral strains highlights the importance of continuous surveillance of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus, using timely and accurate diagnostic tools. Here, we used stable cyclic peptide scaffolds to present antigenic sequences derived from spike protein, reactive to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies. Using peptide sequences from different domains of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, we grafted epitopes on the peptide scaffold sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI&#8208;1). These scaffold peptides were then used to develop a SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 ELISA to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies in serum. We show that displaying epitopes in the scaffold improves reactivity overall. One of the scaffold peptides (S2_1146&#8208;1161_c) has reactivity equal to commercial assays, and shows diagnostic potential.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are important building blocks for constructing functional structures and have been applied in various fields. Considering the significant structural and functional roles of cyclic peptides in materials science and the attributed biophysical advantages, we provide an overview of cyclic peptide types that can self&#8208;assemble to form nanotubes and the recent progress in stimuli&#8208;triggered cyclic peptide assembly and the methods to construct peptide and polymer conjugates based on cyclic peptides with alternative chirality. Specifically, we highlight the roles that stimuli triggered cyclic peptides and their conjugates play in biomedical applications. Besides, recent progress for other cyclic peptides acting as gelators in drug delivery and biomedicine are also summarized. These cyclic peptides with properties in self&#8208;assembly are expected to act as adaptive systems for drug delivery and selective disease targeting.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Near&#8208;IR Absorbing Ruthenium(II) Complex as Photosensitizer for Photodynamic Therapy and its Cetuximab Bioconjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel Ru(II) cyclometalated photosensitizer (PS), Ru&#8208;NH2, for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of formula [Ru(appy)(bphen)2]PF6 (where appy = 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpyridine and bphen =&#160; bathophenanthroline) and its cetuximab (CTX) bioconjugates, Ru&#8208;Mal&#8208;CTX and Ru&#8208;BAA&#8208;CTX (where Mal = maleimide and BAA = benzoylacrylic acid) were synthesised and characterised. The photophysical properties of Ru&#8208;NH2 revealed absorption maxima around 580 nm with an absorption up to 725 nm. The generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) upon light irradiation was confirmed with a 1O2 quantum yield of 0.19 in acetonitrile. Preliminary in vitro experiments revealed the Ru&#8208;NH2 was nontoxic in the dark in CT&#8208;26 and SQ20B cell lines but showed outstanding phototoxicity when irradiated, reaching interesting phototoxicity indexes (PI) &gt; 370 at 670 nm, and &gt; 150 at 740 nm for CT&#8208;26 cells and &gt; 50 with NIR light in SQ20B cells. The antibody CTX was successfully attached to the complexes in view of the selective delivery of the PS to cancer cells. Up to four ruthenium fragments were anchored to the antibody (Ab), as confirmed by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass spectrometry. Nonetheless, the bioconjugates were not as photoactive as the Ru&#8208;NH2 complex.</dc:description>

         <title>De novo design of polyhedral protein assemblies: before and after the AI revolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembling polyhedral protein biomaterials have gained attention as engineering targets owing to their naturally evolved sophisticated functions, ranging from protecting macromolecules from the environment to spatially controlling biochemical reactions. Precise computational design of de novo protein polyhedra is possible through two main types of approaches: methods from first principles, using physical and geometrical rules, and more recent data&#8208;driven methods based on artificial intelligence (AI), including deep learning. Here, we retrospect first principle&#8208; and AI&#8208;based approaches for designing finite polyhedral protein assemblies, as well as advances in the structure prediction of such assemblies. We further highlight the possible applications of these materials and explore how the presented approaches can be combined to overcome current challenges and to advance the design of functional protein&#8208;based biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;based Drug discovery with Deep Learning</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of deep learning bears promise for drug discovery and chemical biology, e.g., to predict protein structure and molecular bioactivity, plan organic synthesis, and design molecules de novo. While most of the deep learning efforts in drug discovery have focused on ligand&#8208;based approaches, structure&#8208;based drug discovery has the potential to tackle unsolved challenges, such as affinity prediction for unexplored protein targets, binding&#8208;mechanism elucidation, and the rationalization of related chemical kinetic properties. Advances in deep learning methodologies and the availability of accurate predictions for protein tertiary structure advocate for a renaissance in structure&#8208;based approaches for drug discovery guided by AI. This review summarizes the most prominent algorithmic concepts in structure&#8208;based deep learning for drug discovery, and forecasts opportunities, applications, and challenges ahead.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Dynamics of Iron is a Key Player in the Catalysis of Non&#8208;heme Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mononuclear nonheme iron enzymes catalyze a large variety of oxidative transformations responsible for various biosynthesis and metabolism processes. Unlike their P450 counterparts, non&#8208;heme enzymes generally possess flexible and variable coordination architecture, which can endow rich reactivity for non&#8208;heme enzymes. This Concept highlights that the coordination dynamics of iron can be a key player in controlling the activity and selectivity of non&#8208;heme enzymes. In ergothioneine synthase EgtB, the coordination switch of the sulfoxide radical species enables the efficient and selective C&#8208;S coupling reaction. In iron(II)&#8208; and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent &#160;(Fe/2OG) oxygenases, the conformational flip of ferryl&#8208;oxo intermediate can be extensively involved in selective oxidation reactions. Especially, the five&#8208;coordinate ferryl&#8208;oxo species may allow the substrate coordination via O or N atom, which may facilitate the C&#8208;O or C&#8208;N coupling reactions via stabilizing the transition states and inhibiting the unwanted hydroxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Refining the dynamic network of T2SS endopilus tip hetero&#8208;complex combining cw&#8208;EPR and Nitroxide&#8208;Gd(III) distance measurements</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The type 2 secretion system (T2SS) is a bacterial nanomachine constituted by an inner membrane assembly platform, an outer membrane pore and a dynamic endopilus. T2SS endopili are organized into a homo&#8208;multimeric body formed by the major pilin capped by a hetero&#8208;complex of four minor pilins. The first model of the T2SS endopilus was recently released even if structural dynamics insights are still required to decipher the role of each protein in the full tetrameric complex. Here, we applied continuous wave and pulse EPR spectroscopy using nitroxide&#8208;gadolinium orthogonal labelling strategies to investigate the hetero&#8208;oligomeric assembly of the minor pilins. Overall, our data are in line with the endopilus model even if they evidenced conformational flexibility and alternative orientations at local scale of specific regions of minor pilins. The integration of different labelling strategies and EPR experiments demonstrates the pertinence of this approach to investigate protein&#8208;protein interactions in such multi protein hetero&#8208;complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructing the potency and cell&#8208;line selectivity of membranolytic&#160;anticancer peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current cancer treatments damage healthy cells and tissues, causing short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term side effects. New treatments are desired that show greater selectivity toward cancer cells and evade the common mechanisms of multidrug resistance. Membranolytic anticancer peptides (mACPs) hold promise against cancer and multidrug resistance. Amphipathicity, hydrophobicity, and net charge of mACPs participate in their respective interactions with cell membranes and their overall inhibition of cancer cells. To support the design of cell&#8208;line selective mACPs, we investigated the relationships that amino acid composition, physicochemical properties, sequence motifs and sequence homology could have with their potency and selectivity towards several healthy and cancer cell lines. Sequence length and net charge are known to affect the selectivity of mACPs between cancer and healthy cell lines. Our study reveals that increasing the net charge or flexibility (i.e., small and aliphatic residues) influences their selectivity between cancer cell lines with comparable lipid compositions.</dc:description>

         <title>Surfaceome profiling identifies basigin&#8208;chaperoned protein clients</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface proteome or &#8220;surfaceome&#8221; is a critical mediator of cellular biology, facilitating cell&#8208;tocell interactions and communication with extracellular biomolecules. Constituents of the surfaceome can serve as biomarkers for changing cell states and as targets for pharmacological intervention. While some pathways of cell surface trafficking are well characterized to allow prediction of surface localization, some non&#8208;canonical trafficking mechanisms do not. Basigin (Bsg), a cell surface glycoprotein, has been shown to chaperone protein clients to the cell surface. However, understanding which proteins are served by Bsg is not always straightforward. To accelerate such identification, we applied a surfaceome proximity labeling method that is integrated with quantitative mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics to discern changes in the surfaceome of hepatic stellate cells that occur in response to the genetic loss of Bsg. Using this strategy, we observed that the loss of Bsg leads to corresponding reductions in the cell surface expression of monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4. We also found that these relationships were unique to Bsg and not found in neuroplastin (Nptn), a related family member. These results establish the utility of the surfaceome proximity labeling method to determine clients of cell surface chaperone proteins.</dc:description>
