         <title>Artificial Peptides as Autophagy Modulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process that eliminates molecules and subcellular elements. This process is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and responding to various stressors, playing a key role in physiological development and the genesis of pathological conditions. This review summarizes recent advances in autophagy regulation strategies and the development of artificial peptide&#8208;based tools for monitoring and modulating autophagy.

Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosomal degradation pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infections, making precise modulation of autophagy a potentially promising therapeutic strategy. Artificial peptide&#8208;based autophagy modulators have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional small molecules, offering several advantages in terms of specificity, biocompatibility, and functional versatility. This review summarizes recent advances in artificial peptide&#8208;based autophagy monitoring tools, autophagy inducers, and autophagy inhibitors.

         <title>Homogeneous Electrochemical Enzyme&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay Strategy Based On pH&#8208;Mediated Redox Potential Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous electrochemical enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay platform is developed, which simplifies and accelerates signal acquisition in field settings. Target&#8208;induced pH change is carefully investigated. Highly sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative electrochemical detection is achieved with C&#8208;reactive protein as a model target.

Enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is widely recognized as the gold standard for protein detection. However, its reliance on expensive and bulky optical instruments limits its use in point&#8208;of&#8208;care and resource&#8208;limited settings. Electrochemical technique emerges as a promising alternative due to its low cost, portability, and simple instrumentation. However, conventional electrochemical methods often require complex surface modifications and suffer from variability between electrodes. To overcome these limitations, a novel homogeneous electrochemical ELISA platform has been developed, that simplifies and accelerates signal acquisition in field settings. This platform leverages pH changes caused by alkaline phosphatase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP, resulting in solution acidification. These pH variations are sensitively detected through shifts in the redox potential of methylene blue (MB), a proton&#8208;sensitive electrochemical probe. By quantitatively correlating the target protein concentration with MB redox potential shift, a sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative electrochemical detection of a model protein, C&#8208;reactive protein, is achieved. This versatile and cost&#8208;effective approach holds significant potential to expand the applicability of ELISA to point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <title>Quantitative Strategies for Decoding Organelle Ion Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights cutting&#8208;edge strategies for probing ion dynamics within organelles using fluorescent indicators. It discusses key advances in calibration techniques for absolute ion quantification and their impact on understanding organellar physiology, and concludes with future directions and applications in decoding ion&#8208;regulated processes in health and disease.

Ion dynamics within cellular organelles are fundamental to numerous biochemical processes, maintaining homeostasis and enabling critical cellular functions. Despite continuous ion movement across organelle membranes, stable ionic gradients are preserved, creating optimal microenvironments for organelle&#8208;specific activities such as ATP production in mitochondria, lysosomal degradation, Golgi&#8208;mediated protein modifications, and DNA processing in the nucleus. These gradients are regulated by specialized membrane proteins, including ion channels and transporters, which facilitate selective and controlled ion flux. Dysfunction in these regulatory proteins is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular conditions, immune dysfunctions, and cancers. Understanding ion regulation mechanisms at the molecular level is not only essential for basic cell biology but also crucial for revealing pathological pathways and identifying therapeutic targets. Recent technological advances&#8212;such as fluorescent probes based on green fluorescent protein, small molecules, and DNA nanodevices&#8212;have significantly enhanced our ability to study ion dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. These tools enable both qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering insights into ion transport mechanisms and their physiological relevance. A comprehensive overview of the principles underlying functional imaging of ion dynamics is provided, current challenges in quantitative assessment are highlighted, and future directions in organelle&#8208;specific ion regulation are discussed.

         <title>Novel Platinum(II) Tetrazine Complex Capable of Live&#8208;Cell IEDDA Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Pt(II) tetrazine complex, trans&#8208;[PtCl2(dmso)(CH3&#8208;Tz&#8208;Bz&#8208;NH2)] (1), is reported, showing good cytotoxicity against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells and undergoing IEDDA reactions with TCO and BCN derivatives. A live&#8208;cell IEDDA reaction in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells with a BCN&#8208;bearing BF2&#8208;azadipyrromethene fluorophore is tracked via FLIM, owing to a 0.3&#8201;ns lifetime shift.

The development of the first Pt(II) tetrazine complex, trans&#8208;[Pt(II)Cl2(dmso)(CH3&#8208;Tz&#8208;Bz&#8208;NH2)] (1), is reported, which exhibits good in&#8201;vitro cytotoxicity against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells and succesfully undergoes inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN) derivates in solution. We demonstrate a live&#8208;cell IEDDA reaction of 1 with a BF2&#8208;azadipyrromethene fluorophore (NIR&#8208;AZA) posessing a BCN handle. A live&#8208;cell bioorthogonal reaction is established using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), through a fluorescence lifetime change of 0.3&#8201;ns from BF2&#8208;azadipyrromethene fluorophore starting material to IEDDA Pt fluorophore reaction product. As there is a distinct difference in fluorescence lifetimes between starting material and product, this approach removes the necessity for designing challenging off to on fluorogenic Pt probes and washing steps when developing bioorthogonal cell&#8208;imaging strategies for Pt complexes.

         <title>Investigating the Interaction Profile of Unconjugated Ubiquitin: Chemical Biology and Affinity Enrichment Mass Spectrometric Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini review provides insights into the synergistic power of chemical biology techniques for generating defined ubiquitin (Ub) variants and the use of affinity enrichment mass spectrometry to decipher the Ub code. It focuses on unconjugated Ub variants, which have emerged as additional signaling molecules in the Ub lexicon. Furthermore, it outlines the use of this approach with Ub&#8208;like proteins. (Figure created in BioRender. (2025) https://BioRender.com/7vby989).

The covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to target proteins (ubiquitylation) represents one of the most versatile post&#8208;translational modifications (PTM) in eukaryotic cells. Substrate modifications range from a single Ub moiety being attached to a target protein to complex Ub chains that can also contain Ubls (Ub&#8208;like proteins) or chemical modifications like acetylation or phosphorylation. The entirety of this complex system is entitled as &#8220;the Ub code&#8221;. To regulate the Ub code, cells have an arsenal of enzymes to install, translate, and reverse these modifications. However, deciphering the Ub code is challenging due to the difficulty of generating defined Ub/Ubl&#8722;protein conjugates. In this mini review, an overview of chemical biology techniques for the generation of defined Ub variants and their subsequent application in affinity enrichment experiments to identify interacting proteins by mass spectrometry is provided. The main focus is on unconjugated Ub variants since they are not well understood even though a &#8220;second messenger&#8221;&#8208;like function of those have been found. Finally, the opportunities to expand this approach to Ubl proteins are briefly discussed.

GA: Cross&#8208;linking of hyaluronic acid modified by a strained alkyne with a photosensitive crosslinker terminating in azides gives hydrogels with tuneable mechanical properties. By tuning the wavelength of employed light, the hydrogel can either be fully degraded allowing harvesting of cultured cells or softened resulting in notable changes in cell morphology.

Properties of semisynthetic hydrogels can be fine&#8208;tuned, making these attractive for various applications in regenerative medicine. Herein, a hydrogel platform based on hyaluronic acid (HA) modified by (1R, 8S,9S)&#8208;bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) and a cross&#8208;linker composed of light&#8208;sensitive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains terminating in azides is described. The two components can undergo strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition resulting in rapid gel formation. First, adipose&#8208;derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are incorporated in the hydrogel and it is demonstrated that the cells can be easily retrieved by UV light&#8208;mediated degradation, maintaining viability and retaining spindle&#8208;like shape when the cells are replated. Next, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of inducing light&#8208;mediated softening of the hydrogel to modulate the morphology of the encapsulated cells is provided. A co&#8208;culture of endothelial cells (cord blood&#8208;derived endothelial colony forming cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived MSCs), which is commonly studied for their ability to form capillary&#8208;like vascular networks, is cultured in the regular and light&#8208;induced softened hydrogels. Nonphotoexposed hydrogels show cells with a prevalently rounded morphology, whereas stretched cells connecting into a primitive capillary network are observed in the light&#8208;softened hydrogels. Photo&#8208;induced softening offers potential to locally control cell shape and self&#8208;organization capacity.

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Flexibility of GrsB Thioesterase Leads to the Structural Reassignment of a Gramicidin S Variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the substrate specificity of gramicidin S synthetase B&#8208;thioesterase reveals stereochemical flexibility, enabling the production of gramicidin S (GS) analogs with L&#8208; or D&#8208;Ser(Allyl). Structural reassignment of a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA) obtained from precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis is achieved using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and antimicrobial assays.

Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide derived from two pentapeptides. The C&#8208;terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of gramicidin S synthetase B (GrsB) dimerizes precursor pentapeptides and cyclizes the resulting linear decapeptide. Recently, a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA), in which a single D&#8208;Phe is replaced by L&#8208;Ser(Allyl), is reported via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis in a native GS producer. To understand how GrsB&#8208;TE processes such modified precursors, its substrate specificity using synthetic linear peptides is investigated. GrsB&#8208;TE cyclizes a substrate containing L&#8208;Ser(Allyl) at position 6 but not at position 1. However, the enzymatically synthesized GS&#8208;SA shows a different high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography retention time than that of the reported GS variant. Further structural and functional analyses, including 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, antimicrobial assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, reveal that the reported GS&#8208;SA contained D&#8208;Ser(Allyl) rather than L&#8208;Ser(Allyl). These findings reveal a previously unrecognized stereochemical flexibility in GrsB&#8208;TE and support the structural revision of the reported GS variant.

         <title>Aspartimide Formation and Its Prevention in Fmoc Chemistry Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aspartimide formation remains a persistent challenge in Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis. This review surveys strategies to prevent aspartimide formation, covering protecting group design, backbone protection, and alternative deprotection approaches. Continued development of scalable, compatible tactics is key to advancing peptide synthesis.

Aspartimide formation remains a persistent challenge during Fmoc chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis. This review outlines various strategies to suppress base&#8208;mediated aspartimide formation, including the use of ester &#946;&#8208;carboxyl protecting groups, non&#8208;ester&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;carboxyl masking groups, and backbone&#8208;protecting groups. In addition, alternatives to the Fmoc group are explored that are cleavable under nonbasic conditions. The work discussed in this review highlights that the continued development of compatible and scalable tactics toward aspartimide prevention is essential for advancing peptide synthesis in both research and industry.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Dithiocarbamato Glycoconjugates as Potential Anticancer Agents: Design, Physico&#8208;Chemical Characterization, and In Vitro Biological Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates based on gold(III), gold(I)&#8208;phosphino, and gold(I)&#8208;carbene scaffolds are here investigated as potential anticancer agents. Contrary to expectations, they induce cell death by acting at the extracellular level rather than targeting overexpressed glucose transporters.

To develop new metal&#8208;based glycoconjugates as potential anticancer agents, three gold(III)&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates of the type [AuIIIBr2(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)] (Au3&#8208;5), their gold(I)&#8208;phosphine counterparts [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(PPh3)] (AuP3&#8208;5), and gold(I)&#8208;carbene analogs [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(Et2BzImy)] (AuC3&#8208;5) (Inp: isonipecotic moiety; GlcN: amino&#8208;glucose scaffold; Et2BzImy: 1,3&#8208;diethylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene moiety), as well as the corresponding non&#8208;glycosylated counterparts (Au1&#8208;2, AuP1&#8208;2, and AuC1&#8208;2) bearing a terminal ester or amide function, are generated and characterized by means of several analytical techniques (FT&#8208;IR, 1H&#8208;/13C&#8208;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X&#8208;ray crystallography). Their stability under physiologically relevant conditions (phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution) has also been evaluated. Contrary to the gold(III)&#8208;glycoconjugates, the glucose&#8208;functionalized gold(I) derivatives show a significant antiproliferative effect against colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29), metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF&#8208;7) cells, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, the gold(I)&#8208;phosphine derivatives turning up to be the best performers. Cell uptake studies show no evident correlation between cell growth inhibition and cellular uptake, and the use of glucose&#8208;free cell culture media and a GLUT1 inhibitor rules out the involvement of glucose transporters in cell internalization, thus suggesting alternative cell death pathways such as acting at extracellular level (especially for the gold(I) derivatives).

         <title>Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation&#8208;Based Analysis of Advanced Small&#8208;Molecule Kinase Inhibitors Identified pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA Binders</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated computational approach evaluating the binding between pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 microRNA and small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) revealed varied pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 binding affinities among the advanced SMKIs. The results justified the characterization of potential RNA targets for kinase inhibitors and small molecules with protein targets in general.

RNAs play crucial roles in various cellular actions, and the uncontrolled expression or improper folding of RNAs is a cause of many diseases. Certain oncogenic phenotypes stem from the overexpression of regulatory microRNAs that contain secondary structural elements. Thus, targeting disease&#8208;related microRNAs with small molecules is a potential therapeutic&#160;strategy that has attracted growing interest. To probe the RNA&#8208;binding chemical space held in advanced small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, in this work, we screened the 78 FDA&#8208;approved small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) as representatives of the most advanced kinase inhibitors for their binding affinity with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA via a combination of computational methods and biophysical measurement. The best&#8208;ranked SMKIs based on docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by analysis of different computational parameters. Collectively, it provided reliable information on the binding affinity for the top&#8208;performed SMKI in the formation of SMKI&#8211;miRNA complexes with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7. Furthermore, the identification of the predicted most promising SMKI&#8211;miRNA interactions was validated by microscale thermophoresis, measuring direct binding affinities. This study evaluating the binding landscapes of the 78 FDA&#8208;approved SMKIs with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA served as an example highlighting the necessity to characterize the biological targets of SMKIs, many of which are FDA&#8208;approved cancer agents, at the transcriptomic level with RNAs.

&lt;p&gt;An integrated computational approach evaluating the binding between pre-&lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; microRNA and small-molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) revealed varied pre-&lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; binding affinities among the advanced SMKIs. The results justified the characterization of potential RNA targets for kinase inhibitors and small molecules with protein targets in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNAs play crucial roles in various cellular actions, and the uncontrolled expression or improper folding of RNAs is a cause of many diseases. Certain oncogenic phenotypes stem from the overexpression of regulatory microRNAs that contain secondary structural elements. Thus, targeting disease-related microRNAs with small molecules is a potential therapeutic&#160;strategy that has attracted growing interest. To probe the RNA-binding chemical space held in advanced small-molecule therapeutics, in this work, we screened the 78 FDA-approved small-molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) as representatives of the most advanced kinase inhibitors for their binding affinity with pre-&lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; miRNA via a combination of computational methods and biophysical measurement. The best-ranked SMKIs based on docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by analysis of different computational parameters. Collectively, it provided reliable information on the binding affinity for the top-performed SMKI in the formation of SMKI&#8211;miRNA complexes with pre-&lt;i&gt;let-7.&lt;/i&gt; Furthermore, the identification of the predicted most promising SMKI&#8211;miRNA interactions was validated by microscale thermophoresis, measuring direct binding affinities. This study evaluating the binding landscapes of the 78 FDA-approved SMKIs with pre-&lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; miRNA served as an example highlighting the necessity to characterize the biological targets of SMKIs, many of which are FDA-approved cancer agents, at the transcriptomic level with RNAs. The study also illustrates the possibility that the interaction with RNA targets may contribute to the observed biological and clinical performance of these approved SMKIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic Fluorophores on Citrate&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles for Fluorogenic Detection of Nanomolar Amyloid Beta Monomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic fluorophores are prepared from their respective radical species, after release of an electron, and are utilized for amyloid beta detection after being conjugated with citrate&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles. The turn&#8208;on fluorescence mechanism is used for detect amyloid beta monomer in nanomolar concentration from 10 to 130 nM.

Gold nanoparticle&#8208;based fluorogenic enhancement for detection of analytes requires a strategy to quench the fluorescence property of the fluorophore effectively before the treatment of analytes. The designing principle of the fluorophore for gold nanoparticle surface coverage is challenging in comparison with chemical modification of a small organic fluorophore for similar quenching. In this report, the ionic interactions between negatively charged gold nanoparticle and cationic fluorophores have been considered . The interaction between two ionic systems is much more effective than the interaction between charged gold nanoparticle and neutral fluorophore for fluorescence quenching. This simple and sensitive strategy for selective nanomolar detection of monomeric amyloid beta (A&#946;) has been demonstrated using the combination of citrate&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and cationic fluorophores (1 and 2). The cationic fluorophores have been generated in aqueous medium from their corresponding radicals by releasing electron. The prompt turn on fluorescence response of 1 has found to be superior to the similar response from 2. The response is suitable for the fluorogenic detection of A&#946; monomer within the concentration range 10&#8211;130&#8201;nM. Further, both the cationic probes have further been utilized successfully to detect monomeric A&#946; level in artificial cerebrospinal fluid and human serum albumin.

         <title>Hijacking the Electron Train: Menaquinone&#8208;Binding Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Menaquinone is an emerging target for antimicrobial peptides. Could it be the new Achilles&#8217; Heel of bacteria?

The rise of antibiotic resistance threatens to undermine modern medicine, making the development of new antibiotics and novel targets an urgent priority. Among emerging strategies, targeting menaquinone (MK), a membrane&#8208;bound electron carrier, has gained traction as a promising yet underexplored approach. MK is only used for electron transport in bacteria, making it an attractive, selective antimicrobial target. Since the discovery of the first MK&#8208;binding antimicrobial peptide (MBAMP), lysocin E, several other examples, natural and synthetic, have been reported. Given the dire need for new antibiotics that are structurally and mechanistically distinct from anything that has come before, MBAMPs potentially offer new hope in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. This review covers recent advances in the discovery, characterization, synthesis and derivatization, and mechanistic understanding of MBAMPs.

         <title>A Thermostable Fatty Acid Hydratase from Marinitoga Piezophila with Low Temperature Optimum and Broad Product Scope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare thermostable Fatty Acid Hydratase ortholog from Marinitoga Piezophila, a thermo&#8208;piezophilic organism, displays novel properties. While the enzyme has excellent thermostability (retaining full activity after incubation at 70&#176;C), quite interestingly, it shows the highest activity at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover the enzyme has a broad substrate scope and unique regioselectivity. 

Hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) are valuable derivatives of fatty acids (FAs) with interesting bioactivities. Moreover, they are used in materials industry as additives, starting materials and surfactants. HFAs can be produced from FAs either by hydroxylation or by hydration reaction, if FA is unsaturated, using chemical or enzymatic methods. FA hydratases (FAHs) are promising biocatalysts for HFA synthesis thanks to their non&#8208;redox nature, high efficiency and excellent selectivity. Although FAHs are relatively more stable compared to other enzymes like monooxygenases, their tolerance to high temperature and organic solvents is limited. In this study, we characterized a rare thermostable FAH ortholog through database gene mining. This enzyme from Marinitoga Piezophila, a thermo&#8208;piezophilic organism, displayed novel properties, including broad substrate scope, broad pH range, unique regioselectivity and excellent thermostability (retaining full activity after 30&#8201;min incubation at 70&#8201;&#176;C); however, quite interestingly, its temperature optimum was at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Although kinetic parameters indicate a less efficient enzyme compared to some other FAHs, the enzyme can reach over 90% conversion within 24&#8201;h at a 100&#8201;mL scale reaction containing 1.75&#8201;mM substrate. Furthermore, mutagenesis of key active&#8208;site residues indicated a possibly different reaction mechanism compared to earlier proposed mechanisms.

         <title>Characterizing Mixed Single&#8208;Chain Amphiphile&#8208;Based Coacervates as a Robust Protocell System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphiles present in the early Earth's prebiotic soup have been shown to readily self&#8208;assemble into compartments. However, their assembly into coacervates remains underexplored. In this study, coacervates resulting from nonanoic acid (NA), nonanol (NOH) and tyramine have been characterized. These remain stable across a wide range of pH, temperature and salt conditions. They also efficiently sequester RNA and support nonenzymatic RNA primer extension, highlighting their potential role as protocells.

Prebiotic soup would have been a dilute pool of chemicals, which would have undergone reactions to form biologically relevant precursors during life's origin. Herein, compartments formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can concentrated these chemicals, thereby catalyzing their reactions. In this backdrop, LLPS&#8208;based systems are being studied, with a decanoic acid&#8208;based coacervate system recently described as a model protocell. This is in contrast to studies where fatty acids vesicles are predominantly explored as protocells. Further, exogenous delivery and endogenous synthesis of fatty acids suggest greater prevalence of shorter chain lengths of single&#8208;chain amphiphiles on the early Earth. In this backdrop, a mixed amphiphile&#8208;based coacervate system composed of nonanoic acid (NA), nonanol (NOH) and tyramine&#160;is&#160;characterized, which can form coacervates over a broad range of pHs, temperatures, and salt concentrations. This is noteworthy as compositionally heterogenous vesicles have also been shown to have advantages over pure fatty acid vesicles. Additionally, RNA sequestration&#160;is demonstrated in these coacervates, which gets enhanced upon addition of cationic amino acids, emphasizing the importance of cosolute interactions in the prebiotic soup. Nonenzymatic template&#8208;directed primer extension is&#160;also&#160;demonstrated in these coacervates, suggesting a potential functional role for these compartments during life's origin.

         <title>Biofilm Eradication Using Water&#8208;Soluble Silver(I) Coumarin Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin&#8208;based silver complexes have excellent antimicrobial activity, but such complexes are typically insoluble in water and unstable under ambient light conditions. Herein, a water soluble coumarin&#8208;silver(I) complex is successfully prepared with the ability to eradicate preformed MRSA biofilms. A triphenylphosphine adduct of the complex lost all antimicrobial activity, though an improvement in solubility and light stability are noted.

Water&#8208;soluble photostable coumarin acetate complexes of silver(I) are successfully synthesized and characterized and found to have the ability to eradicate preformed MRSA biofilms. Substitution with short PEG chains at the 4&#8208;position of the coumarin ring allows the subsequent synthesis of water&#8208;soluble coumarin oxyacetate ligands which successfully allowed silver(I) complex formation. The new complexes are characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, microanalysis and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry where possible. Previous unPEGylated analogs has shown excellent antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic bacteria MRSA, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and that activity is maintained in the PEGylated complexes. However, the solubility of the un&#8208;PEGylated analogs is limited to DMSO, and those silver(I) complexes are unstable in ambient light conditions. Both issues are resolved with the new PEGylated complexes reported here and importantly the ability to eradicate preformed biofilms of MRSA is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Coumarin-based silver complexes have excellent antimicrobial activity, but such complexes are typically insoluble in water and unstable under ambient light conditions. Herein, a water soluble coumarin-silver(I) complex is successfully prepared with the ability to eradicate preformed MRSA biofilms. A triphenylphosphine adduct of the complex lost all antimicrobial activity, though an improvement in solubility and light stability are noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble photostable coumarin acetate complexes of silver(I) are successfully synthesized and characterized and found to have the ability to eradicate preformed MRSA biofilms. Substitution with short PEG chains at the 4-position of the coumarin ring allows the subsequent synthesis of water-soluble coumarin oxyacetate ligands which successfully allowed silver(I) complex formation. The new complexes are characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, microanalysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry where possible. Previous unPEGylated analogs has shown excellent antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic bacteria MRSA, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and that activity is maintained in the PEGylated complexes. However, the solubility of the un-PEGylated analogs is limited to DMSO, and those silver(I) complexes are unstable in ambient light conditions. Both issues are resolved with the new PEGylated complexes reported here and importantly the ability to eradicate preformed biofilms of MRSA is demonstrated. In addition, a triphenylphosphine adduct complex is also synthesized, but this complex has reduced activity compared to the simple PEGylated complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Cytosolic Uptake of Cell Penetrating Peptides with Shortened Sidechains</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The shorter, the better: Herein, the arginine octamer analog mR8 is demonstrated, which features a shortened sidechain relative to R8 and homoR8, and enters cells via direct translocation. In contrast, peptides R8 and homoR8 primarily utilize endocytosis for cellular entry under the same conditions.

Endocytosis and direct translocation serve as the primary mechanisms by which cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) enter cells. Understanding these pathways is vital for unraveling the complexities of cellular uptake, which bears significant relevance to progress in various fields. In this study, the intracellular distribution of arginine octamer analogs is demonstrated to correlate with the length of their side chains. Specifically, peptides with elongated sidechains exhibit enhanced cellular uptake efficiency and a preferential endosomal distribution, whereas mR8&#8212;a peptide with a shortened sidechain&#8212;primarily enters cells via direct translocation and displays cytosolic/nuclear localization. It is further revealed that these structurally analogous peptides exhibit distinct diffusion characteristics and complexation behaviors with model glycosaminoglycans. These findings contribute to a deeper molecular understanding of the cellular uptake mechanisms of peptides.

         <title>Resonance Raman Spectroscopic Study of the Unusual [4Fe&#8208;4S]2+ Cluster of IspH, the Last Enzyme of the Methylerythritol Phosphate Pathway for Terpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy confirms that the apical Fe atom of the [4Fe&#8208;4S]2+ cluster of IspH is linked to H2O molecules and that the (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl diphosphate substrate and the propargyl diphosphate inhibitor lead to a change of coordination geometry. The loss of octahedral coordination of the apical Fe atom is also very likely when the dimethylallyl diphosphate product is added, while no change is observed with isopentenyl diphosphate.

IspH is the last enzyme of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway. It catalyzes the reductive dehydroxylation of (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl diphosphate into isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are precursors for the biosynthesis of terpenoids, essential molecules for the survival of all living organisms. This pathway is absent in humans, making it a promising target for drug discovery. Escherichia coli IspH harbors an unusual [4Fe&#8208;4S]2+ cluster linked to three conserved cysteines with a unique iron site proposed to be coordinated to three water molecules. Here, the first resonance Raman spectroscopic study of the cluster of IspH in the 2+ oxidation state is reported. Using isotopic labeling with 2H2O and H218O, the bands of the cluster that are sensitive to water coordination or hydrogen bonding are identified. The change of geometry of the cluster upon binding of the substrate, an alkyne diphosphate inhibitor, and the two enzyme products is also analyzed. Distinct binding modes to the cluster may indeed be at the origin of the different distribution of IPP and DMAPP observed during catalysis.

         <title>Local and Global Behavior of Unfolded and Intrinsically Disordered Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ramachandran plots of amino acid residues of short peptides show that the sampled conformational space is smaller than assumed by the classical random coil model. At variance withthe latter, it depends on the type of nearest neighbor in a polypeptide chain. . Considering nearest neighbor interactions is pivotal for reproducing conformational distributions of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins.

Intrinsically disordered and artificially denatured foldable proteins have many properties in common, even though the distribution of amino acid residues generally differ. Both are traditionally described as either adopting molten globule or random coil&#8208;like structure, depending on their amino acid composition. For a long period of time, it was believed that with the exception of glycine and proline, conformational preferences of individual amino acid residues are very similar, and therefore, not of great concern. This article discusses experimental and bioinformatical data which show that individual Ramachandran plot distributions in unfolded proteins depend on the characteristics of side chains. Furthermore, ample experimental evidence suggests the presence of nearest neighbor interactions between residues which are ignored in the classical random coil model. The article reviews and discusses work that emphasizes the necessity of a thorough understanding of the local behavior of disordered and unfolded proteins alike for an understanding of the coiled state of proteins. Unresolved issues are delineated and research perspectives suggested.

         <title>Characterization of the Cubamyces Menziesii Terpenome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome of Cubamyces menziesii reveals 18 putative sesquiterpene cyclase genes. These genes are cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding 10 active enzymes. Using farnesyl diphosphate as substrate, the enzymes are analyzed, and the products characterized after bioconversion, uncovering diverse sesquiterpene structures. This study highlights the phylogenetic prediction and the ecological and biotechnological relevance of C. menziesii sesquiterpenes.

Long&#8208;lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, the genome of Cubamyces (C.) menziesii and identified 18 genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases (STCs) is explored. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, the 18 codon&#8208;optimized open reading frames are cloned and overproduced the C. menziesii STCs in Escherichia coli. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme is purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these 10 enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes is determined by (GC&#8208;MS) gas chromatography mass spectrometry and (NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Among the 10 enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds, and the remaining two acted as a multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore C. menziesii and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Route toward a De&#8201;Novo Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Baclofen Based on Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation and Enzymatic Transamination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique chemoenzymatic synthesis route toward (S)&#8208;baclofen is presented, which highlights a hydroformylation and biocatalysis step toward the synthesis of such a challenging &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid. The shown methodology exhibits high conversions and enantiomeric excess and is transferable to other &#946;&#8208;chiral amines and amino acids.

This study explores the chemoenzymatic synthesis of (S)&#8208;baclofen, which involves a sequential combination of transition metal catalysis and biocatalysis. The synthesis approach starts from a readily accessible cinnamic acid ester that is converted using a rhodium&#8208;based hydroformylation catalyst toward the corresponding chiral aldehyde. This compound is subsequently converted via a transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reaction system that yields the desired &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid ester and the final free &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid (S)&#8208;baclofen after a simple hydrolysis reaction. This synthesis concept does provide high atom efficiency and does not require an additional chiral resolution step of a racemic product.

         <title>Nonmetal Methoxy&#8208;Porphyrin Nanophotosensitizers: An Antitumor Agent for Photodynamic Therapy against Breast Cancer and Cervical Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin photosensitizers exhibit excellent photodynamic antitumor effects. Their strong cytotoxicity and good antitumor efficacy at the cellular level make them potentially valuable for the treatment of breast cancer and cervical cancer, demonstrating broad&#8208;spectrum and high&#8208;efficiency activity.

With the continuous development of precision medicine and personalized treatment, traditional therapeutic approaches such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are increasingly unable to meet the ever&#8208;changing clinical needs. Therefore, developing highly efficient, low&#8208;toxicity, and well&#8208;targeted treatment strategies has become an urgent priority in cancer therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has made significant strides in tumor treatment in recent years. Among the various materials used in PDT, porphyrin photosensitizers have emerged as one of the most utilized options due to their exceptional photodynamic activity, excellent targeting ability, low toxicity, and versatility. Here, this study selects nonmetal methoxy&#8208;porphyrin nanophotosensitizers as high&#8208;performance antitumor materials. Both in&#8201;vitro and in&#8201;vivo analyses demonstrate that these nanophotosensitizers efficiently generate reactive oxygen species, exhibiting significant cytotoxic effects at the cellular level. In tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models using 4T1 and HeLa cells, they show remarkable tumor inhibition, confirming their therapeutic potential in breast and cervical cancer models. Transcriptomic sequencing further reveals their regulatory roles in tumor&#8208;related signaling pathways. Overall, these findings highlight the exceptional antitumor properties of nonmetal methoxy&#8208;porphyrin nanophotosensitizers and provide foundational evidence for their application in PDT for gynecological malignancies.

         <title>A Browser&#8208;Based Tool for Assessing Accuracy of Isothermal Titration Calorimetry&#8208;Derived Parameters: Kd, &#916;H&#176;, and n</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate Kd determination is crucial for drug discovery and diagnostics. Accuracy confidence intervals (ACI)&#8208;ITC, a browser&#8208;based tool, calculates ACI for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)&#8208;derived parameters, considering systematic errors in concentration and heat measurements. By offering probabilistic ranges for true Kd, &#916;H&#176;, and stoichiometry value n, ACI&#8208;ITC enhances experimental reliability, guiding better decisions, streamlining cross&#8208;platform accuracy assessments, and improving trust in ITC&#8208;based findings.

Accurate determination of equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) is essential for decision&#8208;making in drug discovery and diagnostics development. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which requires no reactant labeling or immobilization, is commonly used to validate Kd values from high&#8208;throughput screens. Yet, like other methods, ITC results can be skewed by systematic errors in reactant concentrations, a fact that is often overlooked, potentially leading to misinformed decisions. To address this, accuracy confidence intervals (ACI)&#8208;ITC is developed, a browser&#8208;based tool that calculates ACI for ITC&#8208;derived parameters, offering probabilistic ranges for the true values of Kd, enthalpy change (&#916;H&#176;), and binding stoichiometry (n). Unlike traditional confidence intervals that consider only random errors, ACI&#8208;ITC explicitly accounts for systematic errors, providing a more accurate framework to assess experimental reliability. Alongside a user&#8208;friendly interface, it offers detailed guidance for determining uncertainties in concentrations and heat, which are critical inputs for assessing measurement accuracy. The tool's browser&#8208;based accessibility (https://aci.sci.yorku.ca) eliminates the need for specialized installation, enabling cross&#8208;platform compatibility and streamlining accuracy assessments. By highlighting the importance of systematic errors and providing a structured approach for their evaluation, ACI&#8208;ITC supports more robust conclusions, fosters better&#8208;informed decisions based on ITC measurements, and enhances the reliability of research findings.

         <title>Chromenone Derivatives as CRM1 Inhibitors for Targeting Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromenone derivatives are synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of chromosome region maintenance 1&#8208;mediated nuclear export, targeting glioblastoma cells. Active compounds demonstrate structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent inhibition, supported by structure&#8211;activity relationships and molecular docking studies. Selected analogs induce nuclear retention of endogenous proteins, show selective cytotoxicity against glioblastoma cell lines, and highlight promising potential for targeted cancer therapy.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers. Due to the complexity and redundancy within signaling networks in GBM, targeted inhibitors of specific pathways have shown only limited success. The nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target, as its inhibition can simultaneously disrupt multiple key oncogenic drivers. Herein, whether chromenone derivatives, known for detecting thiol&#8208;containing molecules, can function as CRM1 inhibitors is explored. Several chromenone&#8208;based derivatives are synthesized and it is demonstrated that they inhibit CRM1&#8208;driven nuclear export in a structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent manner. A preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship is established, providing a rationale for selective CRM1 binding based on molecular docking studies. Additionally, it is showed that the active chromenone derivatives effectively inhibit the nuclear export of endogenous nuclear export signal&#8208;containing substrates in GBM cells. Several of these compounds exhibit selective cytotoxicity against GBM cell lines, highlighting their potential as targeted therapies for GBM.

         <title>Cell Sensing via a Peptide/Single&#8208;Strand DNA Probe&#8208;Modified Au Screen&#8208;Printed Electrode</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide/single&#8208;strand DNA&#8208;modified screen&#8208;printed electrode is constructed for the detection of human myeloid leukemia cells. KK1B10 aptamer and electron&#8208;transfer peptides are selected as cell recognition and sensing moieties. Target cells are sensed in a range of 5 to 200 cells&#8201;mL. The recoveries of cells in human serum and bovine blood are estimated using the Au screen&#8208;printed electrode and are 99%&#8211;102%. Accordingly, the proposed method can be applied to the detection of target cells.

An electron&#8208;transfer/His&#8208;tag peptides&#8208;single&#8208;strand (ss) DNA probe is designed for the detection of cancer cells. Human myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cells) are commonly used as a model for target cancer cells. An electron&#8208;transfer peptide plays the role of a sensing moiety, and a His&#8208;tag moiety is introduced to purify the probe. A KK1B10 aptamer conjugated with the peptide sequence as an ss&#8208;DNA with target cell recognition properties is used. A probe with cysteine residue at the N&#8208;terminals is then immobilized on an Au screen&#8208;printed electrode (AuSPE). To evaluate the effect of the amino acid sequence in the probe, three types of probes are synthesized. The acetylated(Ac)&#8208;CYYCYYCH6&#8208;amino modifier C6(AmC6)KK1B10 aptamer probe proves to be a superior version. The K562 cells can interact with the probe on the electrode, and the electrode responses of the probe are decreased with increases in the concentrations of the cells. The peak currents are proportional to the concentrations of the cells and ranges from 5 to 200 cells&#8201;mL with a detection limit of 2 cells/mL. The recovery 99%&#8211;102% of K562 cells in human serum and bovine blood is calculated using the probe&#8208;modified AuSPE. Consequently, the proposed method can be applied to the detection of target cells.

The acetylated(Ac)-CYYCYYCH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-amino modifier C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(AmC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)KK1B10 aptamer probe proves to be a superior version. The K562 cells can interact with the probe on the electrode, and the electrode responses of the probe are decreased with increases in the concentrations of the cells. The peak currents are proportional to the concentrations of the cells and ranges from 5 to 200 cells&#8201;mL with a detection limit of 2 cells/mL. The recovery 99%&#8211;102% of K562 cells in human serum and bovine blood is calculated using the probe-modified AuSPE. Consequently, the proposed method can be applied to the detection of target cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fucose&#8208;Based Glycopolymeric Nanomicelles for Activated Platelet&#8208;Targeted Photothermal Thrombolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycopolymeric nanomicelles are designed with hydrophilic fucose segments for activated platelet&#8208;mediated targeting of thrombus, and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate core structure that enables the encapsulation of indocyanine green, thus, achieving precision photothermal thrombolysis.

Thrombotic disorders represent a significant global health burden, with conventional thrombolytic therapies often limited by systemic bleeding risks and inadequate thrombus specificity. To address these challenges, a biomimetic glycopolymer&#8208;based nanomicelle system is developed for precision thrombosis management. Utilizing reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer polymerization, a type of cationic glycopolymer is synthesized from dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and fucose monomers, which self&#8208;assembles into core&#8208;shell nanomicelles. The hydrophilic corona features multivalent fucose clusters that selectively bind to P&#8208;selectin on activated platelets within the thrombi, enabling targeted accumulation, while the hydrophobic core encapsulates the photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG), enhancing its aqueous solubility and photostability. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the ICG&#8208;loaded glycopolymeric nanomicelle, ICG@D20F20 exhibits efficient photothermal conversion, generating localized hyperthermia to disrupt fibrin networks. This platform offers several advantages, including precise targeting, synergistic thrombolysis, and enhanced biocompatibility, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional thrombolytics and providing a novel approach for minimally invasive, image&#8208;guided cardiovascular interventions.

         <title>Robotic&#8208;Assisted Capture&#8208;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment of RNA Aptamers Binding to Small Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the rapid selection of RNA aptamers that can target various small molecules through a newly established automated capture&#8208;systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technique. Throughout the study, this method is applied to aptamer selection for several small molecules, resulting in aptamers that bind with high specificity. The affinity of these aptamers is assessed using fluorescence polarization assays and isothermal calorimetry.

Due to their small size, stability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness compared to antibodies, aptamers developed by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) are promising candidates for the detection of small molecules. In SELEX, a small target molecule is usually covalently immobilized on a surface to separate bound from unbound nucleic acid sequences. However, this immobilization alters the molecule, that is, additional chemical entities are added and the electron distribution is altered, compromising the enrichment properties. To overcome this problem, a capture SELEX method has been successfully developed in which the RNA or DNA libraries are bound to a surface via a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide, and the soluble ligand is used to capture nucleic acids that bind to it from that surface. Herein, the development of an automated version of the capture SELEX method for the identification of RNA aptamers that bind small molecules is described. This method is fully automated and performs up to 12 iterative selection cycles without manual interference in 72&#8201;h. The approach is therefore suitable as rapid route to aptamers and enables resource&#8208;efficient test selections to assess &#8220;aptamerogenicity&#8221; of a target.

         <title>An Oxyprenylated Phenylpropanoid Pharmacologic Scaffold for SelU Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small library of natural oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids is investigated as potential inhibitors of tRNA 2&#8208;selenouridine synthase (MnmH, also called SelU), a member of the Mnm family of enzymes that modify uridine at the wobble position of specific tRNAs. Screening each compound against the N&#8208;terminal domain of SelU via fluorescence quenching methodology reveals details of substrate binding mode and conformational flexibility of this enzyme.

MnmH, better known as tRNA 2&#8208;selenouridine synthase (SelU), is a member of the Mnm family enzymes that work in concert to modify uridine at the wobble position. Instrumental in maintaining base pair fidelity and exclusive to bacteria, SelU is a promising drug target. Although no molecular structure has been experimentally calculated, insights into this enzyme's mechanism of catalysis have been empirically gleaned and proven useful for ligand&#8208;based rational drug design. In this study, a small group of natural and semisynthetic oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids were selected based on their compositional resemblance to the purported SelU ligands. Specifically, these compounds contained one or more geranyl groups branching from aromatic frameworks, all of which are believed to heighten affinity to SelU. Meticulous screening of each compound against an N&#8208;terminal SelU construct via fluorescence quenching of W83 further reveals details on the enzyme&#8208;substrate binding mode. Conformational flexibility of residues around W83 is suggested by the slow bimolecular quenching constants calculated for each compound. This is consistent with the single binding site and the blend of interaction&#8208;types calculated at the active site. Lastly, this general oxyprenylated framework, along with a cinnamic acid moiety, is established as a pharmacologic scaffold that can be further optimized into potential antibiotics.

         <title>Engineering of Amyloid Mimicking Peptide Modulating Side&#8208;Chain Polarity of Aromatic Amino Acid Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective tuning of side chain polarity in an aromatic peptide results supramolecular nanofibrils having amyloidogenic property. These nanofibrils also can arrest solvent molecules leading to sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel phase transition. Interestingly, the hydrogel material is mechanically robust and thixotropic in nature. 

Triggering higher order assembly, peptides form a number of nanoscale architectures. Self&#8208;assembly of phenylalanine homopeptides and its derivatives have been studied extensively, but the supramolecular assembly of aromatic peptides in interplay with side chain polarity is yet to be understood. Herein, the p&#8208;nitrophenylalanine, H&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;OH, a chemically modified aromatic amino acid, has been shuffled in a highly aromatic peptide, Boc&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH (P1), which results three mutated analogs having different polarity. The morphological investigation reveals that except Boc&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH (P2), all peptides aggregate into supramolecular nanofibrils in aqueous solution. The long entangled nanofibrils formed by Boc&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH (P3) are able to arrest the solvent molecules leading to &#8220;sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel&#8221; phase transition. Interestingly, the hydrogel is mechanically robust and the gel fibrils are amyloidogenic in nature. Conformational analysis reveals the presence of cross&#8208;&#946; arrangement of the &#946;&#8208;strand in the gel fibrils. The rheological studies explore the thixotropic property of the self&#8208;supported hydrogel matrix. The studies establish that the supramolecular interactions can be tuned modulating the side&#8208;chain polarity of the amino acid residues. Overall, it paves a new paradigm to fabricate peptide&#8208;based biomaterials for imminent applications.

The CP&#8208;1 might be a valuable carrier for DGL 13K, improving its stability and promoting membrane disruption. This presents a viable approach to creating new antimicrobial treatments to fight drug resistance, especially against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a promising avenue for combating drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections, but their clinical utility is often limited by poor bioavailability and stability. This study presents the design and synthesis of a novel, enantiomerically pure 2D&#8208;coordination polymer, {[Cu(dUMP)(dpp)2]&#183;3(H2O)&#183;(NO3)]}n (CP&#8208;1), derived from Cu(II) ions, deoxy&#8208;uridine monophosphate, and 1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (dpp), as a potential delivery system for AMPs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a 2D double helical structure with square pyramidal Cu(II) coordination. Spectroscopic characterization (IR, UV&#8211;vis, thermogravimetric analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction, circular dichroism) confirms the successful synthesis and reveals chirality transfer to the achiral dpp ligand. Molecular docking studies identify DGL 13K as the AMP exhibiting the strongest binding affinity to CP&#8208;1 (&#916;G&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;13.03&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Critically, molecular dynamics simulations provide detailed insights into the mechanism of action of the CP&#8208;1&#8211;DGL 13K complex against a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial membrane. The simulations demonstrate that DGL 13K, stabilized by CP&#8208;1, undergoes conformational changes, penetrating the membrane and disrupting its integrity through pore formation. These findings highlight the potential of CP&#8208;1 as an effective carrier for AMPs, enhancing their stability and facilitating membrane disruption, offering a promising strategy for developing novel antimicrobial therapies to combat drug resistance.

         <title>Genome Mining Reveals a Novel Nephthenol&#8208;Producing Diterpene Synthase from the Sandfly Lutzomyia Longipalpis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of a terpene synthase of insect origin that makes the apparently cryptic product nephthenol from geranylgeranyl diphosphate sheds light on hidden biosynthetic potential.

Populations of the sandfly, Lutzomyia longipalpis, use the diterpene sobralene as a sex/aggregation pheromone, which is likely produced in the insect through the activity of a recently discovered noncanonical terpene synthase (TPS). This study shows that the genome of this insect also contains another noncanonical TPS able to produce principally (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;nephthenol (isoserratol) from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. This diterpene alcohol does not appear to be produced by the sandfly, nor is the corresponding TPS gene transcribed, hence these findings suggest that insects may be a promising source of TPSs for apparently cryptic terpenoid products.

         <title>Rational Design and Bioactive Screening of Peptide Inhibitors Targeting Host&#8211;Pathogen Interactions in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops peptide inhibitors targeting SFTSV host&#8211;pathogen interactions, specifically blocking viral Gn binding to host receptors DC&#8208;SIGN and NMMHC&#8208;IIA. Using rational design and screening, peptides II&#8208;1 and II&#8208;4 exhibit potent antiviral activity, high binding affinity (KD&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;10&#8722;8&#8201;M), low cytotoxicity, and minimal hemolytic toxicity. Molecular dynamics confirm stable binding, offering a promising platform for SFTSV therapeutics.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) poses a significant threat to public health, with limited therapeutic options available. This study focuses on the rational design and screening of peptide inhibitors targeting host&#8211;pathogen interactions, specifically between the viral Gn glycoprotein and key host cell receptors, DC&#8208;SIGN and NMMHC&#8208;IIA. By employing molecular dynamics simulations, alanine scanning, and peptide docking techniques, peptides were designed to disrupt these protein&#8211;protein interactions. Among the synthesized candidates, peptides II&#8208;1 and II&#8208;4 demonstrate potent inhibitory activity against SFTSV infection, with reduced TCID50 values in cellular assays and displayed exceptional affinity (KD&#8201;=&#8201;7.381&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;8&#8201;M, 1.439&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;8&#8201;M), These peptides also exhibit low cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, highlighting their safety profile. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm strong binding affinities for these peptides, underpinned by stable hydrogen bonding interactions. This research provides a promising platform for developing peptide&#8208;based therapeutics targeting SFTSV, paving the way for further preclinical evaluation and clinical applications.

         <title>Identification of a l&#8208;Threonine&#8208;Utilizing Hydrazine Synthetase for Thrazarine Biosynthesis in Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A putative thrazarine biosynthetic gene cluster is discovered in the genome sequence of Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5. In&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro analyses of ThzN, a hydrazine synthetase with cupin and methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;like domains encoded in the cluster, showed that it synthesizes a key intermediate of thrazarine by catalyzing condensation between l&#8208;threonine and N6&#8208;hydroxylysine, followed by intramolecular rearrangement.

Hydrazine synthetases (HSs), consisting of cupin and methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like domains, catalyze hydrazine formation in the biosynthesis of various nitrogen&#63743;nitrogen (N&#63743;N) bond&#8208;containing secondary metabolites. The structural diversity of the N&#63743;N bond&#8208;containing secondary metabolites synthesized using this system is attributed to the diversity of amino acids (e.g., l&#8208;Glu, d&#8208;Glu, l&#8208;Ala, l&#8208;Tyr, l&#8208;Ser, and Gly) that are recognized by the MetRS domain. However, there are still many HS genes in the genome database whose substrates are unknown. This study identifies a putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for thrazarine, a diazo group&#8208;containing secondary metabolite with antitumor activity, by whole&#8208;genome sequencing of the thrazarine producer Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5. In&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro analyses showed that ThzN, an HS encoded by this BGC, synthesizes N&#8208;((5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;5&#8208;(amino)pentyl)amino)threonine from l&#8208;Thr and N6&#8208;hydroxylysine. This is the first example of l&#8208;Thr&#8208;utilizing HS. Sequence alignment analysis and structure prediction using Boltz&#8208;1 indicated that the space near Gly417 is important for the accommodation of the threonine side chain. The comparison of thrazarine BGC with azaserine BGC indicated that the biosynthetic mechanism of the diazo group of thrazarine is different from that of azaserine. This study expands the diversity of HSs and provides new insights into the biosynthesis of diazo groups.

The cover image illustrates the inhibition of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 by a small molecule inhibitor (in red) that covalently binds to cysteine at position 528. CRM1, a ring&#8208;shaped protein, is overexpressed in several human cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM). Its inhibition can disrupt three key oncogenic signaling pathways that drive GBM progression. CRM1 facilitates the nuclear export of proteins containing a nuclear export signal through the nuclear pore complex (depicted in yellow), which is embedded in the nuclear envelope, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. More details can be found in the article 10.1002/cbic.202500195 by Wolfgang Link and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Macromolecular High&#8208;Affinity Binding Probed by Advanced Fluorescence Techniques</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For interacting biomolecules in solution, confocal fluorescence microscopy enables some very effective approaches to characterize intermolecular binding in complex sample environments and with small sample consumption. These approaches range from fluorescence&#8208;based genetically encoded biosensors for use in living cells to the high controllability in measuring binding curves even at very low picomolar concentrations.

Due to the extreme sensitivity and the intrinsic selectivity of fluorescence techniques, high&#8208;affinity binding can be measured even at extremely low molecule concentrations in the picomolar range. In particular, modern advanced techniques with fluorescence microscopes have provided considerable methodological advancements in recent years. Here, a brief description of the basic physical principles of fluorescence detection and its experimental measurement setups are provided. For interacting biomolecules in solution, confocal fluorescence microscopy enables some very effective approaches to characterize binding in complex sample environments and with small sample consumption. In addition to standard techniques with bulk samples in classical spectrometers, applications with single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, two&#8208;color coincidence detection, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy are presented. The strength of the more advanced techniques lies in their broad applicability, ranging from fluorescence&#8208;based genetically encoded biosensors for use in living cells to the high controllability in the measurement of binding curves even at very low molecule concentrations. The advantages and limitations of the individual techniques are compared and recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are discussed.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Proteins in Single Live Cells: Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced imaging and molecular labeling techniques for spatiotemporal protein analysis in single live cells are reviewed. This article assesses how these cutting&#8208;edge tools unveil protein localization, dynamics, and functional interactions. Technical challenges, future prospects, and transformative applications in precision medicine and systems biology are discussed.

The spatio&#8208;temporal detection of proteins in living cells has always been an ongoing challenge. This complexity stems from the dynamic nature of the cellular environment, in which proteins interact in a highly regulated manner. Some innovative methods collectively represent important advances in overcoming the challenges associated with spatiotemporal detection of proteins in living cells. They are essential for elucidating cell biology and advancing therapeutic diagnostic techniques. However, the spatio&#8208;temporal organization of living intracellular vessels still lacks sufficient characterization. At present, there is a lack of review articles that comprehensively review the progress in recent years. This review aims to fill this gap by providing a broad overview of protein analysis in single living cells. In this review, the recent technical advances in the spatio&#8208;temporal analysis of proteins in single living cells are investigated, and the prospects and challenges in this direction are briefly discussed.

         <title>Designing the Proteome with Chemical Tools: Degrons and Beyond</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details recent advances in chemical strategies to control protein turnover. The tools capable of activating, finding, and bypassing degrons for targeted protein degradation are highlighted.

Cell biology relies on precise changes in protein stability, which can be chemically harnessed to transform cell fate. Decades of research have revealed the many intricate systems underlying cellular proteostasis, which can be hijacked by proximity&#8208;based degrader compounds. The archetypal degrader, proteolysis targeting chimera, recruits E3 ligases to protein targets to facilitate their ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Being able to customize the human proteome with chemical tools has great value for fundamental research and for clinical progress through the controlled elimination of disease&#8208;causing proteins. Success within the degrader field has reinvigorated interest in mapping the mechanisms underlying native protein degradation, which has platformed new degrader classes capable of advancing the field toward the goal of degrading the entire human proteome. This review discusses ongoing strategies to identify degrons regulating native protein turnover, advances in chemical tools to activate these degrons, and new attempts to streamline degron pathways for simplified targeted protein degradation. The continued discovery and application of degrons has the power to transform human biology and combat disease.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Biosynthetic Studies of Sordarin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent breakthroughs characterize the biosynthesis of fungal antibiotic sordarin. The pathway begins with terpenoid scaffold formation. Four successive cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated oxidations cascade, including a key C&#63743;C bond cleavage. A distinct Diels&#8211;Alderase enzyme SdnG then stereoselectively builds the norbornene core. Late&#8208;stage biosynthesis involves glycosyl transferase&#8208;catalyzed sugar attachment and further redox tailoring, producing the antibiotic.

Sordarin, a structurally distinct natural product&#8208;derived antifungal antibiotic targeting eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2, has undergone extensive biosynthetic characterizations in recent studies. This review highlights key advances in understanding its biosynthesis. These insights offer critical pathways for designing next&#8208;generation antifungal agents to address emerging resistance mechanisms.

         <title>Pancatalytic Tumor Therapy by Ultrasound Activation of Inorganic Sonosensitizers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 15, August 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated pancatalytic therapy mediated by sonosensitizers represents a paradigm shift, offering unprecedented spatial specificity and depth penetration capabilities. Herein, the state of US&#8208;activated pancatalytic tumor therapy is summarized, focusing on the classification and design principles of inorganic sonosensitizers, the cancer therapeutic efficacy enabled by sonocatalytic effect, and biosafety considerations for clinical use.

Pancatalytic therapy (PCT) is a comprehensive framework for disease management through the holistic control of catalytic and quasi&#8208;catalytic processes, including preparation (P) of catalysts, activation (A) of specific bio&#8208;effects, and nontoxic treatment (N) of different diseases. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated inorganic sonosensitizers have emerged as a powerful platform for pancatalytic tumor therapy, enabling precise and noninvasive cancer treatment through localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the specific sonocatalytic mechanism. Upon exposure to US activation, inorganic sonosensitizers generate electron&#8211;hole pairs that produce sonocatalytic effect, generating cytotoxic ROS to induce oxidative damage in tumor cells. With ongoing advances in nanomaterial design and US technology, inorganic sonosensitizers represent a transformative approach for precision oncology, offering a versatile and clinically translatable solution for the emerging pancatalytic tumor eradication. This comprehensive review summarizes and highlights recent developments in different kinds of inorganic sonosensitizers and their specific application for pancatalytic tumor therapy. This review begins with providing an overview of inorganic sonosensitizers. The focus is then shifted to US&#8208;activated pancatalytic tumor therapy with high therapeutic efficacy. The biosafety and biospecificity of US&#8208;activated sonosensitizers in combating tumor are further discussed. Finally, the critical challenges and perspectives on potential directions for future clinical translation of this technology are presented.

         <title>Internal Ubiquitin Electrophiles for Covalent Trapping and Inhibition of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GA: Genetically encoded internal electrophiles in ubiquitin (Ub) enable the profiling of multivalent interaction interfaces, addressing a key limitation of current Ub&#8208;based activity&#8208;based probes. In this study, these probes capture a Ub&#8211;deubiquitinase interaction with minimal structural perturbation and serve as selective diUb probes that covalently target the catalytic cysteines of Met1&#8208;specific Dubs. 

The ubiquitin (Ub) system governs vital cellular processes in eukaryotic biology through an intricate network of Ub&#8211;protein interactions. While semisynthetic C&#8208;terminal Ub electrophiles (UbEs) are widely used to study Ub transfer and deubiquitinase (Dub) activity, they are limited to probing the active site while leaving other functionally important sites unexplored. Building on previously identified multivalent interaction interfaces and potential allosteric sites which are key to understanding their dynamic nature, here we report the development of genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to covalently tether Ub&#8208;protein interactions in a proximity&#8208;driven manner at distal locations away from the active site. This study demonstrates that UbEs with internal electrophiles maintain conformational changes observed with their C&#8208;terminal counterparts while circumventing their limitations in capturing distal binding&#8208;site complexes, an emerging feature in Ub&#8208;mediated regulation. Genetically encoding these electrophiles further demonstrate rational variation as activity&#8208;based probes (ABP), leading to a Met1&#8208;diUb ABP showing preference for OTULIN over other Met1 cleaving Dubs. Taken together, our study introduces genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to explore the structural and biochemical significance of Ub&#8208;Dub interactions beyond the canonical S1 site, overcoming some limitations of traditional Ub C&#8208;terminal electrophiles.

         <title>Adding A C&#8208;Terminal Amino Acid Prevents the Conformational Interconversion of Plecantide Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic Peptide Conformational Locks: Plecanatide, an FDA&#8208;endorsed therapy for chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, faces stability challenges in acidic environments. The innovative approach involved appending a functional amino acid to the C&#8208;termini, transforming plecanatide into highly stable isomers that retained or enhanced their GC&#8208;C agonistic activity.

The principle of structure dictating properties is illustrated by the direct correlation between cyclic peptide conformation and their biological efficacy. Plecanatide, a synthetic analog of uroguanylin, has received FDA approval for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Nevertheless, our investigation has revealed that plecanatide undergoes slow conformational interconversion in slightly acidic conditions. In response, propargylglycine is strategically incorporated at the carboxyl terminal of plecanatide, a modification that not only facilitates additional functionalization and derivatizationbut also confers exceptional conformational stability. Remarkably, the resulting isomers not only maintained long&#8208;term conformational stability but also exhibited either preserved or slightly enhanced agonistic activity. This discovery represents a contribution to drug research focused on plecanatide, particularly in elucidating the relationship between its conformational properties and biological activity.

         <title>Selective and pH&#8208;Responsive Macrocyclic Anionophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile macrocycle scaffold containing phenyl units selectively transports anions over OH&#8722;/ H+. The pyridyl analog shows pH responsive anion transport by cotransporting HCl only at low pH.

The ability to selectively control ion transport across membranes is central for identifying synthetic ionophores that can potentially be used as therapeutics for diseases involving dysfunction of natural ion transporters. Herein, a family of C2&#8208;symmetric macrocycles is presented, which is derived from serine or threonine and a disubstituted aromatic moiety. The ion transport behavior of the macrocycles can be precisely tuned by modifying their aromatic core and symmetry. The phenyl&#8208;based macrocycles are highly anion&#8208;selective and do not disturb vesicular pH gradients, a key step toward safe therapeutic use of ionophores with minimal cytotoxic risk. In contrast, the introduction of pH responsive pyridyl units in the macrocycle results in measurable chloride transport only below pH 5, a feature that can be utilized to target the acidic lysosomal compartments. This work highlights a structure&#8208;guided approach to achieving tunable and conditionally active ionophores, with potential implications in biomedical applications.

         <title>Applications of Fluidized Bed Reactors in Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluidized bed reactor combines the properties of a stirred tank reactor and a continuous tubular reactor. Its advantages are its high transfer capacity and its use with liquid and gas phases. This device has been used to degrade contaminants and synthesize cosmetics, food, pharmaceuticals, lubricants, and biodiesel compounds. Its versatility will constitute an attractive alternative for developing biocatalytic systems.

The main objective of this article is to review previous contributions on the applications of fluidized bed reactors (FBR) in biocatalysis. FBR combines the properties of a stirred tank reactor and a continuous tubular reactor, making it an efficient system for carrying out enzymatic reactions with immobilized enzymes. This equipment's advantages include its high transfer capacity and versatility, as it can be used with liquid and gaseous phases. According to the literature, these devices have been primarily used to degrade contaminants, synthesize cosmetic ingredients, produce food and pharmaceutical compounds, and synthesize biolubricants and biodiesel. The enzymes most used in fluidized bed mode are laccases, lipases, and proteases immobilized on methacrylate resins, mesoporous silicas, alginate, and chitosan beads. Enzyme immobilization is essential, as it can promote the suspension of biocatalyst particles, thereby increasing yields and productivity. One of the leading prospects for these systems is to stabilize the fluidized bed using a magnetic field and the concept of &#8220;microfluidization,&#8221; which enables the stabilization of smaller biocatalyst particles with smaller equipment, thereby increasing efficiency and intensifying the biocatalytic process. In the future, the versatility of FBR will constitute an attractive alternative for developing biocatalytic systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeting of PD&#8208;L1 and Integrin &#945;v&#946;3 for Preclinical PET Imaging of Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of integrin &#945;v&#946;3 can upregulate the expression of PD&#8208;L1. Here, a dual&#8208;targeting radiotracer capable of simultaneously targeting both PD&#8208;L1 and &#945;v&#946;3 exhibited prolonged tumor accumulation in PET imaging, making it useful for long&#8208;term monitoring of PD&#8208;L1 expression as a guide for preclinical diagnosis and therapy.

The dual&#8208;targeting strategy has demonstrated advantages in enhancing tumor uptake, improving imaging contrast, and ultimately increasing tumor detection rate. PD&#8208;L1 is overexpressed on multiple tumor cells and regulated by &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;integrin. In this study, a dual&#8208;targeting radiotracer, [64Cu]&#8208;PEG&#8208;RGD&#8208;TPP&#8208;1, is developedfor PET/CT imaging of both PD&#8208;L1 and &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;integrin simultaneously, achieving high contrast, enhanced tumor uptake, and prolonged tumor retention time. [64Cu]&#8208;PEG&#8208;RGD&#8208;TPP&#8208;1 comprises the peptide TPP&#8208;1 and cyclic peptide c(RGDyC), linked via a PEG linker. The dual&#8208;targeting molecule had a moderate serum stability (&#8776;60%) in vivo after 1&#8201;hr. This dual&#8208;targeting radiotracer is evaluated and compared with the single&#8208;targeting radiotracers [64Cu]&#8208;PEG&#8208;TPP&#8208;1 and [64Cu]&#8208;TPP&#8208;1. PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies show that [64Cu]&#8208;PEG&#8208;RGD&#8208;TPP&#8208;1 exhibits higher tumor uptake than its single&#8208;targeting counterparts. Moreover, the dual&#8208;targeting radiotracer demonstrated potential for ultrasmall tumor imaging and could be combined with X&#8208;ray irradiation to further enhance PET imaging contrast, thereby improving tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency. These findings suggest that [64Cu]&#8208;PEG&#8208;RGD&#8208;TPP&#8208;1 is a promising noninvasive tracer for detecting tumors expressing PD&#8208;L1 and/or integrin av&#946;3, with the prospect of clinical implementation.

&lt;p&gt;Activation of integrin &#945;v&#946;3 can upregulate the expression of PD-L1.

         <title>Diastereoselective, Diversifiable Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of the Virginiamycin Inducers, the Virginiae Butanolides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of natural products is tightly regulated, resulting in many silent biosynthetic gene clusters. BarA is a repressor that downregulates production of the virginiamycin antibiotics. The VBs are ligands for BarA that reverse its repression of virginiamycin production. Herein, we report a diversifiable synthesis of the VBs and a GFP&#8208;assay to rapidly assess their abilities to induce natural product production.

Streptomyces species are renowned for their ability to produce bioactive natural products (NPs) via biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, many BGCs remain transcriptionally silent under standard laboratory conditions. Among the key regulatory mechanisms for NP biosynthesis are the &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) signaling molecules, which have been widely studied for their role in repressor&#8208;molecule circuits. While the S. coelicolor butanolides (SCBs) and A&#8208;factor from S. griseus have been extensively studied, the virginiae butanolides (VBs) from S. virginiae, which alleviate repression of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic virginiamycins via binding to the cluster situated TetR&#8208;like repressor BarA, remain understudied. This is in large part due to limited access to enantiopure VBs. Herein, we report a diastereoselective and diversifiable route to access the VB hormones, starting from a protected (R)&#8208;paraconyl alcohol intermediate. A library of VB derivatives was synthesized and tested for their ability to alleviate repression of BarA using a newly developed green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay. The synthesis and assay described herein established the most quantitative structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis of the VBs to date. Overall, this study provides new tools for probing NP regulation in Streptomyces and enables new strategies for BGC activation using synthetic GBL molecules.

         <title>Microbial Synthesis of Six Rosmarinic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study engineers Escherichia coli for the biosynthesis of six rosmarinic acid (RA) derivatives (IA, isorinic acid; CPLA, caffeoyl phenyllactic acid; PSA, p&#8208;coumaroyl salvianic acid; P4PLA, p&#8208;coumaroyl 4&#8208;hydroxyphenyllactic acid; PPLA, p&#8208;coumaroyl phenyllactic acid). Three process strategies: single&#8208;cell, stepwise, and coculture synthesis are&#160;evaluated to optimize production. Results show that the optimal bioprocess is compound&#8208;dependent: single&#8208;cell for PPLA/P4PLA, stepwise for CPLA/PSA/RA, and coculture for IA.

Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phytochemical that exhibits a variety of biological activities. The biological synthesis pathway of RA has been well&#8208;established in plants. In this study, the shikimate pathway is engineered to enhance the availability of precursor substrates and the biosynthetic pathway is reconstructed to produce six RA derivatives: p&#8208;coumaroyl phenyllactic acid (PPLA), p&#8208;coumaroyl 4&#8208;hydroxyphenyllactic acid (P4PLA), caffeoyl phenyllactic acid (CPLA), p&#8208;coumaroyl salvinic acid (PSA), rosmarinic acid (RA), and isorinic acid (IA). To identify the optimal method for maximizing the production of the target compounds while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, single&#8208;cell, stepwise, and coculture approaches are employed. Using the single&#8208;cell method, 145.1&#8201;mg L&#8722;1 of PPLA and 361.6&#8201;mg L&#8722;1 of P4PLA&#160;are&#160;synthesized. The stepwise method yields 28.0&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of CPLA, 23.4&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of PSA (which contains synthesized IA), and 10.9&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of RA. Finally, the coculture method results in the synthesis of 40.2&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of IA (which contains synthesized PSA).

         <title>Engineering Proteinosomes with Cellular&#8208;Like Functionalities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteinosome is a specific form of synthetic cells, which is fabricated with protein&#8208;polymer conjugates and designed for numerous cellular&#8208;like functionalities and activities including the semipermeability of membrane and the hierarchical internal structures. The prototissue systems can be obtained based on communication among these synthetic cells.

Recent development of various types of functional microcompartmentalized ensembles that can imitate rudimentary aspects of living cells has attracted great attentions in a wide range of research communities. Proteinosome is one typical form of these biomimetic structures. Significant advances in their construction have indicated that by utilizing interfacial self&#8208;assembly, polymer&#8208;based membrane templating, and hybrid lipid&#8211;polymer systems can achieve tunable permeability, mechanical stability, and stimuli&#8211;responsive behaviors, which is detailedly elaborated in this review. Additionally, this review emphasizes their functionalization strategies that enable programable bioactivity and communication, as well as community aggregation structures to build prototissues exhibiting cellular&#8208;like behaviors. Innovations in stimuli&#8211;responsive materials and multicompartmentalized architectures further enhance spatiotemporal control over biochemical processes, while the convergence of polymer chemistry, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology continues to expand the functional scope of proteinosomes, positioning them as transformative tools for next&#8208;generation artificial cell models or biomimetic materials. Having covered these topics in depth, this review hopes to inspire additional investigation into the research methodologies related to proteinosomes, furthermore the artificial cells, as well as possible applications in targeted cancer therapy, gene therapy, and artificial organelles design.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Antimicrobial and Anticoagulant Coatings: Synergistic Mechanisms, Research Advances, and Translational Challenges</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines emerging strategies for dual&#8208;functional coatings that simultaneously combat bacterial colonization and thrombus formation on blood&#8208;contacting medical device surfaces. Researchers now integrate antimicrobial activity with thrombus resistance through molecular design, structural biomimicry, and adaptive mechanisms. The discussion highlights critical advancements in achieving synergistic biological defense while addressing remaining challenges for clinical translation.

The adhesion of biological components such as bacteria, proteins, and platelets on material surfaces triggers biofilm formation and thrombus generation, which leads to severe infections and embolism risks in blood&#8208;contacting medical devices. Conventional blood&#8208;contacting coatings predominantly focus on singular antibacterial or anticoagulant functions, while clinical demands urgently require surfaces with synergistic "antibacterial&#8208;anticoagulant" efficacy to address complex biofouling challenges. Recent advancements in dual&#8208;functional antibacterial&#8208;anticoagulant coatings have achieved notable progress. This review summarizes four representative categories: (1) antimicrobial&#8208;dominant antifouling coatings, which combine active bactericidal mechanisms to inhibit biofilm formation with passive antifouling strategies to suppress thrombogenesis; (2) anticoagulant&#8208;loaded bifunctional coatings, merging sustained&#8208;release anticoagulant agents with antibacterial active components or antifouling layers to achieve dual active defense; (3) physically biomimetic bifunctional coatings, leveraging micro/nanotopological architectures and surface chemical mimicry to disrupt bacterial adhesion and platelet activation simultaneously; and (4) environment&#8208;responsive smart coatings, enabling stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic switching of antibacterial functions to adapt to in vivo microenvironmental changes. This review discusses the design principles and operational mechanisms of coatings while highlighting persistent challenges.

     alt="Dual-Functional Antimicrobial and Anticoagulant Coatings: Synergistic Mechanisms, Research Advances, and Translational Challenges"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review examines emerging strategies for dual-functional coatings that simultaneously combat bacterial colonization and thrombus formation on blood-contacting medical device surfaces. Researchers now integrate antimicrobial activity with thrombus resistance through molecular design, structural biomimicry, and adaptive mechanisms. The discussion highlights critical advancements in achieving synergistic biological defense while addressing remaining challenges for clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adhesion of biological components such as bacteria, proteins, and platelets on material surfaces triggers biofilm formation and thrombus generation, which leads to severe infections and embolism risks in blood-contacting medical devices. Conventional blood-contacting coatings predominantly focus on singular antibacterial or anticoagulant functions, while clinical demands urgently require surfaces with synergistic "antibacterial-anticoagulant" efficacy to address complex biofouling challenges. Recent advancements in dual-functional antibacterial-anticoagulant coatings have achieved notable progress. This review summarizes four representative categories: (1) antimicrobial-dominant antifouling coatings, which combine active bactericidal mechanisms to inhibit biofilm formation with passive antifouling strategies to suppress thrombogenesis; (2) anticoagulant-loaded bifunctional coatings, merging sustained-release anticoagulant agents with antibacterial active components or antifouling layers to achieve dual active defense; (3) physically biomimetic bifunctional coatings, leveraging micro/nanotopological architectures and surface chemical mimicry to disrupt bacterial adhesion and platelet activation simultaneously; and (4) environment-responsive smart coatings, enabling stimuli-responsive dynamic switching of antibacterial functions to adapt to in vivo microenvironmental changes. This review discusses the design principles and operational mechanisms of coatings while highlighting persistent challenges. Future research should focus on precisely functionalizing interfaces, enhancing synergistic properties, and optimizing dynamic adaptability to promote their practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing a Dna Distorting Interstrand Crosslink Produced by Mitomycins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic route to generate oligonucleotides containing a monoadduct or &#947;&#8208;interstrand crosslink from a DNA&#8208;distorting mitomycin is presented. The oligonucleotides are thoroughly characterized using mass and circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as thermal denaturation studies. The structure of this novel crosslinked duplex is compared with that of less&#8208;distorting mitomycin ICLs using Molecular Dynamics simulations.

Mitomycin C (MC) is a powerful chemotherapy agent currently used in clinics for the treatment of various types of cancer. MC functions by inhibiting cellular growth through the formation of cytotoxic interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). These ICLs induced by MC have minimal impact on the DNA backbone, preserving its B&#8208;DNA structure. Recent research suggests that the cellular machinery recognizes and repairs ICLs differently based on their specific structure. To better understand how DNA distortion caused by MC ICLs influences cytotoxic effects, Herein, a novel mitomycin ICL is synthiesized that, unlike MC, significantly distorts DNA and widens the minor groove. This work outlines the synthesis of oligonucleotides bearing a single monoadduct or a single ICL of this new MC derivative at a defined position. Such substrates are widely used for investigations into biological processes such as DNA damage/repair studies. The monoadducted and crosslinked oligonucleotides are thoroughly characterized using various techniques, including enzymatic digestion to nucleosides, mass and circular dichroism spectroscopy, as well as thermal denaturation studies. Furthermore, the structure of this novel crosslinked duplex is compared with that of less&#8208;distorting mitomycin ICLs using Molecular Dynamics simulations.

         <title>Lacmoid&#8208;Induced Conformational Changes Inhibit Fibrillation of Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a 37&#8208;residue peptide, responsible for the deposition of amyloid fibrils around pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells is one of the possible causes of type 2 diabetes. Using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, it is demonstrated that lacmoid inhibits IAPP amyloid fibril formation at equimolar concentration. This makes lacmoid a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is a devastating metabolic disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Deposition of amyloid formed by human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) around pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells is one of the possible causes of the disease. IAPP is a 37&#8208;residue peptide expressed by the pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells and cosecreted with insulin, and its misfolding and aggregation into toxic amyloid fibrils are closely linked to &#946;&#8208;cell dysfunction. Herein, it is demonstrated that lacmoid effectively inhibits IAPP fibrillation and disaggregates preformed fibrils. Thioflavin T fluorescence in combination with morphological analysis by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirms complete inhibition and disaggregation of IAPP fibrillation at equimolar concentrations of lacmoid. Additionally, circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal significant changes in the secondary structure of IAPP during fibrillation in the presence of lacmoid. Cytotoxicity assay in U2OS cells show that lacmoid reduces IAPP fibril&#8208;induced toxicity. Molecular docking studies further reveal that the Asn14 residue of IAPP plays a critical role in its interaction with lacmoid. The findings collectively highlight the importance of lacmoid as an inhibitor of IAPP fibrillation which may have potential to develop as a drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanoparticles (SNs) are well&#8208;known for their superior biocompatibility. Here, the application of SNs is summarized for modulating the aggregation of amyloid proteins, hoping to provide some insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship.

The aggregation and deposition of amyloid proteins are considered key contributors to the pathogenesis of various diseases. In recent years, a variety of nanoparticles have been employed to modulate amyloid protein aggregation. Among them, silica nanoparticles (SNs) have emerged as particularly promising due to the excellent biocompatibility of silicon&#8208;based materials and their favorable physicochemical properties, offering significant therapeutic potential. This review summarizes recent studies on the use of SNs to regulate the aggregation of amyloid proteins. The effects of different types and surface&#8208;modified SNs on the aggregation behavior of various amyloid proteins are systematically compared, aiming to provide valuable insights for future research and potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Disassembly of Peptide Nanostructures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two amphiphilic peptides incorporating anthracene as a light&#8208;responsive moiety that assemble into 2D&#8208;sheets or ribbons&#160;are&#160;designed. These nanostructures are disassembled upon irradiation with 365&#8201;nm light by bimolecular [4&#8201;+&#8201;4] cycloaddition. The reaction kinetics are depended on peptide preorganization, linking structure to reactivity.

While the assembly of supramolecular peptide nanostructures with diverse functions and morphologies has been extensively studied, the controlled disassembly of these architectures remains less understood. To address this, two short amphiphilic peptides incorporating anthracene as a light&#8208;responsive unit and lysine as a pH&#8208;sensitive residue&#160;are&#160;designed. These peptides self&#8208;assemble into nanosheets or nanoribbons with distinct secondary structures, which are further tunable by pH through modulation of peptide charge. Upon irradiation at 365&#8201;nm, the anthracene moieties undergo a bimolecular [4&#8201;+&#8201;4] cycloaddition, disrupting the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions by distorting the planarity of the aromatic units. This photoreaction leads to disassembly of the supramolecular architectures within 10 min. Unlike monomolecular reactions such as photocleavage, the kinetics of this bimolecular photodimerization are significantly influenced by the degree of preorganization within the assemblies. These findings underscore the critical interplay between supramolecular architecture and molecular photochemistry, enabling light&#8208;triggered, structure&#8208;dependent disassembly of diverse peptide nanostructures.

         <title>Development of Antibody&#8208;Based Strategies for Targeted Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the potential of antibody&#8208;based therapeutics for targeted degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins through the endocytosis&#8211;lysosome pathway. Construction strategies for the antibody&#8208;based therapeutics, including antibody&#8211;ligand conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and antibody fusion proteins, are discussed.

Membrane and extracellular proteins are essential components in various biological processes that ensure cellular function and homeostasis. Their dysregulation is linked to a wide range of diseases, making them pivotal therapeutic targets. Recent innovations in therapeutic strategies have concentrated on targeted protein degradation, particularly via the endocytosis&#8211;lysosome pathway, offering a novel approach to restoring balance within cellular systems. This review elucidates recent advancements in antibody&#8208;based therapeutics designed for the targeted degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins, specifically emphasizing three key mechanisms: lysosomal&#8208;targeting receptors, transmembrane E3 ligases, and lysosome&#8208;sorting signals that facilitate the degradation of disease&#8208;relevant proteins. Various construction strategies for these antibody&#8208;based therapeutics, highlighting the potential of antibody&#8211;ligand conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and antibody fusion proteins, are focused on. By leveraging the natural endocytic pathway for efficient protein internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, these antibody&#8208;based platforms hold significant promise for developing targeted therapies for a variety of diseases. Through this review, insights into the exciting field of antibody&#8208;enabled lysosomal degradation and its implications for future therapeutic interventions are provided.

         <title>Matrix&#8208;Assisted Efficient Selection of a High&#8208;Affinity Circular Aptamer for Sensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Density Lipoprotein in Human Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>A matrix&#8208;assisted single&#8208;round selection strategy to evolve a circular DNA aptamer low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL&#8208;CAPT2) targeting LDL is developed with high affinity (Kd&#8201;=&#8201;18&#8201;nM), strong specificity, and exceptional stability in biological matrices. Leveraging these properties, it is constructed a label&#8208;free fluorescence biosensing platform that achieves ultrasensitive LDL detection, with a detection limit of 0.4 &#956;M and a broad linear dynamic range spanning three orders of magnitude. This work establishes an efficient paradigm for rapid selection of functional circular aptamers for clinical diagnostics.The accurate and rapid detection of human serum biomakers is crucial for the early diagnosis of related diseases. Circular aptamers emerge as promising candidates for the precise recognition of these biomakers due to their remarkable biological and structural stability. In this study, a high&#8208;affinity circular DNA aptamer for low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL), a key biomarker for cardiovascular diseases, is successfully identified through&#160;a matrix&#8208;assisted efficient selection strategy conducted directly in human serum. This circular aptamer demonstrated a dissociation constant (Kd) as low as 18&#8201;nM and exhibited exceptional specificity for LDL, showing negligible responses to closely related analogs such as high&#8208;density lipoprotein and other abundant human serum substances. A sensitive aptasensor is subsequently developed that utilizes the superior recognition capability of the circular DNA aptamer, which performed well even in human serum (with a limit of detection down to 0.4 &#956;M and a wide linear concentration range of three orders of magnitude). This work underscores the feasibility of rapidly isolating highly functional circular DNA aptamers in one selection round, thereby accelerating the discovery of various circular DNA aptamers that are well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of a wide array of emerging human serum biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Biosynthesis of Polyhydroxybutyrate from Xylose via an In&#8201;Vitro Synthetic Enzymatic Biosystem with Self&#8208;Sustained Cofactor Regeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an in&#8201;vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystem for the high&#8208;yield enzymatic conversion of xylose to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Through systematic optimization of reaction conditions, we achieved high product yield of PHB from xylose via a self&#8208;sustained cofactor regeneration system, providing sustainable biomanufacturing and advanced biorefining strategies.

In&#8201;vitro biotransformation mediated by in&#8201;vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystems (ivSEBs) represents a highly promising platform for sustainable biomanufacturing, offering enhanced reaction efficiency by circumventing cellular constraints. This study develops an ivSEB comprising 17 enzymes for the cell&#8208;free biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from D&#8208;xylose via acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A (CoA). This ivSEB integrates partial glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, enabling self&#8208;sustained balance of several cofactors including CoA, NADP+/NADPH, and ATP/ADP. Stoichiometric analysis demonstrates a theoretical molar yield of PHB from xylose of 111.1%. Through optimizing concentrations of cofactors and enzymes, the one&#8208;pot reaction produces 44.0&#8201;mM (3.8&#8201;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) PHB from 44.8&#8201;mM (6.7&#8201;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) xylose, corresponding to a molar yield of 98.2%. Even at a higher substrate concentration (13.5&#8201;g&#8201;L&#8722;1), this yield (84.5%) remains robust. This study demonstrates the potential of the ivSEB as a scalable and efficient approach for the large&#8208;scale production of PHB and other xylose&#8208;based or acetyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived chemicals.

         <title>2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Analog&#8208;Based Biomolecular Tools for Exploring Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Nonheme Iron Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) analogs are rationally designed to elucidate structure&#8211;activity relationships (SARs) in 2OG&#8208;dependent nonheme iron (NHFe) enzymes. These analogs are tested against prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2). Activity assays reveal that certain analogs compete with 2OG for the PHD2 active site. Computational and mutagenesis studies reveal crucial binding residues, demonstrating the utility of these analogs to derive SARs.

2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent nonheme iron (NHFe) enzymes constitute a family of enzymes that use 2OG and oxygen to hydroxylate unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. These enzymes are biologically important and therapeutically relevant due to their role in key cellular processes. However, selective targeting remains challenging due to high structural conservation in their active sites. Herein, two classes of 2OG analogs are rationally designed and used as tools to investigate the active site of a 2OG&#8208;dependent NHFe enzyme, prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2). Using an activity assay in conjunction with steady&#8208;state kinetics, a new class of aryl&#8208;conjugated 2OG analogs is identified that exhibits 12&#8208;fold varied inhibition and competes with 2OG for the PHD2 active site. Immunoblot studies suggest that these analogs are biologically active and can target PHD2 intracellularly. Furthermore, computational modeling studies reveal that the analogs bind to the active site in a &#8220;flipped&#8221; conformation relative to 2OG, and functional group placement is responsible for their different inhibition capabilities. Mutagenesis studies further validate this unique binding mode and suggest several interactions that are crucial for inhibition. Overall, these studies provide a toolkit of 2OG analogs to establish structure&#8211;activity relationships and identify interactions that can be useful for PHD2 inhibitor design.

         <title>Precision Delivery of CRISPR/Cas Systems via DNA Nanostructures for Gene Therapy and Intracellular Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technology has catalyzed a paradigm shift in life science research, with the CRISPR/Cas system emerging as a cornerstone tool in modern biology due to its transformative capabilities. This review systematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems (Cas9, Cas12, Cas13), with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles.

The CRISPR/Cas system represents a transformative breakthrough in genome editing technology, featuring three principal effector proteins with distinct functionalities: Cas9, which induces site&#8208;specific double&#8208;strand breaks guided by a single guide RNA, enabling precise gene knockout and knock&#8208;in modifications; Cas12, which mediates targeted DNA cleavage through cis&#8208;activity while exhibiting nonspecific trans&#8208;cleavage of single&#8208;stranded DNA, a property exploited for ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection in molecular diagnostics; and Cas13, an RNA&#8208;guided RNase that specifically degrades complementary RNA transcripts, demonstrating significant potential for antiviral therapies and transcriptome regulation. Despite these advances, the clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas systems faces substantial challenges, particularly in achieving efficient and controllable delivery. This reviewsystematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems, with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles. The integration of multifunctional DNA nanostructures with diverse CRISPR/Cas systems may facilitate the development of integrated theranostic platforms, thereby advancing precision medicine through synergistic bioengineering approaches.

         <title>Hazelnut: Explorations toward the Biocatalytic Synthesis of its Aroma Precursor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article proposes a biosynthetic route for synthesizing filbertone, the principal flavor compound of hazelnut, through a multienzyme cascade. The pathway uses D&#8208;amino acid oxidase, threonine deaminase, and a regioselective transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus to produce a sustainable, natural hazelnut aroma precursor, addressing industrial demands for regulated natural compounds.

Biocatalysis gains significant industrial interest due to its controlled stereoselectivity and use of mild process conditions. Here, a biosynthetic route is proposed for the synthesis of filbertone (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hepten&#8208;4&#8208;one, 1), which is the principal flavor compound of hazelnut. The enantiomeric purity of the industrially synthesized compound is defined, contrary to the natural aroma, which varies according to the source of the nut, extraction conditions, and treatments. The novel synthetic pathway for a hazelnut aroma precursor proposed here consists of a multienzyme cascade, which starts from the two amino acids D&#8208;Ile and L&#8208;Thr that are individually converted by enzyme catalysts, i.e., D&#8208;amino acid oxidase and threonine deaminase, followed by C&#63743;C ligation of the obtained products, allowing a potentially sustainable production of the natural aroma. The most critical step is C&#63743;C ligation, which uses two carbonyl compounds as starting material. This step is catalyzed by a regioselective transketolase (TK) that originates from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. The approach holds promise for the industrial production of natural hazelnut aroma precursors, addressing the growing demand in the aroma industry for synthesis methods that sustain the regulatory claims for natural compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Biocatalysis gains significant industrial interest due to its controlled stereoselectivity and use of mild process conditions. Here, a biosynthetic route is proposed for the synthesis of filbertone (5-methyl-2-hepten-4-one, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which is the principal flavor compound of hazelnut. The enantiomeric purity of the industrially synthesized compound is defined, contrary to the natural aroma, which varies according to the source of the nut, extraction conditions, and treatments. The novel synthetic pathway for a hazelnut aroma precursor proposed here consists of a multienzyme cascade, which starts from the two amino acids D-Ile and L-Thr that are individually converted by enzyme catalysts, i.e., D-amino acid oxidase and threonine deaminase, followed by C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C ligation of the obtained products, allowing a potentially sustainable production of the natural aroma. The most critical step is C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C ligation, which uses two carbonyl compounds as starting material. This step is catalyzed by a regioselective transketolase (TK) that originates from &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus stearothermophilus.&lt;/i&gt; The approach holds promise for the industrial production of natural hazelnut aroma precursors, addressing the growing demand in the aroma industry for synthesis methods that sustain the regulatory claims for natural compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond FimH: Diversity and Relevance of Carbohydrate&#8208;Binding Fimbrial Proteins in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses fimbrial lectins found in Escherichia coli (E. coli) other than FimH, which could be targeted to treat E. coli pathogenicity as an alternative to antibiotic treatment.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is responsible for multiple diseases in humans and animals. Many of them are treated with antibiotics; however, the need for new therapies has led to research in alternative treatments. One such approach involves preventing the adherence of E. coli to host cells by inhibiting their adhesins. Adherence is a crucial step of pathogenesis, and bacterial lectins that recognize host glycans play major roles in host cell adhesion. In fact, lectins are the most common bacterial adhesins. The various pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli strains express a multitude of lectins, many of which are found on E. coli fimbriae. Current research on lectin inhibition using glycomimetics has produced many mannose&#8208;based inhibitors of the uropathogenic E. coli fimbrial lectin FimH. However, only a limited number of synthetic inhibitors are reported for other lectins. In this review, many other cell surface adhesins of E. coli are discussed, focusing on fimbrial lectins. The types of E. coli strains they are found in, their carbohydrate targets, and their binding sites are also discussed. This review aims to highlight the many lectins that can become therapeutic targets to treat E. coli infections in addition to FimH.

         <title>Selective Lysine Ubiquitination Using Activated Phenol Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitination of both peptides and proteins using a novel water&#8208;soluble acylation reagent, based on a 2,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid phenol ester, is presented. At alkaline pH, fast lysine ubiquitination is observed on model peptide FLYRANK, and its regioselectivity is confirmed using controls. The same selective lysine ubiquitination is shown on the Fau gene encoded Ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (FUBI) protein, which is confirmed using liquid chromatography tandem mass&#8208;spectrometry analysis/mass spectrometry analysis.

Ubiquitination of target proteins is an essential post&#8208;translational modification influencing a wide variety of cellular processes. Herein, the use of a novel water&#8208;soluble acylation reagent based on the 2,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid phenol ester of ubiquitin is described for efficient and selective ubiquitin modification of peptides. Under alkaline conditions, this reagent is swift and regioselective toward lysine acylation, while at neutral pH it shows loss of regioselectivity and is able to acylate both lysine and N&#8208;terminal modification at reduced speeds. As proof of concept, a model peptide is utilized to demonstrate this strategy, proving to be successful. Then the ubiquitination of a synthetic protein called Fau gene encoded Ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (FUBI) is performed under alkaline conditions followed by tandem MS analysis, proving that the selective lysine ubiquitination works to prepare protein&#8211;protein conjugates.

         <title>Regulation of Gene Expression of Mouse D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover illustration shows the transcriptional regulation of the mouse D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) gene. Key TFs act on the core promoter to stimulate DAO expression, leading to D&#8208;serine metabolism and influencing neurotransmission. This reflects the study's discovery of conserved regulatory elements in DAO gene control.

D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) catalyzes oxidative deamination of D&#8208;amino acids, producing 2&#8208;oxo acids, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. In mammals, DAO is essential for metabolizing both endogenous and exogenous D&#8208;amino acids. Previous studies on human DAO identify two promoter regions (P1 and P2), a negative regulatory element in intron 1, and several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of mouse DAO gene expression is investigated to compare with the human system. To determine the promoter activity in the upstream region of the initiation site, plasmids containing mouse DAO gene fragments inserted into the pGL4 [luc2P/Hygro] vector and assessed luciferase activity in LLC&#8208;PK1 cells are constructed. A series of deletion constructs is analyzed, revealing promoter activity in all tested fragments. The highest promoter activity is detected in the &#8722;333/&#8722;87 subregion, with residual activities in the &#8722;87/&#8201;+&#8201;111 region. Bioinformatics analysis identifies TFs, including NEUR, EGRF, ZF07, ZF11, KLFS, SP1F, and ZF02, which bind to both the human and mouse DAO genes at conserved positions, suggesting their critical role in regulating DAO promoter activity.

         <title>Structures of &#8220;Tyrosine&#8208;IRED&#8221; IR91 from Kribbella flavida in Complex with a Reductive Amination Substrate and Product</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of the (S)&#8208;selective &#8220;tyrosine&#8221; imine reductase (IRED) IR91 from Kribbella flavida is presented in complex with its ketone substrate and (S)&#8208;amine product, revealing for the first time the interactions of substrate and product with an IRED of this type acting in a reductive aminase mode.

Imine reductases with an (S)&#8208;preference for the reduction of the model substrate 2&#8208;methyl pyrroline typically contain tyrosine in the active site (Y&#8208;IREDs) instead of the aspartate present within (R)&#8208;selective enzymes (D&#8208;IREDs). As with D&#8208;IREDs, a subset of Y&#8208;IREDs is capable of enabling reductive amination reactions between some ketone and amine partners to give optically active amines with high optical purity. However, structures of Y&#8208;IREDs in complex with the substrates and products of the reductive amination have not been forthcoming. Herein, structures of the Y&#8208;IRED IR91 from Kribbella flavida in complex with 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;tetralone, a synthetic precursor to the anti&#8208;Parkinson's treatment rotigotine, and also its reductive amination product with methylamine, 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;(S)&#8208;2&#8208;(N&#8208;methylamino)&#8208;tetralin, are presented. The structures, in combination with mutation and kinetic studies, support a role for tryptophan residue W258 in the activity of the enzyme, possibly in binding of the ketone prior to reaction with methylamine.

         <title>Development and Recent Advances in SLIPT&#8208;PM: A Chemogenetic Platform for Manipulating Signaling at the Plasma Membrane</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SLIPT&#8208;PM enables the translocation of tag&#8208;fused proteins from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane using a synthetic self&#8208;localizing ligand. This user&#8208;friendly system permits reversible control of diverse signaling pathways. This concept article highlights the key features and current applications of SLIPT&#8208;PM as a powerful tool in chemical and synthetic biology.

Upon cell stimulation, mammalian cells activate various signaling proteins and lipids by recruiting their upstream regulators to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), which in turn determines their cellular response. Therefore, artificially inducing protein translocation to the PM is an effective strategy for dissecting cell signaling networks and engineering cellular functions. Self&#8208;localizing ligand&#8208;induced protein translocation (SLIPT) is an emerging technique that we developed to control protein localization in living cells using synthetic self&#8208;localizing ligands (SLs). Building on this strategy, we recently introduced a versatile chemogenetic SLIPT platform that rapidly recruits proteins of interest fused to an engineered Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase tag from the cytoplasm to the PM using a trimethoprim&#8208;based SL. The PM&#8208;specific SLIPT (SLIPT&#8208;PM) system is easy to use and enables researchers to manipulate diverse intracellular signaling molecules and pathways with controlled reversibility and repeatability. Owing to its modular design, related SLIPT&#8208;PM tools have also been developed to support more sophisticated experiments, such as light&#8208;induced spatially regulated protein recruitment and multiplexed signal manipulation. In this concept article, we review the development, principal features, current applications, and future challenges of SLIPT&#8208;PM as a unique tool in chemical biology and synthetic biology.

&lt;p&gt;SLIPT-PM enables the translocation of tag-fused proteins from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane using a synthetic self-localizing ligand. This user-friendly system permits reversible control of diverse signaling pathways. This concept article highlights the key features and current applications of SLIPT-PM as a powerful tool in chemical and synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon cell stimulation, mammalian cells activate various signaling proteins and lipids by recruiting their upstream regulators to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), which in turn determines their cellular response. Therefore, artificially inducing protein translocation to the PM is an effective strategy for dissecting cell signaling networks and engineering cellular functions. Self-localizing ligand-induced protein translocation (SLIPT) is an emerging technique that we developed to control protein localization in living cells using synthetic self-localizing ligands (SLs).

         <title>Amphiphilicity to &#945;/&#947; Hybrid Foldamers through Post&#8208;Modification at Multiple Sites: Antimicrobial Design and Structure&#8208;Function Relationship</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current work illustrates a cost&#8208;effective post&#8208;modification approach using artificial peptides to generate synthetic oligomers as antimicrobial agents. The peptides against the ESKAP panel of bacterial strains showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, and structure&#8208;function relationship studies were conducted considering parameters, such as charge and nature of hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains.

Antimicrobial drug design is an active area of research. Drug resistance in microorganisms to conventional antibiotics imposes a huge burden on the healthcare and economy worldwide. Understanding the structural parameters controlling the antimicrobial activity enables researchers to develop effective antimicrobial agents. Post&#8208;modification of artificial peptides as a method to introduce amphiphilicity, a structural parameter to exhibit antimicrobial activity, is described in the current work. Using two hybrid sequences composed of 5&#8208;amino salicylic acid and natural amino acid leucine (Leu) or phenylalanine (Phe), the approach enabled us to prepare peptides varying in chain length, charge, and cationic groups. The peptides against the ESKAP panel of bacterial pathogens showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. The structure&#8208;function relationship indicated that antimicrobial activity varied with chain length, and the peptides composed of Leu residues were more effective than peptides with Phe residues. The late&#8208;stage modification and functional diversification can be done at a large scale, and the approach simplifies the synthesis and reduces the cost of production.

         <title>The Evolution of AChE Inhibitors in Alzheimer's Disease: From Single&#8208;Target to Multi&#8208;Target Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the design and development of multi&#8208;target directed ligands (MTDLs) as innovative solutions for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It highlights the multifaceted nature of AD pathology, current therapeutic limitations, and how MTDLs, through merged or linked pharmacophores, can target multiple pathways such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cholinergic dysfunction to advance anti&#8208;AD drug discovery.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease marked by cognitive decline, neuronal degeneration, and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid plaques, and neuroinflammation. Current treatment strategies, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and N&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;aspartate receptor antagonists, offer symptomatic relief but fail to stop disease progression. The development of multi&#8208;target&#8208;directed ligands (MTDLs) has gained attention as a method to address the complex pathology of AD. This review provides a detailed account of the journey of AChE inhibitors from single&#8208;target ligands to MTDLs, emphasizing the structural changes that improve target specificity, blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, and therapeutic impact. By exploring these advancements, the review highlights the potential of MTDLs to overcome the limitations of traditional single&#8208;target approaches and contribute to the discovery of more effective anti&#8208;Alzheimer therapies along with discussing potential pitfalls.

         <title>Dominant&#8208;Negative Effects of p53 R337 Variants in Li&#8211;Fraumeni Syndrome: Impact on Tetramer Formation and Transcriptional Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;tetramer dysfunction: Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the TP53 gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53. It is shown that p53 variants R337C and R337H, found in LFS, impair wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function by forming heterotetramers with reduced transcriptional activity. This dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect may explain tissue&#8208;specific tumor susceptibility in LFS.

Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by heterozygous TP53 mutations. Among these, missense mutations at Arg337&#8212;such as R337C and R337H&#8212;are common in LFS patients. Although many studies have characterized individual p53 variants in LFS, the impact of tetramerization domain (TD) mutations on wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function remains unclear. Herein, a novel FRET&#8208;based assay system that enables the simultaneous detection of heterotetramer formation and p53&#8208;dependent transcriptional activity in live cells is developed. These results show that the heteromultimerization of the R337C variant with WT p53 is only slightly reduced compared to WT homotetramers, yet its transcriptional activity is diminished by over 50%. In contrast, the R337H variant forms heterotetramers at near&#8208;normal levels but exhibits markedly compromised transcriptional activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect, suggesting reduced p53 function is due not only to decreased tetramer formation but also to diminished heterotetramer stability. Moreover, the LFS&#8208;associated p53TD variants show a greater loss of activity against the low&#8208;affinity, apoptosis&#8208;inducing bax response element than against the high&#8208;affinity, cell cycle arrest&#8208;related CDKN1A response element. Collectively, this study demonstrates that p53TD mutations can exert dominant&#8208;negative effects, advancing the understanding of p53 heteromultimer function in LFS pathogenesis. These mechanistic insights into p53 heterotetramer stability may not only inform genetic screening strategies for LFS but also support future therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring p53 function by stabilizing mutant tetramers.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Cannabidiol and its Unnatural Enantiomer to Evaluate Anxiolytic&#8208;Like Properties and Memory Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both (&#8722;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;cannabidiol (CBD and ent&#8208;CBD, respectively) are synthesized via a highly diastereoselective CSA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. ent&#8208;CBD exhibits anxiolytic&#8208;like effects in aged male mice without impairing long&#8208;term memory formation.

(&#8722;)&#8208;Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychotropic phytocannabinoid found in Cannabis strains with well&#8208;established pharmacological applications. Conversely, (+)&#8208;cannabidiol (ent&#8208;CBD), the non&#8208;natural enantiomer of CBD, has been involved in a limited number of pharmacological studies. Therefore, CBD and ent&#8208;CBD are synthesized using (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;carvone as starting materials, respectively, via a highly diastereoselective 10&#8208;camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction as the key step. Pharmacological studies are conducted using the plus&#8208;maze discriminative avoidance task (PM&#8208;DAT) to evaluate the interaction between memory and anxiety&#8208;like behavior as well as spontaneous motor activity in both young adult and aged male mice. The results show that ent&#8208;CBD at a dose of 20&#8201;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1 has an anxiolytic&#8208;like effect in aged male mice. In addition, ent&#8208;CBD did not impair discriminative avoidance memory formation at all doses evaluated.

Quantification of Small Molecule Partitioning in a Biomolecular Condensate with 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to undergo phase separation and it is highly relevant to know how small molecule metabolites distribute between these phases. It is shown here that the partitioning can be robustly obtained from 2D time&#8208;zero heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectra recorded on the dilute and dense phases separately.

Several intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to undergo phase separation into a dense and dilute phase and this process is intimately linked with the regulation of cellular processes. It is therefore highly relevant to know how metabolites partition between these phases. It is shown here that the partitioning of components in a complex mixture can be robustly obtained from a single set of 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra recorded on the dilute and dense phases separately using &#8220;time&#8208;zero extrapolated&#8221; heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC0) spectroscopy. The spectral separation power of 2D NMR spectroscopy circumvents the need for physical isolation or workup of the mixture components in the two samples. Using quantitative 1D 1H NMR, it is validated that the HSQC0 approach effectively removes all the undermining effects that plague quantification in common 2D NMR experiments, including differential attenuation due to relaxation in the two phases, pulse imperfections, partial decoupling, off&#8208;resonance effects, and incomplete coherence transfer in case of scalar coupling variation. These results should be of widespread interest as partitioning into biomolecular condensates is crucial for the calibration of computational physicochemical models of phase separation and key to the further understanding of cellular biochemistry involving membrane&#8208;less organelles.

         <title>Activity Analysis of the P2X Receptor Antagonist PPADS against Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P2X receptor antagonist PPADS possesses activity against members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, in particular STAT4, STAT5a, and STAT5b. PPADS protects STAT4 and STAT5a/STAT5b from thermal degradation in cell lysates to a higher extent than STAT3. The data suggest that aromatic disulfonate antagonists of P2X receptors may represent promising starting points for the development of inhibitors of STAT proteins.

The small molecule PPADS is a P2X receptor antagonist. Analysis of a library of known bioactive compounds in competitive fluorescence polarization&#8208;based assays indicates that PPADS and its isomer iso&#8208;PPADS also possess activity against members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, in particular STAT4, STAT5a, and STAT5b. These results are also supported by HTRF assays. PPADS protects STAT4 and STAT5a/STAT5b from thermal degradation in cell lysates to a higher extent than STAT3. Combined data from this article and a previous article suggest that aromatic disulfonate antagonists of P2X receptors might serve as promising starting points for the development of inhibitors of STAT proteins.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized LRAD3&#8208;D1 Interacts with N&#8208;Terminal Domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis, calcium&#8208;templated in&#8208;vitro folding and competitive ELISA assay reveal that only domain 1 of the LRAD3 ectodomain interacts with the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) spike NTD, while domains 2 and 3 do not, providing valuable insight into ACE2&#8208;independent viral entry pathways that may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains associated with severe neurological complications.

Growing evidence of post&#8208;COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID&#8208;19. Importantly, the low&#8208;density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2&#8208;independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein is reported. It is observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. The results reveal that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N&#8208;terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.

         <title>Hybridization Probes Featuring a Pyrenylpyridine C&#8208;Nucleoside or Its Palladacycle as a Fluorescent Sensor Moiety</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When placed in the middle of a double helix as a nucleobase surrogate, pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylpyridine and its palladacyclic derivative show fluorescence emission sensitive to the identity of the canonical nucleobase opposite to it. Emission of the palladacycle is weaker but the base discrimination stronger, possibly because of Pd(II)&#8208;mediated base pairing. More emissive metallacycles can find use in genotyping single&#8208;nucleotide polymorphisms.

A C&#8208;nucleoside analog having pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylpyridine as the base moiety has been synthesized and incorporated in the middle of a short oligodeoxynucleotide. A portion of this oligonucleotide is cyclopalladated at the modified residue, and the potential of both the metal&#8208;free and the palladacyclic oligonucleotide as hybridization probes for single&#8208;nucleotide polymorphism genotyping is assessed by melting studies on relevant duplexes using various techniques. Conventional ultraviolet (UV) melting profiles at 260&#8201;nm reveal considerable destabilization of the palladacyclic duplexes relative to their metal&#8208;free counterparts. Circular dichroism melting temperatures are higher than their UV counterparts, especially with the palladacyclic duplexes. Cyclopalladation markedly reduces the fluorescence emission of the pyrenylpyridine moiety, but both the metal&#8208;free and the palladacyclic oligonucleotide exhibit a qualitatively similar pattern of increased fluorescence on hybridization with a complementary sequence, consistent with the pyrene ring being &#8220;pushed out&#8221; of the base stack. Emission at low temperature is dependent on the nucleobase paired with the pyrenylpyridine base surrogate with both of the modified oligonucleotides. This discrimination is stronger with the palladacyclic oligonucleotide, possibly owing to Pd(II)&#8208;mediated base pairing.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticles Guided by Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides: From Sequence to Superstructure</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling peptides act as versatile templates for gold nanoparticle (AuNP) synthesis. Their organization into discrete nanostructures or hydrogels enables control over AuNP morphology and assembly, offering new opportunities for functional nanomaterials.

Peptide&#8208;based supramolecular assemblies have emerged as useful scaffolds to control the synthesis and spatial organization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into nanocomposite superstructures. This concept article summarizes recent progress in the design of peptide&#8208;directed AuNP assemblies, focusing on how subtle variations in peptide sequence, conjugation strategy, and synthesis conditions influence NP morphology, chiral arrangement, and the resulting optical properties. It highlights key strategies for rationally tailoring structural parameters, such as particle size, shape, and interparticle spacing, which determine the collective optical and plasmonic behaviors of the assemblies. The fundamental design rules discussed here provide critical insights for constructing programmable AuNP&#8208;based nanomaterials, potentially useful in diverse fields including sensing, optical devices, and catalysis. Finally, it outlines current challenges and propose directions to further exploit the unique versatility of peptide&#8208;nanoparticle hybrid systems in nanotechnology.

         <title>Isomerized and Racemized Aspartyl and Deamidated Asparagine Residues Identified in &#611;S&#8208;Crystallin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lens contains some of the oldest proteins in the body that undergo deamidation, isomerization, and racemization at asparagine and aspartic acids during cataract. This study identifies these modifications in a major lens protein called &#611;S&#8208;crystallin using stable isotope&#8208;labeled peptides, and confidently assigns deamidation status using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry.

&#611;S&#8208;crystallin is a major protein of the human lens and is highly modified with age and cataract due to a lack of lens protein turnover. Previous studies identify some sites of isomerization and racemization of deamidated asparaginyl and aspartyl residues in &#611;S but have been limited due to the complexity of isoforms and difficulty in characterizing deamidation posttranslational modifications. A total of 32 stable isotope&#8208;labeled peptides are created for &#611;S residues 7&#8211;18, 72&#8211;78, and 131&#8211;145, containing L&#8208;Asp, D&#8208;Asp, L&#8208;isoAsp, and D&#8208;isoAsp at D12, N14, N76, D77, and N143 to act as internal chromatography standards spiked into tryptic digests of nuclear insoluble protein of a cataractous human lens. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry is used to accurately assign deamidation status using the 19&#8201;mDa mass defect between isotopic peaks of deamidated and nondeamidated peptides. While peptides containing D&#8208;forms of Asp and isoAsp were assigned, the predominant isoforms contained L&#8208;isoAsp. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry using wide single ion monitoring data&#8208;independent acquisition also greatly improved the reliable identification of peptide deamidation states. These results will aid creation of &#611;S using native chemical ligation to examine the role of isoAsp in crystallin aggregation and cataract.

&lt;p&gt;The lens contains some of the oldest proteins in the body that undergo deamidation, isomerization, and racemization at asparagine and aspartic acids during cataract. This study identifies these modifications in a major lens protein called &#611;S-crystallin using stable isotope-labeled peptides, and confidently assigns deamidation status using high-resolution mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting Antibiotic Efficacy of Azole Drugs against Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus by Coordination to Rhenium Carbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of antifungal azoles to rhenium di&#8208; and tricarbonyl complexes results in compounds with enhanced antimicrobial efficacy&#8212;up to 32&#8208;fold minimum inhibitory concentration improvement&#8212;against methicillin&#8208;sensitive and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus over parent azoles. Cationic fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3]+ complexes are consistently more potent than cis&#8208;[Re(CO)2]+ species, with a ketoconazole derivative acting by disrupting membrane integrity.

Herein, a library of rhenium di&#8208; and tricarbonyl complexes featuring various antimicrobial azoles as monodentate ligands is synthesized and characterized. Their antimicrobial activity is evaluated against both methicillin&#8208;sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and selected compounds are also assessed for cytotoxicity, yielding promising therapeutic indices. Notably, the complexation of antifungal azoles to the rhenium core enhances antimicrobial efficacy, with a compound exhibiting up to a 32&#8208;fold improvement in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values relative to the parent azole. Structure&#8211;activity relationships indicate that cationic fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3]+ complexes consistently outperform their cis&#8208;[Re(CO)2]+ counterparts, and mechanistic studies suggest that active complexes disrupt bacterial membrane integrity and interfere with the electron transport chain. Complementary small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and in silico analysis corroborate these findings, offering insights into the mechanism of action of this family of complexes.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Enhancing Mutations in an LmrR&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzyme Destabilize the Protein Scaffold and Alter its Conformational Plasticity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protein LmrR is a versatile scaffold to design artificial metalloenzymes. Here, we show that the M8D/A92E (DE) mutations that result in a much more efficient catalyst, destabilize the protein dimerization interface and alter the conformation landscape when binding metal cofactor and substrates are shown. These results highlight the intricate relations between protein, metal cofactor, and substrates in defining catalytic efficiency.

Artificial metalloenzymes (ArM) hold great potential for the sustainable catalysis of complex new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions. To efficiently improve the catalytic efficacy of ArMs, a rational approach is desirable, requiring detailed molecular insight into their conformational landscape. Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) is a multipurpose ArM scaffold protein that, when bound to the Cu(II)&#8208;phenanthroline cofactor, catalyzes the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation (FCA) of indoles. Previously, the M8D and A92E mutations are found to increase the efficiency of this reaction, but a molecular explanation has been lacking. The impact of these two activating mutations on the conformational landscape of LmrR in its apo, cofactor&#8208; and substrate&#8208;bound states is determined. The mutations cause a marked destabilization of the dimerization interface, resulting in a more open central hydrophobic cavity and a dynamic equilibrium between dimer and monomer LmrR is found. While mutant and wild&#8208;type have similar pocket conformation in the cofactor&#8208;bound state, the mutant shows a distinct interaction with the substrate. Our results suggest that increased retention of the catalytic cofactor and widened plasticity improve the activity of the mutant. Ultimately, these results help elucidating the intricate relationships between conformational dynamics of the protein scaffold, cofactor, and substrates that define catalytic activity.

         <title>Reductant&#8208; or Light&#8208;Driven ATP&#8208;Independent Reduction of CO2 by Nitrogenase MoFe Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogenases catalyze ATP&#8208;independent CO2&#8208;reduction to C1&#8211;C4 hydrocarbons in reactions driven by chemical reductants (EuII&#8211;DTPA) or light (quantum dots). MoFe and VFe proteins show higher activity in H2O and D2O, respectively, for the EuII&#8211;DTPA driven CO2&#8208;reduction to hydrocarbons. This atypical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;fuel Fischer&#8211;Tropsch type conversion offers a platform for mechanistic studies and the potential for designing sustainable CO2 recycling strategies.

Nitrogenase is a versatile metalloenzyme that activates and reduces small molecules like N2, CO, and CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals at ambient conditions. Previously, it is shown that the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase could reduce CO2 to CO, but not to hydrocarbons, in an ATP&#8208;dependent reaction. Here, it is reported that the ability of the catalytic component of Mo&#8208;nitrogenase (MoFe protein) enables ATP&#8208;independent reduction of CO2 to up to C4 hydrocarbons in room&#8208;temperature reactions driven by a chemical reductant (EuII&#8211;DTPA) or visible light (via CdS@ZnS (CZS) quantum dots). Moreover, an opposite deuterium isotope effect is observed on the EuII&#8211;DTPA driven reactions of CO2 reduction by MoFe protein and its V&#8208;counterpart (VFe protein), in that the former displays higher activities in H2O, and the latter displays higher activities in D2O. These results provide an important foundation for further mechanistic exploration of the nitrogenase&#8208;enabled, atypical Fischer&#8211;Tropsch type reaction that uses CO2 instead of CO as a substrate; moreover, they serves as a potential template for the future development of nitrogenase&#8208;based applications that effectively recycle the greenhouse gas CO2 into valuable fuel products.

         <title>Functional Characterization of a Diazo&#8208;Forming Enzyme in Meroterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diazo&#8208;forming enzyme (stFur5) facilitates deamination in the biosynthesis of furaquinocins and other polyketide&#8208;derived meroterpenoids.

Meroterpenoids are known for their distinct structure and hybrid biosynthetic origin. The biosynthetic gene clusters of several well&#8208;characterized meroterpenoids contain three genes whose functions have remained elusive. Recent studies on nonmeroterpenoid pathways suggest that these genes may be involved in nitrite&#8208;dependent N&#63743;N bond formation. In this study, it is shown that one of these genes, stfur5, is essential for the biosynthesis of the representative meroterpenoid furaquinocin M. By leveraging a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis platform, it is found that stFur5 catalyzes the transformation of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;flaviolin (8&#8208;AF) into diazo&#8208;flaviolin, which subsequently undergoes nonenzymatic deamination to yield the downstream intermediate flaviolin. The findings suggest that stFur5, together with the nitrite&#8208;generating enzymes stFur15 and stFur16, facilitates the deamination of 8&#8208;AF via diazotization in furaquinocin biosynthesis. We&#160;further identified the nitrite&#8208;binding pocket within stFur5 and proposed a catalytic mechanism in which nitrite is activated through adenylation. The findings enrich the understanding of the role of diazo&#8208;forming enzymes in natural product biosynthesis.

We&#160;further identified the nitrite-binding pocket within &lt;i&gt;st&lt;/i&gt;Fur5 and proposed a catalytic mechanism in which nitrite is activated through adenylation. The findings enrich the understanding of the role of diazo-forming enzymes in natural product biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(ethylene Glycol)&#8208;Based Peptidomimetics (Pegtides) of Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic candidates by conjugation. Here PEG is exploited for peptidomimetic conversion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), as candidate antibacterial agents, by replacing their polyamide backbone. The pegtides obtained thereby can be readily synthesized from inexpensive starting materials and demonstrate properties commensurate of AMP mimetics.

Cationic amphipathic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polymers are generated with synthetic efficiencies allowing their evaluation as antimicrobial peptide (AMP) mimetics. Accordingly, statistical copolymers with cationic units consistently functionalized with guanyl groups, but different side&#8208;chain lengths, and hydrophobic units displaying long aliphatic, branched, and/or aromatic side chains are produced and tested for their antimicrobial and hemolytic properties. The results obtained indicate that candidates with activities and selectivity commensurate to some AMPs can be obtained and that further development of this novel type of antimicrobial peptidomimetics, pegtides, is warranted for clinical and/or biotechnological applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Trehalose&#8208;Based Mertansine Warheads for Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin Delivery of Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) immunotherapy is the gold standard for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, it is limited by adverse effects and resistance, despite eliciting a robust immune response. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study explores Antigen 85&#8208;mediated, metabolically with trehalose&#8208;PEG4 mertansine&#8208;labeled BCG as a novel treatment option for NMIBC, offering promising in cellulo results.

Nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75% of bladder cancer cases, with Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) immunotherapy as the gold standard for high&#8208;risk patients. BCG elicits a robust immune response but is limited by adverse effects and resistance. To enhance its efficacy, a trehalose&#8208;based conjugation strategy is developed, tethering a cytostatic agent to BCG via a cleavable disulfide linker. This system enables selective drug integration into the BCG envelope and controlled release in tumor cells, aiming to improve therapeutic precision while minimizing toxicity. This approach combines immunotherapy with targeted chemotherapy, offering a promising strategy for NMIBC treatment.

         <title>Developing FGF2 Mutants with Selectively Reduced Heparan Sulfate Affinity to Explore Their Impact on FGFR1 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) regulates signal transduction by forming complexes with its receptors, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and heparan sulfate (HS), playing a crucial role in biological systems. Although HS has been suggested to modulate FGF/FGFR signaling as a co&#8208;receptor, multiple hypotheses exist regarding how HS affects FGF/FGFR signaling, and the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, to highlight the role of FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling, FGF2 mutants with reduced HS&#8208;binding affinity were rationally designed through&#160;in silico&#160;analysis. These FGF2 mutants exhibited reduced HS affinity by more than two orders of magnitude while maintaining binding affinity to FGFR1. In addition, these mutants retained their thermal stability. Cellular assays using the FGF2 mutant suggested that, contrary to previous reports, the contribution of the FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling may be limited. The mutant FGFs that specifically alter the interaction with HS, achieved in this study, would contribute to an understanding of the role of FGF/HS interaction in FGF/FGFR signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Characterization of Prodrugged Anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic antibodies are widely used to treat diseases like cancer and inflammatory conditions by binding with high specificity to their molecular targets. Masking is a strategy to mitigate undesirable activity in non&#8208;target tissues, improving safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles by reducing target&#8208;mediated drug disposition (TMDD). In this study, we explored masking an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites on the antibody. While anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 immunotherapy benefits solid tumor treatment, its adverse events limit its utility. We evaluated multiple conjugation sites within the complementarity&#8208;determining regions (CDRs) and adjacent framework regions to attenuate CTLA&#8208;4 binding. We identified the optimal site for maximizing masking efficiency, allowing for efficient bioconjugation and functional restoration upon exposure to a cleaving enzyme in the tumor microenvironment. The prodrugged antibody exhibited reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs), high stability, and an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model. This technology has the potential to improve the PK profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sufficient &#946;&#8208;Methylarginine Biosynthetic Pathway in Planctomycetes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genome&#8208;mining approach identifies a novel biosynthetic gene cluster for &#946;&#8208;methylarginine in the phylum Planctomycetes. Functional characterization of the transaminase PlaA and methyltransferase PlaB reveals a self&#8208;sufficient enzyme cascade for &#946;&#8208;methylarginine biosynthesis. These findings broaden the biocatalytic tools for &#946;&#8208;methyl amino acids production and highlight Planctomycetes as an untapped source of specialized metabolites.

&#946;&#8208;Methyl amino acids (&#946;&#8208;MAAs) enhance the bioactivity of natural products and possess intrinsic pharmacological properties as free amino acids. While the biosynthetic capacity for this class of noncanonical amino acids has been established in certain bacterial lineages such as Gammaproteobacteria and Actinomycetes, other bacterial phyla remain largely unexplored. A genome&#8208;mining&#8208;guided discovery of a novel biosynthetic gene cluster capable of producing &#946;&#8208;methylarginine, from the phylum Planctomycetes is reported. Both in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro evidence indicates that Planctomycetes employ a transaminase (PlaA) and a methyltransferase (PlaB) to synthesize this &#946;&#8208;MAA. Unlike previously described &#946;&#8208;methylarginine biosynthetic pathways, PlaA and PlaB function as a self&#8208;sufficient enzyme cascade that operates without the need for additional keto acid and amino acid partners.

     alt="A Self-Sufficient &#946;-Methylarginine Biosynthetic Pathway in Planctomycetes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genome-mining approach identifies a novel biosynthetic gene cluster for &#946;-methylarginine in the phylum &lt;i&gt;Planctomycetes&lt;/i&gt;. Functional characterization of the transaminase PlaA and methyltransferase PlaB reveals a self-sufficient enzyme cascade for &#946;-methylarginine biosynthesis. These findings broaden the biocatalytic tools for &#946;-methyl amino acids production and highlight &lt;i&gt;Planctomycetes&lt;/i&gt; as an untapped source of specialized metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#946;-Methyl amino acids (&#946;-MAAs) enhance the bioactivity of natural products and possess intrinsic pharmacological properties as free amino acids. While the biosynthetic capacity for this class of noncanonical amino acids has been established in certain bacterial lineages such as &lt;i&gt;Gammaproteobacteria&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Actinomycetes&lt;/i&gt;, other bacterial phyla remain largely unexplored. A genome-mining-guided discovery of a novel biosynthetic gene cluster capable of producing &#946;-methylarginine, from the phylum &lt;i&gt;Planctomycetes&lt;/i&gt; is reported. Both in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro evidence indicates that &lt;i&gt;Planctomycetes&lt;/i&gt; employ a transaminase (PlaA) and a methyltransferase (PlaB) to synthesize this &#946;-MAA. Unlike previously described &#946;-methylarginine biosynthetic pathways, PlaA and PlaB function as a self-sufficient enzyme cascade that operates without the need for additional keto acid and amino acid partners. These findings expand the catalytic repertoire for &#946;-MAAs biosynthesis and establish &lt;i&gt;Planctomycetes&lt;/i&gt; as a new source of secondary metabolites discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Stabilization of Collagen Mimetic Triple Helices and Assemblies by Dopa Crosslinking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating thermally stable collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) is a persistent challenge. Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagen's triple helix&#160;and higher&#8208;order assemblies. Herein, we demonstrate that crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine can covalently stabilize the triple helix in collagen mimetic peptides. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, we hypothesized that this reaction could be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This strategy covalently stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC&#8208;type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine&#8208;Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation&#8208;&#960; pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self&#8208;assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, we demonstrate that Dopa&#8208;Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37 &#176;C. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Biology of Serotonin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neurotransmitter serotonin influences a wide range of behaviors and biological processes through a series of serotonin receptors and transporters. Recent photochemical tools have made it possible to follow this complicated web of interactions with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution.

Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5&#8208;HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8211;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross&#8208;linkers. This review examines the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5&#8208;HT, 5&#8208;HTRs, and SERT over the last &#8776;10&#8201;years, with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.

         <title>5&#8208;thiohistidine N&#8208;acetyltransferase from Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ovothiol A is a 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivative biosynthesized by a broad range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its redox&#8208;active mercaptoimidazole side chain is believed to protect cells from oxidative stress. The three enzymes that produce ovothiol A from histidine, cysteine, and&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl methionine have been identified and characterized. In contrast, no enzymes are known that produce other 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivatives. Here, we describe a small family of acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A&#8208;dependent transferases that produce&#160;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiohistidine. The discovery of these enzymes from&#160;Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans&#160;and related Bacteroidota provides evidence that the 5&#8208;thiohistidine class may be structurally and functionally more diverse than previously thought.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Biosynthesis and Direct Incorporation of Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids into Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autonomous cells are engineered biological systems capable of biosynthesising and directly incorporating non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. These systems have the potential to extend the applicability of the genetic code to enable large&#8208;scale fermentative production of proteins carrying ncAAs. This work evaluates approaches for the generation of autonomous and semi&#8208;autonomous cells. Semi&#8208;autonomous cells rely on the external addition of a precursor, which is enzymatically converted in vivo to an ncAA that is directly incorporated. In contrast, autonomous cells have a metabolic system that produces and directly incorporates an ncAA in vivo. Through a critical evaluation of the state of the art, the reader is provided with an opinion on the future development of the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactivity profiles of progressively ring&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs in the WKYMVm peptide as formylpeptide FPR2 agonists and in keto&#8208;piperazines as anti&#8208;trypanosome agents.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of all&#8208;cis ring fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine were introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G&#8208;protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all&#8208;cis ring cyclohexylalanines of this class were also incorporated into a keto&#8208;piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp3 rich derivatives for assays against the parasite Trypanosoma. brucei. For these cyclohexylalanine analogues bioactivity trends correlated progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all&#8208;cis pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analogue of the W&#8208;peptide was least active perhaps correlating with the well&#8208;known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend was also apparent in the anti&#8208;trypanosomal assays of the keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives, it was less so and some compounds were more active than the previously reported phenylalanine derived analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Glucagon via Molecular and Formulation Strategies: From Natural Hormone to Effective and Stable Therapeutics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucagon, a 29&#8208;amino acid pancreatic hormone, plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). While clinically essential for hypoglycemia rescue, its broader therapeutic applications face limitations due to challenging biophysical properties including poor solubility, strong aggregation tendency, and chemical instability, which currently require lyophilized formulations. Recent advances in peptide engineering and formulation science have enabled the development of next&#8208;generation glucagon analogs with enhanced stability and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use profiles. Moving beyond its classical role in glucose elevation, glucagon is now recognized as a multifunctional metabolic regulator influencing lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and cardiorenal function. This expanded understanding has driven the development of innovative GCGR&#8208;targeting therapies including multi&#8208;receptor agonists such as glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R)/GCGR co&#8208;agonists for metabolic disorders and advanced dual&#8208;hormone delivery systems. This review examines the evolving pharmacology of glucagon by analyzing: (1) structural optimization and formulation strategies to address physicochemical challenges, (2) innovative delivery technologies, and (3) emerging therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases. Through critical assessment of translational challenges, this work bridges molecular insights with clinical innovation in glucagon&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, we discuss current insights into GT promiscuity, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>
