      <title>Surface Ligand&#8208;Density Switches Glycovesicles Between Monomeric and Multimeric Lectin Recognitions</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions define multitude of cellular recognition events. We present herein synthetic glycovesicles as cell surface mimics in order to switch the nature of the lectin recognitions. The covalent glycovesicles, constituted with diacetylene monomers of varying ligand densities at their surfaces, are prepared through photo&#8208;polymerization. Vesicles imbedded with sparsely populated ligands engage a lectin interaction, leading to a dense cross&#8208;linked multimeric complex formation. Whereas vesicles having the most or complete ligand constitution switch the lectin interaction to form a fully soluble monomeric complex, without a cross&#8208;linking. Nanomolar dissociation constants govern these interactions, as assessed by a ligand displacement assay. The study demonstrates the switching between monomeric and multimeric nature of the interaction as a function of ligand densities in the vesicles and the results are directly relevant to understand such a phenomenon occurring at the cell surfaces.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions define multitude of cellular recognition events. We present herein synthetic glycovesicles as cell surface mimics in order to switch the nature of the lectin recognitions. The covalent glycovesicles, constituted with diacetylene monomers of varying ligand densities at their surfaces, are prepared through photo&#8208;polymerization. Vesicles imbedded with sparsely populated ligands engage a lectin interaction, leading to a dense cross&#8208;linked multimeric complex formation. Whereas vesicles having the most or complete ligand constitution switch the lectin interaction to form a fully soluble monomeric complex, without a cross&#8208;linking. Nanomolar dissociation constants govern these interactions, as assessed by a ligand displacement assay. The study demonstrates the switching between monomeric and multimeric nature of the interaction as a function of ligand densities in the vesicles and the results are directly relevant to understand such a phenomenon occurring at the cell surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant containing a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogenase converts N  2  to NH  3  , and CO to hydrocarbons, at its cofactor site. Here, we report a biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant expressed in an  Azotobacter vinelandii  strain containing a deletion of  nifV  , the gene encoding the homocitrate synthase. Designated NifDK  Cit  , the catalytic component of this Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant contains a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor analog. Activity analysis of NifDK  Cit  reveals a shift of CO&#8208;reduction from H  2  &#8208;evolution toward hydrocarbon&#8208;formation and an opposite shift of N  2  &#8208;reduction from NH  3  &#8208;formation toward H  2  &#8208;evolution. Consistent with a shift in the Mo K&#8208;edge energy of NifDK  Cit  relative to that of its wildtype counterpart, EPR analysis demonstrates a broadening of the line&#8208;shape and a decrease in the intensity of the cofactor&#8208;originated  S  = 3/2 signal, suggesting a change in the spin properties of the cofactor upon citrate substitution. These observations point to a crucial role of homocitrate in substrate reduction by nitrogenase and the possibility to tune product profiles of nitrogenase reactions via organic ligand substitution.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous Visualization of Wet Cells and Nanostructured Biomaterials in SEM using Ionic Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>This work presents a successful methodology to image mammalian cells adhered to nanostructured titanium using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operating in low&#8208;vacuum mode following ionic liquid treatment. Human osteoblast&#8208;like Saos&#8208;2 cells were treated with a room&#8208;temperature ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, and subsequently imaged on titanium utilizing SEM. Titanium substrates were modified to create laser&#8208;induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) for visualizing at the sub&#8208;micron scale. Using a combination of fluorescence&#8208;based cell metabolism along with light microscopy and SEM image analysis, the shape and location of irradiated cells were confirmed to be unchanged after multiple irradiation sessions while the viability of minimally irradiated cells was unaltered. The wet imaging conditions combined with a rapid facile protocol using ionic liquid allows this technique to fulfill a niche in examining cellular behavior on biomaterials with sub&#8208;micron surface features. The demonstrated method to track observed cell adhesion to sub&#8208;micron surface features with SEM has great implications for the understanding of cell migration on nanostructured surfaces as well as on the exploration of simpler SEM preparation methods for cellular imaging.</dc:description>

Metals in medicine: Metal complexes offer unique properties in comparison to organic drugs. Herein, the generally underestimated potential of metal&#8208;containing compounds in comparison to organic compounds, as exemplified by photodynamic therapy, is highlighted.







Abstract
The vast majority of investigated compounds in modern medicine are based on organic molecules. Within the last decades, the field of medicinial chemistry is shifting towards the application of metal complexes. These compounds offer different mechanisms of action in comparison to organic molecules due to their unique properties, making them novel drug candidates. Herein, the successful combination of metal containing compounds and medicine is highlighted by their application for photodynamic therapy.

      <title>Pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid probes capable of cross&#8208;linking with DNA: Effects of terminal and internal modifications on cross&#8208;link efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we describe a furan&#8208;modified acpcPNA as a probe that can form an interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) with its DNA target upon activation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). To overcome the problem of the furan instability under acidic conditions, a simple and versatile post&#8208;synthetic methodology for the attachment of the furan group to the PNA probe is developed. Unlike other designs, the furan was placed at the end of the PNA molecule or tethered to the PNA backbone with all the base pairs in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplexes fully preserved. Hence, the true reactivity of each nucleobase towards the cross&#8208;linking could be compared. We show that all DNA bases except T could participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction when the furan was placed at the end of the PNA strand. The cross&#8208;linking process was sensitive to mispairing, and lower cross&#8208;linking efficiency was observed in the presence of a base&#8208;mismatch in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplex. In contrast, when the furan was placed at the internal positions of the acpcPNA&#8208;DNA duplex, no ICL was observed which was explained by the inability of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobase to participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The cross&#8208;linking efficiency was considerably improved, despite lower duplex stability, when an unpaired base (in the form of C&#8208;insertion) was present in the complementary DNA strand close to the furan modification site.</dc:description>

To overcome the problem of the furan instability under acidic conditions, a simple and versatile post&#8208;synthetic methodology for the attachment of the furan group to the PNA probe is developed. Unlike other designs, the furan was placed at the end of the PNA molecule or tethered to the PNA backbone with all the base pairs in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplexes fully preserved. Hence, the true reactivity of each nucleobase towards the cross&#8208;linking could be compared. We show that all DNA bases except T could participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction when the furan was placed at the end of the PNA strand. The cross&#8208;linking process was sensitive to mispairing, and lower cross&#8208;linking efficiency was observed in the presence of a base&#8208;mismatch in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplex. In contrast, when the furan was placed at the internal positions of the acpcPNA&#8208;DNA duplex, no ICL was observed which was explained by the inability of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobase to participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The cross&#8208;linking efficiency was considerably improved, despite lower duplex stability, when an unpaired base (in the form of C&#8208;insertion) was present in the complementary DNA strand close to the furan modification site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Discovery of the 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone biosynthesis genes in Aspergillus oryzae</title>
      <dc:description>The filamentous fungus  Aspergillus oryzae  has 27 putative iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, but secondary metabolites produced by them are mostly unknown. Here, we focused on eight clusters which were reported to be expressed at relatively high levels in a transcriptome analysis. By comparison of metabolites between an octuple&#8208;deletion mutant of these eight PKS gene clusters and its parent strain, we found that  A. oryzae  produced 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  1  ) and its precursor, 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  3  ), in a specific liquid medium. Furthermore, an iterative type I PKS (PpsB) encoded by AO090102000166 and an acetyl&#8208;CoA ligase (PpsA) encoded downstream from  ppsB  were shown to be essential for their biosynthesis. PpsC, encoded upstream from  ppsB  , was shown to have  3  &#8208;binding activity (  K  d  ; 26.0 &#177; 6.2 &#956;M) and is suggested to be involved in the conversion of  3  to  1  .

      <title>The &#8220;Carbonyl Story&#8221; and Beyond; Experiences, Lessons and Implications</title>
      <dc:description>
Lessons in discovery and development: The way to bring a 99mTc imaging agent into and through clinical trials is a long one. Although &#8220;carbonyl technology&#8221; has been known for almost two decades, only one compound made it that far. The different reasons for this are discussed in the paper together with scientific developments inspired by but beyond the carbonyl technology.







Abstract
The complex [99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ has become a versatile building block in radiopharmaceutical chemistry, applied by many groups worldwide. However, despite widespread efforts, only one compound has made it right the way through clinical trials. Along the way from its discovery to its development into an eventual product, the author experienced issues that he would handle differently in retrospect. In this article, these experiences are turned into &#8220;lessons&#8221; that might be helpful for young researchers finding themselves in similar situations. Beside issues with patenting and company strategies, the carbonyl story has provided scientific implications beyond its own story, and insights from which any future 99mTc&#8208;based chemistry for radiopharmacy or molecular imaging might benefit.

      <title>Mammalian&#8208;Like Inflammatory and Pro&#8208;Resolving Oxylipins in Marine Algae</title>
      <dc:description>
The uniqueness of oxylipin endowment in mammals is cracked by marine algae. They also form bioactive lipid mediators such as prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), and resolvins (Rvs) in response to wounding as is observed in mammals. Contributions to the algal oxylipin chemistry kicked off the discovery of novel biosynthetic pathways in mammals with implications in health and disease.

Oxylipins constitute a family of oxidized fatty acids, that are well known as tissue hormones in mammals. They contribute to inflammation and its resolution. The major classes of these lipid mediators are inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) as well as pro&#8208;resolving resolvins (Rvs). Understanding their biosynthetic pathways and modes of action is important for anti&#8208;inflammatory interventions. Besides mammals, marine algae also biosynthesize mammalian&#8208;like oxylipins and thus offer new opportunities for oxylipin research. They provide prolific sources for these compounds and offer unique opportunities to study alternative biosynthetic pathways to the well&#8208;known lipid mediators. Herein, we discuss recent findings on the biosynthesis of oxylipins in mammals and algae including an alternative pathway to prostaglandin E2, a novel pathway to a precursor of leukotriene B4, and the production of resolvins in algae. We evaluate the pharmacological potential of the algal metabolites with implications in health and disease.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The uniqueness of oxylipin&lt;/b&gt; endowment in mammals is cracked by marine algae. They also form bioactive lipid mediators such as prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), and resolvins (Rvs) in response to wounding as is observed in mammals. Contributions to the algal oxylipin chemistry kicked off the discovery of novel biosynthetic pathways in mammals with implications in health and disease.

      <title>Synthesis and Biological Studies of Dodecameric Cationic Antimicrobial Peptides Containing Tetrahydrofuran Amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
CAP size matters: Tetrahydrofuran amino acid (TAA)&#8208;containing linear dodecameric cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) displayed modest antimicrobial activities. However, they were more toxic than their octameric congeners, which had by far the best activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with very negligible toxicity, thus implying that the biological activities of this class of peptides is strongly dependent on their chain length.







Abstract
We report here a concise route to synthesize various stereoisomers of tetrahydrofuran amino acids (TAAs) and the synthesis of TAA&#8208;containing linear cationic dodecapeptides. Some of these linear peptides show slightly better antimicrobial activities than their tetra&#8208; and octameric congeners, but no activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for which octapeptides exhibited by far the best results; this implies that antibacterial activity is dependent on the length of these linear peptides. All the dodecapeptides described here were found to be toxic in nature against Vero cells. The study helps to delineate the optimal length of this series of linear peptides and select potential leads in the development of novel cationic peptide&#8208;based antibiotics.

      <title>The Importance of Phosphates for DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation: Evaluation of Zwitterionic G&#8208;Rich Oligodeoxynucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>
Native negatively charged DNA strands exhibit slow formation of intermolecular G&#8208;quadruplexes. In contrast, a modified TG4T sequence in which each phosphate is replaced with a zwitterionic moiety assembles much faster in both Na+&#8208; and K+&#8208;containing buffers, shows increased thermal stability and great resistance against exonucleases.







Abstract
A quaternary ammonium butylsulfonyl phosphoramidate group (N+) was designed to replace all the phosphates in a G&#8208;rich oligodeoxynucleotide d(TG4T), resulting in a formally charge&#8208;neutral zwitterionic N+TG4T sequence. We evaluated the effects of N+phosphate modifications on the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the parallel G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4) formed by TG4T and compared them to the properties of the recently published phosphoryl guanidine d(TG4T) (PG&#8208;TG4T). Using size&#8208;exclusion chromatography, we established that, unlike PG&#8208;TG4T, which exists as a mixture of complexes of different molecularity in solution, N+TG4T forms an individual tetramolecular complex. In contrast to PG modifications that destabilized G4s, the presence of N+ modifications increased thermal stability relative to unmodified [d(TG4T)]4. The initial stage of assembly of N+TG4T proceeded faster in the presence of Na+ than K+ions and, similarly to PG&#8208;TG4T, was independent of the salt concentration. However, after complex formation exceeded 75&#8201;%, N+TG4T in solution with Na+showed slower association than with K+. N+TG4T could also form G4s in solution with Li+ions at a very low strand concentration (10&#8197;&#956;M); something that has never been reported for the native d(TG4T). Charge&#8208;neutral PG&#8208;G4s can invade preformed native G4s, whereas no invasion was observed between N+and native G4s, possibly due to the increased thermal stability of [N+TG4T]4. The N+ modification makes d(TG4T) fully resistant to enzymatic digestion, which could be useful for intracellular application of N+&#8208;modified DNA or RNA.

      <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Study of Peptides with the Same Amino Acid Composition but Different Sequences by Using an Aerolysin Nanopore</title>
      <dc:description>
Dwelling pace: Two model peptides YEQYEQQDDDRQQQ and QDDDRQQQYEQYEQ were investigated at the single&#8208;molecule level. The relative distances between negatively charged residues D and E and between polar residues Q and Y are different, thus the peptides have different intramolecular interactions and structures. When they enter a single aerolysin nanopore, they induce distinct current blockades with characteristic dwell times.







Abstract
Nanopores are original sensors employed for highly sensitive peptides/proteins detection. Herein, we describe the use of an aerolysin nanopore to identify two similar model peptides, YEQYEQQDDDRQQQ (YEQ2Q3) and QDDDRQQQYEQYEQ (Q3YEQ2), with the same amino acid composition but different sequences. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that YEQ2Q3 possesses fewer hydrogen bonds and a more extended conformation than Q3YEQ2. These two peptides, which fold differently, exhibit obviously distinct mass&#8208;independent current blockades with characteristic dwell times when entering the aerolysin nanopore. Typically, at +60&#8197;mV, the statistical dwell time of 0.630&#177;0.018&#8197;ms for peptide Q3YEQ2 is four times longer than the value of 0.160&#177;0.001&#8197;ms for peptide YEQ2Q3, and yet peptide YEQ2Q3 induces &#8764;1.9&#8201;% larger blockade current amplitude than peptide Q3YEQ2. The obtained results show the remarkable potential of aerolysin nanopore for peptides/proteins identification, characterization, sequencing and also demonstrate that the mass identification of nonuniformly charged peptides/proteins by using the nanopore technique could be complicated by their folded structure and complex analyte&#8208;pore interaction.

      <title>Metallic Nanoparticle&#8208;Enabled Sensing of a Drug&#8208;of&#8208;Abuse: An Attempt at Forensic Application</title>
      <dc:description>
GHB analysis in forensic sample matrices: The date&#8208;rape drug &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) can be detected after a highly specific enzymatic reaction that generates NADH. NADH helps to reduce gold(III) species to form pinkish AuNPs that can be seen even with the naked eye in a variety of spiked drinks. The strategy can also be used to analyze GHB in complicated biological samples.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) functions as a depressant on the central nerve system and serves as a pharmaceutical agent in the treatment of narcolepsy and alcohol withdraw. In recent years, GHB has been misused as a recreational drug due to its ability to induce euphoric feelings. Moreover, it has gained increasing attention as a popular drug of abuse that is frequently related to drug&#8208;facilitated sexual assaults. At the moment, detection methods based on chromatography exhibit extraordinary sensitivity for GHB sensing. However, such techniques require complicated sample treatment prior to analysis. Optical sensors provide an alternative approach for rapid and simple analysis of GHB samples. Unfortunately, currently reported probes are mostly based on hydrogen bonding to recognize GHB, and this raises concerns about, for example, the lack of specificity. In this work, we report a bioinspired strategy for selective sensing of GHB. The method is based on specific enzyme recognition to allow highly selective detection of GHB with minimum interference, even in a complex sample matrix (e.&#8201;g., simulated urine). In addition, the result can be obtained by either quantitative spectroscopy analysis or colorimetric change observed by the naked&#8208;eye, thus demonstrating its potential application in drug screening and forensic analysis.

      <title>Monitoring Dicer&#8208;Mediated miRNA&#8208;21 Maturation and Ago2 Loading by a Dual&#8208;Colour FIT PNA Probe Set</title>
      <dc:description>
Combined use of two orthogonally labelled FIT PNA probes allows unambiguous monitoring of miRNA&#8208;21 maturation. One fluorogenic hybridization probe signals the presence of intact pre&#8208;miR21, the other probe shows enhanced fluorescence upon formation of the matured miRNA passenger strand. PNA&#8208;FIT probes also provide a read&#8208;out for monitoring the Ago2&#8208;mediated unwinding of the miR21 duplex in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
The inhibition of micro RNA (miRNA) maturation by Dicer and loading matured miRNAs into the RNA&#8208;induced silencing complex (RISC) is envisioned as a modality for treatment of cancer. Existing methods for evaluating maturation either focus on the conversion of modified precursors or detect mature miRNA. Whereas the former is not applicable to native pre&#8208;miRNA, the latter approach underestimates maturation when both nonmatured and matured miRNA molecules are subject to cleavage. We present a set of two orthogonally labelled FIT PNA probes that distinguish between cleaved pre&#8208;miRNA and the mature miRNA duplex. The probes allow Dicer&#8208;mediated miR21 maturation to be monitored and Ago2&#8208;mediated unwinding of the miR21 duplex to be assayed. A two&#8208;channel fluorescence readout enables measurement in real&#8208;time without the need for specialized instrumentation or further enzyme mediated amplification.

      <title>EGFR Fragmentation for Topological Transformation Nanobarcoding</title>
      <dc:description>
The long and short of it: Topological transformation nanobarcoding technology (TNT) has been demonstrated to be very effective in profiling important multiple gene mutations of lung cancer at once. However, it was specific for short&#8208;length variations. To widen the use of the long&#8208;chain lung cancer&#8208;specific EGFR signatures, a short edit and application method to TNT is introduced here.







Abstract
As the market for personalized lung cancer medicine expands, the demand for molecular diagnostic tools in general, and methods of detecting multiple genes with qualitative, quantitative, and high specificity in particular, have grown. Here, we propose a system for the effective detection of lung cancer&#8208;specific, long&#8208;length epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations by using a topological transformation nano&#8208;barcoding technique (TNT). In former TNT studies, EGFR was successfully detected in cell environments and at test stages in the presence of a reference gene. However, because typical EGFR target concentrations are significantly lower at the clinical stage and the probe&#8208;binding ability of long&#8208;length targets is lower that of short targets, our system employs polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, restriction, and filtering (PRF) for EGFR fragmentation to maximize performance. In a PRF system, the target is amplified by PCR, cut to a suitable size by a restriction enzyme, and filtered by a magnetic bead. With detection limits of 0.3555&#8201;% and 1.500&#8201;% for EGFR Del 19 and L858R mutations, respectively, the proposed TNT with PRF can effectively distinguish mutant cell lines and efficiently detect various lengths of genetic variations in clinical trials.

      <title>Isoxazole&#8208;Derived Aroylhydrazones and Their Dinuclear Copper(II) Complexes Show Antiproliferative Activity on Breast Cancer Cells with a Potentially Alternative Mechanism Of Action</title>
      <dc:description>
Cytotoxicity contrast: Two aroylhydrazonic ligands and their acetate/perchlorate dicopper complexes were synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including X&#8208;ray diffraction. They were shown to interact with DNA and display contrasted cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells. Their biological properties were linked to their ability to undergo chelation/transmetallation with biologically relevant metal ions.







Abstract
This paper reports the design, synthesis and cytotoxicity studies of two new isoxazole&#8208;derived aroylhydrazone ligands and their dinuclear copper(II) complexes. Compounds were fully characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The molecular structures of four derivatives were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The stability of the ligands and the complexes in aqueous medium was monitored spectroscopically. Both the ligands and the complexes were shown to interact with calf thymus DNA (ct&#8208;DNA). Additionally, structures containing a phenol pendant arm were significantly more cytotoxic than those carrying a pendant pyridine substituent, reaching sub&#8208;micromolar IC50 values on the triple&#8208;negative human breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231. The metal chelation and transchelation ability of the compounds towards FeII, FeIII and ZnII ions was explored as a possible mechanism of action of these compounds.

      <title>Effect of Regiochemistry and Methylation on the Anticancer Activity of a Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Organometallic Nucleoside Analogue</title>
      <dc:description>
Stay on the same side: An anticancer 1,2&#8208;disubstituted ferronucleoside (R=H) retains micromolar toxicity in bone cancer cell lines when methylated in up to two positions but activity is lost for its 1,1&#8242; regioisomer, which otherwise has similar redox properties and the same linker stereochemistry.







Abstract
Four new bis&#8208;substituted ferrocene derivatives containing either a hydroxyalkyl or methoxyalkyl group and either a thyminyl or methylthyminyl group have been synthesised and characterised by a range of spectroscopic and analytical techniques. They were included in a structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) study probing anticancer activities in osteosarcoma (bone cancer) cell lines and were compared with a known lead compound, 1&#8208;(S,Rp), a nucleoside analogue that is highly toxic to cancer cells. Biological studies using the MTT assay revealed that a regioisomer of ferronucleoside 1&#8208;(S,Rp), which only differs from the lead compound in being substituted on two cyclopentadienyl rings rather than one, was over 20&#8197;times less cytotoxic. On the other hand, methylated derivatives of 1&#8208;(S,Rp) showed comparable cytotoxicities to the lead compound. Overall these studies indicate that a mechanism of action for 1&#8208;(S,Rp) cannot proceed through alcohol phosphorylation and that its geometry and size, rather than any particular functional group, are crucial factors in explaining its high anticancer activity.

      <title>Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenases NotI and NotI&#8242; Mediate Spiro&#8208;Oxindole Formation in Biosynthesis of the Notoamides
</title>
      <dc:description>
Common ancestor: We have investigated the enantiodivergent biosynthesis of the notoamides in phylogenetically related Aspergillus strains. NotI and NotI&#8242; are responsible for generating the spirocyclic moiety, with preferential conversion of (&#8722;)&#8208;stephacidin A, thus indicating evolutionary divergence from an ancestral strain.







Abstract
The fungal indole alkaloids are a unique class of complex molecules that have a characteristic bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane ring and frequently contain a spiro&#8208;oxindole moiety. While various strains produce these compounds, an intriguing case involves the formation of individual antipodes by two unique species of fungi in the generation of the potent anticancer agents (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;notoamide A. NotI and NotI&#8242; have been characterized as flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases that catalyze epoxidation and semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement to form the spiro&#8208;oxindole center within these molecules. This work elucidates a key step in the biosynthesis of the notoamides and provides an evolutionary hypothesis regarding a common ancestor for production of enantiopure notoamides.

&lt;p&gt;The fungal indole alkaloids are a unique class of complex molecules that have a characteristic bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane ring and frequently contain a spiro&lt;i&gt;&#8208;&lt;/i&gt;oxindole moiety. While various strains produce these compounds, an intriguing case involves the formation of individual antipodes by two unique species of fungi in the generation of the potent anticancer agents (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;notoamide A. NotI and NotI&#8242; have been characterized as flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases that catalyze epoxidation and semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement to form the spiro&#8208;oxindole center within these molecules. This work elucidates a key step in the biosynthesis of the notoamides and provides an evolutionary hypothesis regarding a common ancestor for production of enantiopure notoamides.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mapping the Binding Interface of PET Tracer Molecules and Alzheimer Disease A&#946; Fibrils by Using MAS Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Binding PET tracer molecules to amyloid fibrils: PET tracers specifically recognize amyloid deposition in neurodegeneration, although the molecular basis of this interaction is not well understood. MAS solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is used to characterize A&#946;&#8208;PET tracer complexes. A bovine serum albumin protocol enables the titration of the hydrophobic molecules.







Abstract
Positron emission tomography (PET) tracer molecules like thioflavin T specifically recognize amyloid deposition in brain tissue by selective binding to hydrophobic or aromatic surface grooves on the &#946;&#8208;sheet surface along the fibril axis. The molecular basis of this interaction is, however, not well understood. We have employed magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to characterize A&#946;&#8208;PET tracer complexes at atomic resolution. We established a titration protocol by using bovine serum albumin as a carrier to transfer hydrophobic small molecules to A&#946;(1&#8208;40) fibrillar aggregates. The same A&#946;(1&#8208;40) amyloid fibril sample was employed in subsequent titrations to minimize systematic errors that potentially arise from sample preparation. In the experiments, the small molecules 13C&#8208;methylated Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) as well as a novel A&#946; tracer based on a diarylbithiazole (DABTA) scaffold were employed. Classical 13C&#8208;detected as well as proton&#8208;detected spectra of protonated and perdeuterated samples with back&#8208;substituted protons, respectively, were acquired and analyzed. After titration of the tracers, chemical&#8208;shift perturbations were observed in the loop region involving residues Gly25&#8208;Lys28 and Ile32&#8208;Gly33, thus suggesting that the PET tracer molecules interact with the loop region connecting &#946;&#8208;sheets &#946;1 and &#946;2 in A&#946; fibrils. We found that titration of the PiB derivatives suppressed fibril polymorphism and stabilized the amyloid fibril structure.

      <title>Advancing DNA Steganography with Incorporation of Randomness</title>
      <dc:description>
Cryptic clues: We show DNA steganography using basic molecular biology techniques with a restriction enzyme as a second secret key: Alice encrypts a message and sends it to Bob. Bob needs a combination of keys 1 and 2 to sequence the DNA and retrieve the information; he can also use qPCR to detect any interception by Eve.







Abstract
DNA has become a promising candidate as a future data storage medium; this makes DNA steganography indispensable in DNA data security. PCR primers are conventional secret keys in DNA steganography. Brute force testing of different primers will be extremely time consuming, and practically unaffordable when high&#8208;throughput sequencing is used. However, the encrypted information can be sequenced and read once the primers are intercepted. A new steganography approach is needed to make the DNA&#8208;encoded information safer, if not unhackable. Mixing information&#8208;carrying DNA with a partially degenerated DNA library containing single or multiple restriction sites, we have built an additional protective layer that can be removed by desired restriction enzymes as secondary secret keys. As PCR is inevitable for reading DNA&#8208;encrypted information, heating will cause reshuffling and generate endonuclease&#8208;resistant mismatched duplexes, especially for DNA with high sequence diversity. Consequently, with the incorporation of randomness, DNA steganography possesses both quantum key distribution (QKD)&#8208;like function for detecting PCR by an interceptor and a self&#8208;destructive property. It is noteworthy that the background noise generated through the protective layer is independent from any sequencing technology including Sanger and high&#8208;throughput sequencing. With a DNA ink incorporating the steganography, we have shown that the authenticity of a piece of writing can be confirmed only by authorized persons with knowledge of all embedded keys.

      <title>Assessing Reproducibility in Amyloid &#946; Research: Impact of A&#946; Sources on Experimental Outcomes</title>
      <dc:description>
Know your source: Amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) has been the target of multiple (and failed) therapeutic approaches to prevent Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we summarize the challenges in data reproducibility of A&#946;, and we evaluate the impact that different sources and methodologies can have on experimental results.







Abstract
The difficulty of synthesizing and purifying the amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide, combined with its high aggregation propensity and low solubility under physiological conditions, leads to a wide variety of experimental results from kinetic assays to biological activity. Thus, it becomes challenging to reproduce outcomes, and this limits our ability to rely on reported results as the foundation for new research. This article examines variability of the A&#946; peptide from different sources, comparing purity, and oligomer and fibril formation propensity side by side. The results highlight the importance of performing rigorous controls so that meaningful biophysical, biochemical, and neurobiological results can be obtained to improve our understanding on A&#946;.

      <title>Bacterial Tropone Natural Products and Derivatives: Overview of their Biosynthesis, Bioactivities, Ecological Role and Biotechnological Potential</title>
      <dc:description>
Accidents will happen: The biosynthesis of bacterial tropone natural products depends on an unusual intertwining of primary and secondary metabolism. Remarkably, a shunt product arising from a &#8220;metabolic accident&#8221; of an aromatic catabolic pathway serves as universal precursor for tropone natural products.







Abstract
Tropone natural products are non&#8208;benzene aromatic compounds of significant ecological and pharmaceutical interest. Herein, we highlight current knowledge on bacterial tropones and their derivatives such as tropolones, tropodithietic acid, and roseobacticides. Their unusual biosynthesis depends on a universal CoA&#8208;bound precursor featuring a seven&#8208;membered carbon ring as backbone, which is generated by a side reaction of the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway. Enzymes encoded by separate gene clusters then further modify this key intermediate by oxidation, CoA&#8208;release, or incorporation of sulfur among other reactions. Tropones play important roles in the terrestrial and marine environment where they act as antibiotics, algaecides, or quorum sensing signals, while their bacterial producers are often involved in symbiotic interactions with plants and marine invertebrates (e.&#8201;g., algae, corals, sponges, or mollusks). Because of their potent bioactivities and of slowly developing bacterial resistance, tropones and their derivatives hold great promise for biomedical or biotechnological applications, for instance as antibiotics in (shell)fish aquaculture.

      <title>Enzyme Mimic Nanomaterials and Their Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanozymes have attracted a lot of research interest and are gradually finding their way to a variety of applications. Herein, we review recent progress on nanomaterials with enzymatic activities, such as their synthesis and the regulation of their activity as well as their use in emerging biomedical fields, such as theranostics and bioorthogonal catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking behavior (nanozymes) have attracted a lot of research interest recently. In comparison to natural enzymes, nanozymes hold many advantages, such as good stability, ease of production and surface functionalization. As the catalytic mechanism of nanozymes is gradually revealed, the application fields of nanozymes are also broadly explored. Beyond traditional colorimetric detection assays, nanozymes have been found to hold great potential in a variety of biomedical fields, such as tumor theranostics, antibacterial, antioxidation and bioorthogonal reactions. In this review, we summarize nanozymes consisting of different nanomaterials. In addition, we focus on the catalytic performance of nanozymes in biomedical applications. The prospects and challenges in the practical use of nanozymes are discussed at the end of this Minireview.

      <title>Olaparib&#8208;Based Photoaffinity Probes for PARP&#8208;1 Detection in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Impair the repair: Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) of clinical relevance because it causes cell death in certain tumor types. By using a substructure of olaparib and adding a photo&#8208;activatable linker, a proteomics assay is presented for visualizing PARP1 with in&#8208;gel fluorescence and MS/MS analysis.







Abstract
The poly&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose polymerase (PARP) is a protein from the family of ADP&#8208;ribosyltransferases that catalyzes polyadenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) formation in order to attract the DNA repair machinery to sites of DNA damage. The inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib can cause cell death, which is of clinical relevance in some tumor types. This demonstrates that quantification of PARP activity in the context of living cells is of great importance. In this work, we present the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of photo&#8208;activatable affinity probes inspired by the olaparib molecule that are equipped with a diazirine for covalent attachment upon activation by UV light and a ligation handle for the addition of a reporter group of choice. SDS&#8208;PAGE, western blotting and label&#8208;free LC&#8208;MS/MS quantification analysis show that the probes target the PARP&#8208;1 protein and are selectively outcompeted by olaparib; this suggests that they bind in the same enzymatic pocket. Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018661.

      <title>Disparities between Antibody Occupancy, Orientation, and Cytotoxicity in Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting in your own way. We report fusion proteins consisting of a HER2 binding domain and antibody&#8208;binding domain. Concomitant treatment with a mixture of fusions increased antibody recruitment and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for some mixtures. For a fusion containing a Sac7d IgG&#8208;recruiting domain, IgG recruitment is observed, but not ADCC, likely due to inhibition of CD16 binding.







Abstract
We report fusion proteins designed to bind spatially distinct epitopes on the extracellular portion of HER2, a breast cancer biomarker and established therapeutic target, and recruit IgG (either anti&#8208;His6 or serum IgG) to the cell surface. When the proteins were incubated with anti&#8208;His6 antibody and various concentrations of a single HER2&#8208;binding protein His6 fusion, we observed interference and a decrease in antibody recruitment at HER2&#8208;binding protein concentrations exceeding &#8764;30&#8197;nM. In contrast, concomitant treatment with two or three distinct HER2&#8208;binding protein His6 fusions, and anti&#8208;His6, results in increased antibody recruitment, even at relatively high HER2&#8208;binding protein concentration. In some instances, increased antibody recruitment leads to increased antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. While a fusion protein consisting of a HER2&#8208;binding nanobody and Sac7d, a protein evolved to recognize the Fc domain of IgG, binds IgG from serum, antibody recruitment does not lead to ADCC activity. Rationales for these disparities are provided. Collectively, our findings have implications for the design of efficacious targeted immunotherapeutic biologics, and ensembles thereof.

      <title>Size Effect in Pd&#8722;Ir Core&#8208;Shell Nanoparticles as Nanozymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Size matters: Size effect in nanozyme was studied by using Pd&#8722;Ir core&#8208;shell nanoparticles of different sizes that possess peroxidase&#8208;like properties as a model system. Over a size range of 3.3&#8211;13.0&#8197;nm, the nanoparticles showed size&#8208;dependent catalytic activities. Their performance in immunoassays was also found to have a dependence on particle size.







Abstract
Comprehensive studies on the size effect in nanozyme (i.&#8201;e., nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities)&#8208;based catalysis have rarely been reported. In this work, we systematically investigated the size effect in nanozymes by using Pd&#8722;Ir core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with peroxidase&#8208;like activities as a model system. Pd&#8722;Ir nanoparticles with four different sizes (3.3, 5.9, 9.8 and 13.0&#8197;nm), but identical shapes and surface structures, were designed and synthesized. We found that the catalytic activity for individual nanozymes increased with particle size. The area&#8208;specific catalytic activity was similar for nanoparticles of 3.3&#8211;9.8&#8197;nm, but decreased slightly when particle size reached 13.0&#8197;nm. By using an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a model platform, the size effect of Pd&#8722;Ir nanoparticles in biosensing applications was investigated; smaller nanoparticles were found to offer lower detection limits. This work not only demonstrates the size effect, but also provides an effective strategy to enhance the performance of nanozymes in certain applications.

      <title>Quantitative Formation of Monomeric G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA from Multimeric Structures of c&#8208;Myc Promoter Sequence</title>
      <dc:description>
A note of caution: G&#8208;Quadruplex (G4)&#8208;forming DNA sequences have a tendency to form stable multimeric structures that are difficult to denature. This can be problematic for studies with synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. We describe a method that quantitatively converts multimeric intermolecular structures of Pu27 sequence from c&#8208;myc promoter into desired monomeric G4 by alkaline treatment and refolding.

      <title>A pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle lights up transfer RNA upon binding at the Mg2+ binding site</title>
      <dc:description>Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are fundamental molecules in cellular translation. In the present study we have highlighted a fluorescence&#8208;based perceptive approach for tRNA using quinoxaline small molecule. We have synthesized a water soluble fluorescent pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle containing a mandatory piperazine tail (  DS1  ) with a large stokes shift (~ 160 nm). The interaction between  DS1  and tRNA results in significant fluorescence enhancement of the molecule with a K  d  ~ 5 &#181;M and multiple binding sites. Our work reveals that  DS1  binding site overlaps with the specific Mg  2+  ion binding site in the D loop of tRNA. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the molecule inhibited Pb  2+  induced cleavage of yeast tRNA  Phe  in the D loop. In competitive binding assay, the fluorescence of DS1&#8208;tRNA complex is quenched by a known tRNA&#8208;binder, tobramycin. This indicates the displacement of  DS1  and indeed a substantiation of a specific binding at the site of tertiary interaction in the central region of tRNA. The ability of compound  DS1  to bind tRNA with higher affinity compared to DNA and single&#8208;stranded RNA offers a promising approach in developing tRNA based biomarker diagnostics in future.</dc:description>

Abstract
Realizing the promise of precision medicine will require breaking down communication barriers between genomic, screening and literature &#8220;big data.&#8221; We discuss the opportunities and challenges of reconciling data science approaches with the scientific method and the critical role of chemical biologists as a bridge between data and mechanism. Finally we propose next steps on the road to precision medicine and give examples of new tools designed to catalyze these steps.

      <title>Evaluation of i&#8208;Motif Formation in the Serotonin Transporter&#8208;Linked Polymorphic Region</title>
      <dc:description>Neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) arise from a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of synaptic serotonin (5&#8208;HT) and its inhibition is an important pharmacological target for treating MDD. The serotonin transporter&#8208;linked polymorphic region (5&#8208;HTTLPR) contains two major variants (short and long) which have been implicated in modulating the susceptibility to MDD by altering the level of expression of SERT. Both variants contain C&#8208;rich repeats that conform to consensus i&#8208;motif folding sequences. i&#8208;Motifs are quadruplex DNA structures that have been proposed to have a role in transcriptional regulation. With spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that both alleles are able to form i&#8208;motifs at acidic pH, and at neutral pH under conditions of molecular crowding. This highlights the potential for i&#8208;motif formation to contribute to transcriptional regulation of the serotonin transporter, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.</dc:description>

The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of synaptic serotonin (5&#8208;HT) and its inhibition is an important pharmacological target for treating MDD. The serotonin transporter&#8208;linked polymorphic region (5&#8208;HTTLPR) contains two major variants (short and long) which have been implicated in modulating the susceptibility to MDD by altering the level of expression of SERT. Both variants contain C&#8208;rich repeats that conform to consensus i&#8208;motif folding sequences. i&#8208;Motifs are quadruplex DNA structures that have been proposed to have a role in transcriptional regulation. With spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that both alleles are able to form i&#8208;motifs at acidic pH, and at neutral pH under conditions of molecular crowding. This highlights the potential for i&#8208;motif formation to contribute to transcriptional regulation of the serotonin transporter, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Regulating CRISPR/Cas9 Function through Conditional Guide RNA Control</title>
      <dc:description>Conditional control of CRISPR/Cas9 has been developed using a variety of different approaches, many focusing on manipulation of the Cas9 protein itself. However, more recent strategies for governing CRISPR/Cas9 function are based on guide RNA (gRNA) modifications. They include control of gRNAs by light, small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides. These designs have unique advantages compared to other approaches and have allowed for precise regulation of gene editing and transcription. Here, we discuss strategies for conditional control of gRNA function and compare effectiveness of these methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalently Mercurated Molecular Beacon for Discriminating the Canonical Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>A highly nucleobase discriminating metalated nucleoside analog, 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;methylaniline, was incorporated into an oligonucleotide molecular beacon. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured after the addition of four different complementary strands, where the nucleobase opposite of the metalated analog varies. The fluorescence results showed a clear binding selectivity at room temperature, in the order G&gt;T&gt;C&gt;A. The selectivity is based on the different affinities between the metalated nucleoside analog and the canonical nucleobases. The synthesized probe is capable of robust discrimination between the two purine as well as the two pyrimidine bases by fluorescence at room temperature, and more sophisticated temperature analysis allows clear separation of every canonical nucleobase. The probe would, hence, be a suitable method for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploring epigenetic marks by analysis of non&#8208;covalent interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Epigenetic marks are modest chemical modifications on DNA and histone proteins that regulate the activation or silencing of genes, through modulation of the intermolecular interactions between the DNA strands and the protein machinery. The process is complex and not always well understood. One of the systems studied in greater detail is the epigenetic mark on H3K9: the lysine 9 of the histone 3. The degree of methylation or acetylation of this histone is linked to silencing or activation of the corresponding gene, but it is not clear which effect each mark has in gene expression. We shed light on this particular methylation process using density functional theory calculations (DFT) First, we built a model consisting of a DNA double strand containing three base pairs and a sequence of three amino acids of the histone&#8217;s tail. Then, we computed the modulation introduced in the intermolecular interactions by each epigenetic modification: from mono to tri&#8208;methylation and acetylation. The calculations show that while acetylation and tri&#8208;methylation results in a reduction of the DNA&#8208;peptide interaction; non&#8208;, mono&#8208;, and di&#8208;methylation increase the intermolecular interactions. Such observations compare well with the findings reported in the literature, highlighting the correlation between the balance of intermolecular forces and biological properties and advancing quantum mechanical studies of large biochemical systems at molecular level through the use of DFT methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Incorporation of halogenated amino acids into antibody fragments at multiple specific sites enhances antigen binding</title>
      <dc:description>The expansion of the amino&#8208;acid repertoire with synthetic derivatives introduces novel structures and functionalities into proteins. In the present study, we improved the antigen binding of antibodies by incorporating halogenated tyrosines at multiple selective sites. Tyrosines in the Fab fragment of an anti&#8208;EGF&#8208;receptor antibody 059&#8208;152 were systematically replaced with 3&#8208;bromo&#8208; and 3&#8208;chlorotyrosines, and simultaneous replacements at 4 specific sites were thus found to cause a 10&#8208;fold increase in the affinity toward the antigen. Structure modeling suggested that this effect was due to enhanced shape complementarity between the antigen and antibody molecules. On the other hand, we showed that chlorination in the constant domain, far from the binding interface, of Rituximab Fab also increased the affinity significantly (up to 17&#8208;fold). Our results showed that antigen binding is tunable with the halogenation&#160;in and out of the binding motifs.</dc:description>

      <title>Spectral Unmixing&#8208;Based Reaction Monitoring of Transformations between Nucleosides and Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>
Nucleosides and their nucleobases have slightly different UV absorption spectra. This can be employed for analysis and reaction monitoring by spectral unmixing, which delivers robust and fast results through the deconvolution of highly overlapping spectra. The approach is particularly useful for enzymatic reactions and incredibly versatile as it can be applied to a wealth of natural and modified nucleosides. See the communication by F. Kaspar, A. Wagner, et al. for more details, tips and software. Cover illustration by BotsAndBrainz (Anne Voigt).

      <title>Synergistic Interactions Are Prevalent in Catalytic Amyloids</title>
      <dc:description>
Just like a limited set of playing cards can provide many combinations, mixtures of peptides with different amino acids can form various functional materials. Even simple binary mixtures of heptapeptides can synergistically form catalytic amyloids with high (using arginine and glutamine), moderate (using lysine and glutamate), or low (using histidine and tyrosine) hydrolytic activities. More information can be found in the communication by I.&#8197;V. Korendovych et&#8197;al.

     alt="Synergistic Interactions Are Prevalent in Catalytic Amyloids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just like a limited set&lt;/b&gt; of playing cards can provide many combinations, mixtures of peptides with different amino acids can form various functional materials. Even simple binary mixtures of heptapeptides can synergistically form catalytic amyloids with high (using arginine and glutamine), moderate (using lysine and glutamate), or low (using histidine and tyrosine) hydrolytic activities. More information can be found in the &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202000205communication by I.&#8197;V. Korendovych et&#8197;al.&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Trapping transient protein species by genetic code expansion</title>
      <dc:description>Nature employs a limited number of genetically encoded amino acids for the construction of functional proteins. By engineering components of the cellular translation machinery, however, it is now possible to genetically encode non&#8208;canonical building blocks with tailored electronic and structural properties, enabling facile chemical diversification of these biopolymers. The ability to incorporate unique chemical functionality into proteins provides a powerful tool to probe mechanism and create novel function.

      <title>Discovery of Six Ramoplanin Family Gene Clusters and the Lipoglycodepsipeptide Chersinamycin</title>
      <dc:description>Ramoplanins and enduracidins are peptidoglycan lipid intermediate II&#8208;binding lipodepsipeptides with broad&#8208;spectrum activity against methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Targeted genome mining using probes from conserved sequences within the ramoplanin/enduracidin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) was used to identify six microorganisms with BGCs predicted to produce unique lipodepsipeptide congeners of ramoplanin and enduracidin. Fermentation of&#160;  Micromonospora chersina  &#160;yielded a novel lipoglycodepsipeptide, called chersinamycin, which exhibited good antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria (1&#8208;2 &#181;g/mL) similar to the ramoplanins and enduracidins. The covalent structure of chersinamycin was determined by NMR and tandem mass spectrometry methods in conjunction with chemical degradation studies. These six new BGCs and isolation of a new antimicrobial peptide provide much&#8208;needed tools to investigate the fundamental aspects of lipodepsipeptide biosynthesis and to facilitate efforts to produce novel antibiotics capable of combating antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections.</dc:description>

      <title>Site Selective Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclized peptides have seen a rise in popularity in the pharmaceutical industry as drug molecules. As such, new macrocyclization methodologies have become abundant in the last several decades. However, efficient methods of cyclization without the formation of side products have still remained a great challenge. Herein, we review the cyclization approaches that focus on site selective chemistry. Site selectivity in macrocyclization decreases the generation of side products, lending to a greater yield of desired peptide macrocycles. We will also take an in&#8208;depth look at the new exclusively intramolecular N&#8208;terminal site selective CyClick strategy for synthesis of cyclic peptides. The CyClick method utilizes imine formation between an aldehyde and the N&#8208;terminus.

      <dc:description>The thermostabilization of enzymes while retaining their activity and enantioselectivity for applied biocatalysis is an important topic in protein engineering. Rational and computational design strategies as well as directed evolution have been used successfully to thermostabilize enzymes.

      <title>Selective Covalent Targeting of Anti&#8208;Apoptotic BFL&#8208;1 by a Sulfonium Tethered Peptide</title>
      <dc:description>Anti&#8208;apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL&#8208;2) family proteins were proven targets for human cancers. Targeting the BH3&#8208;binding pockets of these anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins could reactivate apoptosis in BCL&#8208;2&#8208;depedent cancers. BFL&#8208;1 is a BCL&#8208;2 family protein overexpressed in various chemoresistant cancers. A unique cysteine at the binding interface of the BH3 and BFL&#8208;1 was previously proven as an intriguing targeting site to irreversibly inhibit BFL&#8208;1 functions with stabilized cyclic peptide bearing a covalent warhead. Recently, we developed a sulfonium tethered peptide cyclization strategy to construct peptide ligands which could selectively and efficiently react with cysteine(s) of target proteins nearby the interacting interface. Utilizing this method, we constructed a BFL&#8208;1 peptide inhibitor B4&#8208;MC, which could selectively conjugate with BFL&#8208;1 both in vitro and in cell. B4&#8208;MC showed good cellular uptake, colocalized with BFL&#8208;1 on mitochondria, and showed obvious growth inhibition of BFL&#8208;1 over&#8208;expressed cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts.

The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism.

      <title>Prebiotic origin of pre&#8208;RNA building blocks in a urea &#8220;warm little pond&#8221; scenario.</title>
      <dc:description>Urea appears to be a key intermediate of important prebiotic synthetic pathways. Concentrated pools of urea likely existed on the surface of the early Earth, as urea is synthesized in significant quantities from hydrogen cyanide or cyanamide (widely accepted prebiotic molecules), it has extremely high water solubility, and it can concentrate to form eutectics from aqueous solutions. The dual nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic character of urea makes it an ideal precursor for the formation of nitrogenous bases. We propose a model for the origin of a variety of canonical and non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, including some known to form supramolecular assemblies that contain Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;like base pairs. These reactions involve urea condensation with other prebiotic molecules (e.g., malonic acid) that could be driven by environmental cycles (e.g., freezing/thawing, drying/wetting).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Urea appears to be a key intermediate of important prebiotic synthetic pathways. Concentrated pools of urea likely existed on the surface of the early Earth, as urea is synthesized in significant quantities from hydrogen cyanide or cyanamide (widely accepted prebiotic molecules), it has extremely high water solubility, and it can concentrate to form eutectics from aqueous solutions. The dual nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic character of urea makes it an ideal precursor for the formation of nitrogenous bases. We propose a model for the origin of a variety of canonical and non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, including some known to form supramolecular assemblies that contain Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;like base pairs. These reactions involve urea condensation with other prebiotic molecules (e.g., malonic acid) that could be driven by environmental cycles (e.g., freezing/thawing, drying/wetting). The resulting heterocycle assemblies are compatible with the formation of nucleosides and, possibly, the chemical evolution of molecular precursors to RNA. We show that urea eutectics at moderate temperature represent a robust prebiotic source of nitrogenous heterocycles. The simplicity of these pathways, and their independence from specific or rare geological events, support the idea of urea being of fundamental importance to the prebiotic chemistry that gave rise to life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Simple analysis of primary and secondary bile salt hydrolysis in mouse and human gut microbiome samples using fluorogenic substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Animals produce bile to maximize absorption of lipophilic nutrients in the gut. The physical properties of bile are largely dictated by amphipathic bile salt molecules, which also participate in signalling pathways by modulating physiological processes upon binding host receptors. Upon excretion of bile salts from the gall bladder into the intestine, the gut microbiome can create metabolites with modified signaling capabilities. The category and magnitude of bile salt metabolism can have positive or negative effects on the host. A key modification is bile salt hydrolysis, which is a prerequisite for all additional microbial transformations. We have synthesized five different fluorogenic bile salts for simple and continuous reporting of hydrolysis in both murine and human fecal samples. Our data demonstrate that most gut microbiomes have the highest capacity for hydrolysis of host&#8208;produced primary bile salts, but some microbially modified secondary bile salts also display significant turnover.</dc:description>

      <title>NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) Complexes Containing &#945;&#8208;Oligothiophenes for Applications in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>The design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;active photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;based cancer treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a challenge. While several NIR&#8208;Ru(II) scaffolds have been reported, this approach has not been proven in cells. This is the first report of NIR&#8208;Ru(II) PSs that are phototoxic to cancer cells, including highly pigmented B16F10 melanoma cells. The PS family incorporated a bis(1,8&#8208;naphthyridine)&#8208;based ligand (tpbn), a bidentate thiophene&#8208;based ligand (nT; n=0&#8211;4), and a monodentate 4&#8208;picoline ligand (4&#8208;pic). All compounds absorbed light &gt;800 nm with maxima near 730 nm. Transient absorption (TA) measurements indicated that n&#8805;4 thiophene rings (4T) positioned the PDT&#8208;active triplet intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT) excited state in energetic proximity to the lowest lying triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT). 4T had low micromolar phototoxicity with PIvis and PI733nm values as large as 90 and 12, respectively. Spectroscopic studies suggested that the long&#8208;lived (&#964;TA=3&#8211;6 &#181;s) 3ILCT was accessible from the 3MLCT state, but energetically uphill in the overall photophysics. The study highlights that phototoxic effects can be achieved with NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) PSs as long as the reactive 3ILCT states are energetically accessible from the low&#8208;energy 3MLCT states. It also demonstrates that tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR light can be used to activate the PSs in highly pigmented cells where melanin attenuates shorter wavelengths of light.</dc:description>

      <title>The Impact of Halogenated Phenylalanine Derivatives on NFGAIL Amyloid Formation</title>
      <dc:description>The hexapeptide hIAPP  22&#8208;27  (NFGAIL) is known as a crucial amyloid core sequence of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) whose aggregates can be used to better understand the wild&#8208;type hIAPP's toxicity to &#946;&#8208;cell death. In amyloid research, the role of hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions as potential driving forces during the aggregation process is controversially discussed not only in case of NFGAIL, but also for amyloidogenic peptides in general. Here, we used halogenation of the aromatic residue as a strategy to modulate hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions and prepared a library of NFGAIL variants containing fluorinated and iodinated phenylalanine analogues. We used thioflavin T staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) to study the impact of side&#8208;chain halogenation on NFGAIL amyloid formation kinetics. Our data revealed a synergy between aggregation behavior and hydrophobicity of the phenylalanine residue.

      <title>Recent Progress in the Synthesis of Homogeneous Erythropoietin (EPO) Glycoforms</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting just what you want: The FDA&#8208;approved glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) is an important therapeutic agent and is manufactured by using recombinant protein synthesis, generating a mixture of glycoforms. We highlight recent alternative approaches employing chemical protein synthesis or semisynthesis that produce a single EPO glycoform, thus allowing the roles of the glycans to be more fully understood.







Abstract
Erythropoietin (EPO) has been regarded as a therapeutic glycoprotein for the clinical treatment of anaemia since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Commercial production of the 165&#8208;residue glycoprotein is by recombinant protein expression using mammalian cell lines that renders a complex mixture of glycoforms that have an identical amino acid sequence but variations in the structures of the pendant glycans. This heterogeneous nature of human recombinant EPO restricts structural and bioactivity studies in medicinal chemistry. Consequently, chemical synthesis provides an elegant approach for the preparation of complex homogeneous glycoproteins from a readily accessible pool of amino acids and sugars. In addition, the combination of chemical and biosynthesis enables robust and large&#8208;scale production of homogeneous EPO. The scope of this minireview is to summarise the recent advances in the chemical and semisyntheses of homogeneous EPO glycoforms, highlighting the versatile approaches to the preparation and structural manipulations of the carbohydrate chains incorporated into synthetic EPO glycoproteins.

      <title>A Hydroxyquinoline&#8208;Based Unnatural Amino Acid for the Design of Novel Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Expanding biotransformations: Several metal&#8208;binding noncanonical amino acids have been incorporated into protein scaffolds to create artificial metalloenzymes. We introduced 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)propanoic acid (HQAla) into lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) and complexed it with several transition metal ions such as CuII, ZnII and RhIII to showcase its catalytic potential in a variety of different reactions.







Abstract
We have examined the potential of the noncanonical amino acid (8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)alanine (HQAla) for the design of artificial metalloenzymes. HQAla, a versatile chelator of late transition metals, was introduced into the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) by stop codon suppression methodology. LmrR_HQAla was shown to complex efficiently with three different metal ions, CuII, ZnII and RhIII to form unique artificial metalloenzymes. The catalytic potential of the CuII&#8208;bound LmrR_HQAla enzyme was shown through its ability to catalyse asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Craft alkylation and water addition, whereas the ZnII&#8208;coupled enzyme was shown to mimic natural Zn hydrolase activity.
