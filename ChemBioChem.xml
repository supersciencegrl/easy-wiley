         <title>Target Identification of Marine Natural Product Odoamide:

Odoamide Induces Apoptotic Cell Death by Targeting ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Alpha 1 (ATP1A1)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Marine natural products show a large variety of unique chemical structures and potent biological activities. Elucidating the target molecule and the mechanism of action is an essential and challenging step in drug development starting with a natural product. Odoamide, a member of aurilide&#8208;family isolated from Okinawan marine cyanobacterium, has been known to exhibit highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the target protein and the cytotoxic mechanism of odoamide. Compared to existing anticancer agents, odoamide showed a unique fingerprint in the JFCR39 cancer cell panel and a characteristic pattern in gene expression profiling. Affinity chromatography utilizing a biologically active odoamide probe identified ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) as a specific binding protein. Additionally, cells resistant to odoamide were found to have mutations at Gly98 and Gly99 of the ATP1A1 protein. The apparently attenuated cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of odoamide in odoamide&#8208;resistant cells suggests that the induction of these activities by odoamide is critically dependent on its interaction with ATP1A1. We conclude that odoamide induces apoptotic cell death by targeting ATP1A1, and we discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of ATP1A1 inhibitors for drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>177Lu Radiolabeled Polydopamine Decorated with Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor for Locoregional Treatment of Glioma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine (PDA) was conjugated with fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) and macrocyclic chelator (DOTA) for specific cancer targeting and 177Lu labeling. The synthesized nanoradiopharmaceutical, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI, demonstrated satisfactory antitumor ability after intratumoral injection to U87MG tumor&#8208;bearing mice. In contrast, intravenous injection did not result in noticeable tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
Radionuclide therapy is expected to be a powerful tool for glioma treatment. Here, we introduced a novel nuclear nanomedicine based on polydopamine (PDA), incorporating fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) and macrocyclic chelator (DOTA) for specific cancer targeting and 177Lu labeling. The synthesized nanoradiopharmaceutical, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI, exhibits good stability in serum, saline and PBS over 5&#8197;days. 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI shows efficient specific uptake and internalization when incubated with U87MG cells. In vivo distribution visualized prominent accumulation and long retention ability of 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI at tumor sites after local administration. Moreover, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI has satisfactory antitumor ability without apparent toxic and side effects observed from therapy assay and H&amp;E staining. This study highlights the feasibility of using PDA as a nanocarrier for glioma endoradiotherapy by targeting fibroblast activation protein.

         <title>Flow Cytometric Analysis for Evaluating Protein Synthesis Efficiency in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles with Charged Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GFP synthesis using reconstituted cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (PURE system) in artificial cells composed of charged lipids showed lower GFP synthesis efficiency compared to neutral lipids. This reduced efficiency was restored when both positive and negative charges were introduced to the lipid membrane, neutralizing the overall charge.







Abstract
Quantitative investigation of the relationship between endosomal translation reactions and phospholipid membrane composition is crucial for enhancing protein translation efficiency in artificial cells. In this study, we quantitatively compared the translation reactions within liposomes containing negatively and positively charged lipids using green fluorescent protein fluorescence as an indicator to investigate whether lipid membrane charge affects translation reaction efficiency in artificial cells. Thus, translation efficiency reduced in liposomes containing both negatively and positively charged lipids. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the percentage of liposomes undergoing translational reactions was reduced by the charged phospholipids. This translation reaction inhibition was alleviated by adding equal amounts of negatively and positively charged lipids, indicating that phospholipid membrane charges affected translation reaction efficiency. The relationship between membrane composition and translation reaction efficiency identified in this study is significant for the constructing complex artificial cells, particularly concerning membrane composition design

         <title>A Mn(salen)&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzyme for Nitrene and Oxene Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(salen)&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) were constructed by embedding biotinylated Mn(salen) complexes into streptavidin. Their activities were improved by genetic optimization of protein scaffold and the ArM variants catalyzed the aziridination of styrene and oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with up to 19 and 146 turnover numbers.







Abstract
The development of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) offers a potent approach to incorporate non&#8208;natural chemical reactions into biocatalysis. Here we report the assembly of Mn(salen)&#8208;based ArMs by embedding biotinylated Mn(salen) complexes into streptavidin (Sav) variants. Using commercially available nitrene and oxo transfer reagents, these biohybrid catalysts catalyzed the aziridination of alkenes and oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with up to 19 and 146 turnover numbers.

         <title>Proton Occupancies in Histidine Side Chains of Carbonic Anhydrase II by Neutron Crystallography and NMR &#8211; Differences, Similarities and Opportunities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Comparative studies of histidine proton occupancy in Human Carbonic Anhydrase II using NMR spectroscopy and neutron protein crystallography.







Abstract
Histidine is a key amino&#8208;acid residues in proteins that can exist in three different protonation states: two different neutral tautomeric forms and a protonated, positively charged one. It can act as both donor and acceptor of hydrogen bonds, coordinate metal ions, and engage in acid/base catalysis. Human Carbonic Anhydrase II (HCA II) is a pivotal enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. It contains 12 histidine residues: six are surface exposed, two buried, three are active site zinc ion ligands, and one is a proton shuttle. Comparing results from NMR spectroscopy with previously determined neutron protein crystal structures enabled a side&#8208;by&#8208;side investigation of the proton occupancies and preferred tautomeric states of the histidine residues in HCA II. Buried and zinc coordinating histidines remain in one neutral tautomeric state across the entire pH range studied, as validated by both methods. In contrast, solvent&#8208;exposed histidines display high variability in proton occupancies. While the data were overall remarkably consistent between methods, some discrepancies were observed, shedding light on the limitations of each technique. Therefore, combining these methods with full awareness of the advantages and drawbacks of each, provides insights into the dynamic protonation landscape of HCA II histidines, crucial for elucidating enzyme catalytic mechanisms.

         <title>Navigating The Deuteration Landscape: Innovations, Challenges, and Clinical Potential of Deuterioindoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuteroindole as a focal point, this review traces the evolution of deuterium chemistry from its discovery to clinical applications. It highlights how deuterium enhances drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, envisions its transformative role in precision medicine, and addresses challenges in synthesis, intellectual property, and regulation, while underscoring its broader impact across scientific disciplines.







Abstract
Indoles, pivotal to the realm of drug discovery, underpin numerous FDA&#8208;approved therapeutics. Despite their clinical benefits, pharmacokinetic and toxicity concerns have occasionally hampered their broader application. A notable advancement in this domain is the substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium, known as deuterium modification, which significantly enhances the pharmacological properties of these compounds. This review elucidates the progression of deuterium chemistry, culminating in approval of Deutetrabenazine in 2017. This milestone has catalyzed additional research into deuterated indoles, such as Dosimertinib, which have demonstrated enhancements in stability, toxicity profiles, and therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the review addresses challenges and patent issues in the synthesis of deuterated indoles and highlights their potential applications in precision medicine. In the future, deuterated indoles may positively impact therapy and contribute to advances in precision medicine through molecular engineering.

         <title>Cytotoxic Ruthenium(II)&#8208;diphosphine Complexes affect the Mitochondrial Respiration of Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we studied six Ruthenium(II)&#8208;diphosphine compounds containing different mercapto ligands (N&#8211;S), with general formula [Ru(N&#8211;S)(dppm)2]Cl (dppm = 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane). These compounds were characterized by several techniques (NMR [1H, 31P(1H), and 13C], HRMS, IR, UV&#8208;Vis and XRD) and their purity confirmed by elemental analysis. DLS experiments revealed low diameters and polydispersity indexes, and positive log P values in n&#8208;octanol/PBS indicated their preference for the organic phase. In general, these compounds are stable in different media over 48 h. Cytotoxicity experiments revealed promising IC50 values on A549 breast cancer cells, 0.48 &#181;M and 0.80 &#181;M for [Ru(mtz)(dppm)2]Cl (1) and [Ru(mmi)(dppm)2]Cl (2), respectively (mtz and mmi are 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;thiazoline and mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole in their deprotonated form, respectively). Clonogenic and migration experiments indicated their antiproliferative and anti&#8208;migratory capacity. ICP&#8208;MS results indicated their cellular accumulation in the nucleus, with little amounts in mitochondria. No covalent DNA binding was observed by ICP&#8208;MS. JC&#8208;1 and cell Mito Stress test confirmed mitochondrial dysfunction, which was verified by mitochondrial membrane potential uncoupling and drastic alterations in the oxygen consumption rate. Taken together, our results provide crucial insights regarding the anticancer potential of ruthenium(II)&#8208;phosphine compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies to Enhance the Therapeutic Efficacy of GLP&#8208;1 Receptor Agonists through Structural Modification and Carrier Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient endogenous insulin production or impaired sensitivity to insulin. In recent years, a class of incretin&#8208;based hypoglycemic drugs, glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs), have attracted great attention in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their benefits, including stable glycemic control ability, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction for patients. However, like other peptide drugs, GLP&#8208;1RAs face challenges such as instability, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and immunogenicity, which severely limit their clinical application. In recent years, various strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of GLP&#8208;1RAs, including structural modification and carrier&#8208;mediated delivery. This article briefly introduces the research and application status of several common GLP&#8208;1RAs and their limitations. Taking exendin&#8208;4 as an example, we focus on the research progress of improving bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy based on structural modification and carrier delivery strategies, aiming to provide reference for the development of new GLP&#8208;1RAs treatment systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Cas9&#8208;Based Gene Editing to Engineering of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) could transform the production of bioactive natural product derivatives. A number of recent reports have described the engineering of NRPSs without marked reductions in yield. Comparative analysis of evolutionarily related NRPSs can provide insights regarding permissive fusion sites for engineering where recombination may occur during evolutionary processes. Studies involving engineering of NRPSs using these recombination sites showed that they have great potential. Moreover, we highlight recent advances in engineering of NRPSs using CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based gene editing technology. The use of Cas9 facilitates the editing of even larger biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) close to or over 100 kb in size by precisely targeting and digesting DNA sequences at specific sites. This technology combined with growing understanding of potential fusion sites from large&#8208;scale informatics analyses will accelerate the scalable exploration of engineered NRPS assembly lines to obtain bioactive natural product derivatives in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of caged functional RNAs by an oxidative transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA exhibits remarkable capacity as a functional polymer, with broader catalytic and ligand&#8208;binding capability than previously thought. Despite this, the low side chain diversity present in nucleic acids (two purines and two pyrimidines) relative to proteins (20+ side chains of varied charge, polarity, and chemical functionality) limits the capacity of functional RNAs to act as environmentally responsive polymers, as is possible for peptide&#8208;based receptors and catalysts. Here we show that incorporation of the modified nucleobase 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sU) into functional (aptamer and ribozyme) RNAs produces functionally inactivated polymers that can be activated by oxidative treatment. 2&#8208;thiouridine lacks lack the 2&#8208;position oxygen found in uridine, altering its hydrogen bonding pattern. This limits critical interactions (e.g., G&#8208;U wobble pairs) that allow for proper folding. Oxidative desulfurization of the incorporated 2&#8208;thiouridine moieties to uridine relieves this inability to fold properly, enabling recovery of function. This demonstration of expanded roles for RNA as environmentally responsive functional polymers challenges the notion that they are not known to be redox&#8208;sensitive. Harnessing redox switchability could facilitate new roles in an early &#8220;RNA World,&#8221; extant biology, or new tools in synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Drug Delivery Systems for Atopic Dermatitis Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus and impaired skin barrier function. Advances in drug delivery systems have transformed AD treatment by enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Drug delivery systems such as liposomes, hydrogels, and microneedles enable deeper skin penetration, prolonged drug retention, and controlled release, reducing side effects and treatment frequency. Liposomes improve drug absorption and stability, while hydrogels offer high water content and responsive drug release. Microneedles facilitate painless, localized drug delivery, enhancing patient compliance. These systems address the limitations of traditional therapies like topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants, which are associated with adverse effects and poor patient adherence. Recent innovations include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics targeting immune pathways, demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing inflammation and symptoms. Drug delivery systems offer a safer, more efficient alternative for delivering these advanced therapies. By improving therapeutic outcomes and patient experience, drug delivery systems represent a crucial advancement in AD management.</dc:description>

         <title>MOLECULAR INSIGHTS INTO THE HEME&#8208;BINDING POTENTIAL OF PLANT NCR247&#8208;DERIVED PEPTIDES</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme is involved in many critical processes in pathogenic bacteria as iron acquisition by these microorganisms is achieved by either direct uptake of heme or use of heme&#8208;binding proteins called hemophores. Exploring the underlying mechanisms on a molecular level can open new avenues in understanding the host&#8208;pathogen interactions. Any imbalance of the heme concentration has a direct impact on the bacterial growth and survival.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heme is involved in many critical processes in pathogenic bacteria as iron acquisition by these microorganisms is achieved by either direct uptake of heme or use of heme-binding proteins called hemophores. Exploring the underlying mechanisms on a molecular level can open new avenues in understanding the host-pathogen interactions. Any imbalance of the heme concentration has a direct impact on the bacterial growth and survival.

         <dc:description>
Expansion Microscopy (ExM) employs physical methods to magnify biological samples, enabling visualization of refined cellular structures. Using specialized hydrogels, ExM could achieve super&#8208;resolution imaging on conventional microscope, thus permitting detailed examination of fine structures of cells and tissue sections by anchoring large biological molecules. This review highlights ExM's potential in biomedicine and provides insights into its future development prospects.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) is an innovative super&#8208;resolution imaging technique that utilizes physical expansion to magnify biological samples, facilitating the visualization of cellular structures that are challenging to observe using traditional optical microscopes. The fundamental principle of ExM revolves around employing a specialized hydrogel to uniformly expand biological samples, thereby achieving super&#8208;resolution imaging under conventional optical imaging conditions. This technology finds application not only in various biological samples such as cells and tissue sections, but also enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of large biological molecules including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolite molecules. In recent years, numerous researchers have delved into ExM, resulting in the continuous development of a range of derivative technologies that optimize experimental protocols and broaden practical application fields. This article presents a comprehensive review of these derivative technologies, highlighting the utilization of ExM for anchoring nucleic acids, proteins, and other biological molecules, as well as its applications in biomedicine. Furthermore, this review offers insights into the future development prospects of ExM technology.

         <title>Formation of Poly&#8208;L&#8211;Lysine&#8208;Porphyrin Derivative Complex Exhibiting Diminished Dark Toxicity in Aqueous Solutions and High Photodynamic Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dark toxicity of the poly&#8208;L&#8211;lysine (PLL)&#8211;porphyrin complex was significantly reduced by the reduction or elimination of free PLL, as evidenced by the higher dark toxicity of PLL compared with that of the PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex. In contrast, the PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex exhibited a high photodynamic activity under photoirradiation at 610&#8211;740&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;L&#8211;lysine (PLL) displays a high solubilizing ability for hydrophobic guest molecules, and when in complexes with guest molecules, it exhibits a high intracellular uptake. However, its high cytotoxicity, originating from its cationic character, significantly limits its applications in biological and medicinal chemistry. In this study, the amount of free PLL in an aqueous solution of a PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex was immensely reduced, resulting in considerably lower dark toxicity than that of the free PLL. Furthermore, the PLL&#8211;porphyrin complex exhibited high photodynamic activity under photoirradiation at 610&#8211;740&#8197;nm.

         <title>Research Status and Applications of Adeno&#8208;Associated Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a powerful and effective tool for the delivery of exogenous genes into various cells or tissues. To improve the gene delivery efficiency, as well as the safety and specificity of AAV's cell&#8208;targeting capabilities, extensive investigations have been conducted into its molecular biological characteristics, including capsid structure, cellular tropism, and the mechanisms underlying its entry, replication, DNA packaging, and capsid assembly. Significant differences exist between human and non&#8208;human primate AAVs regarding tissue targeting and transduction efficiency. These differences are primarily attributed to the amino acid sequences of AAV capsid proteins, the structural characteristics of these proteins, and the interactions of AAV with surface factors on host cells, such as cell surface receptors, signaling molecules, and associated proteins. This review primarily focuses on several key aspects of AAV, including its genome, coat proteins and their structures, genome replication, virus assembly, and the role of helper viruses. Additionally, it examines the utilization of recombinant adeno&#8208;associated viruses (rAAV), detailing their production methods, mechanisms of cell entry and trafficking, and various serotypes. The review further interprets the role of rAAV by analyzing its current applications in research and therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advance in Sensitive Detection of Demethylase FTO</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylation modification is a critical regulatory mechanism in epigenetics, playing a significant role in various biological processes. N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification found in RNA. This modification is dynamic and reversible, regulated by methyltransferases and demethylases. The fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO) facilitates the demethylation of m6A in RNA, and its aberrant expression is closely associated with the development of multiple diseases. Thus, FTO has the potential to serve as a crucial biomarker for clinical disease diagnosis. Despite its significance, there has been a lack of comprehensive reviews addressing the research advancements in detection methods for the demethylase FTO. This review provides an overview of the progress in FTO detection methods, ranging from traditional approaches to novel techniques, with a particular focus on recently reported innovations. These novel detection methods can be categorized into strategies based on enzymes, functional nucleic acids (FNA), and conformational changes. We summarize the principles and applications of these detection methods and discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced synthesis of spherical nucleic acids: a limit&#8208;pursuing game with broad implications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consist of DNA strands arranged radially and packed densely on the surface of nanoparticles. Due to their unique properties, which are not found in naturally occurring linear or circular DNA, SNAs have gained widespread attention in fields such as sensing, nanomedicine, and colloidal assembly. The rapidly evolving applications of SNAs have driven a modernization of their syntheses to meet different needs. Recently, several advanced approaches have emerged, enabling ultrafast, quantitative, and low&#8208;cost SNA synthesis with maximal DNA grafting through &#8220;counterintuitive&#8221; processes like freezing and dehydration. This concept paper discusses these critical developments from a synthetic perspective, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and broad implications, with a goal of inspiring future research in related fields.</dc:description>

         <title>NOVEL APPROACHES IN TARGETING MEMBRANE AND SECRETED PROTEINS FOR LYSOSOMAL DEGRADATION</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein degradation is pivotal for all biochemical aspects of cellular function. In mammalian cells, protein degradation is mediated mainly by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic&#8208;lysosomal system (ALS). Over the last two decades, different types of targeted protein degradation approaches have been developed including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs), which employ the UPS to degrade intracellular proteins and the ALS to degrade extracellular and membrane proteins respectively. Nevertheless, current targeted membrane protein degradation approaches face some inherent challenges including limited target protein degradation efficacy and cell type specific applicability. Herein, we highlight a recent development of novel targeted membrane protein degradation modalities that exhibit wide&#8208;applicability and high protein degradation efficiency. These novel membrane protein degraders hold tremendous promise as new pharmacological and biochemical tools in targeting membrane and secretory proteins for lysosomal degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterisation of the Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase CYP116B46 from Tepidiphilus thermophilus as a Homogentisic Acid Generating Enzyme and its Conversion to a Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heme enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYPs) catalyse the selective hydroxylation of unactivated C&#8208;H bonds in organic molecules. There is great interest in applying these enzymes as biocatalysts with a focus on self&#8208;sufficient CYP &#8216;fusion&#8217; enzymes, comprising a single polypeptide chain with the electron transfer components joined to the heme domain. Here we elucidate the function of the self&#8208;sufficient CYP116B46 fusion enzyme, from the thermophilic bacterium Tepidiphilus thermophilus. We demonstrate that it efficiently hydroxylates aromatic organic acids, exemplified by oxidation of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid to homogentisic acid (2,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), an important metabolite in bacterial catabolism. In line with the thermophilic nature of the source bacterium, activity increased at higher temperatures, (50 &#176;C), with a catalytic preference for NADPH over NADH. While self&#8208;sufficient fusion enzymes simplify biocatalysis; engineered peroxygenase activity is also a key advance in the application of these enzymes as biocatalysts as it eliminates the need for electron transfer partner proteins and nicotinamide cofactors. We demonstrate that a T278E mutation in the heme domain of CYP116B46, confers peroxygenase activity. This engineered peroxygenase enzyme is stable to elevated temperatures and catalytic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, with an observed optimal activity resulting in a total turnover number of ~650.</dc:description>

         <title>d&#8208;Galactose&#8208;Esterification of a Fungal Polyketide Catalyzed by a Carnitine Acyltransferase Domain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While sugar&#8208;containing natural products are commonly biosynthesized via glycosyltranferases using sugar&#8208;UDP as the electrophile, nature has evolved alternative strategies of glyco&#8208;modification to expand the diversity of natural products. Hydroxyl groups on sugars can serve as nucleophiles in the release of polyketide products from polyketide synthases. Herein, we demonstrate a highly reducing polyketide synthase (HRPKS) from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum T22, which is terminated with a carnitine acyltransferase (cAT) domain, catalyzes the biosynthesis of a d&#8208;galactose esterified polyketide named as trichogalactin. Structure&#8208;guided enzymatic assays showed that the sugar nucleophile in the esterification reaction catalyzed by cAT is &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;galactose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P) instead of free d&#8208;galactose. The released product, trichogalactin phosphate, is subsequently dephosphorylated by a host alkaline phosphatase to complete the biosynthesis of trichogalactin. The cAT domain is highly specific for Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P and does not accept &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate or &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Our study expands the inventory of natural products from an agriculturally important fungus and demonstrates the potential of mining cAT&#8208;containing HRPKSs to discover new glyco&#8208;esterified natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligoadenine Strand Functionalized Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Film Exhibiting pH&#8208;Triggered High&#8208;Degree Inverse Shape Deformations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Smart shape&#8208;memory DNA hydrogels, which can respond to various types of external stimuli and undergo macroscopic shape deformations, have shown great potential in various applications. By constructing free&#8208;standing films, the deformation and response properties of these hydrogels can be further enhanced, and visualized deformation can be achieved. However, DNA hydrogels that can exhibit rapid and high&#8208;degree shape deformations, such as the inverse shape deformations, are still lacking. Herein, free&#8208;standing oligoadenine strand&#8208;functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films were developed that can exhibit rapid and high&#8208;degree of inverse shape deformation upon cyclic pH changes. The oligoadenine strands exhibit a pH&#8208;stimulated reversible conformational transition between a flexible single&#8208;stranded state and parallel duplex A&#8208;motif structures, resulting in their role change in the film from negatively charged side chains to &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; crosslinking structures, driving a high degree of inverse shape deformation with a relative bending angle change of 223.7%, which is more than 5 times that of a film driven by pH&#8208;responsive i&#8208;motif structures, facilitating the development of bilayer hydrogel film actuators with potential in flexible sensors and robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Entrapment of lipase from Candida antarctica in a xerogel for the production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The process to synthesize biodiesel is well&#8208;developed and optimized to overcome the disadvantages like the competition with agriculture using feedstock, and the problematics in the process. Oils from waste and enzymatic catalysis have proven to be good solutions to these problems. Lipases are currently the most commonly used enzymes in the transesterification of oils; nevertheless, enzymes have a high cost and must be immobilized to offer repetitive reuse. This work focuses on the synthesis and the optimization of the conditions of a xerogel where the lipase from Candida antarctica is immobilized by entrapment. The xerogel synthesized here, a glass&#8208;like material, proved to be very effective in maintaining the enzyme on its structure, with an immobilization rate of 96% and an activity of 5.3 U/mg (free lipase = 12.1 U/mg). By grinding this xerogel, the immobilization rate didn&#8217;t change much, to reach 94%. Nevertheless, grinding the xerogel allowed better diffusion of reagents, and the activity reached 9.7 U/mg. Using this xerogel in biodiesel production has a positive effect on CALB by avoiding the oil from deteriorating the activity of the CALB, also increasing the biodiesel yield, 46.1% (15.1% with free CALB). Finally, the catalyst can be reused for five full runs.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Interplay Between G&#8208;Quadruplexes and Natural/Synthetic Polyamines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though PAs are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G4s are transient regulatory elements. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G4s and biogenic polyamines or synthetic G4 ligands containing polyamines. This work will assist to understand the biological impact of the association between G4s and natural/synthetic PAs.







Abstract
The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though polyamines are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G&#8208;quadruplexes are transient regulatory elements, being both of them key regulators of biological processes. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G&#8208;quadruplexes and biogenic polyamines to understand the biological interplay between them. Moreover, we overview the main works focused on synthetic ligands containing polyamines designed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes, aiming to unravel the structural motifs for designing potent and selective G4 ligands.

         <title>Effect of Linker Length on the Function of Biotinylated OSW&#8208;1 Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of linker length of biotinylated OSW&#8208;1 probes on their functions was evaluated using known target proteins, OSBP and ORP4. The biotinylated probe 3 with PEG5 linker enabled most effective enrichment of target proteins in an affinity pulldown assay, suggesting that the cytotoxicity and pulldown efficiency did not correlate among the probes studied.







Abstract
The biotinylated probes based on anticancer saponin OSW&#8208;1 with varied linker lengths were synthesized and their cell growth inhibitory activity and affinity pulldown efficiency were evaluated. All probes demonstrated comparable cytotoxicity to the parent natural product, highlighting that the linker moiety had a minimal impact on cell uptake or target engagement. In contrast, when evaluated against the known target proteins, OSBP and ORP4, the biotinylated probe 3 with PEG5 linker enabled most effective enrichment of target proteins in the affinity pulldown assay, suggesting that the cytotoxicity and pulldown efficiency did not correlate among the probes studied. Our data provided the first evidence that OSW&#8208;1 specifically binds to endogenously expressed OSBP and ORP4. The selectivity of affinity pulldown using probe 3 was also validated by facile identification of the enriched protein by silver staining and LC/MS analysis. Therefore, probe 3 with PEG5 linker comprising of 25&#8197;atoms (28&#8197;&#197;) was found as an optimal biotinylated probe for isolating OSW&#8208;1 binding proteins from cell lysate.

         <title>Autoinhibition in (Bio)Chemistry: Identification and Mechanistic Classification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconciliation of the considerable disagreement about the usage of term autoinhibition in biochemistry and in chemical kinetics is presented by mechanistic classification of different types of autoinhibitions. A useful guiding tool is also provided serving as a solid starting point for correct identification which inhibitory enzymatic reactions may be referred to as an autoinhibitory system.







Abstract
Autoinhibition is a frequently invoked self&#8208;regulatory mechanism involved in various cellular processes to interpret clearly how these cells may control their complex functioning. This type of temporal behavior generally results in self&#8208;retardation or even in complete shuts down of the undesired reactions to occur meaning that the rate of a certain biochemical reaction is partially or completely retarded. Precise characterization and classification of a complex system where deceleration of the reaction rate is found, however, requires special circumspection to avoid false interpretation. Hereby, it was clearly demonstrated that the retardation effect of an inhibitor is unexpectedly often misidentified as autoinhibition, especially in complex biochemical enzymatic systems. It prompted us to clarify unambiguously the difference between inhibition and autoinhibition. The latter kinetic phenomenon is a special type of inhibition where the inhibitor forms by the result of a chemical or biochemical event exerting the self&#8208;decelerating effect on the rate of its own formation resulting thus in significantly different temporal patterns compared to the ones observed in the case of simple inhibitions. Kinetic activity of autoinhibitor towards the species involved in the given system allowed us to classify direct, indirect and dual autoinhibitions to be supported by real chemical examples.

         <title>Targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Proteins: In Silico Investigation with Polypyridyl&#8208;Based Zn(II)&#8208;Curcumin Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents molecular docking studies for insight into the inhibition potential of polypyridyl Zn(II) curcumin complexes against four viral proteins, i.&#8201;e., spike protein (S), Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme II Receptor protein (ACE2), nucleocapsid protein (N), main protease protein (Mpro), and RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase protein (RdRp) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.







Abstract
Herein, we have selected eight Zn(II)&#8208;based complexes viz., [Zn(bpy)(acac)Cl] (1), [Zn(phen)(acac)Cl] (2), [Zn(dppz)(acac)Cl] (3), [Zn(dppn)(acac)Cl] (4), [Zn(bpy)(cur)Cl] (5), [Zn(phen)(cur)Cl] (6), [Zn(dppz)(cur)Cl] (7), [Zn(dppn)(cur)Cl] (8), where bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, dppz=benzo[i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine, dppn=naphtho[2,3&#8208;i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine, acac=acetylacetonate, cur=curcumin and performed in silico molecular docking studies with the viral proteins, i.&#8201;e., spike protein (S), Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme II Receptor protein (ACE2), nucleocapsid protein (N), main protease protein (Mpro), and RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase protein (RdRp) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The binding energy calculations, visualization of the docking orientation, and analysis of the interactions revealed that these complexes could be potential inhibitors of the viral proteins. Among complexes 1&#8211;8, complex 6 showed the strongest binding affinity with S and ACE2 proteins. 4 exerted better binding affinity in the case of the N protein, whereas 8 presented the highest binding affinities with Mpro and RdRp among all the complexes. Overall, the study indicated that Zn(II) complexes have the potential as alternative and viable therapeutic solutions for COVID&#8208;19.

         <dc:description>
The selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry involves a nucleophilic substitution, in which the nitrogen at the electrophilic selenium(II) center is replaced by a suitable nucleophile, facilitating the flexible and efficient formation of linkages around the Se(II) core.







Abstract
The continuous development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is crucial for advancing the frontiers of click chemistry. Selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry, a versatile chemistry in click chemistry, represents an all&#8208;encompassing term for nucleophilic substitution events that replace nitrogen at an electrophilic selenium(II) center, enabling the flexible and efficient assembly of linkages around a Se(II) core. Several SeNEx chemistries have been developed inspired by the biochemical reaction between Ebselen and cysteine residue, and demonstrated significant potential in on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, selenium&#8208;containing DNA&#8208;encoded library (SeDEL) synthesis, as well as peptide and protein bioconjugation. This concept aims to present the origins, advancements, and applications of selenium(II)&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry while also outlining the potential directions for future research in this field.

In this Concept, we summarize and discuss the latest advancements in disulfide&#8208;bonded peptide and protein folding, with a particular focus on biomimetic folding strategies that mimic the oxidative folding process in organisms. These strategies include artificial chaperone&#8208;assisted folding, glycosylation&#8208;assisted folding, and organic oxidative folding. We also anticipate the existing challenges and potential future research directions.







Abstract
Disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides and proteins, including hormones, toxins, growth factors, and others, are abundant in living organisms. These molecules play crucial physiological roles such as regulating cell and organism growth, development, and metabolism. They have also found widespread applications as drugs or tool molecules in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. However, the chemical synthesis of disulfide&#8208;bonded proteins is complicated by the challenges associated with their folding. This review focuses on the latest advancements in disulfide&#8208;bonded peptide and protein folding technologies. Particularly, it highlights biomimetic folding strategies that emulate the naturally occurring oxidative folding processes in nature.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Rational Design of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron&#8208;Based Lysine Dioxygenase Improves its Total Turnover Number</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a new rational design strategy that synergizes a structure&#8208;based self&#8208;supervised machine learning framework, MutComputeX, with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to engineer a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;based lysine dioxygenase. Rationally designed variants displayed greater purification yields and all increased turnover number relative to WT. This method drastically lowers the cost of sampling single mutant sequence space for protein engineering campaigns and accelerates the development of industrially relevant biocatalysts.







Abstract
Highly selective C&#8722;H functionalization remains an ongoing challenge in organic synthetic methodologies. Biocatalysts are robust tools for achieving these difficult chemical transformations. Biocatalyst engineering has often required directed evolution or structure&#8208;based rational design campaigns to improve their activities. In recent years, machine learning has been integrated into these workflows to improve the discovery of beneficial enzyme variants. In this work, we combine a structure&#8208;based self&#8208;supervised machine learning framework, MutComputeX, with classical molecular dynamics simulations to down select mutations for rational design of a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent lysine dioxygenase, LDO. This approach consistently resulted in functional LDO mutants and circumvents the need for extensive study of mutational activity before&#8208;hand. Our rationally designed single mutants purified with up to 2&#8208;fold higher expression yields than WT and displayed higher total turnover numbers (TTN). Combining five such single mutations into a pentamutant variant, LPNYI LDO, leads to a 40&#8201;% improvement in the TTN (218&#177;3) as compared to WT LDO (TTN=160&#177;2). Overall, this work offers a low&#8208;barrier approach for those seeking to synergize machine learning algorithms with pre&#8208;existing protein engineering strategies.

         <title>Significant Enhancement Catalytic Activity of Nitrile Hydratase by Balancing the Subunits Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We greatly increased the expression of the &#946;&#8208;subunit of recombinant nitrile hydratase by replacing the RBS located in front of the &#946;&#8208;subunit gene sequence of the nitrile hydratase recombinant plasmid, and the efficiency of the modified nitrile hydratase in catalysing the generation of 5&#8208;cyanopentanamide from adiponitrile, as well as the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed efficiency from both were dramatically enhanced.







Abstract
Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most commonly used bacterial recombinant protein production system due to its easy genetic modification properties. In our previous study, a recombinant plasmid expressing the Fe&#8208;type nitrile hydratase derived from Rhodococcus erythropolis CCM2595 (ReNHase) was successfully constructed and the recombinant ReNHase exerted an excellent catalytic effect on dinitrile compounds. Nevertheless, the ReNHases were confronted with imbalanced subunit expression during heterologous expression, which restricted the enzymes assemble functionally. In this study, the secondary structure of mRNA in the ribosome binding sequence region of the &#946;&#8208;subunit was optimized to elevate the translation efficiency of the &#946;&#8208;subunit gene and balance the expression of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;subunits in ReNHase. The optimized ReNHase showed a 12&#8208;fold increase in specific enzyme activity over wild&#8208;type ReNHase. To further enhance the soluble expression of ReNHase, the ReNHase was labeled using three different fusion tags, resulting in three new recombinant ReNHases. In these recombinant ReNHases, some of the fusion tags promoted the soluble expression of ReNHase, but also affected the balance of &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;subunit expression and the secondary structure of the ReNHase, and reduced the enzyme activity. In conclusion, our results provide an optimized strategy for the heterologous expression of multi&#8208;subunit proteins.

         <title>Discovery and Heterologous Expression of Trilenodin, an Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide with a Unique Tri&#8208;Isoleucine Motif</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new antimicrobial lasso peptide, trilenodin, was bioinformatically identified, isolated, and characterized from Firmicutes bacterium Paenibacillus taiwanensis DSM18679. We connected production of trilenodin to its biosynthetic gene cluster by establishing a Firmicutes&#8208;based lasso peptide heterologous expression system and report trilenodin as the first known biologically active Firmicutes lasso peptide.







Abstract
Lasso peptides are an increasingly relevant class of peptide natural products with diverse biological activities, intriguing physical properties, and unique chemical structures. Most characterized lasso peptides have been from Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, despite bioinformatic analyses suggesting that other bacterial taxa, particularly those from Firmicutes, are rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding lasso peptides. Herein, we report the bioinformatic identification of a lasso peptide BGC from Paenibacillus taiwanensis DSM18679 which we termed pats. We used a bioinformatics&#8208;guided isolation approach and high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) to isolate and subsequently characterize a new lasso peptide produced from the pats BGC, which we named trilenodin, after the tri&#8208;isoleucine motif present in its primary sequence. This tri&#8208;isoleucine motif is unique among currently characterized lasso peptides. We confirmed the connection between the pats BGC and trilenodin production by establishing the first Bacillus subtilis 168&#8208;based heterologous expression system for expressing Firmicutes lasso peptides. We finally determined that trilenodin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against B. subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, making trilenodin the first characterized biologically active lasso peptide from Firmicutes. Collectively, we demonstrate that bacteria from Firmicutes can serve as high&#8208;potential sources of chemically and biologically diverse lasso peptides.

Most characterized lasso peptides have been from Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, despite bioinformatic analyses suggesting that other bacterial taxa, particularly those from Firmicutes, are rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding lasso peptides. Herein, we report the bioinformatic identification of a lasso peptide BGC from &lt;i&gt;Paenibacillus taiwanensis&lt;/i&gt; DSM18679 which we termed &lt;i&gt;pats&lt;/i&gt;. We used a bioinformatics-guided isolation approach and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) to isolate and subsequently characterize a new lasso peptide produced from the &lt;i&gt;pats&lt;/i&gt; BGC, which we named trilenodin, after the tri-isoleucine motif present in its primary sequence. This tri-isoleucine motif is unique among currently characterized lasso peptides. We confirmed the connection between the &lt;i&gt;pats&lt;/i&gt; BGC and trilenodin production by establishing the first &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; 168-based heterologous expression system for expressing Firmicutes lasso peptides. We finally determined that trilenodin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, making trilenodin the first characterized biologically active lasso peptide from Firmicutes. Collectively, we demonstrate that bacteria from Firmicutes can serve as high-potential sources of chemically and biologically diverse lasso peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Expanded Substrate Spectrum of Sulfide:Quinone Oxidoreductase Found in Pollutant Degrading Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfide:qunione oxidoreductase (Sqr) reaction generates reactive sulfur species (RSS), coupling sulfide oxidation and CoQ reduction. Thiols as nucleophiles attack the disulfide bridge, and sulfur transfers to a thiophilic acceptor (Acc&#8722;) such as GSH or another thiol. The variants of key residues and the flexible linker fused RHOD (Rhodanese) with FadH2 (Sqr), likely facilitating sulfur transfer and modulating RSS pool.







Abstract
Sulfide:Quinone Oxidoreductase (Sqr) Catalyzes The Initial Procedure On Sulfide Transformation, Alongside Sulfide (H2S, S2&#8722;) Oxidization Coupled With Coenzyme Q (CoQ) Reducing And Reactive Sulfur Species (RSS) Production. Here, We Assessed The Reactivity Of Propanethiol (PT) As An Alternative Substrate For Sqr To Maintain Intracellular Homeostasis In Strain S&#8208;1 Capable Of Degrading Emerging Sulfur&#8208;Containing Pollutants. We Deleted A Gene Encoding Sqr, And Serial Transcriptional Difference Induced By RSS Dynamics Was Therefore Revealed. Next, The Reaction Properties Of Two Sqr Homologs From Strains JMP134 And S&#8208;1 Were Comparatively Characterized, Respectively. As A Result, An Additional Role Of Sqr In Yielding RSS From PT Was Found In Reaction Mixture Prepared By Cell&#8208;Free Extracts Or Purified Enzymes. Interestingly, The Transformation Velocity Of PT By Sqr Was Slower Than That Of Sulfides. From This Scenario, It Was A Rate&#8208;Determining Step That PT As A Nucleophilic Compound Can Be Added Into Sqr Cysteine To Form Disulfide Bond And Likely Serve Nonoptimal Sulfur Recipient. In Addition, The Role Of Persulfidation Driven By RSS In Combating Oxidative And Sulfur Stresses Required To Be Further Clarified. Nevertheless, This Promiscuity Of Sqr&#8208;Binding Organosulfur Compounds And Its Catalytic Modulation Underscored That Expanded Substrates Might Benefit Sulfide Homeostasis In Thiol&#8208;Degrading Bacteria.

         <title>Selenol Switch Assay for Selenoprotein Derivatization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;Selenol Switch&#8221; assay, which relies on the conversion of the selenocysteine residue to the electrophilic dehydroalanine followed by nucleophiles labelling, for selective derivatization of selenoproteins is developed based on the unique reactivity of selenium. The abundance of selenoproteins in mouse tissues determined by the Selenol Switch assay and ICP&#8208;MS gives consistent results.







Abstract
Selenoproteins are a class of protein that have selenocysteine (Sec) residues, and essential for diverse cellular functions. Although the human genome encodes 25 selenoproteins, nearly half of these selenoproteins&#8217; function is not clear. This is largely due to the lack of convenient methods to study selenoproteins. We report in this work a novel Selenol Switch assay to exclusively derivatize selenoproteins. The Selenol Switch assay relies on the selective conversion of the Sec residue to the electrophilic dehydroalanine (DHA) residue, which is then labeled by nucleophiles. The multiple reactions of the Selenol Switch assay are readily performed in a single test tube, and the conversion yield is nearly quantitative. The abundance of selenoproteins in mouse tissues determined by the Selenol Switch assay is consistent with that from the classical ICP&#8208;MS assay, validating the reliability of the Selenol Switch assay in studying selenoproteins.

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complex with Substituted Benzimidazole: pH Directed Organelle&#8208;Specific Localization Within Lysosome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four mononuclear iridium(III) complexes with two isomeric pairs of bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands were synthesized along with their detailed electrochemical, photophysical and pH dependent emission spectral study. The emission sensing of acid&#8208;base, ammonia and biogenic amines are reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome with great precision.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and pH dependent emission spectral behaviour of four emissive iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) with two isomeric pairs of bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl appended benzimidazole ligands. The imidazolyl hydrogen(N&#8722;H) has been replaced by phenyl groups (N&#8722;Ph) in two ligands to understand the impact of hydrogen bonding on the photophysical properties of the complexes and it indeed plays interesting role in the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics. The pH dependent electronic spectral change is observed for two of the complexes. The enhancement of emission intensity is observed at different wavelength for pH&lt;7 and pH&gt;7 for Ir1 and Ir3. The emission sensing of biogenic amines with pka values ranging from 5.80&#8211;9.74 is reported along with cellular imaging. The complex Ir1 specifically localizes within lysosome (pH=4.5&#8211;5) and thus image this organelle with great precision. The detail electronic spectra and electrochemical behaviour were reported here along with TDDFT results.

         <title>Distinct Effects of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein Segments on Structural Stability, Amyloidogenic Potential, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigated the structural properties and amyloidogenic implications of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein segment SK9, demonstrating that its intrinsically disordered nature facilitates rapid amyloid formation and acceleration of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation, while rationally engineered variants with stable secondary structures abolished these pathogenic effects, which suggest the importance of preserving structural disorder in viral&#8208;derived peptides for developing potential therapeutic interventions targeting protein&#8208;protein interactions and aggregation against viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
Amyloidosis is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins, called amyloid fibrils, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. Recent studies on the amyloidogenesis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protein segments have raised concerns on their potential link to post&#8208;infection neurodegeneration, however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the structure, stability, and amyloidogenic propensity of a nine&#8208;residue segment (SK9) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein and their impact on neuronal protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) aggregation. Specifically, the amino acid sequence of the SK9 wildtype has been modified from a basic and positively charged peptide (SFYVYSRVK), to a nearly neutral and more hydrophobic peptide (SAAVASAVK, labelled as SK9 var1), and to an acidic and negatively charged peptide (SDAVANAVK, labelled as SK9 var2). Our findings reveal that the SK9 wildtype exhibited a pronounced amyloidogenic propensity due to its disordered and unstable nature, while the SK9 variants possessed more ordered and stable structures preventing the amyloid formation. Significantly, the SK9 wildtype demonstrated distinct effect on &#945;Syn aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology to facilitate the formation of &#945;Syn aggregates with enhanced resistance against enzymatic degradation. This study highlights the potential of modifying short peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune their properties, providing insights into understanding and regulating viral&#8208;induced amyloid aggregations.

         <title>Amyloid Fibril Formation on Neuronal Cells in the Coexistence of A&#946;40 and A&#946;42</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On neuronal membranes, A&#946;40 alone and A&#946;42 alone form less toxic and more toxic fibrils, respectively. In their coexistence, A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 form less toxic mixed fibrils, suggesting the possibility that A&#946;40 has a protective role against A&#946;42&#8208;induced cell death.







Abstract
The abnormal aggregation and subsequent deposition of amyloid &#946;&#8208;protein (A&#946;) in the brain are considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The two major species of A&#946; are A&#946;40 and A&#946;42, present at an approximate ratio of 9&#8201;:&#8201;1. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal membranes are an important platform of amyloidogenesis by A&#946;. However, information on the aggregational behaviors of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 on membranes is lacking. In this study, the aggregation and resultant cytotoxicity of coexistent A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 at a physiologically relevant ratio were investigated by fluorescence techniques. We found that the degree of coexistence of both A&#946;s in aggregates increased as the assembly proceeded, and reached a maximum in fibrils. Cross&#8208;seeding experiments supported the hypothesis that A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 interact with each other in the fibrillar states when formed on membranes. However, the cytotoxicity of the mixed fibrils was weaker than that of A&#946;42 fibrils, suggesting the possibility that A&#946;40 attenuates the toxicity of A&#946;42 by forming mixed fibrils. In contrast, the degree of coexistence was significantly lower in aqueous phase aggregation, highlighting different aggregation mechanisms between in membranes and in the aqueous phase.

         <title>Multipartite Fluorogenic Sensors for Monitoring Tyrosine Phosphatase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fluorescence&#8208;Activating and absorption&#8208;Shifting Tag (FAST) protein provides a highly sensitive readout of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of either the small molecule fluorogen required for FAST fluorescence or the C&#8208;terminal peptide fragment of splitFAST, abrogates fluorescence of the protein. Phosphatase&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of these substrates results in significant increases in fluorescence, proportional to phosphatase activity.







Abstract
Fluorogenic substrates are essential tools for studying the activity of many enzymes including the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Here, we have taken the first step toward the development of genetically encodable sensors for PTP activity using fluorescent and fluorogen&#8208;activating proteins. The Fluorescence&#8208;Activating and absorption Shifting Tag (FAST) is a small protein that becomes fluorescent upon binding to a small molecule dye. We demonstrate that FAST protein can be used as a sensor for PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of phosphorylated dye molecules. Phosphorylated 4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (pHBR) is not able to bind to the FAST protein and induce fluorescence, but provides a sensitive assay for PTP activity, readily detecting 100&#8197;pM concentrations of PTP1B in the presence of FAST with a kcat value of 19&#177;1&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a KM value of 93&#177;3&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, while phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of split GFP does not result in appreciable change in fluorescence of the reconstituted protein, phosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide of the split FAST protein abrogates fluorescence. Upon PTP&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of the C&#8208;terminal peptide, the ability of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal components to form a fluorescent complex with the small molecule dye is restored, leading to fluorescence.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Discovery of Substrate Peptide Sequences for E3 Ubiquitin Ligases Using a cDNA Display Method</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a screening system for E3 substrate sequences based on a cDNA display method. A randomized library of potential E3 substrates was displayed in the form of covalent conjugates between the peptide sequences and their corresponding DNA sequences. The displayed library was subjected to in&#8197;vitro ubiquitylation, the ubiquitylated sequences were pulled down by the anti&#8208;ubiquitin antibody, and the corresponding peptide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing.







Abstract
Cells utilize ubiquitin as a posttranslational protein modifier to convey various signals such as proteasomal degradation. The dysfunction of ubiquitylation or following proteasomal degradation can give rise to the accumulation and aggregation of improperly ubiquitylated proteins, which is known to be a general causation of many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the characterization of substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases is crucial in biological and pharmaceutical sciences. In this study, we developed a novel high&#8208;throughput screening system for substrate peptide sequences of E3 ligases using a cDNA display method, which enables covalent conjugation between peptide sequences and their corresponding cDNA sequences. First, we focused on the MDM2 E3 ligase and its known peptide substrate as a model to establish the screening method, and confirmed that cDNA display method was compatible with in&#8197;vitro ubiquitylation. Then, we demonstrated identification of MDM2 substrate sequences from random libraries to identify a novel motif (VKFTGGQLA). Bioinformatics analysis of the hit sequences was performed to gain insight about endogenous substrate proteins.

         <title>A Photo&#8208;Caged Cross&#8208;Linker for Identifying Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>

We have synthesized a novel crosslinker with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photoresponsive groups. These o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester (o&#8208;NBE) groups enhance the stability and hydrophobic properties of the crosslinker and add the potential for temporal resolution. A controlled activation mechanism enables precise UV&#8208;triggered protein crosslinking. We also demonstrate its ability to enter intact Hela cells, thereby indicating its future potential as a useful tool to study PPIs within the cellular environment.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) has seen significant improvements which have enhanced its utility for studying protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs), primarily due to the emergence of novel crosslinkers and the development of streamlined analysis workflows. Nevertheless, poor membrane permeability and side reactions with water limit the extent of productive intracellular crosslinking events that can be achieved with current crosslinkers. To address these problems, we have synthesized a novel crosslinker with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photoresponsive groups. These o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester (o&#8208;NBE) groups enhance the stability and hydrophobic properties of the crosslinker and add the potential for temporal resolution, i.&#8201;e. the ability to control the initiation of the crosslinking reaction. Upon exposure to UV light the resulting aldehyde product reacts with adjacent amino groups and subsequent reductive amination of the formed Schiff&#8208;bases yields stable secondary amine linkages. This controlled activation mechanism enables precise UV&#8208;triggered protein crosslinking. We demonstrate proof&#8208;of principle of our o&#8208;NBE cross&#8208;linker to reliably detect PPIs by XL&#8211;MS using a recombinant model protein. We also demonstrate its ability to enter intact Hela cells, thereby indicating its future potential as a useful tool to study PPIs within the cellular environment.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Based Discovery of New Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) show biotechnological promise by producing alka(e)nes from natural fatty acids. Using a cavity based search, 30 distant or unrelated enzymes with potential FAP&#8208;activity were identified either from the PDB&#8216;s flavoproteins of from homology models. Docking experiments and in&#8197;vitro characterization led to the discovery of four photodecarboxylases.







Abstract
Light&#8208;dependent fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) hold significant potential for biotechnology, due to their capability to produce alka(e)nes directly from the corresponding (un)saturated natural fatty acids requiring light as the only reagent. This study expands the family of FAPs through cavity&#8208;based enzyme discovery methods. Thirty enzyme candidates with potential photodecarboxylation activity were identified by matching the cavities of four related template structures against the Protein Data Bank's flavoproteins, a library of proteins identified via the Foldseek Search Server, and homology models of sequences resulting from BLAST. Subsequent docking experiments narrowed this library to ten promising enzymes, which were expressed and assessed in&#8197;vitro, identifying four photodecarboxylases. Out of these enzymes, the GMC oxidoreductase from Coccomyxa sp. Obi (CoFAP) was characterized in detail, which revealed high activity in the decarboxylation reactions of palmitic acid and octanoic acid and a broad pH tolerance (pH&#8197;6.5&#8211;9.5).

     alt="Cavity-Based Discovery of New Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) show biotechnological promise by producing alka(e)nes from natural fatty acids. Using a cavity based search, 30 distant or unrelated enzymes with potential FAP-activity were identified either from the PDB&#8216;s flavoproteins of from homology models. Docking experiments and in&#8197;vitro characterization led to the discovery of four photodecarboxylases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-dependent fatty acid photodecarboxylases (FAPs) hold significant potential for biotechnology, due to their capability to produce alka(e)nes directly from the corresponding (un)saturated natural fatty acids requiring light as the only reagent. This study expands the family of FAPs through cavity-based enzyme discovery methods. Thirty enzyme candidates with potential photodecarboxylation activity were identified by matching the cavities of four related template structures against the Protein Data Bank's flavoproteins, a library of proteins identified &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the Foldseek Search Server, and homology models of sequences resulting from BLAST. Subsequent docking experiments narrowed this library to ten promising enzymes, which were expressed and assessed &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, identifying four photodecarboxylases. Out of these enzymes, the GMC oxidoreductase from &lt;i&gt;Coccomyxa&lt;/i&gt; sp. Obi (&lt;i&gt;Co&lt;/i&gt;FAP) was characterized in detail, which revealed high activity in the decarboxylation reactions of palmitic acid and octanoic acid and a broad pH tolerance (pH&#8197;6.5&#8211;9.5).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Visual Screen for the Directed Evolution of C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;threonine Aldolase</title>

L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;TA) catalyzes the reversible condensation of glycine and aldehydes to form &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. Currently, few high&#8208;throughput methods are available for engineering L&#8208;TAs with enhanced C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This study introduces a novel screening method that couples ketone reductase, which specifically catalyzes the oxidation of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine (L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS), with the simultaneous synthesis of NADPH.







Abstract
L&#8208;Threonine aldolase (L&#8208;TA) is a pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible condensation of glycine and aldehydes to form &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. The combination of directed evolution and efficient high&#8208;throughput screening methods is an effective strategy for enhancing the enzyme's catalytic performance. However, few feasible high&#8208;throughput methods exist for engineering the C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;TAs. Here, we present a novel method of screening for variants with improved C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity; this method couples an L&#8208;threo&#8208;phenylserine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the specific oxidation of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine (L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS), with the concurrent synthesis of NADPH, which is easily detectable via 340&#8208;nm UV absorption. This enables the visual detection of L&#8208;threo&#8208;MTPS produced by L&#8208;TA through the measurement of generated NADPH. Using this method, we discover an L&#8208;TA variant with significantly higher diastereoselectivity, increasing from 0.98&#8201;% de (for the wild&#8208;type) to 71.9&#8201;% de.

         <title>Sequence Context in DNA i&#8208;Motifs Can Nurture Very Stable and Persistent Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA i&#8208;motifs adjacent to duplex form kinetically trapped partially folded species. The species are well resolved on thermal melting curves. In this work, we study dynamics of partial folds and ways to control fully folded population.







Abstract
I&#8208;motifs are non&#8208;canonical DNA structures with recognized biological significance and a proven utility in material engineering. Consequently, understanding and control of i&#8208;motif properties is essential to sustain progress across both disciplines. In this work, we systematically investigate how proximity to the most common form of DNA, a double&#8208;stranded duplex, influences the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of adjacent i&#8208;motifs. We demonstrate that double&#8208;stranded stems in i&#8208;motif loops promote kinetic trapping of very stable and persistent partially folded conformations. Further, we investigate pathways toward rational control over a folding topology makeup.

         <title>Improving CsOAC Activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Directed Production of Olivetolic Acid through Rational Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. If the substrate is not catalyzed by the olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC), the by&#8208;product olivetol (OL) is formed. Following an in silico rational design, protein variants were evaluated regarding for OA and OL production in&#8197;vivo using S. cerevisiae. The G82&#8197;A/L92Y variant showed a successful shift towards OA.







Abstract
Olivetolic acid (OA) is an essential precursor in the cannabinoid biosynthesis. It is produced through a unique interaction between the two proteins, olivetol synthase (CsOLS) and olivetolic acid cyclase (CsOAC). When the OA biosynthesis is transferred to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, olivetol (OL) is produced as a side product, even with a high enhancement of copy number of CsOAC. In order to increase the OA titer while decreasing the OL titer in S. cerevisiae, rational design was applied to CsOAC using in silico approaches such as protein&#8208;ligand docking to find potential protein variants. In vivo screening and also testing different approaches for both proteins was applied to identify the best performing variants of CsOAC. Four variants were identified that gave the desired properties. The best CsOAC variant, G82&#8197;A/L92Y, resulted in a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in OA production and a shift in the ratio between the two products towards OA.

         <title>Tailoring CotA Laccase Substrate Specificity by Rationally Reshaping Pocket Edge</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the protein engineering work against CotA laccase, all mutants show impaired activities against small size sinapic acid, in contrast, A227E, G321F and G321P showed around 25&#8201;% increase of activities against big size ditaurobilirubin compared to WT. Unexpectedly, heterologous expression yields of T262F, T262F/G321F and T262F/G321P increased by around 5, 7 and 21 folds compared to WT, respectively.







Abstract
CotA is a bacterial multicopper oxidase, capable of oxidizing lots of substrates. In previous work, small size lignin phenol derivates were found to lie only in the partially covered part of pocket. However, big size substate would occupy the whole pocket to react. In this work, five residues sitting at the edge of the pocket were selected to study their roles in regulating activities against different size substrates. All mutants showed impaired activities against small size sinapic acid, however, A227E, G321F and G321P showed around 25&#8201;% increase of activities against big size ditaurobilirubin compared to wild type (WT). T262F/G321F showed moderate increased activity to alazin red S. kcat/Kms against ditaurobilirubin of A227E, T262F and G321F are around 1.5, 3 and 1.5 folds of WT's. Unexpectedly, heterologous expression yields of T262F, T262F/G321F and T262F/G321P in Escherichia coli greatly increased by around 5, 7 and 21 folds compared to WT, respectively. It is speculated positive mutants would provide a beneficial orientation for big size substrates. Substituting semi&#8208;buried residue T262 by a hydrophobic amino acid might enhance expression yields mainly by increasing van der waals and hydrophobic interaction. This work exemplified rationally regulating specific activities of laccase and is valuable for industrial application.

         <title>Marker&#8208;Dependent Cleavage of RNA by Binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz) and Binary DNA Machines (BiDM)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA&#8208;based constructions called binary DNAzyme machines are activated by binding cancer marker strand following by binding targeted RNA by Arms 1, 2, 3 and 4 and cleaving it. Binary DNAzyme machines can cleave certain RNA targets with higher affinity and selectivity than optimized DNAzyme constructions that use only Arms 1 and 2.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) can be used to suppress specific RNA in cells and thus has been explored for gene therapy. Despite extensive effort, there is no clinically significant OGT for treating cancer. Low efficiency of OGT is one of the problems. Earlier, we proposed to address this problem by suppressing the most vital genes in cancer cells e.&#8201;g. housekeeping genes. To achieve specific activation of the OGT agents in cancer but not in normal cells, we designed a binary (split) DNAzyme (BiDz) activated by cancer&#8208;related nucleic acid sequences. This work is devoted to BiDz optimization for efficient cleavage of structured RNA targets upon activation with a cancer marker&#8208;related sequence. To achieve efficient binding of folded RNA, the BiDz was equipped with RNA binding/unwinding arms to produce &#8216;Binary DNA&#8208;nanomachines&#8217; (BiDM). It was demonstrated that BiDM can improve both the rate and selectivity of RNA cleavage in comparison with BiDz. For the best selectivity, single&#8208;nucleotide variations should be recognized by the strand detached from the common DNA scaffold of BiDM. Further development of DNA nanotechnology&#8208;inspired agents can advance OGT in treating cancer, viral infections, and genetic disorders.

         <title>Protein Engineering of Lipase A from Candida Antarctica to Improve Esterification of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of mutagenesis at selected amino acid positions (shown in red in the figure), the double mutant V278S+S429G of lipase A from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8722;A) was identified to exhibit a 1.5&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than wild type CAL&#8722;A in the kinetic resolution of a tertiary alcohol model substrate, while maintaining excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Chiral tertiary alcohols are important organic compounds in science as well as in industry. However, their preparation in enantiomerically pure form is still a challenge due to their complex structure and steric hindrances compared with primary and secondary alcohols, so kinetic resolution could be an attractive approach. Lipase A from Candida antarctica (CAL&#8722;A) has been shown to catalyze the enantioselective esterification of various tertiary alcohols with excellent enantioselectivity but low activity. Here we report a mutagenesis study by rational design to improve CAL&#8722;A activity against tertiary alcohols. Single mutants of CAL&#8722;A were selected, expressed, immobilized and screened for esterification of the tertiary alcohol 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ol. A double mutant V278S+S429G showed a 1.5&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than that of the wild type CAL&#8722;A, while maintaining excellent enantioselectivity.

The front cover shows the structure of lipase A from Candida antarctica with auroras in the background. Like this light display of Nature in the sky, enzymes sometimes unfold their power in unexpected forms, thus enriching the scope of applications. By engineering the active site, the catalytic properties of the lipase can be further improved so that the enzyme begins its infinite journey through space and time typified by the enantioselective esterification of (R)&#8208;tertiary alcohols, which has been difficult to achieve.

         <title>Rewiring Lysine Catabolism in Cancer Leads to Increased Histone Crotonylation and Immune Escape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crotonyl&#8208;CoA, metabolite derived from lysine catabolism, is elevated in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), correlating with tumor growth. Increased production is due to overexpression of specific lysine transporters and glutaryl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). Depletion of GCDH or lysine&#8208;restriction diet upregulates type I interferon signaling (IFN), suppressing tumor growth. This study reveals cancer cells&#8217; metabolic rewiring to evade the immune system.







Abstract
Crotonyl&#8208;CoA (cr&#8208;CoA) is a metabolite derived directly from the catabolism of lysine (Lys) and tryptophan (Trp) or from the &#946;&#8208;oxidation of fatty acids. In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), histone H4 crotonylation levels are significantly elevated, which appears to positively correlate with tumor growth. This increase in crotonyl&#8208;CoA production is attributed to the overexpression of specific Lys transporters on the cell membrane, leading to higher free lysine levels. Additionally, the overexpression of glutaryl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), the enzyme responsible for crotonyl&#8208;CoA production, further contributes to this increase. When GCDH is depleted or under a lysine&#8208;restricted diet, genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) signaling are upregulated, resulting in tumor growth suppression. Type I interferons are a group of cytokines critical for antiviral responses and immunoregulation. This highlights how cancer cells exploit crotonylation to modulate the immune response.

     alt="Rewiring Lysine Catabolism in Cancer Leads to Increased Histone Crotonylation and Immune Escape"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crotonyl-CoA, metabolite derived from lysine catabolism, is elevated in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), correlating with tumor growth. Increased production is due to overexpression of specific lysine transporters and glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). Depletion of GCDH or lysine-restriction diet upregulates type I interferon signaling (IFN), suppressing tumor growth. This study reveals cancer cells&#8217; metabolic rewiring to evade the immune system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crotonyl-CoA (cr-CoA) is a metabolite derived directly from the catabolism of lysine (Lys) and tryptophan (Trp) or from the &#946;-oxidation of fatty acids. In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), histone H4 crotonylation levels are significantly elevated, which appears to positively correlate with tumor growth. This increase in crotonyl-CoA production is attributed to the overexpression of specific Lys transporters on the cell membrane, leading to higher free lysine levels. Additionally, the overexpression of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), the enzyme responsible for crotonyl-CoA production, further contributes to this increase. When GCDH is depleted or under a lysine-restricted diet, genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) signaling are upregulated, resulting in tumor growth suppression. Type I interferons are a group of cytokines critical for antiviral responses and immunoregulation. This highlights how cancer cells exploit crotonylation to modulate the immune response. This work opens up new avenues for investigating how cancer cells rewire their metabolism to increase crotonylation and evade the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation is a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates key biological processes. It occurs on a wide range of amino acids, including arginine, cysteine, serine, and glutamic acid. Well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides are valuable tools for investigating the structures, mechanisms of action, and interaction partners of this modification. This article provides a comprehensive overview of chemical and chemoenzymatic methodologies for the construction of mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.







Abstract
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification that regulates vital biological processes like histone reorganization and DNA&#8208;damage repair through the modification of various amino acid residues. Due to advances in mass&#8208;spectrometry, the collection of long&#8208;known ADP&#8208;ribose (ADPr) acceptor sites, e.&#8201;g. arginine, cysteine and glutamic acid, has been expanded with serine, tyrosine and histidine, among others. Well&#8208;defined ADPr&#8208;peptides are valuable tools for investigating the exact structures, mechanisms of action and interaction partners of the different flavors of this modification. This review provides a comprehensive overview of synthetic and chemoenzymatic methodologies that enabled the construction of peptides mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated on various amino acids, and close mimetics thereof.

         <title>In Vivo Delivery Processes and Development Strategies of Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents feasible strategies commonly employed for the development of efficient lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Before introducing these developing strategies, in&#8197;vivo delivery processes of LNPs, the crucial determinants influencing the clinical translation of LNP formulations, are described to better understand how to develop LNP delivery systems.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent an advanced and highly efficient delivery system for RNA molecules, demonstrating exceptional biocompatibility and remarkable delivery efficiency. This is evidenced by the clinical authorization of three LNP formulations: Patisiran, BNT162b2, and mRNA&#8208;1273. To further maximize the efficacy of RNA&#8208;based therapy, it is imperative to develop more potent LNP delivery systems that can effectively protect inherently unstable and negatively charged RNA molecules from degradation by nucleases, while facilitating their cellular uptake into target cells. Therefore, this review presents feasible strategies commonly employed for the development of efficient LNP delivery systems. The strategies encompass combinatorial chemistry for large&#8208;scale synthesis of ionizable lipids, rational design strategy of ionizable lipids, functional molecules&#8208;derived lipid molecules, the optimization of LNP formulations, and the adjustment of particle size and charge property of LNPs. Prior to introducing these developing strategies, in&#8197;vivo delivery processes of LNPs, a crucial determinant influencing the clinical translation of LNP formulations, is described to better understand how to develop LNP delivery systems.

Engineering T7 RNA polymerase for RNA synthesis: The in&#8197;vitro synthesis of RNA is essential for basic RNA research and its therapeutic applications. This review highlights advancements in the engineering of T7 RNA polymerase for the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids incorporating non&#8208;canonical nucleotides and discuss prospective developments in this field.







Abstract
In vitro RNA synthesis technologies are crucial in developing therapeutic RNA drugs, such as mRNA vaccines and RNA interference (RNAi) therapies. Enzymatic RNA synthesis, recognized for its sustainability and efficiency, enables the production of extensive RNA sequences under mild conditions. Among the enzymes utilized, T7 RNA polymerase is distinguished by its exceptional catalytic efficiency, enabling the precise and rapid transcription of RNA from DNA templates by recognizing the specific T7 promoter sequence. With the advancement in clinical applications of RNA&#8208;based drugs, there is an increasing demand for the synthesis of chemically modified RNAs that are stable and resistant to nuclease degradation. To this end, researchers have applied directed evolution to broaden the enzyme's substrate scope, enhancing its compatibility with non&#8208;canonical substrates and reducing the formation of by&#8208;products. This review summarizes the progress in engineering T7 RNA polymerase for these purposes and explores prospective developments in the field.

         <dc:description>
This paper reviews recent advancements in DNA hydrogels for cancer theranostic applications. We aim to offer insights and inspiration for developing novel and effective methods for cancer diagnosis and therapy using DNA hydrogels.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, because of their precise pairing and simple composition, have emerged as excellent materials for the formation of gels. The application of DNA hydrogels in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer has expanded significantly through research on the properties and functions of nucleic acids. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs) such as aptamers, Small interfering RNA (siRNA), and DNAzymes have been incorporated into DNA hydrogels to enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. This review discusses various methods for forming DNA hydrogels, with a focus on pure DNA hydrogels. We then explore the innovative applications of DNA hydrogels in cancer diagnosis and therapy. DNA hydrogels have become essential biomedical materials, and this review provides an overview of current research findings and the status of DNA hydrogels in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, while also exploring future research directions.

         <title>Ubiquitin's Conformational Heterogeneity as Discerned by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Much of our understanding into protein conformational heterogeneity stems from NMR&#8208;based studies of the 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin which is an omni&#8208;present post&#8208;translational modification playing an integral role in ubiquitination, a process regulating nearly all aspects of cellular function. Herein, we discuss 30+ years of NMR research pertaining to ubiquitin's conformational plasticity and suggest new approaches that would allow to better grasp this complex issue, for example by acquiring structural data in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Visualizing a protein's molecular motions has been a long standing topic of research in the biophysics community. Largely this has been done by exploiting nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and arguably no protein's molecular motions have been better characterized by NMR than that of ubiquitin (Ub), a 76 amino acid polypeptide essential in ubiquitination&#8208;a key regulatory system within cells. Herein, we discuss ubiquitin's conformational plasticity as visualized, at atomic resolution, by more than 35&#8197;years of NMR work. In our discussions we point out the differences between data acquired in&#8197;vitro, ex vivo, as well as in&#8197;vivo and stress the need to investigate Ub's conformational plasticity in more biologically representative backgrounds.

         <title>Orthogonal Control of Nucleic Acid Function via Chemical Caging&#8208;Decaging Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the spatiotemporal regulation of nucleic acid molecules based on the chemical caging&#8208;decaging strategy. It highlights the latest advancements in innovative triggered control mechanisms and underscores their significant applications spanning the domains of biotechnology, biomedicine, and biosensors.







Abstract
The ability to precisely control the function of nucleic acids plays an important role in biosensing and biomedicine. In recent years, novel strategies employing biological, physical, and chemical triggers have been developed to modulate the function of nucleic acids spatiotemporally. These approaches commonly involve the incorporation of stimuli&#8208;responsive groups onto nucleic acids to block their functions until triggers&#8208;induced decaging restore activity. These inventive strategies deepen our comprehension of nucleic acid molecules&#8217; dynamic behavior and provide new techniques for precise disease diagnosis and treatment. Focusing on the spatiotemporal regulation of nucleic acid molecules through the chemical caging&#8208;decaging strategy, we here present an overview of the innovative triggered control mechanisms and accentuate their implications across the fields of chemical biology, biomedicine, and biosensing.

Discover the potential of d&#8208;Galacturonic acid and l&#8208;Arabinose in different industries. These monosaccharides are rich in sugar beet pulp biomass and can be used to prepare bioactive compounds, personal care products, building blocks and more.







Abstract
This review provides a perspective on the industrial application potential of sugar beet pulp (SBP) derived monosaccharides. The broad application of these monosaccharides could contribute to bio&#8208;based alternatives and sustainable practices, essential for the transition towards a more circular economy. This review focuses on the utilization and application of two SBP monosaccharides, d&#8208;galacturonic acid (d&#8208;GalA) and l&#8208;arabinose (l&#8208;Ara), derived from pectin and hemicellulose. These polysaccharides are major components of sugar beet pulp, an important side stream of sucrose production. d&#8208;GalA and l&#8208;Ara are therefore abundant in biomass and offer unique molecular structures amenable to selective chemical or enzymatic modifications. We review their application in various industrial applications such as the development and production of bioactive compounds, home and personal care products, and other industries.

         <title>The Structural Diversity of Encapsulin Protein Shells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulin nanocompartments are one of the most diverse and widespread classes of prokaryotic protein compartments. This review focuses on the structural diversity of encapsulins with a focus on shell structure, pore properties, and domain insertions and fusions found within the encapsulin shell protein.







Abstract
Subcellular compartmentalization is a universal feature of all cells. Spatially distinct compartments, be they lipid&#8208; or protein&#8208;based, enable cells to optimize local reaction environments, store nutrients, and sequester toxic processes. Prokaryotes generally lack intracellular membrane systems and usually rely on protein&#8208;based compartments and organelles to regulate and optimize their metabolism. Encapsulins are one of the most diverse and widespread classes of prokaryotic protein compartments. They self&#8208;assemble into icosahedral protein shells and are able to specifically internalize dedicated cargo enzymes. This review discusses the structural diversity of encapsulin protein shells, focusing on shell assembly, symmetry, and dynamics. The properties and functions of pores found within encapsulin shells will also be discussed. In addition, fusion and insertion domains embedded within encapsulin shell protomers will be highlighted. Finally, future research directions for basic encapsulin biology, with a focus on the structural understand of encapsulins, are briefly outlined.

         <title>Enhancing Cellular and Enzymatic Properties Through In Vivo Continuous Evolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous evolution, as a powerful tool in evolutionary engineering, is discussed in this article based on non&#8208;targeted, targeted and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation. The aim is to provide researchers with guidance for selecting appropriate evolutionary tools and to offer insights for the development of future continuous evolution.







Abstract
Directed evolution seeks to evolve target genes at a rate far exceeding the natural mutation rate, thereby endowing cellular and enzymatic properties with desired traits. In vivo continuous directed evolution achieves these purposes by generating libraries within living cells, enabling a continuous cycle of mutant generation and selection, enhancing the exploration of gene variants. Continuous evolution has become powerful tools for unraveling evolution mechanism and improving cellular and enzymatic properties. This review categorizes current continuous evolution into three distinct classes: non&#8208;targeted chromosomal, targeted chromosomal, and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation approaches. It also compares various continuous evolution strategies based on different principles, providing a reference for selecting suitable methods for specific evolutionary goals. Furthermore, this review discusses the two primary limitations for further widespread application of in&#8197;vivo continuous evolution, which are lack of general applicability and insufficient mutagenic capability. We envision that developing generally applicable mutagenic components and methods to enhance mutation rates for in&#8197;vivo continuous evolution are promising future directions for wide range applications of continuous evolution.

&lt;p&gt;Continuous evolution, as a powerful tool in evolutionary engineering, is discussed in this article based on non-targeted, targeted and extra-chromosomal hypermutation. The aim is to provide researchers with guidance for selecting appropriate evolutionary tools and to offer insights for the development of future continuous evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directed evolution seeks to evolve target genes at a rate far exceeding the natural mutation rate, thereby endowing cellular and enzymatic properties with desired traits. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; continuous directed evolution achieves these purposes by generating libraries within living cells, enabling a continuous cycle of mutant generation and selection, enhancing the exploration of gene variants. Continuous evolution has become powerful tools for unraveling evolution mechanism and improving cellular and enzymatic properties. This review categorizes current continuous evolution into three distinct classes: non-targeted chromosomal, targeted chromosomal, and extra-chromosomal hypermutation approaches. It also compares various continuous evolution strategies based on different principles, providing a reference for selecting suitable methods for specific evolutionary goals. Furthermore, this review discusses the two primary limitations for further widespread application of &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; continuous evolution, which are lack of general applicability and insufficient mutagenic capability. We envision that developing generally applicable mutagenic components and methods to enhance mutation rates for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; continuous evolution are promising future directions for wide range applications of continuous evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nuclear&#8208;Targeting Peptides for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the most recent applications of nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides in targeting tumor associated proteins, chemotherapy, photodynamic/photothermal therapy, gene therapy, protein&#8208;based therapeutics, and their synergistic therapy.







Abstract
Nucleus is the central regulator of cells that controls cell proliferation, metabolism, and cell cycle, and is considered the most important organelle in cells. The precision medicine that can achieve nuclear targeting has achieved good therapeutic effects in anti&#8208;tumor therapy. However, the presence of biological barriers such as cell membranes and nuclear membranes in cells limit the delivery of therapeutic agents to the nucleus. Therefore, developing effective nuclear&#8208;targeting drug delivery strategies is particularly important. Nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides are a class of functional peptides that can penetrate cell membranes and target the nucleus. They mainly recognize and bind to the nuclear transport molecules (such as Importin&#8208;&#945;/&#946;) and transport the therapeutic agents to the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPC). This review summarizes the most recent developments of strategies for anti&#8208;tumor therapy utilizing nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides, which will ultimately contribute to the development of more effective nuclear&#8208;targeting strategies to achieve better anti&#8208;tumor outcomes.

         <title>Optogenetic Tools for Regulating RNA Metabolism and Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely review of various current chemical and genetically encodable strategies to photocontrol the transcription, splicing, post&#8208;transcriptional modification, translation, degradation, and phase separation properties and functions of cellular RNA molecules.







Abstract
RNA molecules play a vital role in linking genetic information with various cellular processes. In recent years, a variety of optogenetic tools have been engineered for regulating cellular RNA metabolism and functions. These highly desirable tools can offer non&#8208;intrusive control with spatial precision, remote operation, and biocompatibility. Here, we would like to review these currently available approaches that can regulate RNAs with light: from non&#8208;genetically encodable chemically modified oligonucleotides to genetically encoded RNA aptamers that recognize photosensitive small&#8208;molecule or protein ligands. Some key applications of these optogenetic tools will also be highlighted to illustrate how they have been used for regulating all aspects of the RNA life cycle: from RNA synthesis, maturation, modification, and translation to their degradation, localization, and phase separation control. Some current challenges and potential practical utilizations of these RNA optogenetic tools will also be discussed.

         <title>99mTc(I)&#8208;Labeled His&#8208;Tagged Proteins: Impact in the Development of Novel Imaging Probes and in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the organometallic core fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ in radiopharmaceutical chemistry by Roger Alberto and co&#8208;workers allowed direct radiolabeling, under smooth conditions, of histidine&#8208;tagged proteins, including antibody fragments, affibodies and other biologically relevant proteins. This review article aims to summarize the impact of tricarbonyl technology in the discovery and development of molecular imaging and/or therapeutic agents towards clinical application.







Abstract
Technetium&#8208;99&#8197;m (99mTc) remains the cornerstone of nuclear medicine for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) due to its widespread availability and chemical and physical features. Its multiple oxidation states allow for the design and production of radiopharmaceuticals with versatile properties, namely in terms of pharmacokinetic profile. 99mTc(V) is the most common oxidation state, but 99mTc(I) gained traction after the pioneering work of Alberto and colleagues, which resulted in the introduction of the organometallic core fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3(H2O)3]+. This core is readily available from [99mTcO4]&#8722; and displays three labile water molecules that can be easily swapped for ligands with different denticity and/or donor atoms in aqueous environment. This makes it possible to radiolabel small molecules as well as high molecular weight molecules, such as antibodies or other proteins, while assuring biological activity. Direct radiolabelling of those proteins with fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ under mild conditions is accomplished through incorporation of a polyhistidine tag (His&#8208;tag), a commonly used tag for purification of recombinant proteins. This review aims to address the direct radiolabelling of His&#8208;tagged macromolecules with fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ for development of molecular imaging agents and the impact of this technology in the discovery and development of imaging and/or therapeutic agents towards clinical application.

         <title>Biotemplated Platinum Nanozymes: Synthesis, Catalytic Regulation and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 24, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological templates can guide the formation of Pt nanozymes with specific morphologies and then stabilize them, resulting optimized catalytic performance. This review focuses on biotemplated Pt nanozymes and their biomedical applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for the rational design of Pt nanozymes with robust functionalities for improved practical applications.







Abstract
Platinum (Pt) nanozymes with multiple intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have attracted extensive attention in biomedical fields due to their high catalytic activity, ease of modification, and convenient storage. However, the Pt nanozymes synthesized by the traditional method often suffer from uncontrollable morphology and poor stability under physicochemical conditions, resulting in unsatisfactory catalytic behavior in practical applications. To optimize the catalytic ability, biological templates have been introduced recently, which can guide the deposition of platinum ions on their surface to form specific morphologies and then stabilize the resulting Pt nanozymes. Given the promising potential of biotemplated Pt nanozymes in practical applications, it is essential to conduct a systematic and comprehensive review to summarize their recent research progress. In this review, we first categorize the biological templates and discuss the mechanisms as well as characteristics of each type of biotemplate in directing the growth of Pt nanozyme. Factors that impact the growth of biotemplated Pt nanozymes are then analyzed, followed by summarizing their biomedical applications. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in this field are outlined. This review article aims to provide theoretical guidance for developing Pt nanozymes with robust functionalities in biomedical applications.

         <title>The biarylitides: understanding the structure and biosynthesis of a fascinating class of Cytochrome P450 modified RiPP natural products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biarylitides are a recently discovered class of RiPP natural products that are fascinating both from the small size of the core peptides as well as the diversity of peptide crosslinking exhibited by the cytochrome P450 enzymes found in these systems. In this review, we address the discovery and biosynthetic diversity of these systems and discuss the methods and challenges of analysing the structures of these constrained cyclic peptides. We also discuss the structures of the P450 enzymes involved in these pathways and address the potential for alternate catalytic outcomes and activities as seen most recently with the inclusion of biarylitide related enzymes within rufomycin biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Functional Mimicry of the Antimicrobial Defensin Plectasin by Analogues with Engineered Backbone Composition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The threat posed by bacteria resistant to common antibiotics creates an urgent need for novel antimicrobials. Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide natural products that bind Lipid II, such as vancomycin, represent a promising source for such agents. The fungal defensin plectasin is one of a family of ribosomally produced miniproteins that exert antimicrobial activity via Lipid II binding. Made up entirely of canonical amino acids, these molecules are potentially more susceptible to degradation by protease enzymes than non&#8208;ribosomal counterparts. Here, we report the development of proteomimetic variants of plectasin through the systematic incorporation of artificial backbone connectivity in the domain. An iterative secondary&#8208;structure&#8208;based design scheme yields a variant with a tertiary fold indistinguishable from the prototype defensin, potent activity against Gram positive bacteria, and low mammalian cell toxicity. Backbone modification is shown to improve oxidative folding efficiency of the disulfide&#8208;rich scaffold as well as resistance to proteolytic hydrolysis. These results broaden the scope of design strategies toward protein mimetics as well as folds and biological functions possible in such agents.</dc:description>

This concept provides an overview of the multifunctional and multitargeting nature of the tppz&#8208;based dinuclear Ru(II) complexes, including DNA probes, organelle imaging agents, phototherapeutic agents, and actin polymerization inhibitors.







Abstract
Ruthenium complexes are among the most extensively studied and developed luminescent transition&#8208;metal complexes for anticancer applications. Dinuclear Ru(II) complexes have caught significant interest for larger size, higher charge, and variable complex shapes. In this concept, we have explored past and recent works on the possible biological applications of versatile tetrapyrido[3,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;2,3&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;3,2&#8208;h&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;j]phenazine (tppz)&#8208;based dinuclear Ru(II) complexes with a focus on their use as quadruplex DNA probes, organelle imaging, and phototherapeutic agents. This concept also points out that a particular type of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes can act as multitargeting and multifunctional anticancer agents &#8208;making this an exciting research area in which an array of further applications will likely emerge.

         <title>Position&#8208;Regulated Electrostatic Interactions for Single Amino Acid Revealed by Aspartic Acid&#8208;Scanning Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, peptide&#8208;peptide binding properties were analyzed through aspartate scanning mutagenesis. Significant position&#8208; and composition&#8208;dependent electrostatic interactions involving arginine and aspartate were identified. The findings provide an estimate of the electrostatic side chain&#8208;side chain interactions between arginine and aspartic acid, indicating that the optimal separation distance ranges from 2 to 4 amino acid residues.







Abstract
We have examined in this contribution the electrostatic interactions between single arginine and aspartic acid by analyzing the peptide&#8208;peptide binding characteristics involving arginine&#8208;aspartic acid, arginine&#8208;glycine, arginine&#8208;tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;glycine interactions. The results of aspartic acid mutagenesis revealed that the interactions between arginine and aspartic acid have significant dependence on the position and composition of amino acids. While the primary interaction can be attributed to arginine&#8208;tryptophan contacts originated from the indole moieties with the main chains of 14&#8208;mers containing N&#8722;H and C=O moieties, pronounced enhancement could be identified in association with the electrostatic side&#8208;chain&#8208;side&#8208;chain interactions between arginine and aspartic acid. An optimal separation of 2~4 amino acids between two adjacent aspartic acid and tryptophan binding sites can be identified to achieve maximal enhancement of binding interactions. Such observed separation dependence may be utilized to unravel cooperative effects in heterogeneous interactions between single pair of amino acids.

         <title>Quadruplex DNA Hybrid Catalysts for Enantioselective Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts are constructed by anchoring metal species into the chiral scaffolds of G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif. Three metal&#8208;DNA interaction modes are classified as supramolecular, covalent and coordinative for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts and the coordinative i&#8208;motif DNA hybrid catalyst is reported. The quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts exhibit potent enantioselective catalytic performance and chiral inversion by changing DNA conformations.







Abstract
Beyond the pivotal genetic roles of DNA, its duplex structures as chiral scaffolds interacting with metal complexes give rise to DNA hybrid catalysts for a set of aqueous&#8208;phase enantioselective reactions. Besides DNA duplex, DNA quadruplexes including G&#8208;quadruplex and i&#8208;motif show tunable structures with variable non&#8208;canonical base pairs. In this concept, based on the interaction between metal species and DNA, we classify the construction strategies of quadruplex DNA hybrid catalysts into supramolecular, covalent and coordinative modes. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between DNA quadruplexes and their enantioselective catalytic performance. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and look forward to the future directions in DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis.

         <title>An Upgraded Solid&#8208;Phase Assembly of Chelators (DOTA and NOTA) Enabled Bacterial Uptake Studies of Radiolabeled Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical approach to installing clinically prevalent chelator DOTA and NOTA in solid phase peptide was delineated by exploring various solvent scopes. This upgraded method enabled clean and operationally simple installation of DOTA and NOTA in various bioactive peptides. Strikingly, we revealed that a radiolabeled antimicrobial peptide (Combi) could be an excellent lead for developing bacterial infection imaging agents.







Abstract
Among popular radio metal chelators, DOTA and NOTA have been remarkably considered in radionuclide therapy and imaging studies due to several advantages in pharmacology. Here, we developed a practical and general method for assembling DOTA and NOTA in the solid phase peptide (pseudo&#8208;dilute conditions) using a wide range of solvents with easily accessible and economical feedstocks, which mitigated unprecedented challenges associated with previously reported methods. This upgraded approach enabled an efficient installation of these two chelators on various bioactive peptide sequences. Finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of the DOTA&#8208; and NOTA&#8208;attached Combi peptides to B. subtilis, which was intact. The authenticity of the assembled DOTA framework was assessed by labeling 177Lu and in&#8197;vitro bacterial uptake in E. coli and S. aureus. 177Lu&#8208;labeled DOTA&#8208;Combi peptide exhibited promising uptake for developing a bacterial infection imaging agent while negligible hemolysis activity even at &gt;200&#8197;&#956;M. This contribution will be valued for developing peptide radiopharmaceuticals with operational simplicity and economic approaches.

         <title>Towards Next Generation Protein Sequencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein sequencing is essential for understanding protein structure and function. Recently, nanopore protein sequencing has rapidly emerged as a research hotspot, offering single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level detection accuracy. It also shows great potential to become the mainstream method for next&#8208;generation protein sequencing.







Abstract
Understanding the structure and function of proteins is a critical objective in the life sciences. Protein sequencing, a central aspect of this endeavor, was first accomplished through Edman degradation in the 1950s. Since the late 20th&#8197;century, mass spectrometry has emerged as a prominent method for protein sequencing. In recent years, single&#8208;molecule technologies have increasingly been applied to this field, yielding numerous innovative results. Among these, nanopore sensing has proven to be a reliable single&#8208;molecule technology, enabling advancements in amino acid recognition, short peptide differentiation, and peptide sequence reading. These developments are set to elevate protein sequencing technology to new heights. The next generation of protein sequencing technologies is anticipated to revolutionize our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biological processes and significantly enhance clinical diagnostics and treatments.

Abstract
The integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems has emerged as a transformative approach in biosensing and therapeutic applications. Unique features of DNA, like its programmability and specificity, complement the diverse functions of nanomaterials, leading to the creation of advanced systems for detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Here, we review the developments in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, emphasizing their enhanced functionalities and potential across various biomedical applications. We first discuss the methodologies for synthesizing these conjugates, distinguishing between covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. We then categorize DNA&#8208;nanomaterials conjugates based on the properties of the DNA and nanomaterials involved, respectively. DNA probes are classified by their application into biosensing or therapeutic uses, and, several nanomaterials are highlighted by their recent progress in living biological. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field, anticipating that significant progress in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates will greatly enhance precision medicine.

         <title>Nanomaterial&#8208;Enhanced Red Blood Cell Biopreservation: From Refrigeration to Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are crucial in clinical and military medicine, but preservation is challenged by storage&#8208;induced damage. Traditional methods have limited effectiveness, while nanomaterials offer a promising alternative. This review examines storage and cryolesions, evaluates nanomaterials&#8217; potential to mitigate damage, and discusses key challenges in improving RBC biopreservation strategies.







Abstract
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions represent a cornerstone of clinical practice, with RBCs constituting the primary component in transfusion therapy. Extending the preservation of RBCs while maintaining their functional integrity would offer considerable advancements for both transfusion medicine and military healthcare. Despite decades of research, progress in achieving long&#8208;term RBC preservation has been limited. A key challenge is the range of physical and biochemical damage RBCs incur during storage, leading to marked changes in their morphology, physiological function, and viability. While traditional preservation techniques have provided partial mitigation of these damages, their efficacy remains suboptimal. In contrast, nanomaterials, with their distinctive spatial architectures and surface properties, offer a promising avenue for minimizing storage&#8208;related damage and extending RBC preservation. This review provides an overview of the major categories of damage encountered during RBC biopreservation, classified into storage lesions and cryolesions. We also highlight the key role of nanomaterials in enhancing the storage quality of RBCs and prolonging their preservation duration. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and pressing issues faced by nanomaterial&#8208;based RBCs biopreservation.

         <title>Dual Porphyrin&#8208;Loaded Scintillating Nanoparticles Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy in Hypoxic Cancer Cells under X&#8208;ray Irradiation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;doped NaYF4 scintillator loaded with dual porphyrins, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as a photosensitizer and hemin (Fe3+&#8208;PPIX) as an oxygen generator (Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin) enhances the activity of X&#8208;ray mediated photodynamic therapy in hypoxic cancer cells via catalase&#8208;like property of hemin in the presence of H2O2.







Abstract
Tumor hypoxia represents a major challenge to achieving successful therapy outcomes with photodynamic therapy (PDT). We hypothesized that systemic loading of dual porphyrins, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as a photosensitizer (PS) and hemin (Fe3+&#8208;PPIX) as an oxygen generator, onto Eu&#8208;doped NaYF4 scintillator (Sc), collectively terms as Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, could enhance the activity of X&#8208;ray mediated PDT. Catalase&#8208;like property of hemin in the presence of H2O2 facilitated the production of oxygen molecules (3O2) in hypoxic cancer cells. The produced 3O2 reacts with nearby excited PPIX molecules (PPIX*) in the Sc&#8208;PS pairs to produce singlet oxygen (1O2), as cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of ~60&#8197;nm efficiently produced oxygen in the presence of H2O2, which its concentration in tumor cells is higher than that in normal cells. Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin generated similar amounts of ROS in hypoxic cultured cancer cells under low dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (0.5 Gy), compared to those in normoxic cancer cells. Notably, Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin exhibited similar cytotoxic effects in both hypoxic and normoxic cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Overall, the mutual Sc&#8208;PS performance between PPIX and Eu was synergistically enhanced by hemin in Eu&#8208;PPIX@Hemin, which relieved hypoxia in the cancer cells under X&#8208;ray irradiation.

         <title>Drug Discovery Approaches to Target E3 Ligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive review presenting the different drug discovery approaches that until now have been employed in academic and pharmaceutical settings to identify new E3 ligase small molecules ligands and contributing to the expansion of the targeted protein degradation field.







Abstract
Targeting E3 ligases is a challenging area in drug discovery. Despite the human genome encoding for more than 600 E3 ubiquitin ligases, only a handful of E3 ligases have been pharmacologically modulated or exploited for targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies. The main obstacle for hijacking these E3 ligases is the lack of small&#8208;molecule ligands. As research into this field advances, the identification of new small molecules capable of binding to E3 ligases has become an essential pursuit. These ligases not only expand the repertoire of druggable targets but also offer the potential for increased specificity and selectivity in protein degradation. The synergy between academia and industry is key, as it combines academic expertise in fundamental research with the industrial capabilities of translating these findings into novel therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of the different strategies employed in academia and industry to the discovery of new E3 ligases ligands, showing them with illustrative cases.

         <title>Vanadium Complexes for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This minireview focuses on vanadium complexes in photodynamic therapy (PDT), particularly for their potential as mitochondria&#8208;targeted anticancer agents. Vanadium's coordination versatility supports its bioactivity, showing promise in insulin&#8208;mimetic, lipid&#8208;lowering, and antitumor effects. PDT leverages these complexes' redox properties, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) within mitochondria to induce cancer cell apoptosis with minimal impact on healthy cells. The review covers design strategies to improve mitochondrial localization, photodynamic efficiency, and selective cytotoxicity while addressing challenges like photostability and targeting for next&#8208;gen PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Detecting the Undetectable: Advances in Methods for Identifying Small Tau Aggregates in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tau, a microtubule&#8208;associated protein, plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal structure and function. However, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other tauopathies, tau misfolds and aggregates into oligomers and fibrils, leading to neuronal damage. Soluble tau oligomers are increasingly recognised as the most neurotoxic species, inducing synaptic dysfunction and contributing to disease progression. Detecting these early&#8208;stage aggregates is challenging due to their low concentration and heterogeneity in biological samples. Traditional methods such as immunostaining and ELISA lack the sensitivity and specificity to reliably detect small tau aggregates. Advanced single&#8208;molecule approaches, including smFRET and SiMPull, offer improved sensitivity for studying tau aggregation at the molecular level. These emerging tools provide critical insights into tau pathology, enabling earlier detection and characterisation of disease&#8208;relevant aggregates, thereby offering potential for the development of targeted therapies and diagnostic approaches for tauopathies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and preliminary evaluation of Tanshinone Mimic conjugates for mechanism of action studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) belonging to the ELAV (Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision) family, which stabilizes mRNAs and regulates the expression of multiple genes. Its altered expression or localization is related to pathological features such as cancer or inflammation. Dihydrotanshinone I (DHTS I) is a naturally occurring, tetracyclic ortho&#8208;quinone inhibitor of the HuR&#8208;mRNA interaction. Our earlier efforts led to the identification of a synthetic Tanshinone Mimic (TM)&#160;2&#160;with improved affinity for HuR. Here we report five new TM probes&#160;3&#8208;5&#160;bearing a detection&#8208;promoting moiety (either photo affinity probe &#8208; PAP or biotin) as a para&#8208;substituent on the phenyl&#8208;sulphonamide for mechanism of action (MoA) studies. Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates&#160;3&#8208;5. They showed similar toxic activity in HuR&#8208;expressing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, with micromolar IC50s. REMSAs revealed that photoactivatable groups (4a&#160;and&#160;4b), but not biotin (5a&#160;and&#160;5b), prevented conjugates&#8217; ability to disrupt rHuR&#8208;RNA complexes. Further biochemical studies confirmed that biotinylated probes, in particular&#160;5a, can be used to isolate rM1M2 from solutions, taking advantage of streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads, thus being the most promising HuR inhibitor to be used for further MoA studies in cell lysates.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiphoton excited fluorescence (MPEF) imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing biological processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous materials composed of metal ions or clusters coordinated with organic ligands, have recently gained attention for their unique optical properties and potential applications in MPEF imaging. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design, synthesis, and applications of multiphoton excited fluorescence imaging using MOFs. We discuss the principles behind the fluorescence behavior of MOFs, explore strategies to enhance their photophysical properties, and showcase their applications in bioimaging. Additionally, we address the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the potential of multiphoton excited fluorescence imaging by MOFs for advancing our understanding of complex biological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the molecular basis for G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;binders to ALS/FTD&#8208;associated G4C2 repeats of the C9orf72 gene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The most recurrent familial cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the presence of an abnormal number of intronic GGGGCC (G4C2) repetitions in the C9orf72 gene, which has been proposed to drive ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that such G4C2 repetitions can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary structures. These G4s have been selectively stabilized by small&#8208;molecule binders, furnishing proof of principle that targeting these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid sequences represents a novel and effective therapeutic strategy to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. However, precise information on the mechanism of action of these compounds is still lacking. Here, by performing in silico investigations, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of known structurally related C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders. Moreover, we investigated the binding properties of a strong and selective metal&#8208;based G4 stabilizer, the AuI bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex &#8208; Au(TMX)2 &#8208; showing that it moderately stabilizes G4C2 G4 RNA by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) DNA melting assays. Using metadynamics (metaD) simulations, the Au(TMX)2 binding mode and the associated free&#8208;energy landscape were also evaluated. This information paves the way for developing improved compounds to tackle ALS/FTD neurodegenerative disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Sheet&#8208;Mediated Multivalent Capture of Cells with Enhanced Tunability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cell&#8208;capture surface is constructed by conjugating ligand&#8208;functionalized 2D peptide assemblies to an antifouling glass substrate. These sheet&#8208;like scaffolds allow non&#8208;uniform, patchy presentation of ligands with control over their identity, number, and spatial distribution. With this surface design, enhancements in multivalent cell&#8208;targeting affinity and selectivity are achieved.







Abstract
We report the creation of multivalent ligand surfaces for cell capture by conjugation of ligand&#8208;appended 2D peptide assemblies on an antifouling glass substrate. The sheet&#8208;like structures organize ligands into non&#8208;uniform, patchy patterns, enhancing multivalent cell targeting. A 155&#8201;% increase in captured cells was achieved compared to the presentation of the ligands on surfaces lacking the peptide sheets. Being orthogonal to the commonly used dendrimer&#8208; and cyclic organic molecular&#8208;based scaffolds, this peptide assembly&#8208;based approach offers a facile method to modulate the identity, number, and spatial distribution of ligands through controlled peptide coassembly. Using this method, we constructed a surface bearing two types of ligands, which demonstrates a 128&#8201;% enhancement in targeting selectivity between two model cells compared to the mono&#8208;ligand surface. These findings illustrate that integration of peptide assemblies into ligand substrates permits robust and effective manipulation of multivalent cell targeting, advancing the development of customizable cell&#8208;binding materials.

These findings illustrate that integration of peptide assemblies into ligand substrates permits robust and effective manipulation of multivalent cell targeting, advancing the development of customizable cell-binding materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This article categorizes nanomaterials into 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D forms and illustrates their role in DNA cleavage. It highlights mechanisms such as photo&#8208;induced, electron transfer (ET), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and intercalation. In addition, it discusses the applications of these nanomaterials, which cleave DNA, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), drug delivery, and site&#8208;specific DNA cleavage.







Abstract

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Oxygen&#8208;Independent DNA Photodegradation by Pheophorbide a: Implications for Future Photodynamic Therapy Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the oxygen&#8208;independent photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA provides new insights into potential photodynamic therapy strategies. Our study highlights Phed a&#8217;s ability to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals under anoxic conditions, allowing for effective DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). This capability may enhance cancer treatment in hypoxic environments.







Abstract
This study explores the unique properties of Pheophorbide a (Phed a) in the photodegradation of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA under anoxic conditions, emphasizing its potential for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in hypoxic tumor environments. We used electron spin resonance (ESR), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to assess the radical generation and DNA interaction capabilities of Phed a compared to Pyropheophorbide a (Pyro a) under both oxygenated and anoxic conditions. Our results reveal that Phed a effectively degrades G&#8208;quadruplex DNA in the absence of oxygen, whereas Pyro a does not. Under anoxic conditions, Phed a generates unique carbon&#8208;centered radicals, as indicated by distinctive ESR signals, which are not observed in aerobic environments or with Pyro a. These radicals facilitate DNA decomposition without relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phed a&#8217;s ability to degrade DNA independently of oxygen underscores its potential as a versatile and effective PDT agent, especially for hypoxic tumors where traditional photosensitizers are ineffective. This study paves the way for the development of new PDT agents that can operate under different oxygen levels. Phed a&#8217;s radical generation and oxygen&#8208;independent DNA degradation mechanisms make it a promising candidate for future PDT applications.

         <title>Research Progress in the Field of Hydrogen Sulfide Donors in the Last Five Years</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the progress of research on H2S donors in the last five years. In addition to inorganic sulfide salts, it is elaborated in the following four main sections. They are indirect release of H2S small molecule donor carbonyl sulfide, direct release of hydrogen sulfide small molecule donor, nanocomposite scaffold, and hydrogel.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) serves as the third gasotransmitter, crucial in various physiological processes involving its production and metabolism. Elevated levels of H2S can result in acute or chronic poisoning, whereas lower concentrations are involved in regulating diverse physiological and pathological activities within the human body. Moreover, it actively participates in maintaining normal cellular function by exerting cell protection and anti&#8208;apoptotic effects. In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to explore the physiological significance of H2S and its potential applications in developing prodrugs. To further unravel the biological and clinical potential of H2S, H2S donors have gained widespread utilization. These compounds facilitate our understanding of the specific functional aspects governed by H2S and hold promise as potential therapeutic agents. Therefore, it is necessary to study H2S as a delivery vehicle at the cellular and in&#8197;vivo levels. This review provides an overview of advancements made over the past five years regarding H2S donors and their applications in biology, encompassing indirectly released donors of carbonyl sulfide (COS), directly released small molecule donors, Nanocomposite scaffolds, and hydrogels.

         <title>The Structural Permissiveness of Triosephosphate Isomerase (TpiA) of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase has a typical (&#946;&#945;)8&#8208;barrel superfold with eight &#946;&#945; units, linked together by loops which wrap around to form a cylinder of parallel &#946;&#8208;strands (&#946;&#8208;barrel) surrounded by a layer of parallel &#945;&#8208;helices. Such loops L1&#8211;L3 are candidates for insertion of extra amino acids, but genetic analyses shown in this work reveals permissiveness in other structured sites also.







Abstract
Triosephosphate isomerase (TpiA) is widely regarded as an example of an optimally evolved enzyme due to its essential role in biological systems, its structural conservation, and its near&#8208;perfect kinetic parameters. In this study, we investigated the structural robustness of the archetypal TpiA variant from Escherichia coli using an in&#8197;vitro 5&#8208;amino acid linker scanning method. The resulting library was introduced into a tpiA mutant strain for functional complementation. From this library, 16 TpiA variants that were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild&#8208;type enzyme were selected for further analysis. Although all variants retained enzymatic activities within the wild&#8208;type range, several insertions were found in highly structured protein domains where the linker was expected to cause significant structural perturbations. Despite these potentially disruptive additions, the enzymes maintained their activity even when expressed in a dnaK mutant, suggesting that chaperones did not compensate for structural abnormalities in&#8197;vivo. Additionally, when these mutant TpiA variants were produced using an in&#8197;vitro transcription/translation system, they exhibited enzymatic activity comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the non&#8208;mutated enzyme. AlphaFold2 exposed that insertions reconstructed the local architecture of the nearby amino acid sequences. The evolutionary implications of this remarkable structural resilience are discussed.

Photosynthetic microalgae were engineered for compartmentalized sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis by targeting synthases and cytochrome P450s to the chloroplast. The plastid's electron transport chain drives P450&#8208;mediated oxidation without reductase partners, enabling production of complex functionalized terpenes. This metabolic engineering approach demonstrates how photosynthetic biochemistry can be harnessed for sustainable production of valuable compounds from CO2.







Abstract
Terpenoids play key roles in cellular metabolism and can have specialized functions. Their heterologous production in microbial hosts offers an alternative to natural extraction. Here, we developed a subcellular engineering approach in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by targeting both sesquiterpenoid synthases and cytochrome P450s (CYPs) to the plastid, exploiting its photosynthetic electron transport chain to drive CYP&#8208;mediated oxidation without reductase partners. Nuclear&#8208;encoded sesquiterpenoid synthases were expressed with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase fusions and targeted to the plastid, while CYPs were modified for soluble localization in the plastid stroma by removing transmembrane domains. The plastid environment supported hydroxylation, epoxidation, and oxidation reactions, with functionalization efficiencies reaching 80&#8201;% of accumulated products. Carbon source availability influenced product ratios, revealing metabolic flexibility in the engineered pathways. Overall sesquiterpenoid yields ranged between 250&#8211;2500&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 under screening conditions, establishing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for using plastid biochemistry in complex terpenoid biosynthesis. Living two&#8208;phase terpenoid extractions with different perfluorinated solvents revealed variable performances based on sesquiterpenoid functionalization and solvent type. This work demonstrates that photosynthetic electron transport can drive CYP&#8208;mediated functionalization in engineered subcellular compartments. However, improvements in photobioreactor cultivation concepts will be required to facilitate the use of algal chassis for scaled production.

         <title>Antigen Presentation in an Artificial and Cell Membrane: Blood Group A Glycan Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space filling models of the synthesized blood group A related glycolipid constructs, which were inserted into an artificial membrane and into erythrocytes, and then compared with each other for their interaction with anti&#8208;A antibodies. 3D structure of A(type&#8197;2) tetrasaccharide was calculated on the website https://glycam.org/ [glycam.org]; other fragments of these molecules were calculated in a HyperChem using MM+ in a vacuum. The same figure magnified is given in Supplementary Material.







Abstract
Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are functionally important components of the cell membrane and recognition of their glycan &#8220;head&#8221; by the immune system is a key part of normal and pathological processes. Recognition of glycolipid antigens on a living cell, their structure, &#8220;context&#8221; (microenvironment and clustering), presentation including orientation and distance from the plasma membrane, as well as molecular dynamics are important. GSL antigens are targets for the development of anticancer vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, therefore, control of the presentation of their glycans by synthetic methods opens up new possibilities in medicine. In this work, we synthesized 13 GSL analogues as function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipids (FSLs) with the same head (blood group A tetrasaccharide, ABO system) but each either differing in the structure of the lipid tail, or the length of the region between the head and the tail, or cluster organization of the head (from 2 to 4 tetrasaccharides in a cluster). The insertion of these FSLs into an artificial and erythrocyte membranes was compared, and their interaction with antibodies was studied, including erythrocyte agglutination. The results give further insight into knowledge of the membrane presentation of GSLs (some results can be extrapolated to glycoproteins) and factors involved in their interaction with antibodies.

         <title>Analysis and Prediction of Chymotrypsin Substrate Preferences through Large Data Acquisition with Target&#8208;Free mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral peptide therapeutics may be degraded by gut proteases like chymotrypsin. We used mRNA display to generate large datasets of chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant peptides and created a predictive machine learning model for chymotrypsin stability. We also identified protective and destabilizing residues and their positionally dependent effects on peptide cleavage. Finally, we validated both the computational and NGS model through half&#8208;life measurement experiments.







Abstract
Oral delivery of peptide therapeutics is limited by degradation by gut proteases like chymotrypsin. Existing databases of peptidases are limited in size and do not enable systematic analyses of protease substrate preferences, especially for non&#8208;natural amino acids. Thus, stability optimization of hit compounds is time and resource intensive. To accelerate the stability optimization of peptide ligands, we generated large datasets of chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant peptides via mRNA display to create a predictive model for chymotrypsin&#8208;resistant sequences. Through analysis of enriched motifs, we recapitulate known chymotrypsin cleavage sites, reveal positionally dependent effects of monomers on peptide cleavage, and report previously unidentified protective and destabilizing residues. We then developed a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based model predicting peptide resistance to chymotrypsin cleavage and validated both model performance and the NGS experimental data by measuring chymotrypsin half&#8208;lives for a subset of peptides. Finally, we simulated stability predictions on non&#8208;natural amino acids through a leucine hold&#8208;out model and observed robust performance. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of mRNA display as a tool for big data generation and show that pairing mRNA display with machine learning yields valuable predictions for chymotrypsin cleavage. Expansion of this workflow to additional proteases could provide complementary predictive models that focus future peptide drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework as Selective Fluorescence Sensors for Cancer Inducing Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;precision detection and quantification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is imperative for early diagnosis of several terminal diseases. Owing to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong covalent linkers, porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have found widespread application in the benign fluorescence&#8208;based sensing of diverse VOCs. This article highlights the synthesis of COFs, and the mechanism of their action in VOC detection.







Abstract
Certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as formaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol, are overexpressed in some terminal diseases like cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. Therefore, high&#8208;precision detection and quantification of VOCs is imperative for early diagnosis of such detrimental diseases. Non&#8208;invasive and accurate fluorescence&#8208;based detection of such analytes has garnered widespread attention. The inherent luminescent properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), resulting from their extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation, have made them suitable for sensing applications. Structural tunability and strong covalent linkers facilitate sensing by COFs. Appropriate choices of linker and skeletal units of the COF can help detect various biologically important analytes selectively. The most common linkers used in this regard is the imine linker, which can undergo excellent hydrogen bonding with different protic VOCs e.&#8201;g., ethanol, methanol, etc. Besides imine detection, hydrogen bonding also proved useful for detection of aldehydes. Suitable combinations of donors and acceptors enable the COFs to have specific charge transfer interactions with many electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor VOCs. In this review, we have highlighted the syntheses of selective COFs incorporating linkers designed for sensing cancer&#8208;inducing VOCs. A detailed discussion of the interaction mechanisms between COFs and these VOCs is provided, along with examples from recent literature in this field.

         <title>Engineering Gas&#8208;Releasing Nanomaterials for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, including NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, as well as synergistic therapeutic strategies with other treatment modalities such as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are discussed in wound repair.







Abstract
The escalating prevalence of tissue damage and its associated complications has elicited global apprehension. While nanomaterial&#8208;based wound healing exhibits significant potential in terms of curbing infections and surpassing conventional methods, unresolved concerns regarding nanomaterial controllability and precision remain unresolved, jeopardizing its practical applications. In recent years, a unique strategy for creating gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials for wound repair has been proposed, involving the creation of gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials to facilitate wound repair by generating gas donor moieties. The operational spatiotemporal responsiveness and broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial properties of these gases, combined with their inability to generate bacterial resistance like traditional antibiotics, establish their efficacy in addressing chronic non&#8208;healing wounds, specifically diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). In this review, we delve into the intricacies of wound healing process, emphasizing the chemical design, functionality, bactericidal activity, and potential of gas&#8208;release materials, encompassing NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2, and H2, for effective wound healing. Furthermore, we explore the advancements in synergistic therapy utilizing these gases, aiming to enhance our overall comprehension of this field. The insights gleaned from this review will undoubtedly aid researchers and developers in the creation of promising gas&#8208;releasing nanomaterials, thus propelling efficient wound healing in the future.

A colorimetric assay for DNase I detection based functional nucleic acids with peroxidase&#8208;like activity.







Abstract
DNase I plays a crucial role in fundamental biological processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and efficient method to detect DNase I activity. In this work, a colorimetric assay based on functional nucleic acid for sensitive DNase I detection was reported. The functional nucleic acids with G&#8208;rich bases exhibit peroxidase&#8208;like activity under acetic acid conditions, capable of catalyzing the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The specific nucleic acid is designed as the substrate for DNase I, which can hydrolyze the strand and reduce the catalytic activity of the reaction system. Based on this, a sensitive, simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective colorimetric detection platform was constructed for the quantitative analysis of DNase I. The detection limit (3&#963;/s) for DNase I was 0.046&#8197;U/mL with a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;U/mL. Moreover, the practicality of this colorimetric detection platform was demonstrated by detecting DNase I in human serum.

         <title>Visual and Quantitative Analysis of Dietary Fiber&#8208;Microbiota Interactions via Metabolic Labeling In Vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the dietary fibers&#8217; (DFs) interactions with bacteria in the gut is important in guiding the DF&#8208;based interventions towards the goal of establishing a health&#8208;promoting gut microbiota. However, directly investigating DFs&#8217; interactions with bacteria in the gut remains very difficult. Here, we develop an in&#8197;vivo metabolic labeling&#8208;based strategy to visually investigate and identify the DF&#8208;binding bacteria in the gut and quantitatively analyze their affected metabolic status caused by specific DF.







Abstract
Dietary fiber (DF)&#8208;based interventions are crucial in establishing a health&#8208;promoting gut microbiota. However, directly investigating DFs&#8217; in&#8197;vivo interactions with intestinal bacteria remains challenging due to the lack of suitable tools. Here, we develop an in&#8197;vivo metabolic labeling&#8208;based strategy, which enables not only imaging and identifying the bacteria that bind with specific DF in the intestines, but also quantifying DF's impact on their metabolic status. Four DFs, including galactan, rhamnogalacturonan and two inulins, are fluorescently derivatized and used for in&#8197;vivo labeling to visually record DFs&#8217; interactions with gut bacteria. The subsequent cell&#8208;sorting, 16S rDNA sequencing, and fluorescence in&#8197;situ hybridization identify the taxa that bind each DF. We then select a DF&#8208;binding species newly identified herein and verify its DF&#8208;catabolizing capability in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, we find that the indigenous metabolic status of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whether inulin&#8208;binders or not, is significantly enhanced by the inulin supplement. This trend is not observed in Gram&#8208;negative microbiota, even for the inulin&#8208;binders, demonstrating the ability of our methods in differentiating the primary, secondary DF&#8208;degraders from cross&#8208;feeders, a question that is difficult to answer by using other methods. Our strategy provides a novel chemical biology tool for deciphering the complex DF&#8208;bacteria interactions in the gut.

         <title>Photodynamic Inactivation of Bacteria Using Nickel(II) Complexes with Catecholate and Phenanthroline Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;ligand Ni(II) complexes, incorporating phenanthroline and naturally occurring coumarin (esculetin) ligands, exhibit significant singlet oxygen&#8208;mediated photodynamic inactivation (antibacterial) activity against both Gram&#8208;(+) and Gram&#8208;(&#8722;) bacteria under visible light, paving the way for Ni(II)&#8208;based non&#8208;macrocyclic photosensitizers for treating bacterial infections.







Abstract
Metal complexes activated by light can combat infections by triggering the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. Herein, we report six mixed&#8208;ligand nickel(II) complexes with the formulation [Ni(NN)2(L)] (1&#8211;6), where NN represents an N,N&#8208;donor phenanthroline ligand, specifically 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen in 1, 2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq in 3, 4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz in 5, 6), while L is an O,O donor bidentate ligand derived from catechol (cat2&#8722;, in 1, 3, 5) or esculetin (esc2&#8722;, in 2, 4, 6). The paramagnetic d8 octahedral complexes demonstrated good dark and photostability in the solution phase and exhibited significant light absorption in the visible (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) region. When exposed to low&#8208;energy visible light, these complexes demonstrated significant photodynamic inactivation activity against both Gram&#8208;(+) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram&#8208;(&#8722;) Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. This resulted in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.31&#8211;9.49&#8197;&#956;M. The activity was caused by the cell&#8208;damaging singlet oxygen species produced by the complexes under light exposure. Notably, the complexes showed no bacterial inhibition activity under dark conditions. This study marks the first examples of Ni(II) complexes designed for light&#8208;triggered antibacterial activity, illuminating the path for Ni(II)&#8208;based non&#8208;macrocyclic complexes for antibacterial PDT applications.

         <title>Enhanced Molecular Imaging through a Versatile Peptide Nanofiber for Self&#8208;Assembly and Precise Recognition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;based imaging probe (TAP) is designed through effective combination of the signal unit, recognition motif, assembly motif and Pro&#8208;leverage. TAP could combine with imaging probes through unique self&#8208;assembly strategies and specifically bind to PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive tumor with high specificity and stability. The TAP probe is an effective tool for diagnostic and therapeutic integration of tumors.







Abstract
Designing molecules for multivalent targeting of specific disease markers can enhance binding stability which is critical in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. Through rational molecular design, the nanostructures formed by self&#8208;assembly of targeting peptides are expected to achieve multivalent targeting by increasing the density of recognition ligands. However, the balance between targeting peptide self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition remains elusive. In this study, we designed a targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;based imaging probe system TAP which consist of the signal unit, the recognition motif, the assembly motif and a Pro&#8208;leverage. It is verified that TAP could specifically binds to PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive tumor cells in a multivalent manner to produce biological effects, and could also be combined with imaging probes through unique self&#8208;assembly strategies. By the balance between the peptide self&#8208;assembly and targeting recognition, the specificity and stability can be improved while the accumulation capacity of the probes at the tumor site can be greatly enhanced compared with the conventional strategy, thus reducing side effects, providing an effective tool for diagnostic and therapeutic integration of tumors.

         <title>Development of Nanomaterials&#8208;Based Agents for Selective Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents emerge as promising solutions to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of specific bacteria remains crucial. This review examines nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents and their mechanisms, including hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, protein and nucleic acid leakage, selective labelling and killing, extracellular and intracellular ROS generation, and damage to inner and outer membranes, all contributing to selective antibacterial activity.







Abstract
Bacterial infections continue to threaten public health due to limitations in rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques. While broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics offer empirical treatment, their overuse has fuelled the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens, posing a critical global public health challenge. In this critical scenario, nanomaterial&#8208;based antibacterial agents emerge as a promising solution to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of pathogenic bacteria is paramount. This review highlights recent advancements in developing nanomaterials for selective antibacterial activity. We categorize these agents based on their mode of action, exploring how they selectively interact with bacteria and their potential antibacterial mechanisms.

     alt="Development of Nanomaterials-Based Agents for Selective Antibacterial Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanomaterial-based antibacterial agents emerge as promising solutions to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of specific bacteria remains crucial. This review examines nanomaterial-based antibacterial agents and their mechanisms, including hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, protein and nucleic acid leakage, selective labelling and killing, extracellular and intracellular ROS generation, and damage to inner and outer membranes, all contributing to selective antibacterial activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections continue to threaten public health due to limitations in rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques. While broad-spectrum antibiotics offer empirical treatment, their overuse has fuelled the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens, posing a critical global public health challenge. In this critical scenario, nanomaterial-based antibacterial agents emerge as a promising solution to combat bacteria and inhibit their proliferation. However, selective elimination of pathogenic bacteria is paramount. This review highlights recent advancements in developing nanomaterials for selective antibacterial activity. We categorize these agents based on their mode of action, exploring how they selectively interact with bacteria and their potential antibacterial mechanisms. This review offers crucial insights for researchers exploring the potential of nanotechnology to address the growing threat of AMR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the P&#8208;Cluster of Vanadium Nitrogenase: an EPR and XAS Study of the Holo vs. Apo Forms of the Enzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study brings a combination of biochemical techniques, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data to help to understand the P&#8208;cluster of nitrogenases, in particular the differences between the holo and apo&#8208;forms of the nitrogenase VFe protein. It is demonstrated that apo&#8208;VFe does not contain fully matured P&#8208;clusters.







Abstract
The catalytic moiety of nitrogenases contains two complex metalloclusters: The M&#8208;cluster (also called cofactor), where the catalytic reduction of substrates takes place, and the [Fe8S7] P&#8208;cluster responsible for electron transfer. Due to discrepancies between crystallography and EPR spectroscopy, the exact structure of the P&#8208;cluster in the VFe protein remains a topic of debate. Herein, we use an apo&#8208;form of VFe (which retains the P&#8208;cluster but lacks the FeVco) to study the VFe P&#8208;cluster. SDS&#8208;PAGE and NativePAGE showed a heterogeneous composition of the VFe and the apo&#8208;VFe samples with the presence of &#945;1&#946;2&#948;2 and &#945;1&#946;2 complexes. The parallel mode EPR measurements of IDS oxidized MoFe, apo&#8208;MoFe, and VFe samples reveal a signal at g=12 associated with the two&#8208;electron oxidized state of the P&#8208;cluster (P2+) for all three samples, albeit with different intensities. In contrast, no P2+ was observed for IDS oxidized apo&#8208;VFe. Additionally, comparisons between apo&#8208;MoFe, apo&#8208;VFe and the model complex (NBu4)2[Fe4S4(SPh)4] via EXAFS measurements showed that apo&#8208;VFe does not contain a fully formed [Fe8S7] P&#8208;cluster, but rather is comprised of fragmented iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Our results point to a possible variation in the structure of the P&#8208;cluster in the different forms of the nitrogenase.

         <title>Improving Retinoic Acid Efficacy: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Derivatives with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipase&#8208;catalyzed approach was applied to the synthesis of nine derivatives of retinoic acid (four of them new compounds) with excellent yield and low environmental impact. Several synthesized compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the retinoic acid in Vero cells and a remarkably higher antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;1 (HSV&#8208;1) and Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;2 (HSV&#8208;2).







Abstract
An efficient enzymatic approach was applied to the synthesis of new derivatives of retinoic acid. Nine derivatives, four of them new compounds, were obtained through lipase&#8208;catalysis with excellent yield. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, the influence of various parameters such as enzyme source, nucleophile&#8201;:&#8201;substrate ratio, enzyme&#8201;:&#8201;substrate ratio, solvent and temperature was studied. The excellent results obtained by lipase catalysis made the procedure very efficient considering their advantages such as mild reaction conditions and low environmental impact. In addition, several synthesized compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the retinoic acid in Vero cells and a remarkably higher antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;1 (HSV&#8208;1) and Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;2 (HSV&#8208;2).

         <title>Nucleic Acid Covalent Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review evaluates recent advancements in nucleic acid&#8208;based tags for protein labeling, with a particular emphasis on covalent labeling approaches, including the use of aptamers, protein fusion tags, and metabolic oligosaccharide engineering. It highlights emerging trends in protein detection, visualization, functionalization, and targeted degradation, which play crucial roles in diverse chemical and biomedical applications.







Abstract
The selective and site&#8208;specific chemical labeling of proteins has emerged as a pivotal research area in chemical biology and cell biology. An effective protein labeling typically meets several criteria, including high specificity, rapid and robust conjugation under physiological conditions, operation at low concentrations with biocompatibility, and minimal perturbation of the protein function and activity. The conjugation of nucleic acids with proteins has garnered significant attention recently due to the rapid advancements in nucleic acid probe technologies, leveraging the programmable nature of nucleic acids alongside the multifaceted functionalities of proteins. It helps to convert protein&#8208;specific information into nucleic acid signals, facilitating upstream versatile recognition and downstream signal amplification for the target protein. This review critically evaluates the recent progress in nucleic acid&#8208;based protein labeling methodologies, with a specific focus on covalent labeling using aptamer tags, protein fusion tags or the technique of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering. The tags establish covalent linkages with target proteins through various modalities such as small molecules or metabolic glycan engineering. The insights presented in the review highlight promising avenues for the development of highly specific and versatile protein labeling techniques, which is essential for the improvement of protein&#8208;targeted detection and imaging across diverse biological contexts.

         <title>Designer Helical Fibers and Tubes: Self&#8208;assembling Hybrid Peptides via Leu/Ile&#8208;Phe Zipper</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dipeptides with phenylene urea at their N&#8208;terminus exhibit tubular or fibrous assemblies, depending on the dipeptide sequence. Tubular structures are formed through an Ile/Leu&#8208;Phe zipper involving a double helical arrangement. The self&#8208;assembled structures also display autofluorescence and red&#8208;edge excitation behaviour.







Abstract
Here, we present a family of simple peptides that show diverse self&#8208;assembling behaviors. We used aliphatic (Leu/Ile) and aromatic (Phe) amino acids to delineate our design. The design consists of phenylene urea at the N&#8208;terminus of the peptide. The urea peptides with sequence Phe&#8208;LeuOMe (1) or Phe&#8208;IleOMe (2) associate to form polygonal peptide tubes via zipper arrangements, supported by microscopic and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The peptide with Phe placed away from the phenylene urea (3 and 4), showed fibrous assembly. All the peptides showed autofluorescence and red edge excitation behavior upon self&#8208;assembly.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advances in peptides for liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and highlights their crucial role in drug delivery, catalysis, biosensing, and detection. We focus on the strategies used to design LLPS peptide sequences and emphasize their potential biomedical applications. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as next&#8208;generation biomaterials.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) refers to a spontaneous separation behavior of biomacromolecules under specific physiological conditions, playing a crucial role in regulating various biological processes. Recent advances in synthetic peptides have greatly improved our understanding of peptide&#8208;based coacervate droplets and expanded their applications in biomedicine. Numerous peptide sequences have been reported that undergo phase separation, enabling the concentration and sequestration of different guest molecules for purposes such as drug delivery, catalytic performance, and bioanalytical techniques. Particularly, some of these peptides offer significant advantages in controlled drug release, efficient cell transfection, accelerated reaction kinetics, and selective biomarker detection. This review provides an overview of recent developments in peptide&#8208;based LLPS, exploring various strategies for designing peptide sequences and their biomedical applications. It also addresses the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as promising biomaterials.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterisation of a Bacterial Lactoperoxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the biochemical and structural characterization of CyanoPOX, a heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16. Expressed in E.&#8197;coli, the enzyme exhibits properties similar to bovine lactoperoxidase despite low sequence identity. CyanoPOX demonstrates optimal activity in slightly acidic conditions and efficiently oxidizes various substrates. Structural analysis reveals a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor and a conserved active site pocket.







Abstract
Peroxidases belong to a group of enzymes that are widely found in animals, plants and microorganisms. These enzymes are effective biocatalysts for a wide range of oxidations on various substrates. This work presents a biochemical and structural characterization of a novel heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16, CyanoPOX. This cyanobacterial enzyme was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble, heme&#8208;containing monomeric enzyme. Although CyanoPOX shares relatively low sequence identity (37&#8201;%) with bovine lactoperoxidase, it displays comparable biochemical properties. CyanoPOX is most stable and active in slightly acidic conditions (pH 6&#8211;6.5) and moderately thermostable (melting temperature around 48&#8201;&#176;C). Several compounds that are typical substrates for mammalian lactoperoxidases were tested to establish the catalytic potential of CyanoPOX. Potassium iodide showed the highest catalytic efficiency (126&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), while various aromatic compounds were also readily converted. Structural elucidation of CyanoPOX confirmed the presence of a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor that is situated in the central core of the protein. Except for a highly similar overall structure, CyanoPOX also has a conserved active site pocket when compared with mammalian lactoperoxidases. Due to its catalytic properties and high expression in a bacterial host, this newly discovered peroxidase shows promise for applications.

         <title>Design of a Bioluminescent Assay Platform for Quantitative Measurement of Histone Acetyltransferase Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive novel bioluminescent system was developed that can accurately quantify the kinetics of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) catalyzed acylation reactions. This system utilizes acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 and firefly luciferase for a coupled reaction that generates luminescence proportional to acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA) concentrations allowing for determination of AcCoA consumption by a HAT catalyzed reaction. This system can be used in high throughput for inhibition studies.







Abstract
Protein acetylation and acylation are widespread post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Histone acetyltransferase (HATs) enzymes catalyze the addition of short&#8208;chain acyl moieties to lysine residues on cellular proteins. Many HAT members are found to be dysregulated in human diseases, especially oncological processes. Screening potent and selective HAT inhibitors has promising application for therapeutic innovation. A biochemical assay for quantification of HAT activity utilizing luminescent output is highly desirable to improve upon limitations associated with the classic radiometric assay formats. Here we report the design of a bioluminescent technological platform for robust and sensitive quantification of HAT activity. This platform utilizes the metabolic enzyme acetyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) for a coupled reaction with firefly luciferase to generate luminescent signal relative to the HAT&#8208;catalyzed acetylation reaction. The biochemical assay was implemented in microtiter plate format and our results showed this assay sensitively detected catalytic activity of HAT enzyme p300, accurately measured its steady&#8208;state kinetic parameters of histone acetylation and measured the inhibitory potency of HAT inhibitor. This platform demonstrated excellent robustness, reproducibility, and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, with a screening window Z&#8217;=0.79. Our new bioluminescent design provides an alternative means for HAT enzymatic activity quantitation and HAT inhibitor screening.

         <title>Impact of Antioxidants on Mechanical Properties and ROS Levels of Neuronal Cells Exposed to &#946;&#8208;Amyloid Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effects of antioxidants on oxidative stress and mechanical properties of neuronal cells exposed to &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregates. Using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy and electrochemical methods, it was highlighted how NAC and SOD1 reduce ROS&#8208;induced cellular stiffness, revealing a link between oxidative stress and cytoskeletal dynamics relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
This study aims to investigate the potential role of antioxidants in oxidative stress and its consequent impact on the mechanical properties of neuronal cells, particularly the stress induced by amyloid&#8208;beta (1&#8211;42) (A&#946;42) aggregates. A key aspect of our research involved using scanning ion&#8208;conductance microscopy (SICM) to assess the mechanical properties (Young's modulus) of neuronal cells under oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured in single&#8208;cell using the electrochemical method by low&#8208;invasive Pt nanoelectrode. We investigated the effects of the low molecular weight antioxidant N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) on the physiological and mechanical properties of neuronal cells using SICM. Using electrochemical method and SICM, NAC effectively reduces oxidative stress and restores Young's Modulus in SH&#8208;SY5Y cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide and A&#946;42 oligomers. Our study first examined the influence of SOD1 on intracellular ROS levels in the presence of A&#946; oligomers. The investigation into the effects of SOD1 and its nanoparticle form SOD1 on SH&#8208;SY5Y cells reveals impacts on mechanical properties and oxidative stress. The combined use of SICM and electrochemical measurements provided a comprehensive understanding of how oxidative stress, including that triggered by the A&#946; oligomers affects the mechanical properties of cells.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction and Conformational Change in the Alpha&#8208;Helical Membrane Transporter BtuCD&#8208;F in the Native Cellular Envelope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, the &#945;&#8208;helical membrane proteins are located in the inner membrane (IM) and further nanoconfined into the complex cellular envelope, which additionally consists of the periplasm and the outer membrane (OM). Here, we show that the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair combined with pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy can be used to observe the conformational change of a membrane transporter in the cellular envelope.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins perform numerous critical functions essential for the survival of living organisms. Traditionally, these proteins are extracted from membranes using detergent solubilization and reconstitution into liposomes or nanodiscs. However, these processes often obscure the effects of nanoconfinement and the native environment on the structure and conformational heterogeneity of the target protein. We demonstrate that pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy, combined with the Gd3+&#8208;nitroxide spin pair, enables the selective observation of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD&#8722;F in its native cellular envelope. Despite the high levels of non&#8208;specific labeling in the envelope, this orthogonal approach combined with the long phase&#8208;memory time for the Gd3+ spin enables the observation of the target protein complex at a few micromolar concentrations with high resolution. In the native envelope, vitamin B12 induces a distinct conformational shift at the BtuCD&#8208;BtuF interface, which is not observed in the micelles. This approach offers a general strategy for investigating protein&#8208;protein and protein&#8208;ligand/drug interactions and conformational changes of the alpha&#8208;helical membrane proteins in their native envelope context.

     alt="Protein-Protein Interaction and Conformational Change in the Alpha-Helical Membrane Transporter BtuCD-F in the Native Cellular Envelope"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gram-negative bacteria, the &#945;-helical membrane proteins are located in the inner membrane (IM) and further nanoconfined into the complex cellular envelope, which additionally consists of the periplasm and the outer membrane (OM). Here, we show that the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-nitroxide spin pair combined with pulsed electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy can be used to observe the conformational change of a membrane transporter in the cellular envelope.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha-helical membrane proteins perform numerous critical functions essential for the survival of living organisms. Traditionally, these proteins are extracted from membranes using detergent solubilization and reconstitution into liposomes or nanodiscs. However, these processes often obscure the effects of nanoconfinement and the native environment on the structure and conformational heterogeneity of the target protein. We demonstrate that pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy, combined with the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-nitroxide spin pair, enables the selective observation of the vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; importer BtuCD&#8722;F in its native cellular envelope. Despite the high levels of non-specific labeling in the envelope, this orthogonal approach combined with the long phase-memory time for the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; spin enables the observation of the target protein complex at a few micromolar concentrations with high resolution. In the native envelope, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; induces a distinct conformational shift at the BtuCD-BtuF interface, which is not observed in the micelles. This approach offers a general strategy for investigating protein-protein and protein-ligand/drug interactions and conformational changes of the alpha-helical membrane proteins in their native envelope context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multifunctional roles of NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs) in biocatalysis beyond traditional cofactor regeneration. It highlights their emerging applications in catalyzing key reactions for small molecule synthesis, including reductions of ketones, imines, and aldehydes, as well as dehydrogenation processes, emphasizing their potential in drug discovery and development.







Abstract
The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress in the field of biocatalysis. One of the most frequently utilized enzymes in diverse biocatalytic applications is NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs). Traditionally, these enzymes are employed for their role in regenerating NAD(P)H in various enzymatic reactions utilizing glucose. However, recent studies have expanded the scope of GDHs beyond cofactor regeneration, highlighting their potential as biocatalysts in diverse chemical transformations. GDHs have demonstrated versatility in catalyzing key reactions in the synthesis of various drug molecules and intermediates, including ketone reduction to produce alcohols, imine reduction of C=N bonds to yield amines, reduction of aldehydes to alcohols, and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol derivatives. This review highlights recent advancements in elucidating the multifunctional roles of NAD(P)&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs) in biocatalysis, with an emphasis on their growing applications and significant potential in small molecule synthesis.

         <title>Towards Bacterial Resistance via the Membrane Strategy: Enzymatic, Biophysical and Biomimetic Studies of the Lipid cis&#8208;trans Isomerase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti), a heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, induces a swift membrane rigidification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under stress conditions that impede bacterial growth. This study provides understanding of the enzyme's heme coordination and redox state as well as some insights into the catalytic mechanism and reveals that phospholipids, alongside fatty acids, serve as substrate for this metalloenzyme.







Abstract
The lipid cis&#8208;trans isomerase (Cti) is a periplasmic heme&#8208;c enzyme found in several bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen known for causing nosocomial infections. This metalloenzyme catalyzes the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids in order to rapidly modulate membrane fluidity in response to stresses that impede bacterial growth. As a consequence, breakthrough in the elucidation of the mechanism of this metalloenzyme might lead to new strategies to combat bacterial antibiotic resistance. We report the first comprehensive biochemical, electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Cti enzyme. This has been possible by the successful purification of Cti from P. aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;Cti) in favorable yields with enzyme activity of 0.41&#8197;&#956;mol/min/mg when tested with palmitoleic acid. Through a synergistic approach involving enzymology, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, Raman spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electrochemistry, we identified the heme coordination and redox state, pinpointing Met163 as the sixth ligand of the FeII of heme&#8208;c in Pa&#8208;Cti. Significantly, the development of an innovative assay based on liposomes demonstrated for the first time that Cti catalyzes cis&#8208;trans isomerization directly using phospholipids as substrates without the need of protein partners, answering the important question about the substrate of Cti within the bacterial membrane.

         <title>Concise Affinity&#8208;Based Purification of Ligated mRNA for Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of Nucleosugar Modification Patterns</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a two&#8208;step affinity purification method for ligated sugar&#8208;modified mRNA. The purification is based on oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to 3&#8217; poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA. This method provides a new platform for rapid optimization of chemically modified mRNAs and advancement of their pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
Position&#8208;specific nucleoside sugar modifications have been shown to improve the translational activity and stability of chemically synthesized mRNA. For pharmaceutical applications of chemically modified mRNAs, a rapid purification methodology is imperative to identify the optimal modification pattern. However, while the chemical synthesis of mRNAs can be accomplished by splint ligation of oligonucleotide fragments, the current purification method for ligated mRNAs based on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tends to be time consuming. In this study, we developed a two&#8208;step affinity purification method for rapid sample preparation. In this method, ligated mRNA is captured by oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to the 3&#8217;&#8208;poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA, respectively. Therefore, the target mRNA can be isolated from a complex mixture of splint ligations. Using this method, six sugar&#8208;modified mRNAs were simultaneously purified, and the translational activities of these mRNAs were evaluated immediately after purification. The results demonstrate that this methodology is suitable for the rapid preparation of various chemically synthesized mRNAs to identify their optimal modification patterns.

         <title>Protein Condensates Unfold G&#8208;Quadruplex Resembling a Helicase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of biomolecules plays a significant role in intracellular condensation. Our findings of G4 unfolding within protein condensates reveal intriguing insights into how a protein gain a new function through the formation of condensates, enriching our comprehension of cellular processes at the molecular level.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;less organelles, formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, participate in many vital cellular processes and have received extensive attention recently. A notable form of noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structure, G&#8208;quadruplex (G4), interacts with the scaffolding proteins in these membrane&#8208;less organelles and becomes an integral part of this condensed phase. However, the structure and stability features of the integrated G4 remain poorly characterized. Herein, we employed NMR along with other biophysical methods to investigate the conformation of a G4 within condensates formed by a disordered protein known as DDX4N1. We discovered that the human telomeric sequence MHT24, which forms a G4 structure in a non&#8208;condensed phase solution of protein DDX4N1, unfolds when it is within DDX4N1 condensates due to phase separation. Our findings provide an instance of a protein acquiring new functionality through phase separation process, which deepen our understanding of how protein condensates regulate G4 structure and their functions.

         <title>Chondroitin Sulfate&#8208;Coated Heteroduplex&#8208;Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[60]fullerene&#8208;based molecular spherical nucleic acids (MSNAs) were used as hybridization&#8208;mediated carriers for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate (CS) tetrasaccharides. The impact of the MSNA&#8208;carriers and the CS&#8208;halo on the cellular uptake and suppression of Tau&#8208;protein was studied with hippocampal neurons in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids (MSNAs) are atomically uniform dendritic nanostructures and potential delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The radial formulation combined with covalent conjugation may hide the oligonucleotide content and simultaneously enhance the role of appropriate conjugate groups on the outer sphere.

&lt;p&gt;[60]fullerene-based molecular spherical nucleic acids (MSNAs) were used as hybridization-mediated carriers for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate (CS) tetrasaccharides. The impact of the MSNA-carriers and the CS-halo on the cellular uptake and suppression of Tau-protein was studied with hippocampal neurons &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids (MSNAs) are atomically uniform dendritic nanostructures and potential delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The radial formulation combined with covalent conjugation may hide the oligonucleotide content and simultaneously enhance the role of appropriate conjugate groups on the outer sphere. The conjugate halo may be modulated to affect the delivery properties of the MSNAs. In the present study, [60]fullerene-based molecular spherical nucleic acids, consisting of a 2&#8242;-deoxyribonucleotide and a ribonucleotide sequence, were used as hybridization-mediated carriers (&#8220;DNA and RNA-carriers&#8221;) for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, (i.&#8201;e. Tau-ASO) and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides (CS) with different sulfation patterns. The impact of the MSNA carriers, CS-moieties on the conjugates and the CS-decorations on the MSNAs on cellular uptake and - activity (Tau-suppression) of the Tau-ASO was studied with hippocampal neurons &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The formation and stability of these heteroduplex ASO-MSNAs were evaluated by UV melting profile analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography equipped with a multi angle light scattering detector (SEC-MALS). The cellular uptake and - activity were studied by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Various Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Derivatives in Enzyme Supramolecular Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin derivatives are produced and used to build a protective layer shielding surface&#8208;immobilized enzymes. These macrocycles act as artificial chaperones and support protein stability under thermal stress conditions. Along with providing protection to enzymes exposed to chaotropic stress, the macrocycles support protein refolding and activity recovery.







Abstract
Enzyme stability and activity are pivotal factors for their implementation in different industrial applications. Enzyme supramolecular engineering relies on the fabrication of a tailor&#8208;made enzyme nano&#8208;environment to ensure enzyme stability without impairing activity. Cyclodextrins (CDs), cyclic oligomers of glucose, act as protein chaperones and stabilize, upon interaction with hydrophobic amino acid residues exposed at the protein surface, its three&#8208;dimensional structure. When used to build an organosilica layer shielding an enzyme, they enhance the protective effect of this layer. In the present study, we systematically assessed the protective effects of three organosilane derivatives based on &#593;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CDs. A model lipase enzyme was immobilized at the surface of silica nanoparticles and shielded in an organosilica layer containing these organosilanes. Besides layer thickness optimization, the effect of different stressors (i.&#8201;e., temperature, SDS, urea) was tested. Our results showed that organosilica layers produced with CDs improve enzyme thermal stability. They also support enzyme refolding after denaturation under chaotic conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the protective effect of the smallest CD derivative tested, namely &#593;&#8208;CD, surpassed the other macrocycles studied for conferring the immobilized enzyme with higher resistance to stress conditions. This protection strategy was also applied to a thermostable &#946;&#8208;galactosidase enzyme.

         <title>Auto&#8208;Deactivation of BODIPY&#8208;Derived Type I Photosensitizer Post Photodynamic Therapy under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage photochemical process on BODIPY&#8208;derived photosensitizers is investigated under oxygen&#8208;free conditions to automatically switch off the photoactivity post photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment. The NADH&#8208;driven mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosystem exhibits great potential for safe and efficient PDT beyond reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fighting hypoxia.







Abstract
The long&#8208;lasting activity of photosensitizers during photodynamic therapy (PDT) causes excessive damage and arouses great concerns about biosafety. Herein, we synthesized a pyridinium&#8208;decorated diiodo&#8208;BODIPY compound (PyBDP) and investigated its photosensitizing activity under hypoxic condition in the presence of NADH that is abundant in the mitochondria of hypoxic tumors. The unique property of PyBDP lies in the redox environment&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response. At green light exposure, PyBDP is converted into a colorless inactive form by interacting with NADH in a two&#8208;step one&#8208;electron transfer process. Interestingly, the NADH&#8208;dependent hydrogenation of PyBDP is affected by the presence of cytochrome c (Cyt cox) that is an important component of mitochondrial electron transport chain (Mito&#8208;ETC), unless Cyt cox is exhausted. Active radical species is produced during the photocatalytic reaction, which adds the understanding of PyBDP&#8208;induced photodamage. Therefore, we applied the strategy of auto&#8208;deactivation PDT using a BODIPY photosensitizer by tethering triphenylphosphonium to PyBDP. After PDT effect in a type I pathway, the photosensitizer underwent almost entire auto&#8208;deactivation in hypoxic HeLa cells. This work paves a way for the development of reductive PDT with enhanced safety and efficacy in fighting hypoxic tumors independent on reactive oxygen species (ROS).

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective NanoBRET Probe to Assess MAGL Inhibition in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new intracellular NanoBRET assay was developed to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. To this end, a potent reversible preclinical inhibitor was linked to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 fluorophore by means of structure&#8208;based design, and MAGL was engineered with a fused nanoluciferase (Nluc) protein as a suitable donor counterpart. The assay was validated using representative irreversible and reversible MAGL inhibitors, followed by profiling of over 1&#8217;900 project compounds. This study demonstrates the advantages of cell&#8208;based assays in accelerating compound profiling in early project stages.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;free enzymatic assays are highly useful tools in early compound profiling due to their robustness and scalability. However, their inadequacy to reflect the complexity of target engagement in a cellular environment may lead to a significantly divergent pharmacology that is eventually observed in cells. The discrepancy that emerges from properties like permeability and unspecific protein binding may largely mislead lead compound selection to undergo further chemical optimization. We report the development of a new intracellular NanoBRET assay to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. Based on a reverse design approach, a highly potent, reversible preclinical inhibitor was conjugated to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 acceptor fluorophore while retaining its overall balanced properties. An engineered MAGL&#8208;nanoluciferase (Nluc) fusion protein provided a suitable donor counterpart for the facile interrogation of intracellular ligand activity. Validation of assay conditions using a selection of known MAGL inhibitors set the stage for the evaluation of over 1&#8217;900 MAGL drug candidates derived from our discovery program. This evaluation enabled us to select compounds for further development based not only on target engagement, but also on favorable physicochemical parameters like permeability and protein binding. This study highlights the advantages of cell&#8208;based target engagement assays for accelerating compound profiling and progress at the early stages of drug discovery programs.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Modulated Excited Triplet States and Activities of Ruthenium Complexes for Dual Photodynamic/Sonodynamic Therapy to Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes with distinct intraligand transition nature of the lowest excited triplet states were designed for single&#8208;molecule PDT/SDT synergistic multimodal anticancer toward cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer. They could induce both apoptosis and ferroptosis of tumor cells by light&#8208; and sonication&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
Six polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes were designed for single&#8208;molecule photodynamic and sonodynamic therapy (PDT/SDT) synergistic multimodal anticancer toward cisplatin&#8208;resistant NSCLC. They demonstrated lowest 3ES with distinct intraligand transition nature, which is beneficial for singlet oxygen generation. Remarkable quantum yields of both singlet oxygen and superoxide anion under either 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation or ultrasonic treatment and could induce apoptosis and ferroptosis of A549R cells. Cytotoxicity experiments clearly demonstrated a synergistic effect between PDT and SDT. The relationship between the structures of these complexes and their cellular biological mechanisms has been explored in detail. Using a single&#8208;molecule sensitizer to achieve synergistic PDT/SDT may provide valuable insights for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant tumors that located deeply and in hypoxic microenvironment.

         <title>Photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Library Enables Covalent Chemical Capture of Solvent&#8208;Exposed TPR Domain Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the unnatural amino acid, p&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Bpa), we developed a photoactivatable O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) library to covalently capture protein&#8208;protein interactions along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. This library explicitly targets the less&#8208;studied TPR binding surface, over the lumenal substrate&#8208;binding surface, and expands the toolbox for both targeted discovery of new interactors and characterization of OGT's TPR interactome.







Abstract
O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is an essential, stress&#8208;sensing enzyme responsible for adding the O&#8208;GlcNAc monosaccharide to thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins to regulate cellular homeostasis. OGT substrates are found in almost all intracellular processes, and perturbations in protein O&#8208;GlcNAc levels have been implicated in proteostatic diseases, such as cancers, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration. This broad disease activity makes OGT an attractive therapeutic target; however, the substrate diversity makes pan&#8208;inhibition as a therapeutic strategy unfeasible. Rather, a substrate&#8208;specific approach to targeting is more advantageous, but how OGT chooses its substrates remains poorly understood. Substrate specificity is controlled by the interactions between OGT's non&#8208;catalytic tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, rather than its glycosyltransferase domain. OGT's TPR domain forms a 100&#8197;&#197; superhelical structure, containing a lumenal surface, known as the substrate&#8208;binding surface, and a solvent&#8208;exposed surface. To date, there are no tools to site&#8208;selectively target regions of the domain and differentiate between the two binding surfaces. Here, we developed a library of recombinant OGT constructs containing site&#8208;specifically incorporated photoactivatable unnatural amino acids (UAAs) along the solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the TPR domain to covalently capture and map OGT's interactome.

         <title>Exploring Fluorinase Substrate Tolerance at C&#8208;2 of SAM</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate tolerance of the fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) is explored by introducing untested substituents at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring. The most active analogues were N&#8208;alkylated amines and as a class these were much better than O&#8208; or S&#8208; ethers. The outcomes are supported by in silico analysis. This tolerance broadens the utility of the fluorinase as a tool for introducing the fluorine&#8208;18 isotope into ligands for positron emission tomography applications.







Abstract
The fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63) utilises fluoride ion and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) as substrates for conversion to 5&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;adenosine (5&#8242;&#8208;FDA) and L&#8208;methionine (L&#8208;Met). The enzyme has a very strict substrate specificity, however it has been shown to tolerate acetylenes and NH2 replacements for H at C&#8208;2 of the adenine ring of SAM. This substrate tolerance is explored further here with &#8722;NHR, &#8722;N3, &#8722;OR and &#8722;SR substituents attached to C&#8208;2. New activities are demonstrated, for example with NH&#8208;methyl, NH&#8208;propyl,NH&#8208;butyl and O&#8208;butyl substrates at C&#8208;2, however azide and thioethers were not tolerated. Outcomes are supported by in silico analysis, revealing favourable H&#8208;bonding interactions involving NH and O substituents at the adenine C&#8208;2 position with N278 and the backbone amide of A279 at the active site respectively. The study informs on the selectivity of the fluorinase as a tool for radiolabelling candidate ligands with fluorine&#8208;18 for positron emission tomography programmes.

         <title>Recent Insights into the Reaction Mechanisms of Non&#8208;Heme Diiron Enzymes Containing Oxoiron(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;valent oxoiron(IV): This review outlines the structures, formation mechanisms, and functions of high&#8208;valent oxoiron(IV) intermediates in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The discussion emphasizes the structural and mechanistic diversity across different enzyme subfamilies.







Abstract
Oxoiron(IV) complexes are key intermediates in the catalytic reactions of some non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. These enzymes, across various subfamilies, activate dioxygen to generate high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo species, which, in turn, drive the activation of substrates and mediate a variety of challenging oxidative transformations. In this review, we summarize the structures, formation mechanisms, and functions of high&#8208;valent diiron&#8208;oxo intermediates in eight representative diiron enzymes (sMMO, RNR, ToMO, MIOX, PhnZ, SCD1, AlkB, and SznF) spanning five subfamilies. We also categorize and analyze the structural and mechanistic differences among these enzymes.

         <title>Anion and Substituents Effect on Spectral&#8208;Kinetic and Biological Characteristics of Spiropyran Salts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
These spiropyran are characterized by NIR absorption and fluorescence of their merocyanine forms, making them promising fluorescent probes and markers. It was shown that the counterion has minimal effect on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the dyes but dramatically affects the toxicity of the compounds. Using the most appropriate compounds, bioimaging experiments were carried out to visualize planktonic bacteria and bacterial biofilms.







Abstract
Spiropyran salts containing a cationic vinyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indolium moiety are characterized by NIR absorption and fluorescence of their merocyanine forms. This feature makes them promising fluorescent probes and markers for bioimaging. The article focuses on the synthesis and study of the spectral, kinetic and toxic characteristics of such compounds with respect to various substituents in different moieties and the type of anion. A detailed analysis of the acquired data made it possible to draw some important conclusions regarding the influence of structural factors, which will be very useful for the further rational design of such derivatives. In particular, it was shown that the counterion has minimal effect on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the dyes but dramatically affects the toxicity of the compounds. Following selection of the most appropriate compounds, bioimaging experiments were carried out to visualize planktonic bacteria and bacterial biofilms of E. coli and A. calcoaceticus. The ability to visualize biofilms is critical for the diagnosis of chronic diseases. By the results of molecular docking a theoretical interaction pattern between spiropyran molecules and DNA was proposed.

         <title>Close Proximity of Cholesterol Anchors in Membrane Induces the Dissociation of Amphiphilic DNA Strand from Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular base paring in the terminal base pair of amphiphilic DNA strand labelled with cholesterol anchors was modulated by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction. The close proximity of cholesterol anchors within the membrane could result in the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA strand from the membrane surface.







Abstract
Dynamic DNA nanotechnology is appealing for membrane surface engineering due to their versatility and programmability. To modulate the dynamic interactions between the DNA functional units immobilized on membrane surface, membrane&#8208;anchored DNA functional units often come into close proximity each other due to DNA base pairing, which also leads to the close contact of the hydrophobic anchors in membrane. However, whether the close contact of hydrophobic anchors induces the dissociation of amphiphilic DNA structures from membrane surface is not concerned. Herein, we utilized cholesterol&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a simplified amphiphilic DNA structure to investigate the stability of membrane anchored DNA strands upon the closely contact of cholesterol anchors. The close contact of cholesterol&#8208;labelled ssDNA molecules driven by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction leads to approximately 41&#8201;% membrane anchored ssDNA dissociation from membrane surface, indicating the proximal cholesterol anchors in membrane could reduce the anchoring stability of cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands. This work enhances our understanding of the interactions between amphiphilic DNA and membranes, and provides valuable insights for the design of future DNA constructs intended for applications involving dynamic DNA reactions on membrane surface.

         <title>Mitochondrial Viscosity Probes: Iridium(III) Complexes Induce Apoptosis in HeLa Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new Ir(III) complexes containing 5&#8208;fluorouracil derivatives as ligands were synthesized. Among these, Ir1 selectively induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of Ir1 demonstrated high sensitivity to intracellular viscosity changes, enabling real&#8208;time fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of cellular micro&#8208;viscosity during apoptosis.







Abstract
Mitochondrial viscosity has emerged as a promising biomarker for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, yet accurately measuring viscosity at the subcellular level remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized and characterized three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (Ir1&#8208;Ir3) containing 5&#8208;fluorouracil derivatives as ligands. Among these, Ir1 selectively induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered a cascade of events leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the fluorescence lifetime of Ir1 demonstrated high sensitivity to intracellular viscosity changes, enabling real&#8208;time fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of cellular micro&#8208;viscosity during apoptosis. These findings underscore the potential of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications at the subcellular level.
