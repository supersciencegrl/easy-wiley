      <title>Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides: hyperstable scaffolds for protein engineering</title>
      <dc:description>Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides (CRPs) are small proteins of less than 100 amino acids in length characterized by the presence of disulfide bridges and common end&#8208;to&#8208;end macrocyclization. These properties confer hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and protease degradation to CRPs. Besides, their inter&#8208;cysteine domains (loops) are susceptible to residue hypervariability. CRPs have been successfully applied as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process where cysteine&#8208;rich structures provide higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to an epitope and acquire new biological function(s). This review describes successes and limitations for six cysteine&#8208;rich scaffolds, their bioactive epitopes, and the resulting grafted peptides.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides (CRPs) are small proteins of less than 100 amino acids in length characterized by the presence of disulfide bridges and common end&#8208;to&#8208;end macrocyclization. These properties confer hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and protease degradation to CRPs. Besides, their inter&#8208;cysteine domains (loops) are susceptible to residue hypervariability. CRPs have been successfully applied as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process where cysteine&#8208;rich structures provide higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to an epitope and acquire new biological function(s). This review describes successes and limitations for six cysteine&#8208;rich scaffolds, their bioactive epitopes, and the resulting grafted peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>RAPTA Decorated Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles: Exploring their Synthesis, Physical Properties and Effect on Cell Viability</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we report for the first time the successful immobilization of a known cytoactive [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(C2O4)PTA] (RAPTA) complex to a biologically inert polyacrylamide nanoparticle support. The nanoparticles have been characterised by zetasizer analysis, UV&#8208;Vis, ATR&#8208;FT&#8208;IR, TGA, and ICP&#8208;MS to qualitatively and quantitatively confirm the presence of the metallodrug on the surface of the carrier. The native RAPTA complex required a concentration of 50 &#181;M to produce a cell viability of 47.1 &#177; 2.1% when incubated with human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma cells for 72 hr. Under similar conditions a cell viability of 45.1 &#177; 1.9% was obtained with 0.5 &#181;M of RAPTA complex in its immobilized form. Therefore, conjugation of the RAPTA metallodrug to our nanoparticle carriers resulted in a significant 100&#8208;fold decrease in effective concentration of ruthenium required for a near identical biological effect on cell viability.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of new DNA Aptamers for anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 Reverse Transcriptase</title>
      <dc:description>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV&#8208;1 RT) is a necessary enzyme for retroviral replication which is the main target for antiviral therapy against AIDs. The effective anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT drugs are classified into two groups; nucleoside inhibitors (NRTI) and non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI) which inhibit the DNA polymerase function. In this study, new DNA aptamers were isolated as anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT inhibitors. The selected DNA aptamer (WT62) presented with high affinity and inhibition against wild type (WT) HIV&#8208;1 RT and gave  a K  D  value of 75.10 &#177; 0.29 nM and an IC  50  value of 84.81 &#177; 8.54 nM. Moreover, WT62 decreased the DNA polymerase function of K103N/Y181C double mutant (KY) HIV&#8208;1 RT by around 80%. Furthermore, the ITC results showed that this aptamer has slightly small binding enthalpies with both WT and KY HIV&#8208;1 RTs through which the complex may form a hydrophobic interaction or non&#8208;covalent bonding. The NMR result also suggested that the WT62 aptamer could bind with both WT and KY mutant HIV&#8208;1 RT at the connection domain.</dc:description>

Hidden gems: Despite the recent advances in phosphoproteomics, a chemically labile subset of the phosphoproteome has remained &#8220;hidden&#8221; for a long time. Here we discuss current search efforts and future directions.







Abstract
Protein phosphorylation is one of the most studied post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). Despite the remarkable advances in phosphoproteomics, a chemically less&#8208;stable subset of the phosphosites, which we call the crypto&#8208;phosphoproteome, has remained underexplored due to technological challenges. In this Viewpoint, we briefly summarize the current understanding of these elusive protein phosphorylations and identify the missing pieces for future studies.

      <dc:description>The aim of this study was to develop a transcription activator&#8208;like effector (TALE)&#8208;based technology to regulate protein synthesis in cell&#8208;free systems. We attempted to regulate the T7 promoter system, which has no natural mechanism of expression control, and sought to arbitrarily induce protein expression through the formation and dissociation of TALE and target DNA complexes. Protein synthesis was performed in a cell&#8208;free system in the presence of TALE, which recognized and bound to a sequence upstream of the T7 promoter, and protein expression was suppressed by approximately 80% compared to the absence of TALE. This suggests that the masking of part of the promoter region strongly suppresses protein synthesis. Additionally, competitive inhibition of TALE binding to the target DNA template led to protein synthesis levels that were equivalent to the levels in the absence of TALE. Our results demonstrate that DNA recognition by TALE can regulate the expression of the T7 promoter system.</dc:description>

      <title>Revision of the Cyclisation Mechanism for the Diterpene Spiroviolene and Investigations on its Mass Spectrometric Fragmentation</title>
      <dc:description>The diterpene spiroviolene, its diterpene synthase from  Streptomyces violens  and the experimentally determined terpene cyclisation mechanism were reported in 2017.

      <title>Heterologous expression of an unusual ketosynthase, SxtA, leads to production of saxitoxin intermediates in Escherichia coli</title>
      <dc:description>Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are neurotoxic alkaloids produced by freshwater cyanobacteria and marine dinoflagellates. Due to their antagonism of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in excitable cells, certain analogues are of significant pharmacological interest.

Here, we heterologously expressed SxtA from  Raphidiopsis raciborskii  T3 in  E. coli  and analyzed its activity  in vivo  . Ethyl ketone and a truncated analogue, methyl ketone, were detected by HPLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;HRMS analysis, suggesting that SxtA has relaxed substrate specificity  in vivo  . The chemical structures of these products were further verified by tandem mass spectrometry and labelled&#8208;precursor feeding with [guanidino&#8208;  15  N  2  ] arginine and [1,2&#8208;  13  C  2  ] acetate. These results indicate that the reactions catalyzed by SxtA could give rise to multiple PST variants, including analogues of ecological and pharmacological significance.</dc:description>

      <title>Why does the novel Coronavirus Spike Protein interact so strongly with the human ACE2? A thermodynamic answer.</title>
      <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic is the biggest health concern today, but until now there are no treatments. One possible drug target is the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from the Coronavirus&#8217; Spike Protein, which recognizes the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (hACE2).

      <title>Hydrogen Sulfide Oxidation by Sulfide Quinone Oxidoreductase</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) is an environmental toxin and a heritage of ancient microbial metabolism, which has stimulated new interest following its discovery as a neuromodulator. While many physiological responses have been attributed to low H  2  S levels, higher levels inhibit complex IV in the electron transport chain. To prevent respiratory poisoning, a dedicated set of enzymes comprising the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway exists to clear H  2  S. The committed step in this pathway is catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), which couples sulfide oxidation to coenzyme Q  10  reduction in the electron transport chain. The SQOR reaction prevents H  2  S accumulation and generates highly reactive persulfide species as products, which can be further oxidized or can modify cysteine residues in proteins via persulfidation. Here, we review the kinetic and structural characteristics of human SQOR, and how its unconventional redox cofactor configuration and substrate promiscuity lead to sulfide clearance and potentially expand the signaling potential of H  2  S. This dual role of SQOR makes it a promising target for H  2  S&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmed and Sequential Disassembly of Multi&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Protein Nanoassemblies: A Detailed Mechanistic Investigation</title>
      <dc:description>We report a novel chemical method for the construction of multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoassemblies using custom&#8208;designed facially amphiphilic monodisperse protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The macromolecular synthons contain a globular hydrophilic protein domain site&#8208;specifically conjugated to photo&#8208;responsive hydrophobic benzyl&#8208;ether dendron of different generations using oligoethylene glycol linkers of defined length. The size of the protein nanoassemblies can be systematically tuned by choosing an appropriate dendron or linker of defined length. Exposure of protein nanoassemblies to light results in partial disassembly of complex rather than complete disassembly. The newly formed protein nanoparticle no longer responds to light but could be disassembled into constitutive monomers at the acidic condition or further treatment with a small molecule. More interestingly, the distribution ratio of assembled versus disassembled states of protein nanoassemblies after photochemical reaction does not depend on the dendron generation or nature of linker functionality or the identity of the protein, but heavily influenced by choice of linker length. Altogether, this work discloses a new chemical method for the rational design of a monodisperse multi&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based supramolecular system with exquisite control over the disassembly process.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange of Selective PyFALGEA Oligopeptide Ligands Towards Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>The biorelevant selective PyFALGEA oligopeptide ligand towards epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is successfully employed as substrate in magnetic resonance signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) experiments. It is demonstrated that PyFALGEA and the iridium catalyst &#8208; IMes form a PyFALGEA:IMes molecular complex. The interaction between PyFALGEA:IMes and H  2  results in a ternary SABRE complex. Selective 1D EXSY experiments reveal that this complex is labile, which is an essential condition for successful hyperpolarization via SABRE. Polarization transfer from parahydrogen to PyFALGEA is observed leading to significant enhancement of the  1  H NMR signals of PyFALGEA. Different iridium catalysts and peptides are inspected to discuss the influence of their molecular structures on the efficiency of hyperpolarization. It is observed that the PyFALGEA oligopeptide hyperpolarization is more efficient when an iridium catalyst with a sterically less demanding NHC&#8208;ligand system such as IMesBn is employed. Experiments with shorter analogues of PyFALGEA i.e. PyLGEA and PyEA, show that the bulky phenylalanine from the PyFALGEA oligopeptide causes sterical hindrance in the SABRE complex, which hampers hyperpolarization with IMes. Finally, the single&#8208;scan  1  H NMR SABRE experiment of PyFALGEA with IMesBn revealed a unique pattern of NMR lines in the hydride region, which can be treated as a fingerprint of this important oligopeptide.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzymatic modification of cellulose to unlock its exploitation in advanced materials</title>
      <dc:description>Nowadays natural biopolymers have a wide variety of uses in various industrial applications, such as food, adhesives and composite materials. Among them, cellulose has attracted the interest of researchers due to its properties: high strength and flexibility, biocompatibility and non&#8208;toxicity. Despite that, in many cases its practical use is limited because of poor solubility and/or unsuitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In this context, enzymatic modification appears as a powerful strategy to overcome these problems through selective, green and environmentally friendly processes. This mini review discusses the different methods developed for the enzymatic modification of cellulose, emphasizing the type of reaction, the enzymes used (laccases, esterases, lipases, hexokinases, etc.), the properties and the applications of cellulose derivatives obtained. Considering that cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on the Earth and can be derived from residual lignocellulosic biomass, the impact of its use in biobased process following the logic of circular economy is relevant.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the Interaction between HIV&#8208;1 Protease and the Homodimeric p66/p66&#8242; Reverse Transcriptase Precursor by Double Electron&#8211;Electron Resonance EPR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase catalyzes the conversion of single&#8208;stranded viral RNA into proviral DNA prior to integration into the host genome. Reverse transcriptase is initially expressed as an asymmetric p66/p66&#8242; homodimer precursor. Cleavage of a single RNase&#8197;H domain in an open, accessible conformation by HIV&#8208;1 protease yields the mature p66/p51 heterodimer. DEER&#8208;derived probability distance distributions were used to directly probe the interaction of protease with the open state of the reverse transcriptase precursor.

      <title>17O NMR studies of yeast ubiquitin in aqueous solution and in the solid state</title>
      <dc:description>We report a general method for amino acid&#8208;type specific 17 O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. In particular, we have prepared several [1&#8208; 13 C, 17 O]&#8208;labeled yeast ubiquitin (Ub) samples including Ub&#8208;[1&#8208; 13 C, 17 O]Gly, Ub&#8208;[1&#8208; 13 C, 17 O]Tyr, and Ub&#8208;[1&#8208; 13 C, 17 O]Phe using the auxotrophic E. coli strain DL39 GlyA l DE3 ( asp C &#8211; tyr B &#8211; ilv E &#8211; gly A &#8211; l DE3). We have also produced Ub&#8208;[ h &#8208; 17 O]Tyr, where the phenolic group of Tyr59 is 17 O&#8208;labeled. We showed for the first time that 17 O NMR signals from protein terminal residues and sidechains can be readily detected in aqueous solution. We also reported solid&#8208;state 17 O NMR spectra for Ub&#8208;[1&#8208; 13 C, 17 O]Tyr and Ub&#8208;[1&#8208; 13 C, 17 O]Phe obtained at an ultrahigh magnetic field, 35.2 T (1.5 GHz for 1 H). This work represents a significant advance in the field of 17 O NMR studies of proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Activity&#8208;based protein profiling of chitin catabolism</title>
      <dc:description>Microbial catabolism of chitin, a highly abundant component of polymeric organic matter worldwide, is a fundamental cog in the carbon and nitrogen cycles that govern CO  2  emissions, nutrient dynamics in aquatic systems, and soil vitality. Despite this critical biogeochemical function, we have a poor understanding of the synergy between various microbial chitinases and key accessory enzymes involved in chitin catabolism. We designed and synthesized activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) for profiling active chitinolytic enzymes by modifying the chitin derivatives  N  &#8208;acetyl glucosamine and chitotriose. The ABPs were used to determine the active complement of chitinolytic enzymes produced over time by the soil bacterium  Cellvibrio japonicus  treated with various C substrates. This approach allowed us to demonstrate the utility of these ABPs in determining the intricate synergy between chitinases and other glycoside hydrolases that microbes employ to catabolize chitin. The strategy can be used to gain molecular level insights that can be used to better understand microbial roles in soil C and N cycling in the face of a changing climate.</dc:description>

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Suppressor p53TAD1&#8211;60 Forms a Fuzzy Complex with Metastasis&#8208;Associated S100A4: Structural Insights and Dynamics by an NMR/MD Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Structural and dynamic characterization of highly flexible protein complexes is a major challenge in structural biology. By a combined NMR spectroscopy and MD simulation approach, we studied the complex formed between the disordered p53TAD1&#8208;60 and the metastasis&#8208;associated S100A4. The results indicate that both subdomains of p53TAD1&#8208;60 undergo a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition, with three residues acting as anchor points attached to the binding pockets of S100A4, and a clamp&#8208;like fuzzy complex is formed. More information can be found in the full paper by A. Bodor et&#8197;al.

      <title>The effects of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU stereochemistry on its stability and MAIT&#8208;MR1 axis</title>
      <dc:description>Mucosal&#8208;associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant subset of innate&#8208;like T lymphocytes. MAIT cells are activated by microbial riboflavin&#8208;derived antigens, such as 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;6&#8208;D&#8208;ribitylaminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I&#8208;related protein (MR1). Herein we have synthesized all stereoisomers of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU to investigate the effects of its stereochemistry on the MR1&#8208;dependent MAIT cell activation and MR1 upregulation. The analysis of MAIT cell activation by these 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU isomers revealed that the stereocenters at the 2&#8217;&#8208; and 3&#8217;&#8208;OH groups in the ribityl tail are crucial for the recognition of MAIT&#8208;TCR, while that of 4&#8217;&#8208;OH group does not significantly affect the regulation of MAIT cell activity. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of complex formation between the ligands and MR1 suggested that 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU forms a covalent bond to MR1 in cells within 1 hour. These findings provide guidelines for designing ligands that regulate MAIT cell functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Assessment of tractable cysteines by covalent fragments screening</title>
      <dc:description>Targeted covalent inhibition and the use of irreversible chemical probes are important strategies in chemical biology and drug discovery. To date, the availability and reactivity of cysteine residues amenable for covalent targeting have been evaluated by proteomic and computational tools. Here, we present a toolbox of fragments containing a 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl core that was equipped with chemically diverse electrophilic warheads showing a range of reactivities. We characterized the library members for their reactivity, aqueous stability and specificity for nucleophilic amino acids. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we showed that this approach experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines.

      <title>Probing the secondary structure of individual A&#946;40 amorphous aggregates and fibrils by AFM&#8208;IR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Structural characterization of aggregates and fibrils of the A&#946; protein is pivotal to the molecular level elucidation of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). AFM&#8208;IR provides nanoscale resolution, and thus allows for spectroscopic interrogation of individual aggregates and fibrils. During aggregation of A&#946; we observed mainly disordered A&#946; at t=15 min, substantial structural diversity including co&#8208;existence of parallel and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets within a large amorphous aggregate at t=2 hours, while fibrils exhibited the expected signature of parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets at t=1 week. The resonance observed for parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets at t=2 hours coincides with that observed for fibrils (at 1634 cm&#8208;1), indicating that fibril&#8208;like species exist within the large aggregates. Thus, nucleation might occur within such species, in analogy to current theories of protein crystallization where nucleation occurs within large protein clusters. Cu2+ perturbs A&#946; aggregation, catalysing rapid formation of amorphous aggregates with diverse secondary structure, but inhibiting fibril growth.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulation of the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of nGO, MoS2and WS2&#160;nanozymes using metal cations</title>
      <dc:description>Two dimensional nanoparticles (2D&#8208;nps) along with other nanoscale materials have been deemed to be the next generation of artificial enzymes (nanozymes). The low&#8208;cost bulk&#8208;scale production, ease of storage and modification of the nanomaterials have given nanozymes an advantage over the traditional enzymes. Many studies have been aimed at developing methods to increase the performance of these nanozymes, and also identify interfering agents. In an effort towards investigating the interference of a number of metal cations, we studied the effect of Ti  2+  , Fe  2+  , Ag  +  , Hg  2+  , Co  2+  , Cu  2+  , Ni  2+  , Pb  2+  , Ca  2+  , Zn  2+&#160;  and Mn  2+  in a nanozyme assays of 2D&#8208;nps using ABTS radical formation. Ti  2+  , Co  2+  , Cu  2+  , Ni  2+  , Ca  2+  , Zn  2+&#160;  and Mn  2+  ions did not display any notable effect on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of nGO,MoS  2  and WS  2  2D&#8208;nps.

      <title>C&#8208;terminal tag location hampers in vitro profiling of OGT peptide substrates by mRNA display</title>
      <dc:description>O  &#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the post&#8208;translational modification of proteins at Ser/Thr with a single &#946;&#8208;  N  &#8208;acetylglucosamine (  O  &#8208;GlcNAcylation). Its activity has been associated with chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. While numerous OGT substrates have been identified, its accepted substrate scope can still be refined. We report here an attempt to better define the peptide recognition requirements of the OGT active site using mRNA display, taking advantage of its extremely high throughput to assess substrate potential of a library of all possible 9&#8208;mer peptides. An antibody&#8208;based selection process is described here that is able to enrich an OGT substrate peptide from such a library, but with poor absolute recovery. Following four rounds of selection for  O  &#8208;GlcNAcylated peptides, sequencing revealed fourteen peptides containing Ser/Thr but these were shown by luminescence&#8208;coupled assays and peptide microarray to not be OGT substrates. By contrast, subsequent testing of an N&#8208;terminal tag approach showed exemplary recovery. Our approach demonstrates the power of genetic encoded libraries for selection of peptide substrates, even from very low initial starting abundance and under sub&#8208;optimal conditions, and emphasizes the need to consider binding biases of antibodies and both  C  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;terminal tags in profiling peptide substrates by high&#8208;throughput display.</dc:description>

      <title>Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes: From Solution Chemistry to Analytical, Materials and Therapeutic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Since 1994, deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes were in vitro selected to catalyze various types of reactions. Metal ions play a critical role in DNAzyme catalysis, and among them Zn2+ is a very important one. Zn2+ has good biocompatibility and can be used for intracellular applications. Chemically, Zn2+ is a strong Lewis acid and it can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. Zn2+ undergoes hydrolysis even at neutral pH and the partially hydrolyzed polynuclear complexes can affect the interactions with DNA. These features have made Zn2+ a unique cofactor for DNAzyme reactions. This review summarizes Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes with an emphasis on RNA/DNA&#8208;cleaving reactions. A key feature is the sharp Zn2+ concentration and pH&#8208;dependent activity for many of the DNAzymes. The applications of these DNAzymes as biosensors for Zn2+, as therapeutic agents to cleave intracellular RNA and as chemical biology tools to manipulate DNA are discussed. Future studies can focus on the selection of new DNAzymes with improved performance and detailed biochemical characterizations to understand the role of Zn2+, which can facilitate practical applications of Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineered TALE Repeats for Enhanced Imaging&#8208;based Analysis

of Cellular 5&#8208;Methylcytosine</title>
      <dc:description>Transcription&#8208;activator&#8208;like effectors (TALEs) are repeat&#8208;based, programmable DNA binding proteins that can be engineered to recognize sequences of canonical and epigenetic nucleobases. Fluorescent TALEs can be utilized for the imaging&#8208;based analysis of cellular 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) in repetitive DNA sequences. This is based on recording fluorescence ratios from cell co&#8208;stains with two TALEs: an analytical TALE targeting the cytosine (C) position of interest via a C&#8208;selective repeat that is blocked by 5mC, and a control TALE targeting the position with a universal repeat that binds both C and 5mC. For an enhancement of this approach, we here report the development of novel 5mC&#8208;selective repeats and their integration into TALEs that can replace universal TALEs in imaging&#8208;based 5mC analysis, resulting in a methylation&#8208;dependent response of both TALEs. We screen a library of size&#8208;reduced repeats and identify several 5mC&#8208;binders. Compared to the 5mC binding repeat of natural TALEs and to the universal repeat, two repeats containing aromatic residues show enhancement of 5mC&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity in cellular transcription activation and electromobility shift assays, respectively. In co&#8208;stains of cellular SATIII DNA with a corresponding C&#8208;selective TALE, this selectivity results in positive methylation response of the new TALE, offering perspectives for studying 5mC functions in chromatin regulation by  in situ  imaging with increased dynamic range.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcription&#8208;activator&#8208;like effectors (TALEs) are repeat&#8208;based, programmable DNA binding proteins that can be engineered to recognize sequences of canonical and epigenetic nucleobases. Fluorescent TALEs can be utilized for the imaging&#8208;based analysis of cellular 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) in repetitive DNA sequences. This is based on recording fluorescence ratios from cell co&#8208;stains with two TALEs: an analytical TALE targeting the cytosine (C) position of interest via a C&#8208;selective repeat that is blocked by 5mC, and a control TALE targeting the position with a universal repeat that binds both C and 5mC. For an enhancement of this approach, we here report the development of novel 5mC&#8208;selective repeats and their integration into TALEs that can replace universal TALEs in imaging&#8208;based 5mC analysis, resulting in a methylation&#8208;dependent response of both TALEs. We screen a library of size&#8208;reduced repeats and identify several 5mC&#8208;binders. Compared to the 5mC binding repeat of natural TALEs and to the universal repeat, two repeats containing aromatic residues show enhancement of 5mC&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity in cellular transcription activation and electromobility shift assays, respectively. In co&#8208;stains of cellular SATIII DNA with a corresponding C&#8208;selective TALE, this selectivity results in positive methylation response of the new TALE, offering perspectives for studying 5mC functions in chromatin regulation by  in situ  imaging with increased dynamic range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>A method for producing 1,3&#8208;butadiene (1,3&#8208;BD) by an amalgamation of chemical and biological approach involving syngas as the carbon source is proposed here. Syngas is converted to the central intermediate, acetyl&#8208;CoA, through microorganisms having a tetrahydrofolate metabolism pathway.

      <dc:description>The magnified infectious power of the SARS&#8211;CoV&#8211;2 virus compared to its precursor SARS&#8211;CoV is intimately linked to an enhanced ability in the mutated virus to find available hydrogen bond sites in the host cells.

      <title>OCRE Domains of Splicing Factors RBM5 and RBM10: Tyrosine Ring Flip Frequencies by Integrated Use of 1H&#8208;NMR and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;  &#160;The 55&#8208;residue OCRE domains of the splicing factors RBM5 and RBM10 contain 15 tyrosines in compact, globular folds. At 25&#730;C all 15 tyrosines show symmetric  1  H&#8208;NMR spectra, with averaged signals for the pairs of &#948;&#8208; and &#949;&#8208;ring hydrogens.&#160; At 4&#730;C two tyrosines were identified as showing  1  H&#8208;NMR line&#8208;broadening due to lowered frequency of the ring&#8208;flipping.&#160; For the other 13 tyrosine rings it was thus left open, from the  1  H&#8208;NMR data alone, whether they were either all flipping at high frequencies, or whether slowed flipping went undetected due to small chemical shift differences between pairs of exchanging ring hydrogen atoms.&#160; Here, we integrate  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the tyrosine ring&#8208;flip frequencies. In the RBM10&#8208; OCRE domain we thus found for 11 of the 15 tyrosines that these frequencies are in the range from 2.0&#8729;10  6&#160;&#160;  to 1.3&#8729;10  8  s  &#8208;1  , and we established an upper limit of &lt; 1.0&#8729;10  6  s  &#8208;1  for the remaining four residues. The experimental data and the MD simulation are mutually supportive, and their combined use extends the analysis of aromatic ring&#8208;flip events beyond the limitations of routine  1  H&#8208;NMR line shape analysis into the nanosecond frequency range.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular basis of the antiangiogenic action of rosmarinic acid, a natural compound targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor&#8208;2/FGFR interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF2)/Fibroblast growth factor Receptor (FGFR) signalling plays a major role both in physiology and in several pathologies, including cancer development, metastasis formation and resistance to therapy. The development of small molecules, acting extracellularly to target FGF2/FGFR interactions, has the advantage of limiting adverse effects associated to the current intracellular FGFR inhibitors. Here we discuss the ability of the natural compound rosmarinic acid (RA) to induce FGF2/FGFR complex dissociation. The molecular level description of FGF2/FGFR/RA system, by NMR and docking, clearly demonstrates that RA binds to FGFR&#8208;D2 domain and directly competes with FGF2 for the same binding site. Both direct and allosteric perturbations concur to destabilize the complex. The proposed molecular mechanism is validated by cellular studies showing that RA inhibits FGF2&#8208;induced endothelial cells proliferation and FGFR activation. Our results can serve as the basis for the development of new extracellular inhibitors of the FGF/FGFR pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of apo&#8208;form selective inhibition of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase.</title>
      <dc:description>Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. As an inflammation&#8208;induced immunoregulatory enzyme, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 activity is currently being pursued as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer and other disease states. As such, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of established and novel IDO1 inhibitors remains of great interest. Comparison of a newly&#8208;developed IDO1 inhibitor (GSK5628) to the existing best&#8208;in&#8208;class compound, epacadostat (Incyte), allows us to report on a unique inhibition mechanism for IDO1. Here, we demonstrate that GSK5628 inhibits IDO1 by competing with heme for binding to a heme&#8208;free conformation of the enzyme (apo&#8208;IDO1) while epacadostat coordinates its binding with the iron atom of the IDO1 heme cofactor. Comparison of these two compounds in cellular systems reveals a long&#8208;lasting inhibitory effect of GSK5628, undescribed for other known IDO1 inhibitors. Detailed characterization of this apo&#8208;binding mechanism for IDO1 inhibition may help design superior inhibitors or may confer a unique competitive advantage over other IDO1 inhibitors vis&#8208;&#225;&#8208;vis specificity and pharmacokinetic parameters.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. As an inflammation&#8208;induced immunoregulatory enzyme, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 activity is currently being pursued as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer and other disease states. As such, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of established and novel IDO1 inhibitors remains of great interest. Comparison of a newly&#8208;developed IDO1 inhibitor (GSK5628) to the existing best&#8208;in&#8208;class compound, epacadostat (Incyte), allows us to report on a unique inhibition mechanism for IDO1. Here, we demonstrate that GSK5628 inhibits IDO1 by competing with heme for binding to a heme&#8208;free conformation of the enzyme (apo&#8208;IDO1) while epacadostat coordinates its binding with the iron atom of the IDO1 heme cofactor. Comparison of these two compounds in cellular systems reveals a long&#8208;lasting inhibitory effect of GSK5628, undescribed for other known IDO1 inhibitors. Detailed characterization of this apo&#8208;binding mechanism for IDO1 inhibition may help design superior inhibitors or may confer a unique competitive advantage over other IDO1 inhibitors vis&#8208;&#225;&#8208;vis specificity and pharmacokinetic parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Activation of Protease and Luciferase Using Engineered Nostoc Punctiforme PCC73102 DnaE Intein with Altered Split Position</title>
      <dc:description>Inteins, a self&#8208;catalytic enzyme, have been widely used in the field of protein engineering and chemical biology. Here,  Nostoc punctiforme  PCC73102 (  Npu  ) DnaE intein was engineered to have an altered split position. An eleven residue N&#8208;intein of DnaE in which Gly and Asp were substituted for Tyr and Glu at positions 4 and 5, respectively, was designed, and the active C&#8208;intein variants were acquired by a GFP fluorescence&#8208;based screening. The designed N&#8208;intein and the obtained active C&#8208;intein variants were used to construct a turn&#8208;on system for the enzyme activities such as human immunodeficiency 1 protease and NanoLuc luciferase. Based on the NanoLuc&#8208;intein fusion, we developed two intein pairs, each of which is capable of reacting preferentially, by interchanging the charged amino acids upon N&#8208; and C&#8208;inteins. The specific splicing reactions were easily monitored and discriminated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique.</dc:description>

      <title>Fc&#8208;binding antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen:&#160;defucosylation of antibody for efficacy improvement</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic small molecules that redirect endogenous antibodies to target cells are promising drug candidates because they overcome the potential shortcomings of therapeutic antibodies, such as immunogenicity&#160;and the need for intravenous delivery. Previously, we reported a novel class of bispecific molecules targeting the antibody Fc region and folate receptor, named Fc&#8208;binding antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (Fc&#8208;ARMs). Fc&#8208;ARMs can theoretically recruit most endogenous antibodies, inducing cancer cell elimination via antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Here, we describe new Fc&#8208;ARMs that target prostate cancer (Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;Ps). Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;Ps recruited antibodies to cancer cells expressing&#160;prostate&#8208;specific membraneantigen but did so with lower efficiency compared with Fc&#8208;ARMs targeting folate receptor. Upon recruitment by Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;P, defucosylated antibodies efficiently activated natural killer cells and induced ADCC, whereas antibodies with intact N&#8208;glycans did not. The results suggest that the affinity between recruited antibodies and CD16a, a type of Fc receptor expressed on immune cells, could be a key factor controlling immune activation in the Fc&#8208;ARM strategy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Penicillin&#8208;binding proteins (PBPs) are a family of bacterial enzymes that are key components of cell wall biosynthesis and the target of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. Most microbial pathogens contain multiple structurally homologous PBP isoforms, making it difficult to target individual PBPs.

      <title>Synthetic Antibody Mimics Based on Cancer&#8208;Targeting Immunostimulatory Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>De novo cancer&#8208;targeting immunostimulatory peptides have been designed and developed as synthetic antibody mimics.&#160; A selected trimeric peptide displayed binding on GRP78  +  HepG2 and A549 target cells with some degree of GRP78&#8208;binding dependence. Similarly, the selected trimeric peptide was also found to exhibit NK cell binding in an NKp30&#8208;dependent manner which translated into NK cell activation as indicated by cytokine secretion. In co&#8208;culture, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the target GFP&#8208;expressing A549 cells were visibly associated to the effector NK cells when pre&#8208;activated with lead trimeric peptide. Accordingly, A549 cells were found to be compromised as evidenced by the loss of GFP signal and notable detection of early/late stage apoptosis. Investigation of immunological markers related to toxicity revealed detectable secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IFN&#8208;&#947;, TNF&#8208;&#945; and IL&#8208;8. Furthermore, administration of peptide&#8208;activated NK cells into A549&#8208;tumor bearing mice resulted in a consistent decrease in tumor growth when compared to the untreated control group. Taken together, the identification of a lead trimeric peptide capable of targeting and activating NK cells&#8217; immunotoxicity directly towards GRP78  +  /B7H6  &#8208;  tumors provides a novel proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the development of cancer&#8208;targeting immunostimulatory peptide ligands that mimic antibody targeting and activating functions related to cancer immunotherapy applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Proteomics for Expanding the Druggability of Human Disease</title>
      <dc:description>
Interacting with interactions: Chemical proteomics has taken shape as a powerful technique that seeks to understand small&#8208;molecule and protein function in the physiological system. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) technology with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome.







Abstract
Abstract. Over the past decade, chemical proteomics has emerged as a powerful technique to understand small molecule and protein function in the physiological system and plays a key role in unravelling the cellular targets of pharmacological modulators. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome. A much larger fraction of the human proteome can now be targeted by small molecules than estimated by past predictions of protein druggability.

      <title>A DAPI&#8208;Based Reagent for Mass Cytometry</title>
      <dc:description>Multiparametric single cell analysis has seen dramatic improvements with the introduction of Mass Cytometry (MC) and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC&#8482;). These technologies expanded the number of biomarkers that can be identified simultaneously by using heavy isotope&#8208;tagged antibody reagents. Small molecule probes bearing heavy isotopes are emerging as additional useful functional reporters of cellular features. Realizing this, we explored the iodination of DAPI to produce a heavy atom substituted derivative of the commonly used fluorescent DNA stain. Although exhibiting a drastically reduced fluorescence emission profile, I&#8208;DAPI retains strong binding affinity for DNA. I&#8208;DAPI was used to detect cellular DNA in MC and IMC&#8482; assays with comparable efficiency to known Ir containing DNA intercalators. This work suggests repurposing of well&#8208;known colorimetric stains through simple reactions could be an effective strategy to develop new, functional MC and IMC&#8482; reagents.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiparametric single cell analysis has seen dramatic improvements with the introduction of Mass Cytometry (MC) and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC&#8482;). These technologies expanded the number of biomarkers that can be identified simultaneously by using heavy isotope&#8208;tagged antibody reagents. Small molecule probes bearing heavy isotopes are emerging as additional useful functional reporters of cellular features. Realizing this, we explored the iodination of DAPI to produce a heavy atom substituted derivative of the commonly used fluorescent DNA stain. Although exhibiting a drastically reduced fluorescence emission profile, I&#8208;DAPI retains strong binding affinity for DNA. I&#8208;DAPI was used to detect cellular DNA in MC and IMC&#8482; assays with comparable efficiency to known Ir containing DNA intercalators. This work suggests repurposing of well&#8208;known colorimetric stains through simple reactions could be an effective strategy to develop new, functional MC and IMC&#8482; reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Short RNA Universal Coding for Topological Transformation Nanobarcoding Application</title>
      <dc:description>With the advent of innovative genomic discovery toolkits such as RT&#8208;PCR, genetic information can be quickly decrypted, which has resulted in significant progress in overcoming diseases. However, RT&#8208;PCR has the serious problem of frequent errors, and the demand for a new gene diagnostic system is emerging. Here, we propose a universal coding system for effective detection of short single stranded DNA or RNA using a Topological transformation&#8208;based Nanobarcoding Technique (TNT). Our goal was to develop a dedicated diagnostic device which unifies the other gene groups resulting in minimum testing. In a universal coding system consisting of two separate circulation structures, different gene groups  become generalized into specific single genes with the same sequence via the strand displacement reaction and are then amplified, eventually being quickly detected in one TNT system. Simple gene diagnostic systems like this are high&#8208;speed and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic technologies, and we are very confident that these will provide clinical gene detection in the near future.</dc:description>

      <title>Developments in mannose&#8208;based treatments for Uropathogenic Escherichia coli induced urinary tract infections</title>
      <dc:description>During their lifetime almost half of women will experience a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) with a further half experiencing a relapse within six months.&#160;&#160;Currently UTIs are treated with antibiotics, but increasing antibiotic resistance rates highlight the need for new treatments. Uropathogenic&#160; Escherichia coli &#160;(UPEC) is responsible for the majority of symptomatic UTI cases and thus has become a key pathological target. Adhesion of type one pilus subunit FimH at the surface of UPEC strains to mannose&#8208;saturated oligosaccharides located on the urothelium is critical to&#160;&#160;pathogenesis. Since the identification of FimH as a therapeutic target in the late 1980s, a substantial body of research has been generated focusing on the development of FimH&#8208;targeting mannose&#8208;based anti&#8208;adhesion therapies. In this review we will discuss the design of different classes of these mannose&#8208;based compounds and their utility and potential as UPEC therapeutics.</dc:description>
