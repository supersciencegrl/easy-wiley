         <title>Engineering Gizmos for Short Cancer Genetic Fragments Discrimination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, mankind is fiercely struggling with cancer. Recently, we have been winning the battle against cancer through precision medicine and accompanying diagnostic methods, and we are raising many hopes with blockbuster drugs. It would be even better if we could read the cancer nucleotide sequence, identify them in advance, and suggest treatments simultaneously. However, this may be an impossible dream because it takes a lot of time and effort to diagnose and ensure all the long gene sequences of cancer at once. Thus, victory will be even closer if a rapid and accurate diagnosis of the cancer&#8208;specific gene biomarkers that will soon be imprinted can be made. With the advent of nanotechnology, a new short cancer diagnostic toolkit has been proposed to achieve the goal. This review presents a small diagnostic device that detects genetic fragments (simply &#8216;Gizmo&#8217;) of certain cancers. The development of numerous diagnostic methods has focused on (1) directly detecting pre&#8208;selectively targeted genes using novel diagnostic systems, and (2) indirectly detecting substantial improvements in diagnostic sensitivity only through detection signal amplification without existing gene amplification steps. Our fight against cancer is not a dream, but the result of success, and it is assumed that victory will accelerate.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalently Mercurated 6&#8208;Phenylcarbazole Residues Promote Hybridization of Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homothymidine DNA oligonucleotides bearing a 3&#180;&#8208;terminal 6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole C&#8208;nucleoside, mercurated at position 1, 8 or both, were synthesized and tested for their potential to form triple helices with homoadenine&#183;homothymine duplexes. The monomercurated triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides favored hybridization with fully matched double helices and in some cases considerable increase of the melting temperature could be attributed to Hoogsteen&#8208;type Hg(II)&#8208;mediated interaction with the homoadenine strand. The dimercurated one, on the other hand, favored hybridization with double helices placing a homo mispair opposite to the carbazole residue, suggesting that simultaneous coordination of each of the two Hg(II) ions to a different strand is only possible in the absence of competition from Watson&#8212;Crick base pairing.</dc:description>

         <title>A viscoelastic supramolecular hydrogel co&#8208;assembled from gatifloxacin and deoxyguanosine for the treatment of bacterial keratitis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial keratitis is the most prevalent ocular surface infection, causing significant inconvenience to patients&#8217; lives and posing a risk of blindness if mismanaged. The application of antibiotic gels has been a principal clinic therapeutic intervention due to the retarded ocular surface medication retention. However, current clinical gel formulations rely on high viscosity polymer matrices to improve retention, which often results in uneven gel layers, causing sticky sensation and prone to adhesion to periocular tissues during blinking, leading to clearance. In this study, we propose a supramolecular hydrogel assembled from antibiotic and natural nucleotide molecules with viscoelastic rheology and low cohesion texture. These features enabled it spread uniformly on the ocular surface, recover deformation after blinking, and are less likely to adhere to periocular tissues, significantly improving drug retention on the ocular surface and achieving better therapeutic effects in the treatment of bacterial keratitis. Additionally, the hydrogel is easy to prepare, has good visibility and safety, offering a new strategy for the development of ophthalmic gels.</dc:description>

         <title>A Powerful Organic Photosensitizer for Effective Treatment of Malignant Tumors Via Activating Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizer ThC enhances antitumor photodynamic therapy by efficiently inducing immunogenic cell death, transforming immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, and activating adaptive immunity. In vivo studies highlight its superior tumor eradication efficacy and excellent biocompatibility, establishing ThC as a promising candidate for antitumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an innovative approach in cancer treatment, effectively inducing tumor cell death through light&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Additionally, PDT can also trigger antitumor immune responses, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative tumor recurrence. However, the development of highly efficient photosensitizers aimed at activating immune responses for comprehensive tumor eradication remains at an early stage. In this study, we developed a new organic photosensitizer, ThC, which exhibits excellent mitochondrial&#8208;targeting effect and significantly enhanced ROS production compared to traditional photosensitizers, such as Chlorin e6 (Ce6). Our findings demonstrate that ThC robustly induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) process in hepatic cancer cells, which could effectively transform immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors. Through in&#8197;situ injection and subsequent white light irradiation, ThC achieved superior efficacy in eliminating subcutaneous hepatic tumors. Immunological analyses revealed that ThC treatment led to elevated levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, along with a reduction in immunosuppressive cell populations (Tregs and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages) within the tumor microenvironment. This study provides a novel therapeutic agent with significant potential for clinical translation for the treatment of malignant tumors.

         <title>Radical Strategy Towards N&#8208;glycosides: Current Advances and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress in radical&#8208;based N&#8208;glycosylation, offering a comprehensive overview of its mechanisms and advantages over traditional acid&#8208;promoted methods. The current limitation and future directions for radical&#8208;mediated N&#8208;glycosylation are also discussed.







Abstract
N&#8208;glycosides exhibit diverse biological and pharmacological activities, making their efficient synthesis crucial for both biological research and drug development. Traditional acid&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation methods, which rely on the formation of oxocarbenium intermediates, often face significant challenges. These methods are water&#8208;sensitive and typically require neighboring group participation to achieve high selectivity. Furthermore, they depend on acid activation, rendering them incompatible with alkyl amine. Additionally, low&#8208;nucleophilicity amides often need to be converted into their TMS&#8208;derivatives to enhance reactivity, limiting the direct use of such substrates. In contrast, radical&#8208;based strategies have emerged as a promising alternative, addressing many of these limitations and leading to notable advances in N&#8208;glycosylation. This review explores the unique properties of N&#8208;glycosides, the inherent challenges of traditional N&#8208;glycosylation techniques, and the transformative advantages offered by radical&#8208;based approaches. Specifically, it highlights recent advancements in radical&#8208;mediated N&#8208;glycosylation, including photoredox radical strategies, radical/ionic hybrid approaches, and metallaphotoredox catalysis, accompanied by a detailed discussion of the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the ongoing challenges and potential future directions of N&#8208;glycoside synthesis using radical strategies are presented.

         <title>Review on the o&#8208;Aminoaniline Moiety in Peptide and Protein Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to prepare functional peptides and protein molecules is essential to understand fundamental biological processes and develop novel therapeutics for numerous diseases. In this review, Hong et&#8197;al. document the development of o&#8208;aminoaniline derivatives for chemical protein synthesis, peptide C&#8208;terminus diversification, and cyclic peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Peptides and proteins are important functional biomolecules both inside and outside of living organisms. The ability to prepare various types of functionalized peptides and proteins is essential for understanding fundamental biological processes, such as protein folding and post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), and for developing new therapeutics for many diseases, such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. The o&#8208;aminoaniline moiety was first proposed for activation to a thioester precursor and used for native chemical ligation to prepare large peptides and proteins. In the past decade, the function of o&#8208;aminoaniline has been greatly expanded to facilitate the preparation of homogeneously modified peptide and protein samples, where the modifications can include cyclization, C&#8208;terminus diversification, etc. Many o&#8208;aminoaniline derivatives have also been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of previous versions.

     alt="Review on the o-Aminoaniline Moiety in Peptide and Protein Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to prepare functional peptides and protein molecules is essential to understand fundamental biological processes and develop novel therapeutics for numerous diseases. In this review, Hong et&#8197;al. document the development of o-aminoaniline derivatives for chemical protein synthesis, peptide C-terminus diversification, and cyclic peptide synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptides and proteins are important functional biomolecules both inside and outside of living organisms. The ability to prepare various types of functionalized peptides and proteins is essential for understanding fundamental biological processes, such as protein folding and post-translational modifications (PTMs), and for developing new therapeutics for many diseases, such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. The o-aminoaniline moiety was first proposed for activation to a thioester precursor and used for native chemical ligation to prepare large peptides and proteins. In the past decade, the function of o-aminoaniline has been greatly expanded to facilitate the preparation of homogeneously modified peptide and protein samples, where the modifications can include cyclization, C-terminus diversification, etc. Many o-aminoaniline derivatives have also been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of previous versions. In this review, we attempt to summarize the recent developments of different o-aminoaniline derivatives, focusing on their application to the preparation of functional peptide and protein molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanides Gd and Tm Can Inhibit Carnitine/Acylcarnitine Transporter: Insights from All&#8208;Atoms Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent experimental evidence highlighted the inhibition of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC),an important mitochondrial transmembrane protein for living organisms,by the early lanthanide Pr3+.An explanation of such behaviour was found in the preference of the cation for aminoacids like aspartate and glutamate containing a carboxylate in the sidechain,laying in the inter&#8208;membrane space.Interaction of the cation with these residues can cause halt the transfer of the protein's substrates between the matrix and cytoplasm thus opening to new scenarios concerning the CAC&#8208;metal interactions and its relative inhibition.In the present work,the panel of metals binding the CAC protein is predictively expanded including Gd3+ and Tm3+,selected as representative species of middle and late lanthanides,respectively.A more realistic membrane&#8208;containing model of the protein was built and the comparative analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CAC apo&#8208;form with its complexed systems,named CAC&#8208;Pr,CAC&#8208;Gd and CAC&#8208;Tm,was performed.The analysis of the trajectories revealed that the inhibition is caused by the coordination of D132 and E179 to the cations and that such interactions generate a reorganization of important salt&#8208;bridges inside the framework of CAC.In detail,MD simulations highlighted that a spontaneous conformational change from cytoplasmatic&#8208;state (c&#8208;state) to matrix&#8208;state (m&#8208;state) induced by cations and that,in this condition,the protein channel is occluded,thus explaining the inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Laccase Functional Analysis: Substrates, Activity Assays, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme functional analysis is crucial for evaluating enzyme performance. However, even well&#8208;known enzymes, such as laccase, face challenges with substrates and methods for activity assays. The review examines both commonly and less&#8208;utilized compounds, as well as their associated techniques, methods, and approaches. The review highlights potential strategies to overcome identified gaps.







Abstract
Enzyme functional analysis is a multifaceted process that can be used for various purposes, such as screening for specific activities, as well as developing, optimising, and validating processes or final products. Functional analysis methods are crucial for assessing enzyme performance and catalytic properties. Laccase, a well&#8208;known blue multi&#8208;copper oxidase, holds immense potential in diverse industries such as pharmaceuticals, paper and pulp, food and beverages, textiles, and biorefineries due to its clean oxidation process and versatility in handling a wide range of substrates. Despite its prominence, the use of laccase encounters challenges in selecting appropriate functional analysis substrates and methods. This review delves into the substrates utilised in qualitative and quantitative techniques for laccase activity analysis. Although laccase catalyses mono&#8208;electron oxidation of aromatic hydroxyl, amine, and thiol compounds efficiently, using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor, the review identifies limitations in the specificity of the commonly employed substrates, concerns regarding the stability of certain compounds and highlights potential strategies.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Trapping and Hydroperoxide&#8208;Decomposing Benzoselenazole Antioxidants with Potential Biological Applications against Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of variety of phenolic benzoselenazoles has been described. Phenolic benzoselenazoles with para&#8208;substitution were synthesized from diselenides and aldehydes using acetic acid as a catalyst. All compounds have been tested for glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like antioxidant activity in thiophenol assay. Radical&#8208;trapping antioxidant (RTA) activity of benzoselenazoles towards ROO&#8226; radicals has been studied for the inhibition of autoxidation of cumene in chlorobenzene from the O2&#8208;consumption during the inhibited period. The compound 13c found to inhibit azo&#8208;initiated oxidation of cumene with a stoichiometric factor (n) &#8771; 2.2. This study has also suggested some insights into the substitution&#8208;dependent activity of anilides over phenols as effective radical&#8208;trapping antioxidants. Moreover, the zone of inhibition study corroborated the antimicrobial potential of the synthesized antioxidants against Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Anti&#8208;biofilm activities were portrayed against the production of biofilms by B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa. MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231cell&#160;line was selected for triple&#8208;negative breast carcinoma for in vitro cytotoxicity of all antioxidants using the MTT assay. Moreover, the interaction patterns of antioxidants with target proteins of B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa were demonstrated using&#160;molecular docking study. Molecular dynamics simulations were deployed to&#160;investigate the structural dynamics and the stability of the complex.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment, using high&#8208;energy radiation to induce DNA damage in tumor cells, leading to cell death. However, its efficacy is often hindered by challenges such as radiation resistance and side effects. As a powerful class of functional molecules, nucleic acid drugs (NADs) present a promising solution to these limitations. Engineered to target key pathways like DNA repair and tumor hypoxia, NADs can enhance radiotherapy sensitivity. NADs can also serve as delivery vehicles for radiotherapy agents such as radionuclides, improving targeting accuracy and minimizing side effects. This review explores the role of NADs in optimizing radiotherapy, highlighting their mechanisms, clinical applications, and synergies with radiotherapy, ultimately offering a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Modification of Lysine Mitigates Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the role of free amino acids in modulating the process of amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregation, focusing on positively charged amino acids such as lysine. Our study showed that unmodified lysine had a dose&#8208;dependent interaction with amyloid&#8208;&#946;, altering oligomerization and fibril formation and found that charge distribution plays a critical role in modulating A&#946; aggregation.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides, which aggregate into toxic structures such as oligomers, fibrils, and plaques. The presence of these A&#946; aggregates in the brain plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Understanding how physiological factors affect A&#946; aggregation is essential, and therefore, exploring their influence in&#8197;vitro will likely provide insights into their role in AD pathology. In this study, we investigated the effects of physiological, free amino acids on A&#946; aggregation dynamics. We focused on positively charged amino acids, particularly lysine, and employed a chemical modification, methylation, to neutralize its charge. Our analyses revealed that modified lysine significantly reduced A&#946; aggregation, indicating that charge distribution of amino acids plays a crucial role in modulating A&#946; aggregation behavior. These findings enhance our understanding of the regulatory factors influencing A&#946; aggregation and highlight important considerations for future research on A&#946;.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Palmitic Acid&#8208;modified Thymopentin Functions as a Delivery System of Nanovaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TP&#8208;5 lipopeptide nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with OVA antigens were obtained by ultrasonic preparation based on the principle of charge interaction. Toll&#8208;like receptors (TLR) on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) recognized and phagocytosed the nanovaccine OVA/R1P4 NPs. Subsequently, TLR activation promoted the maturation of DCs and presentation of antigens to CD8+ T cells, which facilitated the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor site and secreted IFN&#8208;&#947; to directly kill the tumor cells, exerting anti&#8208;tumor immune effects.

Abstract
In clinical practice, thymopentin (TP&#8208;5) is a commonly utilized immunomodulatory peptide drug. The relatively short half&#8208;life of TP&#8208;5, however, significantly limits its applicability in immunotherapy. Inspired by the structure of the TLR2 ligand lipopeptide Pam3CSK4, fatty acid&#8208;modified TP&#8208;5 peptides were designed and synthesized in this study. Utilizing its amphiphilicity, they were sonicated to assemble into nanoparticles with the diameters of approximately 100&#8197;nm. Compared with TP&#8208;5, TP&#8208;5 monopalmitate&#8208;modified nanoparticle has immune&#8208;activating properties both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. It markedly increased TNF&#8208;&#945; secretion from RAW264.7 cells and aided in the maturation of DCs. The immunogenicity of OVA model antigen was increased in&#8197;vivo when capsulated by TP&#8208;5 lipopeptide nanoparticle, which considerably slowed the growth of B16&#8208;OVA melanoma. This fatty acid&#8208;modified TP&#8208;5 assembled nanoparticle offers a straightforward and useful delivery system for the design of innovative nanovaccine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Structural Insights into Broad&#8208;Range Polyphosphate Kinase 2&#8208;II Enzymes Applicable for Pyrimidine Nucleoside Diphosphate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first substrate&#8208;bound structures of polyphosphate kinase 2&#8208;II (PPK2&#8208;II) enzymes, offering insights into nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) synthesis. BcPPK2 (Bacillus cereus) and LfPPK2 (Lysinibacillus fusiformis) show a broad substrate range, and reach conversion rates of 85&#8201;% for the selective pyrimidine NDP synthesis. Five crystal structures, including complexes with AMP, ADP, and TMP, highlight novel interactions for future enzyme engineering and applications in biotechnology.







Abstract
Polyphosphate kinases (PPK) play crucial roles in various biological processes, including energy storage and stress responses, through their interaction with inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) and the intracellular nucleotide pool. Members of the PPK family&#8197;2 (PPK2s) catalyse polyP&#8211;consuming phosphorylation of nucleotides. In this study, we characterised two PPK2 enzymes from Bacillus cereus (BcPPK2) and Lysinibacillus fusiformis (LfPPK2) to investigate their substrate specificity and potential for selective nucleotide synthesis. Both enzymes exhibited a broad substrate scope, selectively converting over 85&#8201;% of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) to nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs), while nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) formation was observed only with purine NMPs. Preparative enzymatic synthesis of cytidine diphosphate (CDP) was applied to achieve an yield of 49&#8201;%. Finally, structural analysis of five crystal structures of BcPPK2 and LfPPK2 provided insights into their active sites and substrate interactions. This study highlights PPK2&#8208;II enzymes as promising biocatalysts for the efficient and selective synthesis of pyrimidine NDPs.

         <title>Cleavage of structured RNAs is accelerated by high affinity DNAzyme agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzymes (Dz) have been suggested as sequence&#8208;specific agents for cleaving RNA for therapeutic purposes. This concept paper discusses the challenges of Dz 10&#8208;23 in cleaving folded RNA substrates. Dz with traditionally designed RNA binding arms (Tm ~ 37oC) have low affinity to the folded RNA substrates, which limits the overall cleavage rate. The RNA cleavage can be facilitated using Dz with high&#8208;affinity arms. However, this strategy is efficient only for cleaving RNA into folded RNA products. The unfolded products inhibit multiple substrate turnover. In a more general approach, Dz should be equipped with additional RNA binding arms to achieve tight RNA binding. This can be accomplished by bivalent and multivalent Dz constructs that have multiple catalytic cores. In all cases, high selectivity toward single nucleotide variations can be achieved in addition to multiple turnovers. The presence of RNase H stabilizes the Dz:RNA complex and reduces its selectivity but significantly increases RNA cleavage efficiency. This work proposes changes in the algorithms of Dz design, which can help in constructing potent Dz agents for RNA inhibition both in cell cultures and in vivo. The concept article is supplemented with a quiz testing knowledge of the main concepts used in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomerization of STING and Chemical Regulatory Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a crucial role in innate immunity. Upon the recognition of cytosolic dsDNA, STING undergoes several structural changes, with oligomerization playing a key role in initiating a cascade of immune responses. Therefore, controlling the STING pathway by manipulating STING oligomerization is a practical strategy. This review focuses on the detailed mechanism of STING oligomerization, highlighting its decisive role. It also describes oligomerization&#8208;based strategies to regulate STING protein, such as the use of small&#8208;molecule agonists and biomacromolecules, highlighting their interaction modes and potential therapeutic applications. This knowledge may lead to the development of innovative approaches for treating cancer and immune disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Profiling of Olaparib Interactors Using a Biotinylated Photoaffinity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olaparib is a widely used PARP inhibitor for the treatment of BRCA&#8208;mutated cancers. To comprehensively understand the drug's clinical impact, measuring its interactions with intended on&#8208; and off&#8208;targets is crucial. In this study, olaparib's on&#8208; and off&#8208;targets were profiled using photoaffinity labeling, a powerful, proteome&#8208;wide method for studying the direct interactions between a drug and its protein targets. A novel photoaffinity probe was designed and used in a proteomic screening to discover novel targets of olaparib in the human proteome. The probe, incorporating a pre&#8208;installed biotin group, bypasses the limitations of using a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed click reaction in cell lysates for reporter group conjugation and revealed a broad range of olaparib interactors, including previously unreported proteins, in a quantitative mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomic screening using HeLa whole cell lysate. This study contributes to our current understanding of the pharmacology of olaparib and provides a valuable tool for elucidating drug interactors within cell lysates, potentially guiding the development of more targeted therapeutics with fewer off&#8208;targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an Environmentally Responsive Fluorescent Ligand for Vitamin D Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized a novel fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time observation of ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes in the vitamin&#8197;D receptor (VDR). Incorporating a dansyl fluorophore at the C11 position of 1&#945;,25(OH)&#8322;D&#8323;, the probe exhibits turn&#8208;on fluorescence with intensity and wavelength shifts upon VDR binding, reflecting its environmentally responsive properties.







Abstract
Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a critical role in regulating multiple biological processes, including bone metabolism and cell differentiation, by mediating transcriptional activation in response to ligand binding. We have constructed an environmentally fluorescent probe 2 for VDR to facilitate real&#8208;time observation of its ligand&#8208;dependent conformational changes in living cells. This probe 2 was synthesized by introducing a dansyl fluorophore via an ethynyl group at the C11 position of 1&#945;,25(OH)&#8322;D&#8323;. Probe 2 exhibited strong environmentally responsive fluorescence, showing increased intensity and a blue shift of the peak wavelength upon binding to VDR due to the increased hydrophobicity of the environment.

         <title>Expanding the Enzymatic Toolbox for Carboligation: Increasing the Diversity of the &#8216;Split&#8217; Transketolase Sequence Space</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transketolases (TKs) are thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two&#8208;carbon units in a stereoselective manner, making them valuable biocatalysts for sustainable processes. Most known TKs are about 650 amino acids long; however, a second type found in Archaea and many Bacteria consists of two proteins, each of about 300 amino acids. Exploring the unique features and differences of split TKs may help in assessing their potential use in biocatalysis and for uncovering new reactivities. Additionally, it could provide valuable information on how their structure relates to their function, especially compared to full&#8208;length TKs. In this study, we significantly expanded the known repertoire of split TKs approximately 14&#8208;fold to the best of our knowledge, by identifying and providing accessions of nearly 500 putative split&#8208;TK subunit pairs. Moreover, we doubled the number of experimentally produced and tested split TKs by cloning, purifying, and testing ten candidates retrieved from genomes and in&#8208;house metagenomes. Interestingly, pQR2809 and pQR2812, derived from hyperthermophilic organisms, showed enhanced thermostability compared to other TK examples in the literature, maintaining partial activity after heating at 90 &#176;C or 100 &#176;C for 1 hour, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Immobilizing Fluorogenic Probe for In Situ Labeling of Granzyme B Activity in Host Immune Response to Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized three granzyme B&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe HCy&#8208;F exhibits in&#8197;situ imaging capabilities, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This advancement provides a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, represent a pressing global health challenge. During the interaction between pathogen infection and host defense, bacterial infections initiate the host's immune response, which involves the activation of proteases that play a critical role in antibacterial defense. Granzyme B (GzmB), a key immune&#8208;related biomarker associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), plays a pivotal role in this process. Therefore, detecting the activity of GzmB is crucial for understanding the host immune response to bacterial infections and for developing therapeutic strategies to overcome bacterial virulence. In this study, we designed and synthesized three granzyme B&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe HCy&#8208;F demonstrates in&#8197;situ imaging capability, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This development offers a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>The Biarylitides: Understanding the Structure and Biosynthesis of a Fascinating Class of Cytochrome P450 Modified RiPP Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biarylitides are fascinating RiPP natural products with small core peptides and diverse peptide crosslinks performed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Here, we address the discovery and diversity of the biarylitides, methods to analyse these constrained cyclic peptides, the structures of the biarylitide P450 enzymes and address alternate catalytic outcomes as recently seen in rufomycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The biarylitides are a recently discovered class of RiPP natural products that are fascinating both from the small size of the core peptides as well as the diversity of peptide crosslinking exhibited by the cytochrome P450 enzymes found in these systems. In this review, we address the discovery and biosynthetic diversity of these systems and discuss the methods and challenges of analysing the structures of these constrained cyclic peptides. We also discuss the structures of the P450 enzymes involved in these pathways and address the potential for alternate catalytic outcomes and activities as seen most recently with the inclusion of biarylitide related enzymes within rufomycin biosynthesis.

         <title>Conformational Selection in Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Depolymerization of Bio&#8208;based Polyesters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significance of conformational selection in enzymatic degradation of biopolymers is demonstrated for a series of terpene&#8208;derived polyesters. A fundamental 1D&#8208;geometric parameter with respect to whether the polymer chain is straight or twisted impacts biocatalytic depolymerization by influencing the polymer's affinity to enzyme ground state conformers. Two representative enzyme residues in PETase are shown in blue and magenta.







Abstract
Enzymatic degradation of polymers holds promise for advancing towards a bio&#8208;based economy. However, the bulky nature of polymers presents challenges in accessibility for biocatalysts, hindering depolymerization reactions. Beyond the impact of crystallinity, polymer chains can reside in different conformations affecting binding efficiency to the enzyme active site. We previously showed that the gauche and trans chain conformers associated with crystalline and amorphous regions of the synthetic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) display different affinity to PETase, thus affecting the depolymerization rate. However, structural&#8208;function relationships for biopolymers remain poorly understood in biocatalysis. In this study, we explored the biodegradation of previously synthesized bio&#8208;polyesters made from a rigid bicyclic chiral terpene&#8208;based diol and copolymerized with various renewable diesters. Herein, four of those polyesters spanning from semi&#8208;aromatic to aliphatic were subjected to enzymatic degradations in concert with induced&#8208;fit docking (IFD) analyses. The monomer yield following enzymatic depolymerization by IsPETase S238&#8197;A, Dura and LCC ranged from 2&#8201;% to 17&#8201;% without any further pre&#8208;treatment step. The degradation efficiency was found to correlate with the extent of matched substrate and enzyme conformations revealed by IFD, regardless of the actual reaction temperature employed. Our findings demonstrate the importance of conformational selection in enzymatic depolymerization of biopolymers. A straight or twisted conformation of the polymer chain is crucial in biocatalytic degradation by showing different affinities to enzyme ground&#8208;state conformers. This work highlights the importance of considering the conformational match between the polymer and the enzyme to optimize the biocatalytic degradation efficiency of biopolymers, providing valuable insights for the development of sustainable bioprocesses.

         <title>Channel Engineering of a Glutamate Exporter</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through two design strategy to improve MscCG2 efflux ability: widening the channel entrance for smoother entry of glutamate and reducing the electronegativity at the entrance of the channels to minimize the rejection of negatively charged glutamate entry. The designed variants were found to enhance glutamate excretion by 2 to 3.3&#8208;fold in the early phase and 1.1&#8208;fold to 1.5&#8208;fold in the late phase of fermentation.







Abstract
Mechanosensitive channel MscCG2 is involved in glutamate excretion in most C. glutamicum strains. Improving the excretion efficiency of MscCG2 is beneficial to the production of glutamate. In this study, structure&#8208;based rational design was carried out to obtain an improved efflux ability of exporter MscCG2 and its mechanistic advance via two strategies: widening the channel entrance for smoother entry of glutamate and reducing the electronegativity at the entrance of the channels to minimize the rejection of negatively charged glutamate entry. The designed variants were found to enhance glutamate excretion by 2 to 3.3&#8208;fold in the early phase and 1.1&#8208;fold to 1.5&#8208;fold in the late phase of fermentation.

&lt;p&gt;Through two design strategy to improve MscCG2 efflux ability: widening the channel entrance for smoother entry of glutamate and reducing the electronegativity at the entrance of the channels to minimize the rejection of negatively charged glutamate entry. The designed variants were found to enhance glutamate excretion by 2 to 3.3-fold in the early phase and 1.1-fold to 1.5-fold in the late phase of fermentation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanosensitive channel MscCG2 is involved in glutamate excretion in most &lt;i&gt;C. glutamicum&lt;/i&gt; strains. Improving the excretion efficiency of MscCG2 is beneficial to the production of glutamate. In this study, structure-based rational design was carried out to obtain an improved efflux ability of exporter MscCG2 and its mechanistic advance via two strategies: widening the channel entrance for smoother entry of glutamate and reducing the electronegativity at the entrance of the channels to minimize the rejection of negatively charged glutamate entry. The designed variants were found to enhance glutamate excretion by 2 to 3.3-fold in the early phase and 1.1-fold to 1.5-fold in the late phase of fermentation. The enhanced glutamate excretion was further confirmed by using glutamate toxic analog 4-fluoroglutamate (4-FG) and Glu-Glu peptide uptake and glutamate export assay. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations revealed that the amino acid substitutions indeed enlarged the channel entrance and reduced the repulsion of glutamate when entering the channel. The finding of this study is important for understanding the underlying structure-function relationship and the mechanism of glutamate secretion to improve glutamate efflux efficiency of glutamate exporter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cyclization by Vanadium Chloroperoxidase for Synthesis of 4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;Ones</title>

Curvularia inaequalis vanadium chloroperoxidase (CiVCPO) catalyzed the chemoenzymatic cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids with different electron&#8208;donating groups to produce good yields of 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones by adding KBr and H2O2 in citrate buffer (pH&#8197;5) containing 30&#8201;% DMSO.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones belong to the class of the secondary metabolite 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins. They exhibit a wide range of biological activities. These compounds can be synthesized through halocyclization using hypervalent iodine species or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, followed by hydrolysis. Nonetheless, the reactions required specific conditions and generated toxic byproducts. In this study, Curvularia inaequalis vanadium chloroperoxidase (CiVCPO) catalyzed the chemoenzymatic cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids with different electron&#8208;donating groups (1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;e) to produce good yields of 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones (3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;e) by adding KBr and H2O2 in citrate buffer (pH&#8197;5). The reaction mixture contained 30&#8201;% DMSO to improve substrate solubility without enzyme activity loss. The condition is more environmentally friendly than chemical methods. Therefore, it offers an alternative approach for synthesizing 4&#8208;hydroxyisochroman&#8208;1&#8208;ones.

         <title>The Anti&#8208;Cancer Stem Cell Properties of Copper(II)&#8208;Terpyridine Complexes with Attached Salicylaldehyde Moieties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reports on the anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes are relatively sparse. Here the synthesis, characterisation, and anti&#8208;breast CSC activity of two new copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes with bidentate salicylaldehyde moieties is reported. Insight into the solution stability and the cytotoxic mechanism of action of the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes is also provided.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterisation, and anti&#8208;breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of two copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes with bidentate salicylaldehyde moieties (2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde for 1 and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde for 2). The copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 are stable in biologically relevant aqueous solutions and display micromolar potency towards breast CSCs. The most effective complex 1 is 5&#8208;fold and 6.6&#8208;fold more potent towards breast CSCs than salinomycin and cisplatin, respectively. The copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 also decrease the formation and viability of three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres within the micromolar range. Notably complex 1 is up to 7&#8208;fold more potent towards mammospheres than salinomycin or cisplatin. Mechanistic studies suggest that the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine complexes 1 and 2 are able to readily enter breast CSCs, elevate intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, induce DNA damage (presumably by oxidative DNA cleavage), and evoke apoptosis that is independent of caspases. This study shows that the copper(II)&#8208;terpyridine motif is a useful building block for the design of anti&#8208;breast CSC agents and reinforces the therapeutic potential of copper coordination complexes.

Human 8&#8208;oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) reacts with the most frequently generated DNA lesion, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, to form covalent DNA&#8208;protein cross&#8208;links (OGG1&#8208;DPCs).

Abstract

It has been reported that OGG1 incises the most frequently formed DNA lesion, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, and in the process a stable DNA&#8208;OGG1 cross&#8208;link is formed. However, the chemical structure of the adduct is not characterized.

         <title>Discovery of Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;Biosidases and a Novel N&#8208;Acetyllactosaminidase Activity in the CAZy Family GH20: Functional Diversity and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report several new lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biosidases (LNBases) and the first report of N&#8208;acetyllactosaminidase (LacNAcase) activity in CAZy family GH20, i.&#8201;e. enzymes that catalyze the release heterodisaccharides from human milk oligosaccharides and related glycans. New crystal structures comparing a specific LNBase to an enzyme with dual LacNAcase/LNBase activity reveal a highly conserved subsite &#8722;1, common to GH20 enzymes, and high variation in subsite &#8722;2.







Abstract
The glycoside hydrolase family 20 (GH20) predominantly features N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52), with only few known lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biosidases (EC 3.2.1.140; LNBases). LNBases catalyze the degradation of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose (LNT), a prominent component of human milk oligosaccharides, thereby supporting a healthy infant gut microbiome development. We investigated GH20 diversity to discover novel enzymes that release disaccharides such as lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose (LNB). Our approach combined peptide clustering, sequence analysis, and 3D structure model evaluation to assess active site topologies, focusing on the presence of a subsite &#8722;2. Five LNBases were active on pNP&#8208;LNB and four showed activity on LNT. One enzyme displayed activity on both pNP&#8208;LacNAc and pNP&#8208;LNB, establishing the first report of N&#8208;acetyllactosaminidase (LacNAcase) activity. Exploration of this enzyme cluster led to the identification of four additional enzymes sharing this dual substrate specificity. Comparing the determined crystal structure of a specific LNBase (TrpyGH20) and the first crystal structure of an enzyme with dual LacNAcase/LNBase activity (TrdeGH20) revealed a highly conserved subsite &#8722;1, common to GH20 enzymes, while the &#8722;2 subsites varied significantly. TrdeGH20 had a wider subsite &#8722;2, accommodating Gal with both &#946;1,4&#8208; and &#946;1,3&#8208;linkages to the GlcNAc in subsite &#8722;1. Biotechnological applications of these enzymes may include structural elucidation of complex carbohydrates and glycoengineering.

&lt;p&gt;The glycoside hydrolase family 20 (GH20) predominantly features &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylhexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52), with only few known lacto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-biosidases (EC 3.2.1.140; LNBases). LNBases catalyze the degradation of lacto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tetraose (LNT), a prominent component of human milk oligosaccharides, thereby supporting a healthy infant gut microbiome development. We investigated GH20 diversity to discover novel enzymes that release disaccharides such as lacto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-biose (LNB). Our approach combined peptide clustering, sequence analysis, and 3D structure model evaluation to assess active site topologies, focusing on the presence of a subsite &#8722;2. Five LNBases were active on pNP-LNB and four showed activity on LNT. One enzyme displayed activity on both pNP-LacNAc and pNP-LNB, establishing the first report of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyllactosaminidase (LacNAcase) activity. Exploration of this enzyme cluster led to the identification of four additional enzymes sharing this dual substrate specificity. Comparing the determined crystal structure of a specific LNBase (TrpyGH20) and the first crystal structure of an enzyme with dual LacNAcase/LNBase activity (TrdeGH20) revealed a highly conserved subsite &#8722;1, common to GH20 enzymes, while the &#8722;2 subsites varied significantly. TrdeGH20 had a wider subsite &#8722;2, accommodating Gal with both &#946;1,4- and &#946;1,3-linkages to the GlcNAc in subsite &#8722;1. Biotechnological applications of these enzymes may include structural elucidation of complex carbohydrates and glycoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concise Affinity&#8208;Based Purification of Ligated mRNA for Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of Nucleosugar Modification Patterns</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a two&#8208;step affinity purification method for ligated sugar&#8208;modified mRNA. The purification is based on oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to 3&#8217; poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA. This method provides a new platform for rapid optimization of chemically modified mRNAs and advancement of their pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
Position&#8208;specific nucleoside sugar modifications have been shown to improve the translational activity and stability of chemically synthesized mRNA. For pharmaceutical applications of chemically modified mRNAs, a rapid purification methodology is imperative to identify the optimal modification pattern. However, while the chemical synthesis of mRNAs can be accomplished by splint ligation of oligonucleotide fragments, the current purification method for ligated mRNAs based on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tends to be time consuming. In this study, we developed a two&#8208;step affinity purification method for rapid sample preparation. In this method, ligated mRNA is captured by oligo dT magnetic beads and streptavidin magnetic beads with 3&#8217;&#8208;biotinylated oligo DNA, which are complementary to the 3&#8217;&#8208;poly(A) and 5&#8217; terminal sequences of the target mRNA, respectively. Therefore, the target mRNA can be isolated from a complex mixture of splint ligations. Using this method, six sugar&#8208;modified mRNAs were simultaneously purified, and the translational activities of these mRNAs were evaluated immediately after purification. The results demonstrate that this methodology is suitable for the rapid preparation of various chemically synthesized mRNAs to identify their optimal modification patterns.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterisation of a Bacterial Lactoperoxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the biochemical and structural characterization of CyanoPOX, a heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16. Expressed in E.&#8197;coli, the enzyme exhibits properties similar to bovine lactoperoxidase despite low sequence identity. CyanoPOX demonstrates optimal activity in slightly acidic conditions and efficiently oxidizes various substrates. Structural analysis reveals a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor and a conserved active site pocket.







Abstract
Peroxidases belong to a group of enzymes that are widely found in animals, plants and microorganisms. These enzymes are effective biocatalysts for a wide range of oxidations on various substrates. This work presents a biochemical and structural characterization of a novel heme&#8208;containing peroxidase from Cyanobacterium sp. TDX16, CyanoPOX. This cyanobacterial enzyme was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble, heme&#8208;containing monomeric enzyme. Although CyanoPOX shares relatively low sequence identity (37&#8201;%) with bovine lactoperoxidase, it displays comparable biochemical properties. CyanoPOX is most stable and active in slightly acidic conditions (pH 6&#8211;6.5) and moderately thermostable (melting temperature around 48&#8201;&#176;C). Several compounds that are typical substrates for mammalian lactoperoxidases were tested to establish the catalytic potential of CyanoPOX. Potassium iodide showed the highest catalytic efficiency (126&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), while various aromatic compounds were also readily converted. Structural elucidation of CyanoPOX confirmed the presence of a non&#8208;covalently bound b&#8208;type heme cofactor that is situated in the central core of the protein. Except for a highly similar overall structure, CyanoPOX also has a conserved active site pocket when compared with mammalian lactoperoxidases. Due to its catalytic properties and high expression in a bacterial host, this newly discovered peroxidase shows promise for applications.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformation for the Preparation of Chromopyrrolic Acid and 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;Chromopyrrolic Acid in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a combination of two enzymes (LaStaO/LzrO and VioB) into the E. coli strain, a whole&#8208;cell biotransformation method was developed. Chromopyrrolic acid and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid could be produced in hundred milligram per liter level by feeding L&#8208;tryptophan and 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, respectively, to the working culture or phosphate buffer&#8208;resuspended culture.







Abstract
Chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) and its congeners are important intermediates for the biosynthesis and synthesis of various dimeric tryptophan natural products. We have constructed two E. coli strains (CPA001/CPA002) harboring a single plasmid carrying genes coding for a combination of two enzymes (LaStaO/LzrO and VioB) that are able to convert L&#8208;tryptophan (L&#8208;Trp)/5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryotophan (5&#8208;Cl&#8722;L&#8208;Trp) to chromopyrrolic acid (CPA)/5,5&#8217;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid (5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA). Effect on the production of CPA were evaluated by varying the parameters of strain cultivation and biotransformation process. Under the optimized conditions, up to 325&#8197;mg/L of CPA and 275&#8197;mg/L of 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diCl&#8208;CPA could be obtained by supplementing L&#8208;Trp and 5&#8208;Cl&#8722;L&#8208;Trp, respectively, to a working culture of CPA001, or to a phosphate buffer&#8208;resuspended culture of CPA002. The practicability of this whole&#8208;cell biotransformation system could also be served as a potential platform for the preparation of CPA congeners.

         <title>In vivo and in vitro Reconstitution of Biosynthesis of N&#8208;Prenylated Phenazines Revealing Diverse Phenazine&#8208;Modifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for natural phenazines. The class II terpene cyclase Pzm1 catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form monocyclic FPP. The prenyltransferases PzmP and LavP function as the N&#8208;prenyltransferases of the phenazine&#8208;backbone, followed by the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the flavin monooxygenases PzmS and LavS to yield phenazinomycin and lavanducyanin, respectively.







Abstract
Phenazine natural products play various roles such as signal molecules, antibiotics, or electron carriers in their producer strains. Among these products, phenazinomycin and lavanducyanin, which are produced by Streptomyces species, are characterized by an N&#8208;alkyl modification. Herein, we established the biosynthetic pathways for these two phenazine natural products. Gene&#8208;disruption experiments and in&#8197;vitro reconstitution of the phenazine&#8208;tailoring pathway revealed the late steps of the biosynthetic pathway of the phenazines. The class II terpene cyclase homolog Pzm1 catalyzes the cyclization reaction of farnesyl diphosphate to form monocyclic farnesyl diphosphate. Additionally, the prenyltransferase homolog PzmP functions as the N&#8208;prenyltransferase of 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid. The flavin monooxygenase homolog PzmS catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of prenylated 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid to yield phenazinomycin. This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for phenazine natural products.

Additionally, the prenyltransferase homolog PzmP functions as the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-prenyltransferase of 5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid. The flavin monooxygenase homolog PzmS catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of prenylated 5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid to yield phenazinomycin. This study highlights unprecedented modification enzymes for phenazine natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Retinoic Acid Efficacy: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Derivatives with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipase&#8208;catalyzed approach was applied to the synthesis of nine derivatives of retinoic acid (four of them new compounds) with excellent yield and low environmental impact. Several synthesized compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the retinoic acid in Vero cells and a remarkably higher antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;1 (HSV&#8208;1) and Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;2 (HSV&#8208;2).







Abstract
An efficient enzymatic approach was applied to the synthesis of new derivatives of retinoic acid. Nine derivatives, four of them new compounds, were obtained through lipase&#8208;catalysis with excellent yield. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, the influence of various parameters such as enzyme source, nucleophile&#8201;:&#8201;substrate ratio, enzyme&#8201;:&#8201;substrate ratio, solvent and temperature was studied. The excellent results obtained by lipase catalysis made the procedure very efficient considering their advantages such as mild reaction conditions and low environmental impact. In addition, several synthesized compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the retinoic acid in Vero cells and a remarkably higher antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;1 (HSV&#8208;1) and Herpes simplex virus type&#8197;2 (HSV&#8208;2).

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of a New Antitumor Pyranonaphthoquinone from Streptomyces tanashiensis DSM 731: Insights from Single&#8208;Molecule Stretching Assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;molecule stretching assay&#8208;based molecular networking strategy can effectively dereplicate known compounds and identify new bioactive natural products. This approach led to the discovery of a new pyranonaphthoquinone (PNQ), methyl kalafunginate (1), with potent antitumor bioactivity. Moreover, compound 1 was found to be a non&#8208;enzymatic product of kalafungin (4) in methanol, providing valuable insights into the formation mechanism of PNQs.







Abstract
Guided by molecular networking based on single&#8208;molecule stretching assay, an unprecedented pyranonaphthoquinone, methyl kalafunginate (1) and five known compounds 2&#8211;6 were isolated from Streptomyces tanashiensis DSM 731. Compound 1 was characterized through a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis, ECD calculation, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Interestingly, we discovered that compound 1 was spontaneously converted from kalafungin (4) in methanol solution. All isolated compounds, except for compound 3, were assessed for their cytotoxic potential against a panel of five human cancer cell lines: A549, HepG2, BxPC&#8208;3, SW620, and C4&#8208;2B. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 exhibited remarkable cytotoxicity with IC50 values below 2.382&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting their potential as promising anticancer agents. These findings highlight the significance of using a combined approach of single&#8208;molecule stretching assays and molecular networking for efficiently discovering novel natural products with potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Cytotoxic Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Diphosphine Complexes Affect the Mitochondrial Respiration of Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II)&#8208;based compounds containing diphosphines and mercapto ligands are cytotoxic and are able to inhibit the colony formation and the migration on A549 lung cancer cells. JC&#8208;1 and Mito stress tests revealed these compounds affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, changing the oxygen consumption and ATP levels, confirming mitochondrial dysfunction on these cells.







Abstract
In this work, we studied six Ruthenium(II)&#8208;diphosphine compounds containing different mercapto ligands (N&#8722;S), with general formula [Ru(N&#8722;S)(dppm)2]Cl (dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane). These compounds were characterized by several techniques (NMR [1H, 31P(1H), and 13C], HRMS, IR, UV&#8208;Vis and XRD) and their purity confirmed by elemental analysis. DLS experiments revealed low diameters and polydispersity indexes, and positive log P values in n&#8208;octanol/PBS indicated their preference for the organic phase. In general, these compounds are stable in different media over 48&#8197;h. Cytotoxicity experiments revealed promising IC50 values on A549 breast cancer cells, 0.48&#8197;&#956;M and 0.80&#8197;&#956;M for [Ru(mtz)(dppm)2]Cl (1) and [Ru(mmi)(dppm)2]Cl (2), respectively (mtz and mmi are 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;thiazoline and mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole in their deprotonated form, respectively). Clonogenic and migration experiments indicated their antiproliferative and anti&#8208;migratory capacity. ICP&#8208;MS results indicated their cellular accumulation in the nucleus, with little amounts in mitochondria. No covalent DNA binding was observed by ICP&#8208;MS. JC&#8208;1 and cell Mito Stress test confirmed mitochondrial dysfunction, which was verified by mitochondrial membrane potential uncoupling and drastic alterations in the oxygen consumption rate. Taken together, our results provide crucial insights regarding the anticancer potential of ruthenium(II)&#8208;phosphine compounds.

         <title>A Thermostable Heme Protein Fold Adapted for Stereoselective C&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation Using Peroxygenase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber as a source of a thermostable protein fold for biocatalyst design. By modifying the I&#8208;helix, we have transformed it into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE) that enantioselectively oxidises &#946;&#8208;ionone into (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ionone with 94&#8201;% e.e. The enzyme exhibited high stability, resisting 20&#8197;mM H2O2 and 20&#8201;% organic solvent, withstanding 60&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;hour and 30&#8201;&#176;C for 365&#8197;days, and supported over 1700 turnovers.







Abstract
Thermostable protein folds of natural and synthetic origin are highly sought&#8208;after templates for biocatalyst generation due to their enhanced stability to elevated temperatures which overcomes one of the major limitations of applying enzymes for synthesis. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are a family of heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases that catalyse the oxidation of their substrates in a highly stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner. The CYP enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber binds the norisoprenoid &#946;&#8208;ionone and was employed as a scaffold for catalyst design. The I&#8208;helix was modified to convert this enzyme from a monooxygenase into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE), enabling the enantioselective oxidation of &#946;&#8208;ionone to (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ionone (94&#8201;% e.e.). The enzyme was resistant to 20&#8197;mM H2O2, 20&#8201;% (v/v) of organic solvent, supported over 1700 turnovers and was fully functional after incubation at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h and 30&#8201;&#176;C for 365&#8197;days. The reaction was scaled&#8208;up to generate multi milligram quantities of the product for characterisation. Overall, we demonstrate that sourcing a CYP protein fold from an extremophile enabled the design of a highly stable enzyme for stereoselective C&#8722;H bond activation only using H2O2 as the oxidant, providing a viable strategy for future biocatalyst design.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are a family of heme-thiolate monooxygenases that catalyse the oxidation of their substrates in a highly stereo- and regio-selective manner. The CYP enzyme (CYP107PQ1) from the thermophilic bacterium &lt;i&gt;Meiothermus ruber&lt;/i&gt; binds the norisoprenoid &#946;-ionone and was employed as a scaffold for catalyst design. The I-helix was modified to convert this enzyme from a monooxygenase into a peroxygenase (CYP107PQ1QE), enabling the enantioselective oxidation of &#946;-ionone to (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-4-hydroxy-&#946;-ionone (94&#8201;% e.e.). The enzyme was resistant to 20&#8197;mM H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 20&#8201;% (v/v) of organic solvent, supported over 1700 turnovers and was fully functional after incubation at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h and 30&#8201;&#176;C for 365&#8197;days. The reaction was scaled-up to generate multi milligram quantities of the product for characterisation. Overall, we demonstrate that sourcing a CYP protein fold from an extremophile enabled the design of a highly stable enzyme for stereoselective C&#8722;H bond activation only using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the oxidant, providing a viable strategy for future biocatalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evaluation of Potency and Specificity of Cryptophycin&#8208;Loaded Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptophycin&#8208;uD[Dap(Me)], a derivative of the microtubule inhibitor cryptophycin, was equipped with an Mc&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PAB linker to enable conjugation of the toxin to either hinge&#8208;region cysteines or engineered cysteines in THIOMAB variants of trastuzumab. ADCs with DARs of 1.5, 3 and 6 were obtained. Especially the DAR 3 variant in THIOMAB format showed desirable biophysical properties and high potency in cellular assays.







Abstract
An enhanced variant of the antimitotic toxin cryptophycin was conjugated to the anti&#8208;Her2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) Trastuzumab upon Michael addition. Either antibodies with freed hinge&#8208;region cysteines or THIOMAB formats with engineered cysteines in the mAbs light chain were added to a maleimide derivative of cryptophycin. These Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs) showed retained binding to Her2 positive tumor cells and highly efficient cell killing in double&#8208;digit pM range on high Her2&#8208;expressing SK&#8208;BR&#8208;3 cells. Two ADCs (DAR 6, DAR 3) showed superior cell killing of the cell lines JIMT&#8208;1 and RT112 with medium receptor expression level in comparison with a DAR 6 MMAE ADC serving as reference. The observed cell cytotoxicity is target&#8208;dependent since no impact on cell viability was observed for low Her2&#8208;expressing MDA&#8208;MB468 cells. Particularly the DAR 3 ADC in THIOMAB format exhibiting desirable biophysical properties and high potency emerged as a promising candidate for further in&#8197;vivo investigations.

         <title>ER Oxidoreductin 1&#8208;Like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Drives Protein Disulfide Isomerase in an Electron Relay System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) &#8211; a typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;resident oxidoreductase &#8211; donates electrons to O2 via ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), turning its own catalytic cycle to promote oxidative folding. This study showed that cyclic diselenides imitate Ero1 activity, enhancing PDI function and hence promoting PDI&#8208;catalyzed folding of drug&#8208;related proteins, including insulin.







Abstract
Disulfide formation generally involves a two&#8208;electron oxidation reaction between cysteine residues. Additionally, disulfide formation is an essential post&#8208;translational modification for the structural maturation of proteins. This oxidative folding is precisely controlled by an electron relay network constructed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), with a CGHC sequence as the redox&#8208;active site, and its family enzymes. Creating reagents that mimic the functions of these enzymes facilitates folding during chemical protein synthesis. In this study, we aimed to imitate a biological electron relay system using cyclic diselenide compounds as surrogates for endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), which is responsible for the re&#8208;oxidation of PDI. Oxidized PDI (PDIox) introduces disulfide bonds into substrate proteins, resulting in its conversion to reduced PDI (PDIred). The PDIred is then re&#8208;oxidized to PDIox by a coexisting cyclic diselenide compound, thereby restoring the function of PDI as a disulfide&#8208;forming agent. The produced diselenol state is readily oxidized to the original diselenide state with molecular oxygen, continuously sustaining the PDI catalytic cycle. This artificial electron relay system regulating enzymatic PDI function effectively promotes the oxidative folding of disulfide&#8208;containing proteins, such as insulin &#8211; a hypoglycemic formulation &#8211; by enhancing both yield and reaction velocity.

Fundamental mechanisms underpinning biocatalytic depolymerization of biopolymers from renewable sources remain poorly understood. In article 10.1002/cbic.202400456, Per&#8208;Olof Syr&#233;n and co&#8208;workers combine NMR and SEC analysis of enzymatic degradation in concert with induced&#8208;fit docking to explore the biodegradation mechanism of a set of previously synthesized bio&#8208;polyesters stemming from a rigid bicyclic terpene&#8208;based diol core. Strikingly, the results show how the simple 1D parameter with respect to whether the biopolymer chain adopts a straight or twisted conformation dictates the degradation rate. This work stresses the importance of matching enzyme and polymer conformations for expedient polymer degradation with broad implications for enzyme and material design. The Cover was designed by Karla Martinez Bauza and Ximena Lopez Lorenzo.

Cancer remains a leading cause of death, urging new treatment strategies. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr), a novel protein modification, plays a central role in cancer&#8208;related processes like cell proliferation, metastasis, DNA damage response, and gene expression. Abnormal Kcr is strongly linked to cancers such as breast, liver, and lung, making it a promising therapeutic target. However, limited chemical tools hinder understanding of its molecular mechanisms. Developing chemical tools to study Kcr&#8208;regulated proteins and pathways holds significant potential to uncover novel interventions in cancer therapy. More details can be found in article 10.1002/cbic.202400639 by Rita Petracca and co&#8208;workers.

MscCG2 is a mechanosensitive channel which is involved in glutamate excretion in most C. glutamicum strains. Protein engineering of MscCG2 to enhance its excretion efficiency is essential for the production of glutamate. In article 10.1002/cbic.202400540, Leilei Zhu and co&#8208;workers perform structure&#8208;based rational design and obtain MscCG2 variants with 2&#8208;3.3&#8208;fold enhanced glutamate excretion. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the amino acid substitutions enlarge the channel entrance and reduce the repulsion of glutamate when entering the channel. These findings are important for understanding the underlying structure&#8208;function relationship and the mechanism of glutamate secretion to improve glutamate efflux efficiency of glutamate exporter.

&lt;p&gt;MscCG2 is a mechanosensitive channel which is involved in glutamate excretion in most &lt;i&gt;C. glutamicum&lt;/i&gt; strains. Protein engineering of MscCG2 to enhance its excretion efficiency is essential for the production of glutamate. In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202400540"&gt;article 10.1002/cbic.202400540, Leilei Zhu and co-workers&lt;/a&gt; perform structure-based rational design and obtain MscCG2 variants with 2-3.3-fold enhanced glutamate excretion. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the amino acid substitutions enlarge the channel entrance and reduce the repulsion of glutamate when entering the channel. These findings are important for understanding the underlying structure-function relationship and the mechanism of glutamate secretion to improve glutamate efflux efficiency of glutamate exporter.

         <title>Cracking Lysine Crotonylation (Kcr): Enlightening a Promising Post&#8208;Translational Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a novel post&#8208;translational modification linked to diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease. Kcr enhances gene expression more than lysine acetylation, making it a promising therapeutic target. Despite recent research, key regulatory mechanisms and selective methods for studying Kcr remain underexplored. This review highlights Kcr's potential and identifies gaps needing further investigation.







Abstract
Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a recently discovered post&#8208;translational modification (PTM). Both histone and non&#8208;histone Kcr&#8208;proteins have been associated with numerous diseases including cancer, acute kidney injury, HIV latency, and cardiovascular disease. Histone Kcr enhances gene expression to a larger extend than the extensively studied lysine acetylation (Kac), suggesting Kcr as a novel potential therapeutic target. Although numerous scientific reports on crotonylation were published in the last years, relevant knowledge gaps concerning this PTM and its regulation still remain. To date, only few selective Kcr&#8208;interacting proteins have been identified and selective methods for the enrichment of Kcr&#8208;proteins in chemical proteomics analysis are still lacking. The development of new techniques to study this underexplored PTM could then clarify its function in health and disease and hopefully accelerate the development of new therapeutics for Kcr&#8208;related disease. Herein we briefly review what is known about the regulation mechanisms of Kcr and the current methods used to identify Kcr&#8208;proteins and their interacting partners. This report aims to highlight the significant potential of Kcr as a therapeutic target and to identify the existing scientific gaps that new research must address.

         <title>Mechanistic Perspective on Oxygen Activation Chemistry by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze crucial chemical reactions. Oxygen activation typically occurs at two sites on flavin: the C4a site, generating flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H), which is responsible for hydroxylation, halogenation, dehalogenation, and Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, and the N5 site, forming flavin&#8208;N5OOH, which functions as a nucleophile or base, facilitating nonoxidative C&#8722;X (X=N, S, Cl) bond cleavage and oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyze a panoply of chemical transformations essential for living organisms. Through oxygen activation, flavoenzymes could generate diverse flavin&#8208;oxygen species that mediate numerous redox and non&#8208;redox transformations. In this review, we highlight the extensive oxygen activation chemistry at two sites of the flavin cofactor: C4a and N5 sites. Oxygen activation at the C4a site generates flavin&#8208;C4aOO(H) species for various monooxygenation reactions, while activation at the N5 site produces negatively charged flavin&#8208;N5OOH species, which act as highly reactive nucleophiles or bases. The selective oxygen activation at either the C4a or N5 site depends on the nature of substrates and is controlled by the active site architecture. These insights have expanded our understanding of oxygen activation chemistry in flavoenzymes and will serve as a foundation for future efforts in enzyme engineering and redesign.

         <title>Noncanonical Functions of Ketosynthase Domains in Type I Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ketosynthase (KS) domain plays a central role in the biosynthesis of polyketide natural products. This work reviews the diverse functions of type I PKS KS domains in natural product biosynthesis, including canonical Claisen condensation and noncanonical reactions, such as decarboxylation, acyl transfer, Dickmann condensation, Micheal addition, C&#8722;N bond formation, aldol&#8208;lactonization bicyclization and decarbonylation.







Abstract
Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are remarkable molecular machines that can synthesize structurally complex polyketide natural products with a wide range of biological activities. In these molecular machines, ketosynthase (KS) domains play a central role, typically by catalyzing decarboxylative Claisen condensation for polyketide chain extension. Noncanonical KS domains with catalytic functions rather than Claisen condensation have increasingly been evidenced, further demonstrating the capability of type I PKSs for structural diversity. This review provides an overview of the reactions involving unusual KS activities, including PKS priming, acyl transfer, Dieckmann condensation, Michael addition, aldol&#8208;lactonization bicyclization, C&#8722;N bond formation and decarbonylation. Insights into these reactions can deepen the understanding of PKS&#8208;based assembly line chemistry and guide the efforts for rational engineering of polyketide&#8208;related molecules.

         <title>Peptides for Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation: An Emerging Biomaterial</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advances in peptides for liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and highlights their crucial role in drug delivery, catalysis, biosensing, and detection. We focus on the strategies used to design LLPS peptide sequences and emphasize their potential biomedical applications. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as next&#8208;generation biomaterials.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) refers to a spontaneous separation behavior of biomacromolecules under specific physiological conditions, playing a crucial role in regulating various biological processes. Recent advances in synthetic peptides have greatly improved our understanding of peptide&#8208;based coacervate droplets and expanded their applications in biomedicine. Numerous peptide sequences have been reported that undergo phase separation, enabling the concentration and sequestration of different guest molecules for purposes such as drug delivery, catalytic performance, and bioanalytical techniques. Particularly, some of these peptides offer significant advantages in controlled drug release, efficient cell transfection, accelerated reaction kinetics, and selective biomarker detection. This review provides an overview of recent developments in peptide&#8208;based LLPS, exploring various strategies for designing peptide sequences and their biomedical applications. It also addresses the challenges and future directions for LLPS peptide vehicles as promising biomaterials.

         <title>Amide Synthesis from Decarboxylative Coupling of Isocyanates and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 2, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative coupling between carboxylic acids and isocyanates to prepare amides is reviewed. Complementary to the classical carboxylic acid/amine reaction, this protocol does not require the activation of carboxylic acid, thus providing new solutions to the problems caused by the carboxylic acid activation strategy.







Abstract
Isocyanates are versatile electrophiles that can react with a wide range of nucleophiles to afford important organic structures. Although the reactions between isocyanates and alcohols, amines and organometallic reagents have been well established, the synthesis of amides through the decarboxylative condensation of carboxylic acids and isocyanates is less appreciated. In this review, the synthesis of isocyanates and its application on amide synthesis through the condensation with carboxylic acids are summarized and discussed. It is our hope that this review will attract more attention to this less mentioned transformation and inspire new developments in the fields of organic synthesis, polymer synthesis and chemical biology.

         <title>Silencing of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase attenuated O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and metastatic potentials of melanoma cells through suppression of Akt&#8208;NFkB signaling pathway</title>

         <dc:description>O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is an important biological process in regulating the function of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins in cells.&#160;&#160;Enhancement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation was associated with cancer development and progression.&#160;&#160;Here, we demonstrated the involvement of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in melanoma metastasis.&#160;&#160;Using the data from GEO database, we found that O&#8208;GlcNAcylation and its related enzymes, including glutamine fructose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and O&#8208;GlcNAcase (OGA); were elevated in metastatic melanoma compared with primary tumors and normal tissues.&#160;&#160;Functional analyses in melanoma cell lines&#8208;&#8208;MNT&#8208;1, SK&#8208;MEL&#8208;28, and A&#8208;375 showed that suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation by siRNA against OGT significantly reduces the migration and invasion abilities of the cells.&#160;&#160;Phosphorylation of Akt and NFkB was drastically suppressed after knockdown of OGT, suggesting the role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating the Akt&#8208;NFkB signaling pathway.&#160;&#160;In addition, we found that the NFkB target genes, such as ZEB&#8208;2 and MCT&#8208;1, were significantly upregulated in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors.&#160;&#160;MCT&#8208;1 expression in melanoma tissues was also correlated with O&#8208;GlcNAcylation level.&#160;&#160;Taken together, we have demonstrated in this study the possible role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in controlling melanoma metastasis via upregulating MCT&#8208;1 expression through activation of Akt&#8208;NFkB signaling pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>From Antibacterial Activity to Molecular Mechanism: Case Study of Hexapeptide RWWRWW and Its Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8208; and L&#8208;isomers of designed hexapeptides are studied. Sum frequency generation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that D&#8208;isomer forms aggregates via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing the capability to disrupt bacterial membrane; while L&#8208;isomers form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, enabling them to interact with and leading to effective disruption of the membrane.







Abstract
In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a potent weapon against the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Among AMPs, the ones containing tryptophan (W) and arginine (R) exhibit enhanced antimicrobial properties, benefiting from the unique physicochemical features of the two amino acids. Herein, we designed three hexapeptides, including WR, DWR (D&#8208;isomer), and RF, derived from the original sequence, RWWRWW&#8208;NH2 (RW). By combining sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG&#8208;VS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we examined AMPs&#8217; interactions with model bacterial membrane at the molecular level. Our findings revealed the innate different structural features associated with molecular aggregation and membrane activity between L&#8208;(WR, RF and RW) and D&#8208;isomer. The D&#8208;isomer was demonstrated to aggregate via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which reduced its membrane adsorption quantity and consequently weakened its disruptive effect on the model membrane; while L&#8208;isomers rarely aggregated and thus could fully interact with the model membrane. D&#8208;isomer was proven to lack a stable helical structure, while L&#8208;isomers adopted helical structures, which was believed to be the reason for DWR's tendency to aggregate easily. This study should contribute to designing novel short&#8208;chain AMPs with high efficiency, especially in the case that D&#8208;isomers will be used.

         <title>Vanadium Complexes for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This highlight covers recent advances in mitochondria&#8208;targeted vanadium complexes for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in cancer treatment. These complexes demonstrate selective in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity toward cancer cells without harming the normal cells. This review combines stable vanadium complexes with their ROS generation and DNA crosslinking capabilities, this work opening the way for translational research and future clinical applications in targeted cancer therapies.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based drugs have the potential to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy by exhibiting key properties such as appropriate charge, thermodynamic stability, hydrolytic stability, oral bioavailability, and dual functional capability. These properties are critical for effective intracellular uptake, as drugs or prodrugs must cross cellular membranes to target specific organelles like mitochondria, essential for maximizing therapeutic impact. Bio&#8208;essential metal ions such as copper, zinc, and iron are transported through specialized active channels, whereas others depend on passive diffusion to enter cells. Vanadium has gained significant attention in research because of its remarkable coordination flexibility, lipid&#8208;lowering characteristics, and potential anticancer effects. The coordination flexibility of vanadium has led to its investigation in pharmaceuticals, given its demonstrated insulin&#8208;mimetic effects, lipid&#8208;lowering properties, and promising antitumor activities. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a targeted cancer treatment approach through light&#8208;activated compounds that selectively generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cell death. Among metal&#8208;based photosensitizers, vanadium complexes are emerging as effective agents due to their unique redox properties and known biological activity. This minireview explores mitochondria&#8208;targeting vanadium complexes within PDT. Mitochondria serve as an ideal ROS generation site, triggering apoptosis while minimizing damage to healthy cells. We examine key strategies in designing vanadium complexes that enhance mitochondrial localization, photodynamic efficiency, and cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. This review highlights the challenges like photostability and selective targeting, and future directions for advancing vanadium&#8208;based photosensitizers as next&#8208;generation PDT cancer therapies.

         <title>Unsymmetric Triazine&#8208;Based Triglucoside Detergents for Membrane Protein Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of unsymmetry into the hydrophobic region of the TTG scaffold generates several unsymmetrical TTGs with varying alkyl chain lengths. Among these new detergents, TTG&#8208;8,12, which exhibits intermediate unsymmetry, is the most effective at stabilizing multiple membrane proteins. This U&#8208;TTG is significantly more effective than lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) in stabilizing G protein&#8208;coupled receptors.







Abstract
Membrane proteins play a crucial role in a variety of biological processes and are key targets for pharmaceutical development. Structural studies of membrane proteins provide molecular insights into the mechanisms of these processes and are essential for effective drug discovery. Historically, these studies have relied on solubilization of the target protein using detergents, but conventional detergents often fail to maintain the stability of challenging membrane proteins. To address this issue, there is a need to develop novel detergents with enhanced protein stabilization properties. In this study, we synthesized unsymmetric variants of recently reported tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane(TRIS)&#8208;linker&#8208;bearing triazine&#8208;based triglucosides (TTGs) by incorporating two different alkyl chains (long and short) into the detergent structure. When tested with model membrane proteins, including a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, TTG&#8208;8,12 demonstrated superior efficacy in stabilizing membrane proteins compared to the original TTGs and the gold standard detergents DDM/LMNG. These results suggest that detergent unsymmetry is an important concept for improving detergent performance and unsymmetric detergents such as TTG&#8208;8,12 hold significant potential for advancing membrane protein structural studies.

         <title>Probing DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex and I&#8208;Motif Structures Via a Fluorescent Nucleoside Analogue: 4&#8208;Cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxyribonucleoside</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was demonstrated that the nucleoside analogue, 4&#8208;cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI&#8208;NS), can serve as a minimally&#8208;perturbing and sensitive fluorescent probe of DNA structure and dynamics. In particular, the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of 4CNI&#8208;NS can be used to distinguish different noncanonical DNA structures, such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs), as well as to monitor the corresponding conformational transitions.







Abstract
Since the building blocks of DNA are nonfluorescent, various external fluorescence reporters have been employed to investigate the structure, dynamics, and function of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs), which play an important role in gene regulation and expression. However, most of those fluorescence reporters lack the ability to provide site&#8208;specific structural information of interest. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fluorescent nucleoside analogues that can be covalently inserted into oligonucleotides, which not only serve this purpose, but minimize any potential perturbation towards the native structure of the DNA systems in question. Herein, we characterize the spectroscopic utility of a high quantum yield fluorescent nucleoside analogue, 4&#8208;cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI&#8208;NS). We show that (1) incorporation of 4CNI&#8208;NS into various oligonucleotides does not alter their ability to fold into their respective native structures, nor does it affect the overall stability of those structures and (2) the fluorescence property of 4CNI&#8208;NS is sensitive to its local environment, and the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of the 4CNI&#8208;NS&#8208;containing oligonucleotides exhibit a clear dependence on their secondary structure formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 4CNI&#8208;NS can be used as a sensitive, isomorphic probe in the study of noncanonical DNA structures.

     alt="Probing DNA G-Quadruplex and I-Motif Structures Via a Fluorescent Nucleoside Analogue: 4-Cyanoindole-2&#8242;-Deoxyribonucleoside"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was demonstrated that the nucleoside analogue, 4-cyanoindole-2&#8242;-deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI-NS), can serve as a minimally-perturbing and sensitive fluorescent probe of DNA structure and dynamics. In particular, the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of 4CNI-NS can be used to distinguish different noncanonical DNA structures, such as G-quadruplexes (GQs) and i-motifs (iMs), as well as to monitor the corresponding conformational transitions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the building blocks of DNA are nonfluorescent, various external fluorescence reporters have been employed to investigate the structure, dynamics, and function of DNA G-quadruplexes (GQs) and i-motifs (iMs), which play an important role in gene regulation and expression. However, most of those fluorescence reporters lack the ability to provide site-specific structural information of interest. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fluorescent nucleoside analogues that can be covalently inserted into oligonucleotides, which not only serve this purpose, but minimize any potential perturbation towards the native structure of the DNA systems in question. Herein, we characterize the spectroscopic utility of a high quantum yield fluorescent nucleoside analogue, 4-cyanoindole-2&#8242;-deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI-NS). We show that (1) incorporation of 4CNI-NS into various oligonucleotides does not alter their ability to fold into their respective native structures, nor does it affect the overall stability of those structures and (2) the fluorescence property of 4CNI-NS is sensitive to its local environment, and the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of the 4CNI-NS-containing oligonucleotides exhibit a clear dependence on their secondary structure formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 4CNI-NS can be used as a sensitive, isomorphic probe in the study of noncanonical DNA structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing from Nature &#8211; Evolving Potential of Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are recognized as one of the most ancient components of innate immunity, playing a pivotal role as the first line of host defense systems. These evolutionarily conserved molecules have been identified in various organisms, from prokaryotes to humans. AMPs establish a delicate balanced relationship between host and microbes, by simultaneously regulating the biological activities of pathogens and commensal microbes. Given the escalating global concern over antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to explore alternative strategies to combat challenging infectious diseases. AMPs have emerged as promising candidates employed in clinical practice due to their sustainable bactericidal properties. Witnessed by deep understanding of AMPs actions toward host and bacteria, the potential applications of AMPs extend far beyond infection control. Emerging developments harnessed natural capabilities of AMPs to optimize their roles in modulating host signaling, treating diverse diseases, advancing biosensing and bioimaging technologies. In this Concept paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the diversity and properties of AMPs. Additionally, we elaborate on the mechanisms underlying AMP activity and bacterial responses counteracting AMP's&#160;functions. Most importantly, we discuss potential biomedical applications of AMPs and offer perspectives on their future development.</dc:description>

         <title>The History of Studies on Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is no doubt that breakthroughs in the enzyme&#8208;mediated formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis constitute significant milestones in the biosynthesis of complex natural products. In this review, we summarize the understanding of the biosynthesis of the oxetane ring of paclitaxel from different viewpoints. Generally, it covers five aspects, (1) a different understanding of the mechanistic formation of the oxetane ring on the basis of sound chemical reasoning, (2) a reasonable speculation of the biosynthetic pathways and suitable surrogate substrates for oxetane ring formation based on the natural and chemical logical analysis, (3)&#160;Taxus genome&#8208;enabled enzymes identification, (4) the discovery of different enzymes that mediate oxetane ring formation, and (5) a mechanistic investigation involving the use of isotopic labelling experiments and quantum chemical calculations. This review provides a detailed overview of the history of the studies on the oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis, which may be useful for a better understanding this process in combined view of nature, chemistry and biology logics, also for efficient heterologous reconstruction of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic characterization of bacillibactin in thermophilic Bacillaceae and its potential for&#160;in vitro mutational synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacillibactin (BB) is a microbial siderophore produced by Bacillus species. BB is biosynthesized from 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3&#8208;DHB), Gly, and L&#8208;Thr by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes DhbE, DhbB, and DhbF. The biosynthetic gene cluster (dhb) is also conserved in some strains of thermophilic genera, Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus and Parageobacillus. However, the production of BB from these thermophilic bacteria has not been characterized. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro characterization of BB biosynthesis in Parageobacillus sp. KH3&#8208;4 which grows at 65&#176;C. We confirmed BB production in this thermophilic bacterium and the gene cluster active. In vitro enzymatic analysis revealed that 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) encoded in the same gene cluster is responsible for the post&#8208;translational maturation of carrier proteins. DhbE and DhbF showed substrate preference to 2,3&#8208;DHB and Gly and L&#8208;Thr, respectively, consistent with the chemical structure of BB. With the purified enzymes, we successfully reconstituted the NRPS assembly line in vitro. In addition, using chemically synthesized acyl&#8208;N&#8208;acetylcysteamine substrate analogues, BB analogues possessing methylbenzoyl groups instead of 2,3&#8208;DHB were detected. This study provides a new insight into secondary metabolism in thermophiles, and it expands the temperature limitation of NRPS enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A ratiometric fluorescent probe for sensitively tracking peroxynitrite during drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the essential components of reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) plays an indispensable role in redox homeostasis and signal transduction processes, and its deviant levels are associated with numerous clinical diseases. Therefore, accurate and rapid detection of intracellular ONOO&#8208; levels is crucial for revealing its role in physiological and pathological processes. Herein, we constructed a ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect ONOO&#8208; levels in biological systems. The probe represents fast reaction rate (within 15 min), outstanding selectivity, good sensitivity (LOD = 13.32 nM) and stability to ONOO&#8208;, and it was successfully used for visualizing endogenous ONOO&#8208; in living cells. More importantly, it has also been used for tracking the changes of intracellular ONOO&#8208; during drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity with ratiometric fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging&#8208;guided Photothermal Activated Pyroptosis For Precision Therapy Of Glioma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer therapy faces challenges with apoptosis resistance, steering focus towards alternative pathways like pyroptosis. Photothermal therapy (PTT) offers a precise, non&#8208;invasive method to reduce pyroptosis&#8208;related side effects by using NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging for glioma targeting. A polymer semiconductor PTT agent, coated by mesoporous silica, showed potential in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo pyroptosis induction, offering a promising method for glioma therapy.







Abstract
The resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis poses a significant challenge in cancer therapy, driving the exploration of alternative cell death pathways such as pyroptosis, known for its rapid and potent effects. While initial efforts focused on chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis, concerns about systemic inflammation highlight the need for precise activation strategies. Photothermal therapy emerges as a promising non&#8208;invasive technique, minimizing pyroptosis&#8208;related side effects by targeting tumors spatially and temporally. However, accurately pinpointing tumors to avoid collateral damage remains a challenge. Thus, we utilize NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging to achieve precise PTT&#8208;induced pyroptosis activation in glioma. A polymer semiconductor&#8208;based PTT agent was developed with high optical stability, integrated with mesoporous silica to enhance its biocompatibility. These nanoparticles, stabilized through PEG modification and targeted with cRGD peptides, effectively induced pyroptosis in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, this design facilitated precise tumor imaging guidance and subsequent pyroptosis activation in&#8197;vivo, presenting a promising strategy for glioma therapy with minimized adverse effects.

This study clarifies the target protein and MOA of odoamide by an affinity&#8208;based methodology, followed by analyses of the binding protein and odoamide&#8208;resistant cells. We discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of odoamide for drug development.







Abstract
Marine natural products show a large variety of unique chemical structures and potent biological activities. Elucidating the target molecule and the mechanism of action is an essential and challenging step in drug development starting with a natural product. Odoamide, a member of aurilide&#8208;family isolated from Okinawan marine cyanobacterium, has been known to exhibit highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the target protein and the cytotoxic mechanism of odoamide. Compared to existing anticancer agents, odoamide showed a unique fingerprint in the JFCR39 cancer cell panel and a characteristic pattern in gene expression profiling. Affinity chromatography utilizing a biologically active odoamide probe identified ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) as a specific binding protein. Additionally, cells resistant to odoamide were found to have mutations at Gly98 and Gly99 of the ATP1A1 protein. The apparently attenuated cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of odoamide in odoamide&#8208;resistant cells suggests that the induction of these activities by odoamide is critically dependent on its interaction with ATP1A1. We conclude that odoamide induces apoptotic cell death by targeting ATP1A1, and we discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of ATP1A1 inhibitors for drug discovery.

         <title>Revealing the Monooxygenase Mechanism for Selective Ring Cleavage of Anthraquinone by BTG13 through Multiscale Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzyme, BTG13, with a unique coordination of four histidines and a carboxylated&#8208;lysine, was reported to catalyze the C4a&#8208;C10 bond cleavage in anthraquinone. Our calculations demonstrated that it functions as a monooxygenase, inserting oxygen atom into the C10&#8208;C4a bond to form a lactone species, which then undergoes hydrolysis to yield a ring&#8208;opened product.







Abstract
BTG13, a non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzyme with a distinctive coordination environment of four histidines and a carboxylated lysine, has been found to catalyze the cleavage of the C4a&#8208;C10 bond in anthraquinone. Contrary to typical dioxygenase mechanisms, our quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations reveal that BTG13 functions more like a monooxygenase. It selectively inserts an oxygen atom into the C10&#8208;C4a bond, creating a lactone species that subsequently undergoes hydrolysis, leading to the formation of a ring&#8208;opened product. This discovery highlights the unique catalytic properties of BTG13 and expands our understanding of non&#8208;heme iron enzyme mechanisms.

         <title>Recent advances in biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic synthesis of oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to synthetic oligonucleotides is crucial for applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology. Traditional solid phase synthesis is limited by sequence length and complexities, low yields, high costs and poor sustainability. Similarly, polymerase&#8208;based approaches such as in vitro transcription and primer extension reactions do not permit any control on the positioning of modifications and display poor substrate tolerance. In response, biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategies have emerged as promising alternatives, offering selective and efficient pathways for oligonucleotide synthesis. These methods leverage the precision and efficiency of enzymes to construct oligonucleotides with high fidelity. Recent advancements have focused on optimized systems and/or engineered enzymes enabling the incorporation of chemically modified nucleotides. Biocatalytic approaches, particularly those using DNA/RNA polymerases provide advantages in milder reaction conditions and enhanced sustainability. Chemoenzymatic methods, combining chemical synthesis and enzymes, have proven to be effective in overcoming limitations of traditional solid phase synthesis. This review summarizes recent developments in biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategies to construct oligonucleotides, highlighting innovations in enzyme engineering, substrate and reaction condition optimization for various applications. We address crucial details of the methods, their advantages, and limitations as well as important insights for future research directions in oligonucleotide production.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay between C&#945; Methylation and C&#945; Stereochemistry in the Folding Energetics of a Helix&#8208;Rich Miniprotein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparison of the achiral residue 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and chiral &#945;&#8208;methylated analogues as modifications in a helix&#8208;rich miniprotein reveals a synergistic thermodynamic benefit from C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter. These results help inform the use of these monomers in design of helical peptide mimetics and yield new fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;helix is an abundant and functionally important element of protein secondary structure, which has motivated intensive efforts toward chemical strategies to stabilize helical folds. One such method is the incorporation of non&#8208;canonical backbone composition through an additional methyl substituent at the C&#945; atom. Examples of monomers include the achiral 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) with geminal dimethyl substitution and chiral analogues with one methyl and one non&#8208;methyl substituent. While Aib and chiral C&#945;&#8208;Me residues are both established helix promoting moieties, their comparative ability in this regard has not been quantitatively investigated. Addressing this gap would help to inform the use of these building blocks in the construction of peptide and protein mimetics as well as provide fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding. Here, we report a quantitative comparison of the impacts of Aib and chiral &#945;Me residues on the high&#8208;resolution folded structure and folding thermodynamics of a small helical protein. These results reveal a synergistic stabilizing effect arising from the presence of C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the most recent progress of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures based on the scaffolds of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA for biological applications, including gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription, due to their excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Nucleic acid, as a carrier of genetic information, has been widely employed as a building block for the construction of versatile nanostructures with pre&#8208;designed sizes and shapes through complementary base pairing. With excellent programmability, addressability, and biocompatibility, nucleic acid nanostructures are extensively applied in biomedical researches, such as bio&#8208;imaging, bio&#8208;sensing, and drug delivery. Notably, the original gene&#8208;encoding capability of the nucleic acids themselves has been utilized in these structurally well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress in the design of double&#8208;stranded DNA and mRNA&#8208;encoded nanostructures for various biological applications, such as gene regulation, gene expression, and mRNA transcription. Furthermore, the challenges and future opportunities of genetically encoded nucleic acid nanostructures in biomedical applications will be discussed.

         <title>Activation of Caged Functional RNAs by An Oxidative Transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sUrd) in place of uridine (Urd) can exhibit loss of function. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide can convert 2sUrd to Urd. We show that a 2sUrd&#8208;containing aptamer and ribozyme can exhibit recovery of function upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, allowing for redox&#8208;switched functional behavior.







Abstract
RNA exhibits remarkable capacity as a functional polymer, with broader catalytic and ligand&#8208;binding capability than previously thought. Despite this, the low side chain diversity present in nucleic acids (two purines and two pyrimidines) relative to proteins (20+ side chains of varied charge, polarity, and chemical functionality) limits the capacity of functional RNAs to act as environmentally responsive polymers, as is possible for peptide&#8208;based receptors and catalysts. Here we show that incorporation of the modified nucleobase 2&#8208;thiouridine (2sU) into functional (aptamer and ribozyme) RNAs produces functionally inactivated polymers that can be activated by oxidative treatment. 2&#8208;thiouridine lacksthe 2&#8208;position oxygen found in uridine, altering its hydrogen bonding pattern. This limits critical interactions (e.&#8201;g., G&#8722;U wobble pairs) that allow for proper folding. Oxidative desulfurization of the incorporated 2&#8208;thiouridine moieties to uridine relieves this inability to fold properly, enabling recovery of function. This demonstration of expanded roles for RNA as environmentally responsive functional polymers challenges the notion that they are not known to be redox&#8208;sensitive. Harnessing redox switchability in RNA could regulate cellular activities such as translation, or allow switching RNA between a &#8220;template&#8221; and a &#8220;catalytic&#8221; state in &#8220;RNA World&#8221; scenarios or in synthetic biology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA exhibits remarkable capacity as a functional polymer, with broader catalytic and ligand-binding capability than previously thought. Despite this, the low side chain diversity present in nucleic acids (two purines and two pyrimidines) relative to proteins (20+ side chains of varied charge, polarity, and chemical functionality) limits the capacity of functional RNAs to act as environmentally responsive polymers, as is possible for peptide-based receptors and catalysts. Here we show that incorporation of the modified nucleobase 2-thiouridine (2sU) into functional (aptamer and ribozyme) RNAs produces functionally inactivated polymers that can be activated by oxidative treatment. 2-thiouridine lacksthe 2-position oxygen found in uridine, altering its hydrogen bonding pattern. This limits critical interactions (e.&#8201;g., G&#8722;U wobble pairs) that allow for proper folding. Oxidative desulfurization of the incorporated 2-thiouridine moieties to uridine relieves this inability to fold properly, enabling recovery of function. This demonstration of expanded roles for RNA as environmentally responsive functional polymers challenges the notion that they are not known to be redox-sensitive. Harnessing redox switchability in RNA could regulate cellular activities such as translation, or allow switching RNA between a &#8220;template&#8221; and a &#8220;catalytic&#8221; state in &#8220;RNA World&#8221; scenarios or in synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein Fusion of Biosynthetic Enzymes and a Thermo&#8208;Responsive Polypeptide Expedites Facile Access to Biocatalysts for Nucleotide Sugars</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green preparation and recycle avenue to biocatalysts for nucleotide sugars was established by protein fusion and a thermo&#8208;responsive tag. Using this strategy, five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64 and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) were successfully constructed and applied as biocatalysts. In addition, the ELP&#8208;tagged bifunctional enzymes may also be recycled from reaction solution by simple ITC process.







Abstract
Nucleotide sugars (NSs) are essential building blocks for the enzymatic assembly of glycans. In this study, we established a preparation and recycling avenue to the biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs. This approach involves fusing two enzymes into a bifunctional chimera and using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ET64) as a purification tag, which allows for easy recovery of these biocatalysts without the need for chromatography. We successfully constructed and obtained five bifunctional fusion enzymes (GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, ManC&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64) for the synthesis of five common NSs (UDP&#8208;Gal, UDP&#8208;GlcNAc, GDP&#8208;Man, GDP&#8208;Fuc, and CMP&#8208;Neu5Ac). These enzymes were obtained using the Inverse Transition Cycling (ITC) process in yields ranging from 60 to 124&#8197;mg per liter of fermentation. The enzymatic synthesis of NSs was carried out on a scale from hundreds of milligrams to multiple grams using these biocatalysts. Furthermore, we investigated the reusability of these biocatalysts by recycling them from the reaction solution using the ITC process. The recycling of GalK&#8208;USP&#8208;ET64, GlmU&#8208;NahK&#8208;ET64, FKP&#8208;ET64, and NanA&#8208;CSS&#8208;ET64 was effectively achieved for 15, 13, 3, and 4 times, respectively. These biocatalysts could be used not only for the enzymatic synthesis of NSs but also for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycan biomolecules when coupled with glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Proteomic Profiling of Potential E6AP Substrates via Ubiquitin&#8208;based Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Assisted Affinity Enrichment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable E6AP&#8208;Ub conjugate equipped with diazirine moieties (Ub&#8208;DEA), which mimics an essential intermediate in HECT ligase catalyzed ubiquitination and allows covalent substrate trapping by photo&#8208;crosslinking (PCL). We validate our approach in PCL&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (PCL&#8208;AE&#8208;MS) experiments and argue for its general applicability.







Abstract
The ubiquitin (Ub) ligase E6AP, encoded by the UBE3A gene, has been causally associated with human diseases including cervical cancer and Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Yet, our knowledge about disease&#8208;relevant substrates of E6AP is still limited, presumably because at least some of these interactions are rather transient, a phenomenon observed for many enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions. Here, we introduce a novel approach to trap such potential transient interactions by combining a stable E6AP&#8208;Ub conjugate mimicking the active state of this enzyme with photo&#8208;crosslinking (PCL) followed by affinity enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry (AE&#8208;MS). To enable PCL, we equipped Ub with diazirine moieties at distinct positions. We validated our PCL assisted AE&#8208;MS approach by identification of known (e.&#8201;g. PSMD4, UCHL5) and potential new (e.&#8201;g. MSH2) substrates of E6AP. Our findings suggest that PCL assisted AE&#8208;MS is indeed suited to identify substrates of E6AP, thereby providing insights into E6AP&#8208;associated pathologies, and, potentially, of other enzymes of the Ub&#8208;conjugating system.

         <title>Functional Proteins/Peptides Targeting to Clear Amyloid&#8208;&#946; for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clearance of toxic amyloid &#946;&#8208;protein (A&#946;) proteins from the brain has become the preferred therapeutic approach for reversing the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and delaying its clinical course. Anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs have been developed through various mechanisms. This article discussed the current development of anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs and their clinical progress, and then introduced potential drug development targets from both central and peripheral perspectives to develop safer and more effective anti&#8208;A&#946; drugs.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting individuals over the age of 65. It is characterized by impairments in memory, thinking, analytical judgment, visuospatial recognition, and mood. In recent years, the development of protein and peptide drugs targeting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) has gained momentum, with several therapies entering clinical trials and even receiving marketing approval. Novel functional protein and peptide drugs, as the first&#8208;generation immunotherapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases, have pioneered cellular immunotherapy for AD. However, the currently available drugs are associated with toxicity issues, which can lead to serious complications such as cerebral hemorrhage or edema. Consequently, this study examines the potential for a new generation of A&#946;&#8208;targeting drugs to mitigate the side effects of existing treatments and offers innovative perspectives for the advancement of therapies for AD.

Conversion and characterization of the broccoli fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer into a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor for the detection of a small non&#8208;coding RNA, by destabilization of the fluorophore&#8208;binding G&#8208;quadruplex with a micro RNA&#8208;200c&#8208;dependent strand displacement and stabilization approach.







Abstract
In the last decade the important role of small non&#8208;coding RNAs such as micro RNAs (miRs) in gene regulation in healthy and disease states became more and more evident. The miR&#8208;200&#8208;family of miRs has been shown to play a critical role in many diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and could be potentially important for diagnosis and treatment. However, the size of miRs of about ~21&#8211;23&#8197;nt provide challenges for their investigation. Here we report the conversion and optimization of the Broccoli fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA&#8208;aptamer into a specific sensor for miR&#8208;200c using a strand&#8208;displacement design principle. This aptamer can differentiate miR&#8208;200c from its family members whose sequence differ by more than one nucleotide. By adding this in&#8197;vitro transcribed aptamer to RNA extracts from human cells, we can detect miR&#8208;200c in&#8197;vitro in a plate reader assay.

         <title>Evaluation of Multispecific Drugs Based on Patient&#8208;Derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept explores the use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids (PDITOs) as advanced models for evaluating multispecific drugs in cancer research. It highlights PDITOs&#8242; ability to simulate tumor&#8208;immune interactions and discusses their potential for preclinical drug testing, personalized medicine, and overcoming traditional model limitations.







Abstract
The evolution of antitumor drug development has transitioned from single&#8208;agent chemotherapy to targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and more recently, multispecific drugs. These innovative drugs target multiple cellular or molecular pathways simultaneously, offering a more comprehensive anticancer approach and addressing some of the limitations inherent in traditional monotherapies. However, preclinical assessment of multispecific drugs remains challenging, as conventional tumor models often lack the necessary complexity to accurately reflect the interactions between various cell types and targets.

&lt;p&gt;The concept explores the use of patient-derived immunocompetent tumor organoids (PDITOs) as advanced models for evaluating multispecific drugs in cancer research. It highlights PDITOs&#8242; ability to simulate tumor-immune interactions and discusses their potential for preclinical drug testing, personalized medicine, and overcoming traditional model limitations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of antitumor drug development has transitioned from single-agent chemotherapy to targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and more recently, multispecific drugs. These innovative drugs target multiple cellular or molecular pathways simultaneously, offering a more comprehensive anticancer approach and addressing some of the limitations inherent in traditional monotherapies. However, preclinical assessment of multispecific drugs remains challenging, as conventional tumor models often lack the necessary complexity to accurately reflect the interactions between various cell types and targets. Patient-derived immunocompetent tumor organoids (PDITOs), which incorporate both tumor cells and immune cells, present a promising platform for the evaluation of these drugs. Beyond their use in drug evaluation, PDITOs can also be utilized in personalized drug screening and predicting patient-specific treatment outcomes, thus advancing both multispecific drug development and precision medicine. This perspective discusses the current landscape of multispecific drug development and the methodologies for constructing PDITOs. It also addresses the associated challenges and introduces the concept of employing these organoids to optimize the evaluation and rational design of multispecific drug therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic G&#8208;Quadruplexes in the Rous Sarcoma Virus Genome: Scaffolds for Protein Interaction and Potential Anti&#8208;Viral Targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is an onco&#8208;retrovirus that infects avian species such as the chicken (Gallus gallus). RSV is the first oncovirus to be described, and the oncogenic activity of this virus is related to the expression of a tyrosine kinase that induces carcinogenic transformation. Interestingly, we have noted that the RSV genome contains various potential G4&#8208;forming sequences. Among these, two sequences in the GAG and POL genes show high G4&#8208;forming potential. Additionally, the SRC oncogene also harbours a putative G4 forming sequence. In this study, we have characterised the G4 formation and topology in these three loci in the RSV&#8208;DNA. We have found that these sequences form dynamic G4 structures in physiological conditions, and such dynamicity may be associated with their cellular functions. Further, we have also established that these G4s are recognised by G4 interacting small&#8208;molecule ligands and the G4&#8208;stabilising protein nucleolin. The binding of these ligands induces structural shifts in the G4s, leading to changes in structure and stability. Thus, the RSV&#8208;DNA G4s may be further studied as targets to control its infection and oncogenic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Molecular Basis for G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binders to ALS/FTD&#8208;Associated G4C2 Repeats of the C9orf72 Gene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some neurodegenerative disorders can be driven by recurrent mutations in the C9orf72 gene. These sequences can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex secondary structures. Here, by performing in silico investigations coupled with FRET DNA melting assays, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of organic and organometallic C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders.







Abstract
The most recurrent familial cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the presence of an abnormal number of intronic GGGGCC (G4C2) repetitions in the C9orf72 gene, which has been proposed to drive ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that such G4C2 repetitions can fold into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary structures. These G4s have been selectively stabilized by small&#8208;molecule binders, furnishing proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that targeting these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid sequences represents a novel and effective therapeutic strategy to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. However, precise information on the mechanism of action of these compounds is still lacking. Here, by performing in silico investigations, we unraveled the molecular basis for the selectivity of a series of known structurally related C9orf72 G4&#8208;binders. Moreover, we investigated the binding properties of a strong and selective metal&#8208;based G4 stabilizer, the AuI bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex &#8211; Au(TMX)2 &#8211; showing that it moderately stabilizes G4C2 G4 RNA by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) DNA melting assays. Using metadynamics (metaD) simulations, the Au(TMX)2 binding mode and the associated free&#8208;energy landscape were also evaluated. This information paves the way for developing improved compounds to tackle ALS/FTD neurodegenerative disorders.

         <title>Methionine&#8208;Derived Fluorescent Probes Targeting Mitochondria: A Tool for Real&#8208;Time Oxidative Stress Monitoring in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed two pyridinium&#8208;based fluorophores, and among these, the methyl derivative PSSM shows strong turn&#8208;on emission via a PeT mechanism. PSSM demonstrates excellent mitochondrial localization and high selectivity among different Reactive Oxygen Species. It detects exogenous and endogenous HOCl in live cells, supported by structural analysis and imaging studies, making it a valuable tool for investigating oxidative stress at the organelle level.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in both cell signaling and defense mechanisms. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidant, aids the immune response by damaging pathogens. In this study, we developed two pyridinium&#8208;based fluorophores PSSM and PSSE for selective hypochlorite detection. Out of these two fluorescent probes, PSSM shows a strong turn&#8208;on emission via a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) mechanism, excellent mitochondrial localization, and rapid response to HOCl with high selectivity among reactive oxygen species by achieving a detection limit of 2.41&#8197;&#956;M. It successfully detects both exogenous and endogenous HOCl in live cells, enabling the study of HOCl's role at the organelle level. Structural analysis of PSSM via thioether oxidation confirmed by HPLC, NMR and HRMS further supports its specificity. Confocal imaging and flow cytometry studies further highlights its utility in investigating oxidative stress, positioning this fluorophore as a valuable tool for monitoring HOCl imbalances in biological systems.

         <title>Click Hydrogels to Assess Stiffness&#8208;Induced Activation of Pancreatic Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts and Its Impact on Cancer Cell Spreading</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) and migration of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC). Results show that substrate stiffness affects the nuclear localization dynamics of Yes&#8208;associated protein and verify the role of CAFs in promoting PCC migration under an elevated substrate stiffness.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is marked by significant desmoplastic reactions, or the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrices. PDAC stroma has abnormally high stiffness, which alters cancer cell behaviors and creates a barrier for effective drug delivery. Unfortunately, clinical trials using a combination of chemotherapy and matrix&#8208;degrading enzyme have led to disappointing results, as the degradation of stromal tissue likely accelerated the dissemination of cancer cells. High matrix stiffness has been shown to activate cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs), increasing their interaction with pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) through promoting proliferation, migration, and resistance to chemotherapy. With the advance of biomaterials science and engineering, it is now possible to design chemically defined matrices to understand the role of stiffness in activating pancreatic CAFs and how this may alter cancer cell migration. Here, we developed a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of CAFs and migration of PCCs. Our results show that matrix stiffness did not alter matrix deposition from CAFs but affected nuclear localization of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP). Our results also verify the role of CAFs on promoting PCC migration and an elevated substrate stiffness further increased PCC motility.

         <title>4&#8208;O&#8208;Methylglucaric Acid Production from Xylan with Uronic Acid Oxidase and Comparison to Glucaric Acid from Glucose</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beechwood glucuronoxylan was enzymatically hydrolyzed and the resulting 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid by uronic acid oxidase with a yield of 95&#8201;%. High purity (98&#8201;% w/w) 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated from the reaction mixture and was demonstrated to perform similarly to commercial glucaric acid in detergent builder applications.







Abstract
This study describes an enzymatic pathway to produce high purity 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid from xylan, an underutilized fraction of lignocellulosic biomass. Beechwood xylan was enzymatically hydrolysed using a commercial xylanase and an &#945;&#8208;glucuronidase from Amphibacillus xylanus to form 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid, which was then purified by anion exchange chromatography and subsequently oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid using a recombinantly produced uronic acid oxidase from Citrus sinensis. Enzymatic oxidation with uronic acid oxidase afforded 95&#8201;% yield in 72&#8197;hours which is considerably higher than yields previously achieved using a glucooligosaccharide oxidase from Sarocladium strictum. 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated by precipitation and purified by recrystallization. Characterization by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed product identity and high purity (97.8&#8201;% w/w). 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid's performance as a detergent builder was compared to commercial glucaric acid. At 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratios of detergent builder to calcium, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid provided similar calcium sequestration performance to glucaric acid (less than 5&#8201;% difference) at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;10 in the presence of surfactants, including sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate. Given their similar calcium sequestration performance, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid could effectively substitute for glucaric acid in detergent formulations.

         <title>Molecular Insights into the Heme&#8208;Binding Potential of Plant NCR247&#8208;Derived Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme&#8208;binding to Cys&#8208;rich, plant&#8208;derived NCR247 peptides was investigated using biochemical and bioanalytical approaches including UV/Vis and rRaman spectroscopy. The interaction of these disulfide&#8208;bonded peptides plays a critical role in the binding mode with heme. The observations were further substantiated by in silico studies. This investigation redefines perceptions of the heme&#8208;binding capacity of NCR247 peptides.







Abstract
Heme is involved in many critical processes in pathogenic bacteria as iron acquisition by these microorganisms is achieved by either direct uptake of heme or use of heme&#8208;binding proteins called hemophores. Exploring the underlying mechanisms on a molecular level can open new avenues in understanding the host&#8208;pathogen interactions. Any imbalance of the heme concentration has a direct impact on the bacterial growth and survival. Thus, heme&#8208;regulated proteins that are involved in heme homeostasis poise to be promising targets for research. Similarly, naturally occurring compounds, including cysteine&#8208;rich peptides from either plant secondary metabolites or venom toxins from vertebrates and invertebrates, have been studied for their therapeutic potential. NCR247 is such a cysteine&#8208;rich peptide, known to be crucial for nitrogenase activity in M. truncatula and its symbiotic relation with S. meliloti. NCR247&#8208;derived peptides were suggested to serve as high&#8208;affinity heme&#8208;binding molecules with remarkable heme&#8208;capturing properties. A comprehensive biochemical and computational analysis of NCR247&#8208;derived peptides, however, redefines their heme&#8208;binding capacity and consequently their potential therapeutic role.

         <title>Modulation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Cleavage with an Oligo&#8208;Ribonucleoprotein Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic sgRNA structure could be modified by adding oligo DNA. The assembly of oligo&#8208;sgRNA with Cas9 protein (oligo&#8208;RNP) could modulate the Cas9 cleavage on on&#8208;target and off&#8208;target DNA. The oligo&#8208;RNP could be further delivered into mammalian cells for improving genome editing specificity.







Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated protein Cas9 system has been widely used for genome editing. However, the editing or cleavage specificity of CRISPR Cas9 remains a major concern due to the off&#8208;target effects. The existing approaches to control or modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage include engineering Cas9 protein and development of anti&#8208;CRISPR proteins. There are also attempts on direct modification of sgRNA, for example, structural modification via truncation or hairpin design, or chemical modification on sgRNA such as partially replacing RNA with DNA. The above&#8208;mentioned strategies rely on extensive protein engineering and direct chemical or structural modification of sgRNA. In this study, we proposed an indirect method to modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage without modification on Cas9 protein or sgRNA. An oligonucleotide was used to form an RNA&#8208;DNA hybrid structure with the sgRNA spacer, creating steric hindrance during the Cas9 mediated DNA cleavage process. We first introduced a simple and robust method to assemble the oligo&#8208;ribonucleoprotein (oligo&#8208;RNP). Next, the cleavage efficiency of the assembled oligo&#8208;RNP was examined using different oligo lengths in&#8197;vitro. Lastly, we showed that the oligo&#8208;RNP directly delivered into cells could also modulate Cas9 activity inside cells using three model gene targets with reduced off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Construction of Escherichia coli cell factory for efficient synthesis of indigo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigo is widely used in dyes, medicines and semiconductors materials due to its excellent dyeing efficiency, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, anti&#8208;corrosion, and thermostability properties. Here, a biosynthetic pathway for indigo was designed, integrating two enzymes (EcTnaA, MaFMO) into a higher L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;producing the strain Escherichia coli TRP. However, the lower catalytic activity of MaFMO was a bottleneck for increasing indigo titers. To overcome this limitation, the enzyme activity of MaFMO was enhanced through mechanism&#8208;guided rational design. The optimal mutant obtained in this study, MaFMOD197E, whose kcat/Km was 1.34 times that of the wild type, and its specific activity was 2.36 times that of the wild type. In addition, the expression levels of EcTnaA and MaFMOD197E were regulated by optimizing the promoters and increasing the copy number to generate the strain E. coli IND&#8208;13. Finally, in the optimal fermentation conditions (220 rpm, 0.05% Tween&#8208;80), the strain E. coli IND&#8208;13 achieved the indigo titer of 568.52 mg/L in a 5&#8208;L bioreactor, with the yield and productivity of 2.62 mg/g and 12.96 mg/L/h (the highest to date), respectively. The results presented here can lay a foundation for further construction of cell factories for indigo and its derivatives with industrial application potential.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we employed a novel fluorescent probe, RO7304924&#8212;which selectively targets cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R)&#8212;to assess the lateral mobility of CB2R within the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing a functional, untagged receptor variant. Utilizing confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we quantified the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of CB2R, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of RO7304924 as an innovative tool for elucidating the dynamics of this major endocannabinoid&#8208;binding G protein&#8208;coupled receptor.

         <title>Construction of Double&#8208;layered DNA Tiles and Arrays from Double Crossover Motifs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;layered DNA tiles have been constructed from DAE motifs using small circular 42&#8208; or 64&#8208;nt oligonucleotides as scaffolds. 3D DNA planar arrays and porous nanotubes have been further achieved via solution assembly. The chiral index theory was applied to analyze DNA nanotubes for tube perimeter, lateral tube and tile curvature, frame&#8208;rolling structure, etc.







Abstract
DNA double crossover (DX) motifs including DAE (double crossover, antiparallel, even spacing) and DAO (double crossover, antiparallel, odd spacing) are well&#8208;known monolayered DNA building blocks for construction of 2D DNA arrays and tubes in nanoscale and microscale. Compared to the 3D architectures of DNA origami and single&#8208;stranded DNA bricks to build nanoscale 3D bundles, tessellations, gears, castles, etc., designs of double&#8208; and multi&#8208;layers of DX motifs for 3D architectures are still limited. Herein, we report two types of double&#8208;layered tiles derived from DAE motifs with single&#8208;stranded circular 42&#8208; and 64&#8208;nt oligonucleotides as scaffold strands.

     alt="Construction of Double-layered DNA Tiles and Arrays from Double Crossover Motifs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-layered DNA tiles have been constructed from DAE motifs using small circular 42- or 64-nt oligonucleotides as scaffolds. 3D DNA planar arrays and porous nanotubes have been further achieved via solution assembly. The chiral index theory was applied to analyze DNA nanotubes for tube perimeter, lateral tube and tile curvature, frame-rolling structure, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA double crossover (DX) motifs including DAE (double crossover, antiparallel, even spacing) and DAO (double crossover, antiparallel, odd spacing) are well-known monolayered DNA building blocks for construction of 2D DNA arrays and tubes in nanoscale and microscale. Compared to the 3D architectures of DNA origami and single-stranded DNA bricks to build nanoscale 3D bundles, tessellations, gears, castles, etc., designs of double- and multi-layers of DX motifs for 3D architectures are still limited. Herein, we report two types of double-layered tiles derived from DAE motifs with single-stranded circular 42- and 64-nt oligonucleotides as scaffold strands. Further tiling of the tiles generated planar 3D crystalline domains and curved tubes, correspondingly. Finally, we applied the chiral index theory to derive the unit tube parameters of six E-tiling (inter-tile distance of even spacing) tubes and analyzed the causation of difference between these tubes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advance in Sensitive Detection of Demethylase FTO</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO) facilitates the demethylation of m6A in RNA, and its abnormal expression is closely linked to the development of several diseases. This review provides an overview of the progress in FTO detection methods, ranging from traditional approaches to innovative techniques, with a particular emphasis on recently reported advancements.







Abstract
Methylation modification is a critical regulatory mechanism in epigenetics and plays a significant role in various biological processes. N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common modification found in RNA. The fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO) facilitate the demethylation of m6A in RNA, and its abnormal expression is closely linked to the development of several diseases. As a result, FTO has the potential to serve as an important biomarker for clinical disease diagnosis. Despite its significance, there has been a lack of comprehensive reviews addressing advancements in detection methods for the demethylase FTO. This review provides an overview of the progress in FTO detection methods, ranging from traditional approaches to innovative techniques, with a particular emphasis on recently reported advancements. These novel detection methods can be categorized into strategies based on enzymes, functional nucleic acids (FNA), and conformational changes. We summarize the principles and applications of these detection methods and discuss the current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Application of Cas9&#8208;Based Gene Editing to Engineering of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based gene editing facilitates the engineering of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), even in larger biosynthetic gene clusters close to 100 kb. Recently, examples of engineering of NRPSs using evolution&#8208;guided fusion sites have been increasing. The experimentally evaluation of these fusion sites will be accelerated by gene editing technology.







Abstract
Engineering of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) could transform the production of bioactive natural product derivatives. A number of recent reports have described the engineering of NRPSs without marked reductions in yield. Comparative analysis of evolutionarily related NRPSs can provide insights regarding permissive fusion sites for engineering where recombination may occur during evolutionary processes. Studies involving engineering of NRPSs using these recombination sites showed that they have great potential. Moreover, we highlight recent advances in engineering of NRPSs using CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based gene editing technology. The use of Cas9 facilitates the editing of even larger biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) close to or over 100 kb in size by precisely targeting and digesting DNA sequences at specific sites. This technology combined with growing understanding of potential fusion sites from large&#8208;scale informatics analyses will accelerate the scalable exploration of engineered NRPS assembly lines to obtain bioactive natural product derivatives in high yields.

         <title>Advances in Drug Delivery Systems for Atopic Dermatitis Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. AD is incurable and prone to recurrence, and the treatment options are limited, we systematically summarize the current common drug delivery systems (DDS) such as liposomes, hydrogels, and nanoparticles, as well as the design of these drug delivery systems for the treatment of AD, the mechanism of the treatment process, and the advantages compared to traditional therapies.







Abstract
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus and impaired skin barrier function. Advances in drug delivery systems have transformed AD treatment by enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Drug delivery systems such as liposomes, hydrogels, and microneedles enable deeper skin penetration, prolonged drug retention, and controlled release, reducing side effects and treatment frequency. Liposomes improve drug absorption and stability, while hydrogels offer high water content and responsive drug release. Microneedles facilitate painless, localized drug delivery, enhancing patient compliance. These systems address the limitations of traditional therapies like topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants, which are associated with adverse effects and poor patient adherence. Recent innovations include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics targeting immune pathways, demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing inflammation and symptoms. Drug delivery systems offer a safer, more efficient alternative for delivering these advanced therapies. By improving therapeutic outcomes and patient experience, drug delivery systems represent a crucial advancement in AD management.

         <title>Probing Biomolecular Interactions with Paramagnetic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy offers useful opportunities for structural biology. Key techniques such as pseudocontact shifts and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements provide long&#8208;range structural restraints, while dynamic nuclear polarization can amplify NMR signals of large biomolecules in complex environments. The integration of paramagnetic NMR data with computational methods like AlphaFold holds great potential to elucidate large and dynamic biomolecular complexes.







Abstract
Recent advances in computational methods like AlphaFold have transformed structural biology, enabling accurate modeling of protein complexes and driving applications in drug discovery and protein engineering. However, predicting the structure of systems involving weak, transient, or dynamic interactions, or of complexes with disordered regions, remains challenging. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers atomic&#8208;level insights into biomolecular complexes, even in weakly interacting and dynamic systems. Paramagnetic NMR, in particular, provides long&#8208;range structural restraints, easily exceeding distances over 25&#8197;&#197;, making it ideal for studying large protein complexes. Advances in chemical tools for introducing paramagnetic tags into proteins, combined with progress in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, have enhanced the method's utility. This perspective article discusses paramagnetic NMR approaches for analyzing biomolecular complexes in solution and in the solid state, emphasizing quantities like pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Additionally, dynamic nuclear polarization offers a promising method to amplify NMR signals of large complexes, even in complex environments. The integration of AlphaFold protein structure prediction with paramagnetic NMR holds great potential for advancing our understanding of biomolecular interactions.

Abstract
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient endogenous insulin production or impaired sensitivity to insulin. In recent years, a class of incretin&#8208;based hypoglycemic drugs, glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs), have attracted great attention in the management of type&#8197;2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their benefits, including stable glycemic control ability, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction for patients. However, like other peptide drugs, GLP&#8208;1RAs face challenges such as instability, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and immunogenicity, which severely limit their clinical application. In recent years, various strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of GLP&#8208;1RAs, including structural modification and carrier&#8208;mediated delivery. This article briefly introduces the research and application status of several common GLP&#8208;1RAs and their limitations. Taking exendin&#8208;4 as an example, we focus on the research progress of improving bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy based on structural modification and carrier delivery strategies, aiming to provide reference for the development of new GLP&#8208;1RAs treatment systems.

         <title>Oligoadenine Strand Functionalized Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Film Exhibiting pH&#8208;Triggered High&#8208;Degree Inverse Shape Deformations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the formation of parallel duplex A&#8208;motif structures under acidic conditions, oligoadenine strands (A&#8208;strands) functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films exhibited pH&#8208;responsive macroscopic reversal shape deformation.







Abstract
Smart shape&#8208;memory DNA hydrogels, which can respond to various types of external stimuli and undergo macroscopic shape deformations, have shown great potential in various applications. By constructing free&#8208;standing films, the deformation and response properties of these hydrogels can be further enhanced, and visualized deformation can be achieved. However, DNA hydrogels that can exhibit rapid and high&#8208;degree shape deformations, such as the inverse shape deformations, are still lacking. Herein, free&#8208;standing oligoadenine strand&#8208;functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel films were developed that can exhibit reversible and high degree of inverse shape deformation upon cyclic pH changes. The oligoadenine strands exhibit a pH&#8208;stimulated reversible conformational transition between a flexible single&#8208;stranded state and parallel duplex A&#8208;motif structures, resulting in their role change in the film from negatively charged side chains to &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; crosslinking structures, driving a high degree of inverse shape deformation with a relative bending angle change of 223.7&#8201;% of the film, which is more than 5 times that of a film driven by pH&#8208;responsive i&#8208;motif structures, facilitating the development of bilayer hydrogel film actuators with potential in flexible sensors and robots.

         <title>Characterisation of the Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase CYP116B46 from Tepidiphilus thermophilus as a Homogentisic Acid Generating Enzyme and its Conversion to a Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of the CYP116 family of self&#8208;sufficient P450 enzymes in the formation of homegentisic acid from 2&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid was investigated using the thermostable CYP116B46 enzyme from Tepidiphilus thermophilus. The high activity of the enzyme for this reaction demonstrates the domain architecture and structure of this enzyme is suited for efficient oxidative biotransformations.







Abstract
The heme enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYPs) catalyse the selective hydroxylation of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules. There is great interest in applying these enzymes as biocatalysts with a focus on self&#8208;sufficient CYP &#8216;fusion&#8217; enzymes, comprising a single polypeptide chain with the electron transfer components joined to the heme domain. Here we elucidate the function of the self&#8208;sufficient CYP116B46 fusion enzyme, from the thermophilic bacterium Tepidiphilus thermophilus. We demonstrate that it efficiently hydroxylates aromatic organic acids, exemplified by oxidation of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid to homogentisic acid (2,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), an important metabolite in bacterial catabolism. In line with the thermophilic nature of the source bacterium, activity increased at higher temperatures, (50&#8201;&#176;C), with a catalytic preference for NADPH over NADH. While self&#8208;sufficient fusion enzymes simplify biocatalysis; engineered peroxygenase activity is also a key advance in the application of these enzymes as biocatalysts as it eliminates the need for electron transfer partner proteins and nicotinamide cofactors. We demonstrate that a T278E mutation in the heme domain of CYP116B46, confers peroxygenase activity. This engineered peroxygenase enzyme is stable to elevated temperatures and catalytic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, with an observed optimal activity resulting in a total turnover number of ~650.

         <title>Structural and Functional Mimicry of the Antimicrobial Defensin Plectasin by Analogues with Engineered Backbone Composition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone engineering in the disulfide&#8208;rich miniprotein plectasin, a Lipid&#8208;II binding antimicrobial defensin, leads to proteomimetic analogues that reproduce the fold and function of the natural product on scaffolds with improved stability to degradation by protease enzymes.







Abstract
The threat posed by bacteria resistant to common antibiotics creates an urgent need for novel antimicrobials. Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide natural products that bind Lipid II, such as vancomycin, represent a promising source for such agents. The fungal defensin plectasin is one of a family of ribosomally produced miniproteins that also exert antimicrobial activity via Lipid II binding. Made up entirely of canonical amino acids, these molecules are potentially more susceptible to degradation by protease enzymes than non&#8208;ribosomal counterparts. Here, we report the development of proteomimetic variants of plectasin through the systematic incorporation of artificial backbone connectivity in the domain. An iterative secondary&#8208;structure&#8208;based design scheme yields a variant with a tertiary fold indistinguishable from the prototype natural product, potent activity against Gram positive bacteria, and low mammalian cell toxicity. Backbone modification is shown to improve oxidative folding efficiency of the disulfide&#8208;rich scaffold as well as resistance to proteolytic hydrolysis. These results broaden the scope of design strategies toward protein mimetics as well as folds and biological functions possible in such agents.

         <title>Entrapment of Lipase from Candida antarctica in a Xerogel for the Production of Biodiesel from Waste Cooking Oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methodology to synthesize a silica&#8208;based xerogel and immobilize the lipase from Candida antarctica (CALB) by entrapment, keeping its stability and activity without leaching. The modified status of the xerogel, from solid bloc to solid powder, brings better reagent diffusion as shown in the production of biodiesel with repetitive reuse.







Abstract
The process to synthesize biodiesel is well&#8208;developed and optimized to overcome the disadvantages like the competition with agriculture using feedstock, and the problematics in the process. Oils from waste and enzymatic catalysis have proven to be good solutions to these problems. Lipases are currently the most commonly used enzymes in the transesterification of oils; nevertheless, enzymes have a high cost and must be immobilized to offer repetitive reuse. This work focuses on the synthesis and the optimization of the conditions of a xerogel where the lipase from Candida antarctica is immobilized by entrapment. The xerogel synthesized here, a glass&#8208;like material, proved to be very effective in maintaining the enzyme on its structure, with an immobilization yield of 96&#8201;% and an activity of 5.3&#8197;U/mg (free lipase=12.1&#8197;U/mg). By grinding this xerogel, the immobilization yield remained constant (94&#8201;%). Nevertheless, grinding the xerogel allowed better diffusion of reagents, and the activity reached 9.7&#8197;U/mg. Using this xerogel in biodiesel production had a positive effect on CALB efficiency by increasing the biodiesel yield, 46.1&#8201;% against 15.1&#8201;% with free CALB. Finally, the catalyst could be reused for five runs without loss of activity.

         <title>Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluation of Tanshinone Mimic Conjugates for Mechanism of Action Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small array of Tanshinone Mimics (TM) probes with a detection&#8208;promoting moiety (either a photoaffinity probe &#8208; PAP or biotin) has been synthesized for mechanism of action (MoA) studies on Human antigen R (HuR). Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates. Among these, biotinylated probe 5&#8201;a proved to be the most promising compound.







Abstract
Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) belonging to the ELAV (Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision) family, which stabilizes mRNAs and regulates the expression of multiple genes. Its altered expression or localization is related to pathological features such as cancer or inflammation. Dihydrotanshinone I (DHTS I) is a naturally occurring, tetracyclic ortho&#8208;quinone inhibitor of the HuR&#8208;mRNA interaction. Our earlier efforts led to the identification of a synthetic Tanshinone Mimic (TM) 2 with improved affinity for HuR. Here we report five new TM probes 3&#8211;5 bearing a detection&#8208;promoting moiety (either photo affinity probe &#8208; PAP or biotin) as a para&#8208;substituent on the phenyl&#8208;sulphonamide for mechanism of action (MoA) studies. Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates 3&#8211;5. They showed similar toxic activity in HuR&#8208;expressing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, with micromolar CC50s. REMSAs revealed that photoactivatable groups (4&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b), but not biotin (5&#8201;a and 5&#8201;b), prevented conjugates&#8217; ability to disrupt rHuR&#8208;RNA complexes. Further biochemical studies confirmed that biotinylated probes, in particular 5&#8201;a, can be used to isolate rM1&#8197;M2 from solutions, taking advantage of streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads, thus being the most promising HuR inhibitor to be used for further MoA studies in cell lysates.

Here we report five new TM probes &lt;b&gt;3&#8211;5&lt;/b&gt; bearing a detection-promoting moiety (either photo affinity probe - PAP or biotin) as a para-substituent on the phenyl-sulphonamide for mechanism of action (MoA) studies. Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates &lt;b&gt;3&#8211;5&lt;/b&gt;. They showed similar toxic activity in HuR-expressing triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, with micromolar CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;s. REMSAs revealed that photoactivatable groups (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), but not biotin (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), prevented conjugates&#8217; ability to disrupt rHuR-RNA complexes. Further biochemical studies confirmed that biotinylated probes, in particular &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, can be used to isolate rM1&#8197;M2 from solutions, taking advantage of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, thus being the most promising HuR inhibitor to be used for further MoA studies in cell lysates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Research Status and Applications of Adeno&#8208;Associated Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in adeno&#8208;associated viruses (AAV). Our objective is to conclude information regarding the characterization of AAVs and to emphasize the latest advancements in their applications within ocular, muscular, liver, and central nervous system disorders.







Abstract
Adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a powerful and effective tool for the delivery of exogenous genes into various cells or tissues. To improve the gene delivery efficiency, as well as the safety and specificity of AAV&#8242;s cell&#8208;targeting capabilities, extensive investigations have been conducted into its molecular biological characteristics, including capsid structure, cellular tropism, and the mechanisms underlying its entry, replication, DNA packaging, and capsid assembly. Significant differences exist between human and non&#8208;human primate AAVs regarding tissue targeting and transduction efficiency. These differences are primarily attributed to the amino acid sequences of AAV capsid proteins, the structural characteristics of these proteins, and the interactions of AAV with surface factors on host cells, such as cell surface receptors, signaling molecules, and associated proteins. This review primarily focuses on several key aspects of AAV, including its genome, coat proteins and their structures, genome replication, virus assembly, and the role of helper viruses. Additionally, it examines the utilization of recombinant adeno&#8208;associated viruses (rAAV), detailing their production methods, mechanisms of cell entry and trafficking, and various serotypes. The review further interprets the role of rAAV by analyzing its current applications in research and therapy.

         <title>Multiphoton Excited Fluorescence Imaging over Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with multiphoton excited fluorescence (MPEF) properties are designed through ligand design, pore modification, and crystal engineering strategies, which can be used for two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) imaging or high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence (H&#8208;MPEF) imaging. These approaches endow MPEF&#8208;MOFs with lower photodamage, stronger fluorescence intensity, and deeper tissue penetration character.







Abstract
Multiphoton excited fluorescence (MPEF) imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing biological processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous materials composed of metal ions or clusters coordinated with organic ligands, have recently gained attention for their unique optical properties and potential applications in MPEF imaging. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design, synthesis, and applications of multiphoton excited fluorescence imaging using MOFs. We discuss the principles behind the fluorescence behavior of MOFs, explore strategies to enhance their photophysical properties, and showcase their applications in bioimaging. Additionally, we address the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the potential of multiphoton excited fluorescence imaging by MOFs for advancing our understanding of complex biological processes.

         <title>d&#8208;Galactose&#8208;Esterification of a Fungal Polyketide Catalyzed by a Carnitine Acyltransferase Domain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TrgA, a highly reducing polyketide synthase bearing a C&#8208;terminal carnitine acyltransferase domain (cAT), is heterologously reconstituted to biosynthesize trichogalactin. The cAT domain of TrgA offloads and esterifies the polyketide product with d&#8208;galactose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Dephosphorylation of TrgA product by an alkaline phosphatase completes the biosynthesis of the d&#8208;galactose&#8208;esterified polyketide.







Abstract
While sugar&#8208;containing natural products are commonly biosynthesized via glycosyltranferases using sugar&#8208;UDP as the electrophile, nature has evolved alternative strategies of glyco&#8208;modification to expand the diversity of natural products. Hydroxyl groups on sugars can serve as nucleophiles in the release of polyketide products from polyketide synthases. Herein, we demonstrate a highly reducing polyketide synthase (HRPKS) from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum T22, which is terminated with a carnitine acyltransferase (cAT) domain, catalyzes the biosynthesis of a d&#8208;galactose esterified polyketide named as trichogalactin. Structure&#8208;guided enzymatic assays showed that the sugar nucleophile in the esterification reaction catalyzed by cAT is &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;galactose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P) instead of free d&#8208;galactose. The released product, trichogalactin phosphate, is subsequently dephosphorylated by a host alkaline phosphatase to complete the biosynthesis of trichogalactin. The cAT domain is highly specific for Gal&#8208;1&#8208;P and does not accept &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate or &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Our study expands the inventory of natural products from an agriculturally important fungus and demonstrates the potential of mining cAT&#8208;containing HRPKSs to discover new glyco&#8208;esterified natural products.

         <title>Protein&#8208;metabolite Interactions Based on Chemical Targeting Methods</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing detectable signals for specific interactions plays a crucial role in elucidating protein&#8208;metabolite interaction networks. This article outlines the chemical targeting strategies and the applications in discovering and elucidating pathways of protein&#8208;metabolite interactions.







Abstract
The importance of the protein&#8208;metabolite interaction network extends beyond its relevance to life sciences focused on proteins, it also profoundly influences its mechanisms related to disease targets, drug screening, and clinical diagnosis and treatment. Research methods targeting protein&#8208;metabolite interaction focus on enhancing the detectable signals of specific interactions by examining the structural characteristics of both proteins and metabolites in conjunction with chemical molecules, playing a crucial role in elucidating the protein&#8208;metabolite interaction network. Consequently, this article outlines several chemical targeting strategies developed in recent years and provides examples of their applications in the discovery and interpretation of new protein&#8208;metabolite interaction pathways. Finally, a brief summary will be presented regarding technological advances, research prospects, and current challenges of protein&#8208;metabolite interaction research.

         <title>Novel Approaches in Targeting Cell Surface and Secreted Proteins for Lysosomal Degradation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TransTAC&#8208;mediated membrane protein degradation via the lysosome. TransTACs are small molecules that trigger the engagement between transferrin receptor (TfR1) and the target protein on the cell membrane surface resulting in co&#8208;internalization of the target protein and TfR1 to early endosomes and subsequently shuttling of the target protein for lysosomal degradation.







Abstract
Protein degradation is pivotal for all biochemical aspects of cellular function. In mammalian cells, protein degradation is mediated mainly by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic&#8208;lysosomal system (ALS). Over the last two decades, different types of targeted protein degradation approaches have been developed including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs), which employ the UPS to degrade intracellular proteins and the ALS to degrade extracellular and membrane proteins respectively. Nevertheless, Current targeted membrane protein degradation approaches face some inherent challenges including limited target protein degradation efficacy and cell type specific applicability. Herein, we highlight some recent developments of novel targeted membrane protein degradation modalities that exhibit wide&#8208;applicability and high protein degradation efficiency. These novel membrane protein degraders hold tremendous promise as new pharmacological and biochemical tools in targeting membrane and secretory proteins for lysosomal degradation.

         <title>Advanced Synthesis of Spherical Nucleic Acids: A Limit&#8208;Pursuing Game with Broad Implications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, the synthesis of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), an important class of bionanomaterials with widespread uses, has been greatly advanced toward reduced time consumption and record&#8208;high DNA densities. Starting from the classical salt&#8208;aging method, this concept introduces the innovative strategies based on low&#8208;pH, freezing&#8208;thawing, and dehydration conditions toward high quality SNA synthesis, with a focus on their mechanistic understanding and wide implications to various future pursuits.







Abstract
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consist of DNA strands arranged radially and packed densely on the surface of nanoparticles. Due to their unique properties, which are not found in naturally occurring linear or circular DNA, SNAs have gained widespread attention in fields such as sensing, nanomedicine, and colloidal assembly. The rapidly evolving applications of SNAs have driven a modernization of their syntheses to meet different needs. Recently, several advanced approaches have emerged, enabling ultrafast, quantitative, and low&#8208;cost SNA synthesis with maximal DNA grafting through &#8220;counterintuitive&#8221; processes like freezing and dehydration. This concept paper discusses these critical developments from a synthetic perspective, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and broad implications, with a goal of inspiring future research in related fields.

         <title>Detecting the Undetectable: Advances in Methods for Identifying Small Tau Aggregates in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores current methods for detecting and characterising small tau aggregates, which are increasingly recognised as key drivers of neurotoxicity in tauopathies. It discusses emerging techniques such as single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down (SiMPull), single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), and cryo&#8208;electron tomography (cryo&#8208;ET), highlighting their potential to improve our understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer's where traditional methods fall short.







Abstract
Tau, a microtubule&#8208;associated protein, plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal structure and function. However, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, tau misfolds and aggregates into oligomers and fibrils, leading to neuronal damage. Tau oligomers are increasingly recognised as the most neurotoxic species, inducing synaptic dysfunction and contributing to disease progression. Detecting these early&#8208;stage aggregates is challenging due to their low concentration and high heterogeneity in biological samples. Traditional methods such as immunostaining and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) lack the sensitivity and specificity to reliably detect small tau aggregates. Advanced single&#8208;molecule approaches, including single&#8208;molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down (SiMPull), offer improved sensitivity for studying tau aggregation at the molecular level. These emerging tools provide critical insights into tau pathology, enabling earlier detection and characterisation of disease&#8208;relevant aggregates, thereby offering potential for the development of targeted therapies and diagnostic approaches for tauopathies.

         <title>177Lu Radiolabeled Polydopamine Decorated with Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor for Locoregional Treatment of Glioma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine (PDA) was conjugated with fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) and macrocyclic chelator (DOTA) for specific cancer targeting and 177Lu labeling. The synthesized nanoradiopharmaceutical, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI, demonstrated satisfactory antitumor ability after intratumoral injection to U87MG tumor&#8208;bearing mice. In contrast, intravenous injection did not result in noticeable tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
Radionuclide therapy is expected to be a powerful tool for glioma treatment. Here, we introduced a novel nuclear nanomedicine based on polydopamine (PDA), incorporating fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) and macrocyclic chelator (DOTA) for specific cancer targeting and 177Lu labeling. The synthesized nanoradiopharmaceutical, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI, exhibits good stability in serum, saline and PBS over 5&#8197;days. 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI shows efficient specific uptake and internalization when incubated with U87MG cells. In vivo distribution visualized prominent accumulation and long retention ability of 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI at tumor sites after local administration. Moreover, 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PDA&#8208;FAPI has satisfactory antitumor ability without apparent toxic and side effects observed from therapy assay and H&amp;E staining. This study highlights the feasibility of using PDA as a nanocarrier for glioma endoradiotherapy by targeting fibroblast activation protein.

         <title>Flow Cytometric Analysis for Evaluating Protein Synthesis Efficiency in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles with Charged Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GFP synthesis using reconstituted cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (PURE system) in artificial cells composed of charged lipids showed lower GFP synthesis efficiency compared to neutral lipids. This reduced efficiency was restored when both positive and negative charges were introduced to the lipid membrane, neutralizing the overall charge.







Abstract
Quantitative investigation of the relationship between endosomal translation reactions and phospholipid membrane composition is crucial for enhancing protein translation efficiency in artificial cells. In this study, we quantitatively compared the translation reactions within liposomes containing negatively and positively charged lipids using green fluorescent protein fluorescence as an indicator to investigate whether lipid membrane charge affects translation reaction efficiency in artificial cells. Thus, translation efficiency reduced in liposomes containing both negatively and positively charged lipids. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the percentage of liposomes undergoing translational reactions was reduced by the charged phospholipids. This translation reaction inhibition was alleviated by adding equal amounts of negatively and positively charged lipids, indicating that phospholipid membrane charges affected translation reaction efficiency. The relationship between membrane composition and translation reaction efficiency identified in this study is significant for the constructing complex artificial cells, particularly concerning membrane composition design

         <title>A Mn(salen)&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzyme for Nitrene and Oxene Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(salen)&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) were constructed by embedding biotinylated Mn(salen) complexes into streptavidin. Their activities were improved by genetic optimization of protein scaffold and the ArM variants catalyzed the aziridination of styrene and oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with up to 19 and 146 turnover numbers.







Abstract
The development of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) offers a potent approach to incorporate non&#8208;natural chemical reactions into biocatalysis. Here we report the assembly of Mn(salen)&#8208;based ArMs by embedding biotinylated Mn(salen) complexes into streptavidin (Sav) variants. Using commercially available nitrene and oxo transfer reagents, these biohybrid catalysts catalyzed the aziridination of alkenes and oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with up to 19 and 146 turnover numbers.

Comparative studies of histidine proton occupancy in Human Carbonic Anhydrase II using NMR spectroscopy and neutron protein crystallography.







Abstract
Histidine is a key amino&#8208;acid residues in proteins that can exist in three different protonation states: two different neutral tautomeric forms and a protonated, positively charged one. It can act as both donor and acceptor of hydrogen bonds, coordinate metal ions, and engage in acid/base catalysis. Human Carbonic Anhydrase II (HCA II) is a pivotal enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. It contains 12 histidine residues: six are surface exposed, two buried, three are active site zinc ion ligands, and one is a proton shuttle. Comparing results from NMR spectroscopy with previously determined neutron protein crystal structures enabled a side&#8208;by&#8208;side investigation of the proton occupancies and preferred tautomeric states of the histidine residues in HCA II. Buried and zinc coordinating histidines remain in one neutral tautomeric state across the entire pH range studied, as validated by both methods. In contrast, solvent&#8208;exposed histidines display high variability in proton occupancies. While the data were overall remarkably consistent between methods, some discrepancies were observed, shedding light on the limitations of each technique. Therefore, combining these methods with full awareness of the advantages and drawbacks of each, provides insights into the dynamic protonation landscape of HCA II histidines, crucial for elucidating enzyme catalytic mechanisms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histidine is a key amino-acid residues in proteins that can exist in three different protonation states: two different neutral tautomeric forms and a protonated, positively charged one. It can act as both donor and acceptor of hydrogen bonds, coordinate metal ions, and engage in acid/base catalysis. Human Carbonic Anhydrase II (HCA II) is a pivotal enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. It contains 12 histidine residues: six are surface exposed, two buried, three are active site zinc ion ligands, and one is a proton shuttle. Comparing results from NMR spectroscopy with previously determined neutron protein crystal structures enabled a side-by-side investigation of the proton occupancies and preferred tautomeric states of the histidine residues in HCA II.

         <title>Navigating The Deuteration Landscape: Innovations, Challenges, and Clinical Potential of Deuterioindoles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuteroindole as a focal point, this review traces the evolution of deuterium chemistry from its discovery to clinical applications. It highlights how deuterium enhances drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, envisions its transformative role in precision medicine, and addresses challenges in synthesis, intellectual property, and regulation, while underscoring its broader impact across scientific disciplines.







Abstract
Indoles, pivotal to the realm of drug discovery, underpin numerous FDA&#8208;approved therapeutics. Despite their clinical benefits, pharmacokinetic and toxicity concerns have occasionally hampered their broader application. A notable advancement in this domain is the substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium, known as deuterium modification, which significantly enhances the pharmacological properties of these compounds. This review elucidates the progression of deuterium chemistry, culminating in approval of Deutetrabenazine in 2017. This milestone has catalyzed additional research into deuterated indoles, such as Dosimertinib, which have demonstrated enhancements in stability, toxicity profiles, and therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the review addresses challenges and patent issues in the synthesis of deuterated indoles and highlights their potential applications in precision medicine. In the future, deuterated indoles may positively impact therapy and contribute to advances in precision medicine through molecular engineering.

Using specialized hydrogels, ExM could achieve super&#8208;resolution imaging on conventional microscope, thus permitting detailed examination of fine structures of cells and tissue sections by anchoring large biological molecules. This review highlights ExM's potential in biomedicine and provides insights into its future development prospects.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) is an innovative super&#8208;resolution imaging technique that utilizes physical expansion to magnify biological samples, facilitating the visualization of cellular structures that are challenging to observe using traditional optical microscopes. The fundamental principle of ExM revolves around employing a specialized hydrogel to uniformly expand biological samples, thereby achieving super&#8208;resolution imaging under conventional optical imaging conditions. This technology finds application not only in various biological samples such as cells and tissue sections, but also enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of large biological molecules including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolite molecules. In recent years, numerous researchers have delved into ExM, resulting in the continuous development of a range of derivative technologies that optimize experimental protocols and broaden practical application fields. This article presents a comprehensive review of these derivative technologies, highlighting the utilization of ExM for anchoring nucleic acids, proteins, and other biological molecules, as well as its applications in biomedicine. Furthermore, this review offers insights into the future development prospects of ExM technology.

         <title>Deciphering the Interplay Between G&#8208;Quadruplexes and Natural/Synthetic Polyamines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though PAs are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G4s are transient regulatory elements. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G4s and biogenic polyamines or synthetic G4 ligands containing polyamines. This work will assist to understand the biological impact of the association between G4s and natural/synthetic PAs.







Abstract
The interplay between polyamines and G&#8208;quadruplexes has been largely overlooked in the literature, even though polyamines are ubiquitous metabolites in living cells and G&#8208;quadruplexes are transient regulatory elements, being both of them key regulators of biological processes. Herein, we compile the investigations connecting G&#8208;quadruplexes and biogenic polyamines to understand the biological interplay between them. Moreover, we overview the main works focused on synthetic ligands containing polyamines designed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes, aiming to unravel the structural motifs for designing potent and selective G4 ligands.

         <title>Towards Next Generation Protein Sequencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein sequencing is essential for understanding protein structure and function. Recently, nanopore protein sequencing has rapidly emerged as a research hotspot, offering single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level detection accuracy. It also shows great potential to become the mainstream method for next&#8208;generation protein sequencing.







Abstract
Understanding the structure and function of proteins is a critical objective in the life sciences. Protein sequencing, a central aspect of this endeavor, was first accomplished through Edman degradation in the 1950s. Since the late 20th&#8197;century, mass spectrometry has emerged as a prominent method for protein sequencing. In recent years, single&#8208;molecule technologies have increasingly been applied to this field, yielding numerous innovative results. Among these, nanopore sensing has proven to be a reliable single&#8208;molecule technology, enabling advancements in amino acid recognition, short peptide differentiation, and peptide sequence reading. These developments are set to elevate protein sequencing technology to new heights. The next generation of protein sequencing technologies is anticipated to revolutionize our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biological processes and significantly enhance clinical diagnostics and treatments.

         <dc:description>
This review explores the transformative integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems for biosensing and therapeutic applications. It covers advances in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, detailing synthesis methods, functional classifications, and applications in detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Emphasis is placed on the unique synergies between DNA and nanomaterials, addressing challenges, and forecasting future opportunities in precision medicine.







Abstract
The integration of nanomaterials with DNA&#8208;based systems has emerged as a transformative approach in biosensing and therapeutic applications. Unique features of DNA, like its programmability and specificity, complement the diverse functions of nanomaterials, leading to the creation of advanced systems for detecting biomarkers and delivering treatments. Here, we review the developments in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates, emphasizing their enhanced functionalities and potential across various biomedical applications. We first discuss the methodologies for synthesizing these conjugates, distinguishing between covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. We then categorize DNA&#8208;nanomaterials conjugates based on the properties of the DNA and nanomaterials involved, respectively. DNA probes are classified by their application into biosensing or therapeutic uses, and, several nanomaterials are highlighted by their recent progress in living biological. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field, anticipating that significant progress in DNA&#8208;nanomaterial conjugates will greatly enhance precision medicine.

         <title>Nanomaterial&#8208;Enhanced Red Blood Cell Biopreservation: From Refrigeration to Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are crucial in clinical and military medicine, but preservation is challenged by storage&#8208;induced damage. Traditional methods have limited effectiveness, while nanomaterials offer a promising alternative. This review examines storage and cryolesions, evaluates nanomaterials&#8217; potential to mitigate damage, and discusses key challenges in improving RBC biopreservation strategies.







Abstract
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions represent a cornerstone of clinical practice, with RBCs constituting the primary component in transfusion therapy. Extending the preservation of RBCs while maintaining their functional integrity would offer considerable advancements for both transfusion medicine and military healthcare. Despite decades of research, progress in achieving long&#8208;term RBC preservation has been limited. A key challenge is the range of physical and biochemical damage RBCs incur during storage, leading to marked changes in their morphology, physiological function, and viability. While traditional preservation techniques have provided partial mitigation of these damages, their efficacy remains suboptimal. In contrast, nanomaterials, with their distinctive spatial architectures and surface properties, offer a promising avenue for minimizing storage&#8208;related damage and extending RBC preservation. This review provides an overview of the major categories of damage encountered during RBC biopreservation, classified into storage lesions and cryolesions. We also highlight the key role of nanomaterials in enhancing the storage quality of RBCs and prolonging their preservation duration. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and pressing issues faced by nanomaterial&#8208;based RBCs biopreservation.
