         <title>On the Weak Binding and Spectroscopic Signature of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 Interaction with RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of nsp14 protein with nascent RNA for the removal of mismatched nucleotide from the newly synthesized RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is reported.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 non&#8208;structural protein 14 (nsp14), known as exoribonuclease is encoded from the large polyprotein of viral genome and is a major constituent of the transcription replication complex (TRC) machinery of the viral RNA synthesis. This protein is highly conserved among the coronaviruses and is a potential target for the development of a therapeutic drug. Here, we report the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nsp14 expression, show its structural characterization, and ss&#8208;RNA exonuclease activity through vibrational and electronic spectroscopies. The deconvolution of amide&#8208;I band in the FTIR spectrum of the protein revealed a composition of 35&#8201;% &#945;&#8208;helix and 25&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;sheets. The binding between protein and RNA is evidenced from the spectral changes in the amide&#8208;I region of the nsp14, showing protein conformational changes during the binding process. A value of 20.60&#177;3.81&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 of the binding constant (KD) is obtained for nsp14/RNA complex. The findings reported here can motivate further studies to develop structural models for better understanding the mechanism of exonuclease enzymes for correcting the viral genome and can help in the development of drugs against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Structural Studies Provide New Insights into the Role of Lysine Acetylation on Substrate Recognition by CARM1 and Inform the Design of Potent Peptidomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidomimetics based on the histone H3 tail peptide were used in co&#8208;crystallization studies with coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) to investigate the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. These findings also provide new insights into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation and the development of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of CARM1.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin provides a communication system for the regulation of gene expression. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role that such crosstalk between PTMs plays in chromatin recognition. In this study, (bio)chemical and structural approaches were applied to specifically probe the impact of acetylation of Lys18 in the histone H3 tail peptide on peptide recognition by the protein methyltransferase coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). Peptidomimetics that recapitulate the transition state of protein arginine N&#8208;methyltransferases, were designed based on the H3 peptide wherein the target Arg17 was flanked by either a free or an acetylated lysine. Structural studies with these peptidomimetics and the catalytic domain of CARM1 provide new insights into the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. While the co&#8208;crystal structures reveal that lysine acetylation results in minor conformational differences for both CARM1 and the H3 peptide, acetylation of Lys18 does lead to additional interactions (Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) and likely reduces the cost of desolvation upon binding, resulting in increased affinity. Informed by these findings a series of smaller peptidomimetics were also prepared and found to maintain potent and selective CARM1 inhibition. These findings provide new insights both into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation as well as towards the development of peptidomimetic CARM1 inhibitors.

         <title>Harnessing Fluorescent Moenomycin A Antibiotics for Bacterial Cell Wall Imaging Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moenomycin A (MoeA)&#8208;based fluorescent probes were developed for imaging the bacterial cell wall through specific labeling of transglycosylases. The strategy provided stunning imaging probes for mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains.







Abstract
The imaging of peptidoglycan (PGN) dynamics in living bacteria facilitates the understanding of PGN biosynthesis and wall&#8208;targeting antibiotics. The main tools for imaging bacterial PGN are fluorescent probes, such as the well&#8208;known PGN metabolic labeling probes. However, fluorescent small&#8208;molecule probes for labeling key PGN&#8208;synthesizing enzymes, especially for transglycosylases (TGases), remain to be explored. In this work, the first imaging probe for labeling TGase in bacterial cell wall studies is reported. We synthesized various fluorescent MoeA&#8208;based molecules by derivatizing the natural antibiotic moenomycin A (MoeA), and used them to label TGases in living bacteria, monitor bacterial growth and division cycles by time&#8208;lapse imaging, and study cell wall growth in the mecA&#8208;carrying methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains when the &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based probes were unsuitable.

         <title>The Diverse Antimicrobial Activities of Human Milk Oligosaccharides against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exert various activities against Group B Streptococcus (GBS) including inhibition of bacterial growth, enhanced penetrance, and efficacy of antibiotics via bacterial cell permeabilization, and inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation. This review discusses the most recent studies on the interaction between HMOs and GBS.







Abstract
Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathobiont that is the etiological cause of severe perinatal infections. GBS can colonize the vagina of pregnant patients and invade tissues causing ascending infections of the gravid reproductive tract that lead to adverse outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal or fetal demise. Additionally, transmission of GBS during labor or breastfeeding can also cause invasive infections of neonates and infants. However, human milk has also been shown to have protective effects against infection; a characteristic that is likely derived from antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of molecules that comprise human milk. Recent evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), short&#8208;chain sugars that comprise 8&#8211;20&#8201;% of breast milk, have antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and other bacterial pathogens. Additionally, HMOs have been shown to potentiate the activity of antibiotics against GBS. This review presents the most recent published work that studies the interaction between HMOs and GBS.

         <title>Peptides derived from vascular endothelial growth factor B show potent binding to neuropilin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate significant pathways in angiogenesis, myocardial and neuronal protection, metabolism, and cancer progression. The VEGF&#8208;B isoform is involved in cell survival, anti&#8208;apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms, through binding to VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin&#8208;1 (NRP&#8208;1).  We employed surface plasmon resonance technology and X&#8208;ray crystallography to analyse the molecular basis of the interaction between VEGF&#8208;B and the b1 domain of NRP&#8208;1, and developed VEGF&#8208;B &#8211; C&#8208;terminus derived peptides to be used as chemical tools for studying VEGF&#8208;B &#8211; NRP&#8208;1 related pathways.  Peptide lipidation was used as a means to stabilise the peptides. VEGF&#8208;B &#8211; derived peptides containing a C&#8208;terminal arginine show potent binding to NRP1&#8208;b1. Peptide lipidation increased binding residence time and improved plasma stability. A crystal structure of a peptide with NRP&#8208;1 demonstrated that VEGF&#8208;B peptides bind at the canonical C&#8208;terminal Arginine binding site. VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus imparts higher affinity for NRP&#8208;1 than the corresponding VEGF&#8208;A  165  region. This tight binding may impact on the activity and selectivity of the full&#8208;length protein. The VEGF&#8208;B  167  derived peptides were more effective than VEGF&#8208;A  165  peptides in blocking functional phosphorylation events. Blockers of VEGF&#8208;B function have potential applications in diabetes and non&#8208;alcoholic fatty liver disease.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate significant pathways in angiogenesis, myocardial and neuronal protection, metabolism, and cancer progression. The VEGF-B isoform is involved in cell survival, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms, through binding to VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1).  We employed surface plasmon resonance technology and X-ray crystallography to analyse the molecular basis of the interaction between VEGF-B and the b1 domain of NRP-1, and developed VEGF-B &#8211; C-terminus derived peptides to be used as chemical tools for studying VEGF-B &#8211; NRP-1 related pathways.

A crystal structure of a peptide with NRP-1 demonstrated that VEGF-B peptides bind at the canonical C-terminal Arginine binding site. VEGF-B C-terminus imparts higher affinity for NRP-1 than the corresponding VEGF-A  165  region. This tight binding may impact on the activity and selectivity of the full-length protein.

         <title>Xanthopsin&#8208;like Systems via Site&#8208;Specific Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Retinoic Acid Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of light&#8208;responsive proteins to control both living or synthetic cells, is at the core of the expanding fields of optogenetics and synthetic biology. It is thus apparent that a richer reaction toolbox for the preparation of such systems is of fundamental importance. Here, we provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration that Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed to perform a facile site&#8208;specific, irreversible and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket and yielding an unnatural chromophore with an extended &#960;&#8208;system. In doing so we effectively open the path to the in vitro preparation of a library of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors. We argue that such library, made of variable unnatural chromophores inserted in an easy to mutate and crystallize retinoic acid transporter, significantly expand the scope of the recently introduced rhodopsin mimics as both optogenetic and "lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule" tools.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat due to the ability of bacteria to quickly evolve in response to the selection pressure induced by anti&#8208;infective drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against resistant bacteria. In this review, we discuss pathways involving bacterial protein biogenesis as attractive antibacterial targets since many of them are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. We discuss the structural understanding of various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis, which in turn can be utilized for rational antibiotic design. We highlight efforts made towards developing inhibitors of these pathways with insights into future possibilities and challenges. We also briefly discuss other potential targets related to protein biogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Target&#8208;Mediated 5&#8217;&#8208;Exonuclease Digestion of DNA Aptamers with RecJ to Modulate Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new method for biosensing based on the target&#8208;mediated resistance of DNA aptamers against 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion, allowing them to act as primers for rolling circle amplification (RCA). A target&#8208;bound DNA strand containing an aptamer region on the 5&#8217;&#8208;end and a primer region on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end is protected from 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ exonuclease in a target&#8208;dependent manner. As the protected aptamer is at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end, the exposed primer on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template to generate a turn&#8208;on sensor. Without target, RecJ digests the primer and prevents RCA from occurring, allowing quantitative fluorescence detection of both thrombin, a protein, and ochratoxin A (OTA), a small molecule, at picomolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Transaminase Activity by Encapsulation in Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus megaterium transaminase (BmTA) shows high immobilization efficiency in upper critical solution temperature type poly(N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide) (pNAGA) hydrogels, and high activity in the swollen hydrogel. Upon temperature decrease, the hydrogel swelling and enzyme activity decrease. The deactivation tended to be higher for BmTA immobilized in pNAGA compared to free BmTA due to temperature&#8208;induced hydrogel shrinking.







Abstract
Smart hydrogels hold much potential for biocatalysis, not only for the immobilization of enzymes, but also for the control of enzyme activity. We investigated upper critical solution temperature&#8208;type poly N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (pNAGA) hydrogels as a smart matrix for the amine transaminase from Bacillus megaterium (BmTA). Physical entrapment of BmTA in pNAGA hydrogels results in high immobilization efficiency (&gt;89&#8201;%) and high activity (97&#8201;%). The temperature&#8208;sensitiveness of pNAGA is preserved upon immobilization of BmTA and shows a gradual deswelling upon temperature reduction. While enzyme activity is mainly controlled by temperature, deactivation tended to be higher for immobilized BmTA (&#8776;62&#8211;68&#8201;%) than for free BmTA (&#8776;44&#8201;%), suggesting a deactivating effect due to deswelling of the pNAGA gel. Although the deactivation in response to hydrogel deswelling is not yet suitable for controlling enzyme activity sufficiently, it is nevertheless a good starting point for further optimization.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can a common synthetic intermediate be transformed by different functional groups to target different cell organelles? We evaluated the structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes synthesized from the same synthetic intermediate to target nuclei, lysosomes, and mitochondria in live microglial cells.







Abstract
Targeting live cell organelles is essential for imaging, understanding, and controlling specific biochemical processes. Typically, fluorescent probes with distinct structural scaffolds are used to target specific cell organelles. Here, we have designed a modular one&#8208;step synthetic strategy using a common reaction intermediate to develop new lysosomal, mitochondrial, and nucleus&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes that are all based on a single boron dipyrromethane scaffold. The divergent cell organelle targeting was achieved by synthesizing probes with specific functional group changes to the central scaffold resulting in differential fluorescence and pKa. Specifically, we show that the functional group transformation of the same scaffold influences cellular localization and specificity of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes in live primary microglial cells with pKa values ranging from &#8764;3.2&#8211;6.0. We introduce a structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) framework to target nuclei (NucShine), lysosomes (LysoShine), and mitochondria (MitoShine) in live microglia. This work will result in future applications of SOR beyond imaging to target and control organelle&#8208;specific biochemical processes in disease&#8208;specific models.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Detection of Enzymatic Alcohol Dehydrogenase Activity in Microfluidic Droplets with a Direct Fluorogenic Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh throughput screening assay of alcohol dehydrogenases in microfluidic droplets becomes possible with substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore. With a 100&#8197;nM detection threshold and no appreciable leaking even after 6 weeks, less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average is robustly detectable.







Abstract
The exploration of large DNA libraries of metagenomic or synthetic origin is greatly facilitated by ultrahigh&#8208;throughput assays that use monodisperse water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets as sequestered reaction compartments. Millions of samples can be generated and analysed in microfluidic devices at kHz speeds, requiring only micrograms of reagents. The scope of this powerful platform for the discovery of new sequence space is, however, hampered by the limited availability of assay substrates, restricting the functions and reaction types that can be investigated. Here, we broaden the scope of detectable biochemical transformations in droplet microfluidics by introducing the first fluorogenic assay for alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in this format. We have synthesized substrates that release a pyranine fluorophore (8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;pyrenetrisulfonic acid, HPTS) when enzymatic turnover occurs. Pyranine is well retained in droplets for &gt;6 weeks (i.&#8201;e. 14&#8208;times longer than fluorescein), avoiding product leakage and ensuring excellent assay sensitivity. Product concentrations as low as 100&#8197;nM were successfully detected, corresponding to less than one turnover per enzyme molecule on average. The potential of our substrate design was demonstrated by efficient recovery of a bona fide ADH with an &gt;800&#8208;fold enrichment. The repertoire of droplet screening is enlarged by this sensitive and direct fluorogenic assay to identify dehydrogenases for biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Mitochondrial Membrane Disrupting Molecules for Selective Killing of Senescent Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here, we showcase the importance of hydrophobicity and charge during the design of new mitochondria&#8208;targeted small molecules as a senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.







Abstract
Cellular senescence, a stable form of cell cycle arrest, facilitates protection from tumorigenesis and aids in tissue repair as they accumulate in the body at an early age. However, long&#8208;term retention of senescent cells causes inflammation, aging of the tissue, and progression of deadly diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Various attempts have been made to achieve selective elimination of senescent cells from the body, yet little has been explored in designing the mitochondria&#8208;targeted senolytic agent. Many characteristics of senescence are associated with mitochondria. Here we have designed a library of alkyl&#8208;monoquaternary ammonium&#8208;triphenyl phosphine (TPP) and alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP of varying alkyl chain lengths, which target the mitochondria; we also studied their senolytic properties. It was observed that the alkyl&#8208;diquaternary ammonium&#8208;TPP with the longest chain length induced apoptosis in senescent cells selectively via an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane disruption. This study demonstrates that mitochondria could be a potential target for designing new small molecules as senolytic agents for the treatment of a variety of dysfunctions associated with pathological aging.

         <title>&#8220;A Study in Yellow&#8221;: Investigations in the Stereoselectivity of Ene&#8208;Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Elementary, Watson!&#8221; The recent efforts to investigate and understand the stereochemical course of the asymmetric bioreduction of C=C bonds mediated by ene&#8208;reductases are reviewed, covering the literature of the last two decades. A general binding model is presented and successful approaches to stereodivergent reductions are discussed with representative examples.







Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductases from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily are a well&#8208;known and efficient biocatalytic alternative for the asymmetric reduction of C=C bonds. Considering the broad variety of substituents that can be tolerated, and the excellent stereoselectivities achieved, it is apparent why these enzymes are so appealing for preparative and industrial applications. Different classes of C=C bonds activated by at least one electron&#8208;withdrawing group have been shown to be accepted by these versatile biocatalysts in the last decades, affording a vast range of chiral intermediates employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavours, fragrances and fine chemicals. In order to access both enantiomers of reduced products, stereodivergent pairs of OYEs are desirable, but their natural occurrence is limited. The detailed knowledge of the stereochemical course of the reaction can uncover alternative strategies to orient the selectivity via mutagenesis, evolution, and substrate engineering. An overview of the ongoing studies on OYE&#8208;mediated bioreductions will be provided, with particular focus on stereochemical investigations by deuterium labelling.

         <title>NAD(H)&#8208;PEG Swing Arms Improve Both the Activities and Stabilities of Modularly&#8208;Assembled Transhydrogenases Designed with Predictable Selectivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular assembly of synthetic transhydrogenase catalysts is demonstrated using a PEG&#8208;NAD(H) modified formate dehydrogenase (FDH)&#8208;SpyCatcher fusion protein. The front cover highlights how any oxidoreductase enzyme can be outfitted with a simple SpyTag peptide and conjugated to FDH&#8208;SpyCatcher to create new cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalysts driven by formate oxidation. The stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites, emphasizing the functional modularity and predictive nature of this synthetic approach to biocatalyst design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Massad and S. Banta.

Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the dynamics of the cell&#8216;s molecular systems. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging of biomolecules in living cells, especially for G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, are introduced. The potential of a single&#8208;molecule imaging approach for chemical translational biology is discussed based on the recent progress in single&#8208;molecule imaging methods.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging is the most direct approach for monitoring the motility of molecules in living cells. Considering the relationship between the motility of molecules and their function, information obtained from single&#8208;molecule imaging involves essential clues for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the processes of target molecules, and translation to applied sciences such as drug discovery. In this Concept, examples of single&#8208;molecule imaging studies on G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are mainly introduced, and recent techniques of single&#8208;molecule imaging for overcoming the limitation of single&#8208;molecule live&#8208;cell imaging are discussed. Based on these studies, the prospects of single&#8208;molecule imaging will be outlined.

         <title>Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy Enables to Quantify the Affinity Between DNA and Proteins in Cell Lysate</title>

Our research targets on the quantitative determination of protein&#8208;to&#8208;ligand binding in complex cellular environments. Fluorine protein labelling has been utilized enabling to analyze signal height, line width and chemical shift upon DNA binding in great detail employing high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and simulations. This approach can be easily applied to studies generally interested in interaction processes taking place in cellular environments.







Abstract
The determination of the binding affinity quantifying the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is of crucial interest in biological and chemical research. Here, we have made use of site&#8208;specific fluorine labeling of the cold shock protein from Bacillus subtilis, BsCspB, enabling to directly monitor the interaction with single stranded DNA molecules in cell lysate. High&#8208;resolution 19F NMR spectroscopy has been applied to exclusively report on resonance signals arising from the protein under study. We have found that this experimental approach advances the reliable determination of the binding affinity between single stranded DNA molecules and its target protein in this complex biological environment by intertwining analyses based on NMR chemical shifts, signal heights, line shapes and simulations. We propose that the developed experimental platform offers a potent approach for the identification of binding affinities characterizing intermolecular interactions in native surroundings covering the nano&#8208;to&#8208;micromolar range that can be even expanded to in cell applications in future studies.

         <title>Building siRNAs with Cubes: Synthesis and Evaluation of Cubane&#8208;Modified siRNAs</title>

siRNA lego: Cubane&#8208;functionalized siRNAs lead to potent RNAi&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;silencing activity, and improved strand selection.







Abstract
Cubane molecules hold great potential for medicinal chemistry applications due to their inherent stability and low toxicity. In this study, we report the synthesis of a cubane derivative phosphoramidite for the incorporation of cubane into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Synthetic siRNAs rely on chemical modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profiles. However, they are still able to mediate sequence&#8208;specific gene silencing via the endogenous RNA interference pathway. We designed a library of siRNAs bearing cubane at different positions within the sense and antisense strands. All siRNAs showed excellent gene&#8208;silencing activity, with IC50 values ranging from 45.4 to 305&#8197;pM. Incorporating the cubane modification in both the sense and antisense strand led to viable duplexes with good biological activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of siRNAs bearing a cubane derivative within the backbone.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>

Enzymes are a valuable tool for upcycling side&#8208;stream from renewable sources. We have found that EstB from Burkholderia gladioli could achieve high enantiopurity in upcycling &#945;&#8208;pinene, a side&#8208;product from turpentine production, whereas common lipases and esterases could not. This reaction can be easily integrated with the existing chemical synthetic route for the production of the racemic camphor with minimal adjustments as the route goes through an intermediate isobornyl acetate.







Abstract
Racemic camphor and isoborneol are readily available as industrial side products, whereas (1R)&#8208;camphor is available from natural sources. Optically pure (1S)&#8208;camphor, however, is much more difficult to obtain. The synthesis of racemic camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene proceeds via an intermediary racemic isobornyl ester, which is then hydrolyzed and oxidized to give camphor. We reasoned that enantioselective hydrolysis of isobornyl esters would give facile access to optically pure isoborneol and camphor isomers, respectively. While screening of a set of commercial lipases and esterases in the kinetic resolution of racemic monoterpenols did not lead to the identification of any enantioselective enzymes, the cephalosporin Esterase B from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB) and Esterase C (EstC) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed outstanding enantioselectivity (E&gt;100) towards the butyryl esters of isoborneol, borneol and fenchol. The enantioselectivity was higher with increasing chain length of the acyl moiety of the substrate. The kinetic resolution of isobornyl butyrate can be easily integrated into the production of camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene and thus allows the facile synthesis of optically pure monoterpenols from a renewable side&#8208;product.

Construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells: Two novel methods for the construction of nanobody libraries in mammalian cells, called dsDNA&#8208;HR and in&#8197;vitro ligation, were developed. Both methods generated over a million unique nanobody sequences as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing.







Abstract
A nanobody is an antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antigen&#8208;binding domain. Mammalian cells are ideal platforms for identifying nanobodies targeting hard&#8208;to&#8208;display transmembrane proteins and nanobodies that function as modulators of cellular phenotypes. However, the introduction of a high&#8208;diversity nanobody library into mammalian cells is challenging. We have developed two novel methods for constructing a nanobody library in mammalian cells. Complementarity&#8208;determining region (CDR) random sequences were first incorporated into upstream and downstream dsDNAs by PCR. In the first method, named dsDNA&#8208;HR, upstream and downstream dsDNAs containing an identical overlapping sequence were co&#8208;transfected into cultured mammalian cells for intracellular homologous recombination that resulted in the formation of an intact nanobody library expression cassette. In the second method, named in&#8197;vitro ligation, we generated full&#8208;length nanobody expression dsDNAs via ligation of restriction digested upstream and downstream dsDNAs. The obtained full&#8208;length dsDNAs were transfected into mammalian cells for nanobody library expression. Using both methods, we generated over a million unique nanobody sequences, as revealed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Single&#8208;cell sequencing was employed to resolve the diversity of the dsDNA&#8208;HR nanobody library. We also identified a small molecule, Nocodazole, which could enhance the efficacy of dsDNA&#8208;HR.

         <title>Kinetic Studies of Acetyl Group Migration between the Saccharide Units in an Oligomannoside Trisaccharide Model Compound and a Native Galactoglucomannan Polysaccharide</title>

Kinetic calculations on the migration between saccharide units in a mannan trisaccharide model compounds and a galactoglucomannan polysaccharide were performed. Potential interactions of the model compounds with a lectin were also investigated.







Abstract
Acyl group migration is a fundamental phenomenon in carbohydrate chemistry, recently shown to take place also between two non&#8208;adjacent hydroxyl groups, across the glycosidic bond, in a &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked mannan trisaccharide model compound. With the central mannoside unit containing acetyl groups at the O2 and O3 positions, the O2&#8208;acetyl was in the earlier study shown to migrate to O6 of the reducing end. Potential implications of the general acyl migration process on cell signaling events and plant growth in nature are intriguing open questions. In the present work, migration kinetics in this original trisaccharide model system were studied in more detail together with potential interactions of the model compound and the migration products with DC&#8208;SIGN lectin. Furthermore, we demonstrate here for the first time that similar migration may also take place in native polysaccharides, here represented by galactoglucomannan from Norway spruce.

Furthermore, we demonstrate here for the first time that similar migration may also take place in native polysaccharides, here represented by galactoglucomannan from Norway spruce.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates is reported. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain.







Abstract
The reversible nature of disulfide functionality has been exploited to design intelligent materials such as nanocapsules, micelles, vesicles, inorganic nanoparticles, peptide and nucleic acid nanodevices. Herein, we report a new chemical methodology for the construction redox&#8208;sensitive protein assemblies using monodisperse facially amphiphilic protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The disulfide functionality is strategically placed between the dendron and protein domains. The custom designed bioconjugates self&#8208;assembled into nanoscopic objects of a defined size dictated by the nature of dendron domain. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the protein assemblies is demonstrated using a suitable redox trigger.

         <title>When Supramolecular Chemistry Meets Chemical Biology: New Strategies to Target Proteins through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 20, Page 2914-2917, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein targeting through host&#8208;guest recognition is an exciting area but is limited by the lack of specific recognition element on protein. Chemical biology methods for site&#8208;specific protein modification provide powerful tools for introducing guest molecules into proteins and will greatly expand the scope of protein targeting using supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins is of great interest for the development of novel approaches to recognize, isolate and control proteins. Taking advantage of chemical biology approaches, such as genetic&#8208;code expansion and enzyme&#8208;mediated ligation, guest recognition elements can be built into proteins of interest, allowing supramolecular control of protein function and regulation. In this viewpoint article, we will discuss the methods, applications, limitations, and future perspectives of supramolecular chemistry for targeting proteins in a site&#8208;specific manner.

Functional protein nanotechnology: The cover feature illustrates the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of redox&#8208;sensitive artificial proteins. The disulfide functionality is placed strategically in between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of the artificial protein. The hydrophobic domain drives the self&#8208;assembly of artificial proteins to form monodisperse protein nanoparticles. Treatment of protein nanoparticles with dithiothreitol (DTT) results in cleavage of disulfide bonds and subsequent disassembly of protein nanoparticles due to cleavage of the hydrophobic domain. This work lays the foundation for pushing the boundaries of functional protein nanotechnology. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;J. Bhandari and B.&#8197;S.

(&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor can occur naturally as a constituent of essential oils of several plants, including Cinnamomum camphora, or it can be obtained chemically from optically pure &#945;&#8208;pinene, which itself must be isolated from plants. Camphor is well known for its characteristic pungent odor and health benefits. While (+)&#8208;camphor can be isolated from various natural sources, (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor is more difficult to obtain.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Selenocysteine Incorporation into Proteins by Genetic Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 20, Page 2918-2924, October 13, 2021. </description>

Native Sec incorporation is highly species&#8208;dependent, which makes it challenging to express selenoproteins recombinantly. This article reviews recent progress in the method development for selenoprotein production, including the uses of engineered tRNA, allo&#8208;tRNA and Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element as well as genetic code expansion approaches for efficient site&#8208;specific Sec incorporation.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation in vivo is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe the progress in selenoprotein production methodology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in-frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation in vivo is highly species-dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe the progress in selenoprotein production methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent progress in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure&#8208;activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.







Abstract
Several life&#8208;threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non&#8208;toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations. In addition, their ability to disrupt cellular homeostasis and to alter lysosomal pH endow ionophores as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Overall, critically outlining the advances in artificial ionophores in terms of in vitro ion transport, possible modes of action and biological activities enables us to propose possible future roadmaps in this research area.

         <title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Natural Products of Commensal Microbiota as an Environmental Selection Pressure for the Rise of New Variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>

In silico studies suggest that NPs like bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) produced by bacteria residing in the respiratory tract can interfere with the binding of the original strain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to the ACE2 receptor but not with the binding of the emerging variants having the N501Y mutation. Thus, it is hypothesized that NPs of respiratory tract bacteria are an environmental selection pressure for the rise of new variants of the virus with higher infectivity rate.







Abstract
Since the emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, little attention has been paid to the interplay between the interaction of virus and commensal microbiota. Here, we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations to study the interaction of some of the known metabolites and natural products (NPs) produced by commensal microbiota with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The results predict that NPs of commensal microbiota such as bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs), of which some are siderophores, bind to the wild&#8208;type RBD and interfere with its binding to the ACE2 receptor. N501Y mutation, which is present in many of the emerging variants of the virus, abolishes the predicted binding pocket of bile acids and NRPs. Based on these findings, available experimental data showing that bile acids reduce the binding affinity of wild&#8208;type RBD to the ACE2 receptor, and the data suggesting that the respiratory tract microbiota affect viral infection we put forward the following proposal: mutations such as N501Y enable the RBD to bind to the ACE2 receptor more effectively in the presence of NPs produced by the respiratory tract bacteria thereby, increasing the infectivity rate of the virus. We hope our data stimulate future works to better understand the interactions of NPs produced by commensal microbiota with respiratory viruses like SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>The Conversion of Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by Nitrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenases are the only known family of enzymes that catalyze the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2  ) to ammonia (NH3  ). The N2  reduction drives the biological nitrogen fixation and the global nitrogen cycle. Beside the conversion of N2  , nitrogenases catalyze a whole range of other reductions, including the reduction of the small gaseous substrates carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to hydrocarbons. However, it remains an open question whether these &#8216;side reactivities&#8217; play a role under environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these reactivities and particularly the formation of hydrocarbons have spurred the interest in nitrogenases for biotechnological applications. There are three different isozymes of nitrogenase: the molybdenum and the alternative vanadium and iron&#8208;only nitrogenase. The isozymes differ in their metal content, structure and substrate&#8208;dependent activity despite their homology. This minireview focuses on the conversion of CO and CO2  to methane and higher hydrocarbons and aims to specify the differences in activity between the three nitrogenase isozymes.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decade, a variety of carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed and tested. Some CORMs spontaneously release CO once in solution, while others require a trigger mechanism to release the bound CO from its molecular complex. The modulation of biological systems by CORMs depends largely on the spatiotemporal release of CO, which likely differs among the different types of CORMs. In spontaneously releasing CORMs, CO is released extracellularly and crosses the cell membrane to interact with intra&#8208;cellular targets.&#160;&#160;Other CORMs can directly release CO intra&#8208;cellularly, which may be a more efficient method to modulate biological systems. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of extracellular and intracellular CO&#8208;releasing CORMs that either release CO spontaneously or require an enzymatic trigger. The efficacy of such CORMs to modulate HO&#8208;1 and VCAM&#8208;1 expression in TNF&#8208;&#945;&#8208;stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was evaluated here.</dc:description>

         <title>The effect of photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking&#8208;inhibitor between probes in photo&#8208;induced double duplex invasion DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Double duplex invasion DNA is a useful method as an antigene method, which inhibits a gene expression of targeting genomic DNA. We have succeeded in photoinduced&#8208;DDI(pDDI) by using an ultrafast photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking. 5&#8208;cyanouracil is used in pDDI to inhibit the photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking between probes, but its importance has not yet been clarified. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect on pDDI efficiency using Spacer(S) and d&#8208;Spacer(dS), which are considered to have photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking ability like  CN  U. As a result,  CN  U had the highest pDDI efficiency, and S, dS, and T were not so different. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect is better with S and dS than with T. On the other hand, the thermal stability is significantly lower in S and dS than in T. In this pDDI, it is considered that the pDDI efficiency is determined by the balance between the photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and the thermal stability, which is the introduction efficiency for double&#8208;stranded DNA. Therefore, it is considered that  CN  U, which has a photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking inhibitory effect and a high Tm value, showed the highest inhibitory efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Defluorination Capability of l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid Dehalogenases in the HAD&#8208;like Hydrolase Superfamily Correlates with Active Site Compactness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid dehalogenases, industrially and environmentally important enzymes that catalyze cleavage of the carbon&#8208;halogen bond in  S  &#8208;2&#8208;halocarboxylic acids, were known to hydrolyze chlorinated, brominated and iodinated substrates but no activity towards fluorinated compounds had been reported. A screen for novel dehalogenase activities revealed four l&#8208;2&#8208;haloacid dehalogenases capable of defluorination. We now report crystal structures for two of these enzymes, Bpro0530 and Rha0230, as well as for the related proteins PA0810 and RSc1362, which hydrolyze chloroacetate but not fluoroacetate, all at ~2.2 &#197; resolution. The active sites of these four enzymes are highly similar. In Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations, only the defluorinating enzymes sample compacter conformations, which in turn allow more effective interactions with the small fluorine atom. Structural constraints, based on X&#8208;ray structures and MD calculations, correctly predict the defluorination activity of the homologous enzyme ST2570.</dc:description>

         <title>Antisense oligonucleotide modified with disulfide units induces efficient exon skipping in&#160;mdx&#160;myotubes through enhanced membrane permeability and nucleus internalization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have found that antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA molecules modified with repeat structures of disulfide units can be directly introduced into the cytoplasm and exhibit a suppressive effect on gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of cellular uptake of these membrane&#8208;permeable oligonucleotides (MPONs). Time&#8208;course analysis by confocal microscopy showed that the uptake of MPONs from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm reached 50% of the total uptake in about 5 min. In addition, analysis of the plasma membrane proteins to which MPONs bind identified several proteins, including voltage&#8208;dependent anion channel. Next, we analyzed the behavior of MPONs in the cell and found an abundance of them in the nucleus as early as 24 h after addition with the amount increasing further at 48 and 72 h. The amount of MPONs was 2.5&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified oligonucleotides in the nucleus at 72 h. We also designed antisense oligonucleotides and evaluated the effect of MPONs on mRNA exon skipping using DMD model cells; MPONs caused exon skipping with 69% efficiency after 72 h, which was three times higher than the rate of the control. In summary, the high capacity for intracytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of MPONs is expected to be useful for therapeutic strategies targeting exon skipping.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High costs and low availability of UDP&#8208;galactose hampers the enzymatic synthesis of valuable oligosaccharides such as human milk oligosaccharides. Here, we report the development of a platform for the scalable, biocatalytic synthesis and purification of UDP&#8208;galactose. UDP&#8208;galactose was produced with a titer of 48 mM (27.2 g/L) in a small&#8208;scale batch process (200 &#181;L) within 24 h using 0.02 g  enzyme  /g  product  . Through  in&#8208;situ  ATP regeneration, the amount of ATP (0.6 mM) supplemented was around 240&#8208;fold lower than the stoichiometric equivalent required to achieve the final product yield. Chromatographic purification using porous graphic carbon adsorbent yielded UDP&#8208;galactose with a purity of 92%. The synthesis was transferred to 1 L preparative scale production in a stirred tank bioreactor. To further reduce the synthesis costs here, the supernatant of cell lysates was used bypassing expensive purification of enzymes. Here, 23.4 g/L UDP&#8208;galactose were produced within 23 h with a synthesis yield of 71% and a biocatalyst load of 0.05 g  total_protein  /g  product  . The costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;galactose synthesized were around 0.26 &#8364;/g.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent advances in hydrogen peroxide responsive organoborons for biological and biomedical applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable reactive oxygen species generated endogenously, participating in numerous physiological processes and abnormal pathological conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that a higher level of H  2  O  2  exists in various disease conditions. Thus, H  2  O  2  functions as an ideal target for site&#8208;specific bioimaging and therapeutic targeting. The unique reactivity of organoborons with H  2  O  2  provides a method for developing chemoselective molecules for biological and biomedical applications. This review highlights the design and application of boron&#8208;derived molecules for H  2  O  2  detection, and the utility of boron moieties toward masking reactive compounds leading to development of metal prochelators and prodrugs for selectively delivering an active species at the target sites with elevated H  2  O  2  levels. Additionally, the emergence of H  2  O  2  &#8208;responsive theranostic agents consisting of both therapeutic and diagnostic moieties in one integrated system are discussed. The purpose of this review is to better understand the role of boron&#8208;derived molecules towards biological and pharmacological application.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of Potent Bioactive anti&#8208;TNF&#945; Aptamers by Microbead&#8208;Assisted Capillary Electrophoresis (MACE)&#8208;SELEX</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid identification of high&#8208;affinity aptamers against human TNF&#945;: In vitro selection coupled with microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) separation was performed to rapidly identify anti&#8208;TNF&#945; aptamers; it was completed in only three rounds. Selected Apt14 showed the strongest inhibition activity according to the cell viability assay. Furthermore, by introducing a complementary linker to the aptamers, facile dimerization was performed, resulting in enhanced affinity and inhibition activity compared to that of the monomer.







Abstract
Dysregulation of tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;), a pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine, causes several diseases, making it an important therapeutic target. Here, we identified a novel DNA aptamer against human TNF&#945; using in&#8197;vitro selection, which included a high exclusion pressure process against non&#8208;binding and weak binders through microbead&#8208;assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) in only three rounds. Among the 15 most enriched aptamers, Apt14 exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for the interaction between TNF&#945; and its cognate receptor in mouse L929 cells. For further improving the bioactivity of the aptamer, dimerization programed by hybridization was evaluated, resulting in the Apt14 dimer exhibited a twofold higher binding affinity and stronger inhibition compared to the monomer counterpart. Rapid identification of bioactive aptamers using MACE in combination with facile dimerization by hybridization accelerates the discovery of novel bioactive aptamers, paving the way toward replacing current monoclonal antibody therapy with the less expensive and non&#8208;immunogenic aptamer therapy.

Here, we identified a novel DNA aptamer against human TNF&#945; using &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection, which included a high exclusion pressure process against non-binding and weak binders through microbead-assisted capillary electrophoresis (MACE) in only three rounds. Among the 15 most enriched aptamers, Apt14 exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for the interaction between TNF&#945; and its cognate receptor in mouse L929 cells. For further improving the bioactivity of the aptamer, dimerization programed by hybridization was evaluated, resulting in the Apt14 dimer exhibited a twofold higher binding affinity and stronger inhibition compared to the monomer counterpart. Rapid identification of bioactive aptamers using MACE in combination with facile dimerization by hybridization accelerates the discovery of novel bioactive aptamers, paving the way toward replacing current monoclonal antibody therapy with the less expensive and non-immunogenic aptamer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing P450 Enzyme for Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attentions in the synthetic biology and biotechnology areas due to their versatile functions and unique structures. In this article, different strategies that used to leverage P450s catalytic efficiency have been reviewed and discussed, which include substrate engineering, allostery effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, OPME and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization etc.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYPs) catalyze the oxidative transformation of a wide range of organic substrates. Their functions are crucial to xenobiotic metabolism and steroid transformation in humans and other organisms. The enzymes are promising for synthetic biology applications but limited by several drawbacks including low turnover rates, poor stability, the dependance of expensive cofactors and redox partners, and the narrow substrate scope. To conquer these obstacles, emerging strategies including substrate engineering, usage of decoy and decoy&#8208;based small molecules auxiliaries, designing of artificial enzyme cascades and the incorporation of materials have been explored based on the unique properties of P450s. These strategies can be applied to a wide range of P450s and can be combined with protein engineering to improve the enzymatic activities. This minireview will focus on some recent developments of these strategies which have been used to leverage P450 catalysis. Remaining challenges and future opportunities will also be discussed.

         <title>Controlling enzymatic activity by modulating the oligomerization state via chemical rescue and optical control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective switching of enzymatic activity has been a longstanding goal in synthetic biology. Drastic changes in activity upon mutational manipulation of the oligomerization state of enzymes have been frequently reported in literature, but scarcely exploited for switching. Using geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase as a model, we demonstrate that catalytic activity can be efficiently controlled by exogenous modulation of the association state. We introduced a lysine&#8208;to&#8208;cysteine mutation, leading to the breakdown of the active hexamer into dimers with impaired catalytic efficiency. Addition of bromoethylamine chemically rescued the enzyme by restoring hexamerization and activity. As an alternative method, we incorporated the photo&#8208;sensitive unnatural amino acid  o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;O&#8208;tyrosine (ONBY) into the hexamerization interface. This again led to inactive dimers, but the hexameric state and activity could be recovered by UV&#8208;light induced cleavage of ONBY. For both approaches, we obtained switching factors of larger than 350&#8208;fold, which compares favorably with previously reported activity changes that were caused by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification and Composition of Clasper Scent Gland Components of the Butterfly Heliconius erato and Its Relation to Mimicry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scent glands of male Heliconius erato contain up to 350 components with individual compositions. Linear terpenes dominate, either as esters or as long, regular linear isoprene&#8208;oligomers. The high chemical diversity is reflected within the many different mimicry patterns of these butterflies. The compounds were identified by a combination of various methods, including synthesis, which allowed to unravel the underlying biosynthetic pathways used to arrive at these compound bouquets.







Abstract
The butterfly Heliconius erato occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper scent gland releases an anti&#8208;aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)&#8208;analyses, derivatization, and synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3&#8208;oxohexan&#8208;1&#8208;ol and (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol with (S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids, and various alcohols. In addition, linear terpenes with up to seven uniformly connected isoprene units occur, e.&#8201;g. farnesylfarnesol. A large number of the compounds have not been reported before from nature. Discriminant analyses of principal components of the gland contents showed that the iridescent mimicry group differs strongly from the other, mostly also separated, mimicry groups. Comparison with data from other species indicated that Heliconius recruits different biosynthetic pathways in a species&#8208;specific manner for semiochemical formation.

The reactivity of a biomimetic iron (IV)&#8208;oxo complex (the sun) towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates (the orbiting planets) was investigated. The reaction rates (corresponding to the orbital periods) are in very good agreement with the calculated bond dissociation energies. 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU or the dimethylated compounds 1,5dimC and 1,5dimU.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel benzaldehyde lyase for the production of chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones was identified by a machine learning model and two variants with altered substrate scopes were created by rational design. All three variants exhibit significantly higher thermostability compared to the only previously described benzaldehyde lyase. When immobilized in a packed&#8208;bed reactor, the most thermostable variant showed stable substrate turnover over days.







Abstract
Enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are important building blocks of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which can be produced by thiamine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyases, such as benzaldehyde lyase. Here we report the discovery of a novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis R138 (ReBAL). While the overall sequence identity to the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar I (PfBAL) was only 65&#8201;%, comparison of a structural model of ReBAL with the crystal structure of PfBAL revealed only four divergent amino acids in the substrate binding cavity. Based on rational design, we generated two ReBAL variants, which were characterized along with the wild&#8208;type enzyme in terms of their substrate spectrum, thermostability and biocatalytic performance in the presence of different co&#8208;solvents. We found that the new enzyme variants have a significantly higher thermostability (up to 22&#8201;&#176;C increase in T50) and a different co&#8208;solvent&#8208;dependent activity. Using the most stable variant immobilized in packed&#8208;bed reactors via the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, (R)&#8208;benzoin was synthesized from benzaldehyde over a period of seven days with a stable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8208;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;d&#8722;1. Our work expands the important class of benzaldehyde lyases and therefore contributes to the development of continuous biocatalytic processes for the production of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and APIs.

We found that the new enzyme variants have a significantly higher thermostability (up to 22&#8201;&#176;C increase in T&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and a different co-solvent-dependent activity. Using the most stable variant immobilized in packed-bed reactors via the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-benzoin was synthesized from benzaldehyde over a period of seven days with a stable space-time-yield of 9.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;d&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work expands the important class of benzaldehyde lyases and therefore contributes to the development of continuous biocatalytic processes for the production of &#945;-hydroxy ketones and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Spike Protein Mutations in the Infectious Power of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Variants: A Molecular Interaction Perspective</title>

New SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2&#8201;variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells.







Abstract
Specific S477N, N501Y, K417N, K417T, E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein in the wild type SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus have resulted, among others, in the following variants: B.1.160 (20A or EU2, first reported in continental Europe), B1.1.7 (&#945; or 20I501Y.V1, first reported in the United Kingdom), B.1.351 (&#946; or 20H/501Y.V2, first reported in South Africa), B.1.1.28.1 (&#947; or P.1 or 20J/501Y.V3, first reported in Brazil), and B.1.1.28.2 (&#950;, or P.2 or 20B/S484K, also first reported in Brazil). From the analysis of a set of bonding descriptors firmly rooted in the formalism of quantum mechanics, including Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO), Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and highly correlated energies within the Domain Based Local Pair Natural Orbital Coupled Cluster Method (DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)), and from a set of computed electronic spectral patterns with environmental effects, we show that the new variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells. This results in significantly improved initial virus&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;cell molecular recognition and attachment at the microscopic level, which trigger the infectious cycle.

         <title>Protein Design with Fluoroprolines: 4,4&#8208;Difluoroproline Does Not Eliminate the Rate&#8208;Limiting Step of Thioredoxin Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of 4,4&#8208;difluoroproline into the conserved cis prolyl&#8208;peptide bond of the E.&#8197;coli thioredoxin variant Trx1P neither eliminated the bottleneck of the thioredoxin refolding reaction nor had an impact on the attainment of the cis/trans equilibrium in the unfolded state. Our results suggest that the cis/trans isomerisation rates predicted for fluorinated proline analogues in the context of short model peptides are not applicable in the context of tertiary structures.







Abstract
C4&#8208;substituted fluoroprolines (4R)&#8208;fluoroproline ((4R)&#8208;Flp) and (4S)&#8208;fluoroproline ((4S)&#8208;Flp) have been used in protein engineering to enhance the thermodynamic stability of peptides and proteins. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine can bias the pucker of the pyrrolidine ring, influence the conformational preference of the preceding peptide bond, and can accelerate the cis/trans prolyl peptide bond isomerisation by diminishing its double bond character. The role of 4,4&#8208;difluoroproline (Dfp) in the acceleration of the refolding rate of globular proteins bearing a proline (Pro) residue in the cis conformation in the native state remains elusive. Moreover, the impact of Dfp on the thermodynamic stability and bioactivity of globular proteins has been seldom described. In this study, we show that the incorporation of Dfp caused a redox state dependent and position dependent destabilisation of the thioredoxin (Trx) fold, while the catalytic activities of the modified proteins remained unchanged. The Pro to Dfp substitution at the conserved cisPro76 in the thioredoxin variant Trx1P did not elicited acceleration of the rate&#8208;limiting trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization of the Ile75&#8208;Pro76 peptide bond. Our results show that pucker preferences in the context of a tertiary structure could play a major role in protein folding, thus overtaking the rules determined for cis/trans isomerisation barriers determined in model peptides.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Mesophilic CTP&#8208;Dependent Riboflavin Kinase and Rational Engineering to Create Its Thermostable Homologues
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pathway for vitamin B2 (riboflavin) biosynthesis in archaea contains several novel enzymes and reactions. The archaeal riboflavin kinase, RibK, is one such example &#8211; it has a unique structural fold, and phosphorylates B2 using CTP. Here, we characterize a new mesophilic archaeal RibK, compare its structure and function with a closely linked thermophilic homologue, and determine the molecular factors that confer thermal stability to this enzyme's characteristic structural fold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Kumar, R.&#8197;K. Singh, and A.&#8197;B. Hazra.

         <title>The chirality of aggregated Yariv reagents correlates with their AGP&#8208;binding ability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Yariv reagents are glycosylated triphenylazo dyes that bind to arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), proteoglycans found in plant cell walls that are integral for plant growth and development. Yariv reagents are widely utilized as imaging, purification, and quantification tools for AGPs and represent the only small molecule probe for interrogating AGP function. The ability of Yariv reagents to bind to AGPs is dependent on the structure of the terminal glycoside on the dye. The reason for this selectivity has not been understood until the present work. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the Yariv reagents form supramolecular aggregates with helical chirality. More significantly, the ability of the Yariv reagent to bind AGPs is correlated with this helical chirality. This finding paves the way towards developing a more detailed understanding of the nature of the Yariv&#8208;AGP complex, and the design of AGP&#8208;binding reagents with higher affinities and selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Visual Detection of Adenosine Triphosphate by Taylor Rising: A Simple Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Method Based on Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) is an extremely critical mission in practical applications, especially for rigorous military medicine, home health care, and the third world. Here, we report a visual POCT method for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection based on Taylor rising in the corner of quadratic geometries between the two rod surfaces. We discuss the principle of Taylor rising, demonstrating that it is significantly influenced by contact angle, surface tension, and density of the sample, which are controlled by ATP&#8208;dependent rolling circle amplification (RCA). In the presence of ATP, RCA reaction effectively suppresses the Taylor rising behavior, due to the increased contact angle, density, and decreased surface tension. Without addition of ATP, untriggered RCA reaction is favorable for Taylor rising, resulting in a significant height. With this proposed method, visual sensitive detection of ATP without the aid of other instruments is realized with only 5 &#956;L droplet, which has good selectivity and a low detection limit (17 nM). Importantly, this visual method provides a promising POCT tool for user&#8208;friendly molecular diagnostics.</dc:description>

With this proposed method, visual sensitive detection of ATP without the aid of other instruments is realized with only 5 &#956;L droplet, which has good selectivity and a low detection limit (17 nM). Importantly, this visual method provides a promising POCT tool for user-friendly molecular diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploration of GH94 Sequence Space for Enzyme Discovery Reveals a Novel Glucosylgalactose Phosphorylase Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of a glucosylgalactose phosphorylase: Although the rapidly expanding sequence space offers excellent opportunities for the discovery of novel enzymes, its rational exploration is key to the effective localization of regions for which no functional information is available. We have applied a binary approach that leverages the strengths of phylogeny and sequence similarity networks and which led to the discovery of the novel 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose phosphorylase.







Abstract
The substantial increase in DNA sequencing efforts has led to a rapid expansion of available sequences in glycoside hydrolase families. The ever&#8208;increasing sequence space presents considerable opportunities for the search for enzymes with novel functionalities. In this work, the sequence&#8208;function space of glycoside hydrolase family 94 (GH94) was explored in detail, using a combined approach of phylogenetic analysis and sequence similarity networks. The identification and experimental screening of unknown clusters led to the discovery of an enzyme from the soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa that acts as a 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose phosphorylase (GGalP), a specificity that has not been reported to date. Detailed characterization of GGalP revealed that its kinetic parameters were consistent with those of other known phosphorylases. Furthermore, the enzyme could be used for production of the rare disaccharides 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose and 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;l&#8208;arabinose. Our current work highlights the power of rational sequence space exploration in the search for novel enzyme specificities, as well as the potential of phosphorylases for rare disaccharide synthesis.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyridine&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two for one: A straightforward chemoenzymatic synthesis pathway towards valuable chiral alcohols with &#945;&#8208;fluorination in close proximity to the chiral center and a pyridine ring is presented. High conversions with excellent enantioselectivities were found, showing its high synthetic potential.







Abstract
Fluoro&#8208;substituted and heteroaromatic compounds are valuable intermediates for a variety of applications in pharma&#8208; and agrochemistry and synthetic chemistry. This study investigates the chemoenzymatic preparation of chiral alcohols bearing a heteroaromatic ring with an increasing degree of fluorination in &#945;&#8208;position. Starting from readily available picoline derivatives prochiral &#945;&#8208;halogenated acyl moieties were introduced with excellent selectivity and 64&#8211;95&#8201;% yield. The formed carbonyl group was subsequently reduced to the corresponding alcohols using the alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir, yielding an enantiomeric excess of 95&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% and up to 98&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Completely Chemically Synthesized Long DNA Can be Transcribed in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA segments of 78&#8197;bp and 258&#8197;bp in length, were prepared by chemical ligation of chemically synthesized DNA fragments with phosphorothioate and haloacyl terminus groups. The 258&#8197;bp DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a truncated SV promoter sequence, was successfully transcribed and showed full gene silencing effects in human cells.







Abstract
Chemical ligation reaction of DNA is useful for the construction of long functional DNA using oligonucleotide fragments that are prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis. However, the unnatural linkage structure formed by the ligation reaction generally impairs the biological function of the resulting ligated DNA. We achieved the complete chemical synthesis of 78 and 258&#8197;bp synthetic DNAs via multiple chemical ligation reactions with phosphorothioate and haloacyl&#8208;modified DNA fragments. The latter synthetic DNA, coding shRNA for luciferase genes with a designed truncated SV promoter sequence, successfully induced the expected gene silencing effect in HeLa cells.

         <title>Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes in Photoredox Catalysis and Photodynamic Therapy: A New Paradigm towards Anticancer Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered Ir(III)&#8208; and Ru(II)&#8208;based organometallic complexes that elicit selective in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo responses to cancerous cells while being nontoxic to normal cells in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photoredox catalysis (PC) are discussed in this Highlight article. We indicate promising avenues in translational research for cancer treatment by examining stable transition&#8208;metal complexes that hold potential for clinical trials in the future.







Abstract
Individually, photoredox catalysis (PC) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are well&#8208;established concepts that have experienced a remarkable resurgence in recent years, leading to significant progress in organic synthesis for PC and clinical approval of anticancer drugs for PDT. But, very recently, new photoredox catalyst systems based on Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes have garnered significant interest because they can simultaneously be used as PDT agents apart from their demonstrated PC activity. This highlight discusses the unique PC behavior of emerging Ir(III)&#8208; and Ru(II)&#8208;based systems while also examining their potential PDT activity in cancer treatment.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein misfolding and aggregation is a complex biochemical process and has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. Developing novel tools and methods to visualize aggregated proteins in live cells is in high demand for mechanistic studies, diagnosis, and therapeutics. In this review, we summarized the recent progress on the chemical biology toolbox applied to protein aggregation studies in live cells. These methods exploited fluorescent protein tags, chemical protein tags, and small molecule probes to visualize protein aggregation process, detect proteome stresses, and quantify protein homeostasis network capacity. Inspired by these seminal works, we generalized design principles to develop new detection methods and probes that illuminate this important biological process in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Gly&#8208;His&#8208;Tagged Proteins with Azidogluconolactone</title>

Site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;amino acylation of proteins with N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;HisTags using 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone (6AGDL) is reported. To demonstrate the usefulness of this reaction, we multimerise the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) protein antigen onto virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). The resulting COVID&#8208;19 vaccine candidate induces single&#8208;shot seroconversion, and virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies in mice.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific protein modifications are vital for biopharmaceutical drug development. Gluconoylation is a non&#8208;enzymatic, post&#8208;translational modification of N&#8208;terminal HisTags. We report high&#8208;yield, site&#8208;selective in&#8197;vitro &#945;&#8208;aminoacylation of peptides, glycoproteins, antibodies, and virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) with azidogluconolactone at pH&#8197;7.5 in 1&#8197;h. Conjugates slowly hydrolyse, but diol&#8208;masking with borate esters inhibits reversibility. In an example, we multimerise azidogluconoylated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) onto VLPs via click&#8208;chemistry, to give a COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. Compared to yeast antigen, HEK&#8208;derived RBD was immunologically superior, likely due to observed differences in glycosylation. We show the benefits of ordered over randomly oriented multimeric antigen display, by demonstrating single&#8208;shot seroconversion and best virus&#8208;neutralizing antibodies. Azidogluconoylation is simple, fast and robust chemistry, and should accelerate research and development.

         <title>HaloTag Engineering for Enhanced Fluorogenicity and Kinetics with a Styrylpyridium Dye</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HaloTag is a small self&#8208;labeling protein that is frequently used for creating fluorescent reporters in living cells. The small&#8208;molecule dyes used with HaloTag are almost exclusively based on rhodamine scaffolds, which are often expensive and challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report the engineering of HaloTag for use with a chemically accessible, inexpensive fluorophore based on the dimethylamino&#8208;styrylpyridium dye. Through directed evolution, the maximum fluorogenicity and the apparent second&#8208;order bioconjugation rate constants could be improved up to 4&#8208;fold and 42&#8208;fold, respectively. One of the top variants,  HT&#8208;SP5  , enabled reliable imaging in mammalian cells, with a 113&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement over the parent protein. Additionally, crystallographic characterization of selected mutants suggests the chemical origin of the fluorescent enhancement. The improved dye system offers a valuable tool for imaging and illustrates the viability of engineering self&#8208;labeling proteins for alternative fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic evaluation of fluorination as modification for peptide&#8208;based fusion inhibitors against HIV&#8208;1 infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the emergence of novel viruses, the development of new antivirals is more urgent than ever. A key step in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) infection is six&#8208;helix bundle formation within the envelope protein subunit gp41. Selective disruption of bundle formation by peptides has been shown to be effective; however, these drugs, exemplified by T20, are prone to rapid clearance from the patient. The incorporation of non&#8208;natural amino acids is known to improve these pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we evaluate a peptide inhibitor in which a critical Ile residue is replaced by fluorinated analogues. We characterized the influence of the fluorinated analogues on the biophysical properties of the peptide. Furthermore, we show that the fluorinated peptides can block HIV&#8208;1 infection of target cells at nanomolar levels. These findings demonstrate that fluorinated amino acids are appropriate tools for the development of novel peptide therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Removable Photocaging Groups Accepted by MjMAT Variant: Structural Basis and Compatibility with DNA and RNA Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylation and demethylation of DNA, RNA and proteins constitutes a major regulatory mechanism in epigenetic processes. Investigations would benefit from the ability to install photo&#8208;cleavable groups at methyltransferase target sites that block interactions with reader proteins until removed by non&#8208;damaging light in the visible spectrum. Engineered methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) have been exploited in cascade reactions with methyltransferases (MTases) to modify biomolecules with non&#8208;natural groups, including first evidence for accepting photo&#8208;cleavable groups. We show that an engineered MAT from  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii  (PC&#8208;MjMAT) is 308&#8208;fold more efficient at converting  ortho  &#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;(ONB)&#8208;homocysteine than the wildtype enzyme. PC&#8208;MjMAT is active over a broad range of temperatures and compatible with MTases from mesophilic organisms. We solved the crystal structures of wildtype and PC&#8208;MjMAT in complex with AdoONB and a red&#8208;shifted derivative thereof. These structures reveal that aromatic stacking interactions within the ligands are key to accommodate the photocaging groups in PC&#8208;MjMAT. The enlargement of the binding pocket eliminates steric clashes to enable AdoMet analog binding. Importantly, PC&#8208;MjMAT exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogs with red&#8208;shifted ONB&#8208;derivatives enabling photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Conformationally constrained peptides hold promise as molecular tools in chemical biology and as a new modality in drug discovery. The construction and screening of a target&#8208;focused library could be a promising approach for the generation of  de novo  ligands or inhibitors against target proteins. Here, we prepared a protein kinase&#8208;focused library by chemically modifying helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (HLH) peptides displayed on phage and subsequently tethered to adenosine. The library was screened against aurora kinase A (AurA). The selected HLH peptide  Bip&#8208;3  retained the &#945;&#8208;helical structure and bound to AurA with a  K  D  value of 13.7 &#956;M.  Bip&#8208;3  and the adenosine&#8208;tethered peptide  Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc  provided IC  50  values of 103 &#956;M and 7.7 &#956;M respectively, suggesting that  Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc  bivalently inhibited AurA. In addition, the selectivity of  Bip&#8208;3&#8208;Adc  to several protein kinases was tested, and was highest to AurA. These results demonstrated that chemical modification enabled the construction of a kinase&#8208;focused library of phage&#8208;displayed HLH peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Leifsonia Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Thermostability and Catalytic Efficiency by Enhancing Subunit Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the subunit interface of Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) yielded thermostability, and catalytic efficiency significantly improved in the mutant T100R/S148I. T100R/S148I can efficiently convert various ketone substrates into nearly optically pure chiral alcohols at elevated temperature in a very low enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;500).







Abstract
Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) is a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. However, limitations of wild&#8208;type LnADH observed for practical application include low activity and poor stability. In this work, protein engineering was employed to improve its thermostability and catalytic efficiency by altering the subunit interfaces. Residues T100 and S148 were identified to be significant for thermostability and activity, and the melting temperature (&#916;Tm) and catalytic efficiency of the mutant T100R/S148I toward ketone substrates was improved by 18.7&#8201;&#176;C and 1.8&#8211;5.5&#8208;fold. Solving the crystal structures of the wild&#8208;type enzyme and T100R/S148L revealed beneficial effects of mutations on stability and catalytic activity. The most robust mutant T100R/S148I is promising for industrial applications and can produce 200&#8197;g&#8201;liter&#8722;1&#8201;day&#8722;1 chiral alcohols at 50&#8201;&#176;C by only a 1&#8201;:&#8201;500 ratio of enzyme to substrate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineering the subunit interface&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Leifsonia&lt;/i&gt; alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) yielded thermostability, and catalytic efficiency significantly improved in the mutant T100R/S148I. T100R/S148I can efficiently convert various ketone substrates into nearly optically pure chiral alcohols at elevated temperature in a very low enzyme-to-substrate ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;500).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leifsonia&lt;/i&gt; alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) is a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. However, limitations of wild-type LnADH observed for practical application include low activity and poor stability. In this work, protein engineering was employed to improve its thermostability and catalytic efficiency by altering the subunit interfaces. Residues T100 and S148 were identified to be significant for thermostability and activity, and the melting temperature (&#916;T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and catalytic efficiency of the mutant T100R/S148I toward ketone substrates was improved by 18.7&#8201;&#176;C and 1.8&#8211;5.5-fold. Solving the crystal structures of the wild-type enzyme and T100R/S148L revealed beneficial effects of mutations on stability and catalytic activity. The most robust mutant T100R/S148I is promising for industrial applications and can produce 200&#8197;g&#8201;liter&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;day&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; chiral alcohols at 50&#8201;&#176;C by only a 1&#8201;:&#8201;500 ratio of enzyme to substrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Linear dsDNA Tagging Using Deoxyuridine Excision**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular barcoding is used to tag nucleic acids with sequence&#8208;encoded identifiers to distinguish between different samples or individual molecules. I describe a one&#8208;pot procedure for efficiently tagging linear dsDNA with molecular barcodes. This approach has potential utility for high&#8208;throughput in&#8197;vitro biochemical experiments that require uniform and quantitative dsDNA tagging.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific strategies for exchanging segments of dsDNA are important for DNA library construction and molecular tagging. Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3&#8217; ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi&#8208;base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT&#8594;dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non&#8208;perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called deoxyUridine eXcision&#8208;tagging (dUX&#8208;tagging), is an efficient one&#8208;pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3&#8217; overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5&#8217; overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX&#8208;tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX&#8208;tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high&#8208;efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial biosynthesis and catabolism of phosphonate natural products is a largely unexplored world of unusual enzyme reactions. Within this world resides Fosfonochlorin, a rare example of a halogenated phosphonate natural product, and a biosynthetic enigma since its discovery in 1988. In this study Gama and co&#8208;workers reveal two key steps in the biosynthesis of this deceptively simple molecule. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Pallitsch, D.&#8197;L. Zechel et&#8197;al.

         <title>Structural Basis of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diene Forming Acyl&#8208;Coenzyme A Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the biocatalytic repertoire: Canonical acyl&#8208;coenzyme dehydrogenases catalyze the 1,2&#8208;dehydrogenation of aliphatic thioesters in a highly conserved manner with a invariant glutamate serving as catalytic base and a flavin as hydride acceptor. By removal of this glutamate and positioning of a novel aspartate base at C3, an 1,4 dehydrogenation activity is achieved, thereby generating a cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building block.







Abstract
The biologically important, FAD&#8208;containing acyl&#8208;coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenases (ACAD) usually catalyze the anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination of a proton and a hydride of aliphatic CoA thioesters. Here, we report on the structure and function of an ACAD from anaerobic bacteria catalyzing the unprecedented 1,4&#8208;elimination at C3 and C6 of cyclohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1CoA) to cyclohex&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (Ch1,5CoA) and at C3 and C4 of the latter to benzoyl&#8208;CoA. Based on high&#8208;resolution Ch1CoA dehydrogenase crystal structures, the unorthodox reactivity is explained by the presence of a catalytic aspartate base (D91) at C3, and by eliminating the catalytic glutamate base at C1. Moreover, C6 of Ch1CoA and C4 of Ch1,5CoA are positioned towards FAD&#8208;N5 to favor the biologically relevant C3,C6&#8208; over the C3,C4&#8208;dehydrogenation activity. The C1,C2&#8208;dehydrogenation activity was regained by structure&#8208;inspired amino acid exchanges. The results provide the structural rationale for the extended catalytic repertoire of ACADs and offer previously unknown biocatalytic options for the synthesis of cyclic 1,3&#8208;diene building blocks.

         <title>Discovery, Biocatalytic Exploration and Structural Analysis of a 4&#8208;Ethylphenol Oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gc4EO, a new member of the VAO/PCMH family from the actinobacteria Gulosibacter chungangensis was discovered. This oxidase is a very appealing biocatalyst for the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylphenols, exhibiting high conversion yields with an attractive chemoselectivity towards the production of alkenes. Gc4EO showed high activity to produce 4&#8208;vinylphenol, an interesting building block for the synthesis of polyvinylphenol.







Abstract
The vanillyl&#8208;alcohol oxidase (VAO) family is a rich source of biocatalysts for the oxidative bioconversion of phenolic compounds. Through genome mining and sequence comparisons, we found that several family members lack a generally conserved catalytic aspartate. This finding led us to study a VAO&#8208;homolog featuring a glutamate residue in place of the common aspartate. This 4&#8208;ethylphenol oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis (Gc4EO) shares 42&#8201;% sequence identity with VAO from Penicillium simplicissimum, contains the same 8&#945;&#8208;N3&#8208;histidyl&#8208;bound FAD and uses oxygen as electron acceptor. However, Gc4EO features a distinct substrate scope and product specificity as it is primarily effective in the dehydrogenation of para&#8208;substituted phenols with little generation of hydroxylated products. The three&#8208;dimensional structure shows that the characteristic glutamate side chain creates a closely packed environment that may limit water accessibility and thereby protect from hydroxylation. With its high thermal stability, well defined structural properties and high expression yields, Gc4EO may become a catalyst of choice for the specific dehydrogenation of phenolic compounds bearing small substituents.

How far does energy migrate in DNA? DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport is a new pathway to DNA photodamage occurring at remote sites and not locally at the site of excitation by light. Although these distances might be small with regard to a whole gene, the proposal that a site might be damaged other than the site of initial photoexcitation is important to the understanding of mutations that are caused by remote DNA photodamages.







Abstract
Local DNA photodamaging by light is well&#8208;studied and leads to a number of structurally identified direct damage, in particular cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and indirect oxidatively generated damage, such as 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;hydroxyguanine. Similar damages have now been found at remote sites, at least more than 105&#8197;&#197; (30 base pairs) away from the site of photoexcitation. In contrast to the established mechanisms of local DNA photodamaging, the processes of remote photodamage are only partially understood. Known pathways include those to remote oxidatively generated DNA photodamages, which were elucidated by studying electron hole transport through the DNA about 20&#8197;years ago. Recent studies with DNA photosensitizers and mechanistic proposals on photoinduced DNA&#8208;mediated energy transport are summarized in this minireview. These new mechanisms to a new type of remote DNA photodamaging provide an important extension to our general understanding to light&#8208;induced DNA damage and their mutations.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Dual Modulators of A&#946; and Tau Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The screening of a focused library of 52 thiophene molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation identified lead compounds. The potent lead compound effectively rescued neuronal cells from aggregation&#8208;induced toxicity and establish thiophene compound as a dual modulator of A&#946; and Tau aggregation.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A&#946;) and Tau aggregates in the brain, which induces various pathological events resulting in neurodegeneration. There have been continuous efforts to develop modulators of the A&#946; and Tau aggregation process to halt or modify disease progression. A few small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based inhibitors that target both A&#946; and Tau pathology have been reported. Here, we report the screening of a targeted library of small molecules to modulate A&#946; and Tau aggregation together with their in&#8197;vitro, in&#8197;silico and cellular studies. In&#8197;vitro ThT fluorescence assay, dot blot assay, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results have shown that thiophene&#8208;based lead molecules effectively modulate A&#946; aggregation and inhibit Tau aggregation. In&#8197;silico studies performed by employing molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding&#8208;free energy calculations have helped in understanding the mechanism of interaction of the lead thiophene compounds with A&#946; and Tau fibril targets. In&#8197;cellulo studies revealed that the lead candidate is biocompatible and effectively ameliorates neuronal cells from A&#946; and Tau&#8208;mediated amyloid toxicity.

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs enables efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The cover feature demonstrates how PylT recodes an amber stop codon within a GFP reporter to direct site&#8208;specific incorporation of an ncAA, leading to GFP fluorescence throughout the organoid, as visible by light&#8208;sheet microscopy. The method will help to implement existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies for probing and manipulating proteins in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. van&#8197;Husen et&#8197;al.

         <title>TET&#8208;Like Oxidation in 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and Derivatives: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex 1 towards a number of methylated cytosine and uracil substrates was investigated. The reaction rates are in very good agreement with the calculated BDEs. C&#8208;Methylated compounds such as 5mC, T and 5miC possess a different reactivity than the solely N&#8208;methylated compounds 1mC and 1mU.







Abstract
The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) is an important factor in DNA modification and epigenetics. It can be modified through a three&#8208;step oxidation performed by ten&#8208;eleven&#8208;translocation (TET) enzymes and we have previously reported that the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [Fe(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can oxidize 5mC. Here, we report the reactivity of this iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex towards a wider scope of methylated cytosine and uracil derivatives relevant for synthetic DNA applications, such as 1&#8208;methylcytosine (1mC), 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;iso&#8208;cytosine (5miC) and thymine (T/5mU). The observed kinetic parameters are corroborated by calculation of the C&#8722;H bond energies at the reactive sites which was found to be an efficient tool for reaction rate prediction of 1 towards methylated DNA bases. We identified oxidation products of methylated cytosine derivatives using HPLC&#8208;MS and GC&#8208;MS. Thereby, we shed light on the impact of the methyl group position and resulting C&#8722;H bond dissociation energies on reactivity towards TET&#8208;like oxidation.

         <title>Recent Developments in PROTAC&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation: From Bench to Clinic</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past two decades, Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed as a new approach for targeted protein degradation by hijacking the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In this review, we describe recent PROTAC developments, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), an emerging paradigm&#8208;shifting technology, hijacks the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. PROTACs induce ternary complexes between an E3 ligase and POI, and this induced proximity leads to polyUb chain formation on substrates and eventual proteasomal&#8208;mediated POI degradation. PROTACs have shown great therapeutic potential by degrading many disease&#8208;causing proteins, such as the androgen receptor and BRD4. The PROTAC technology has advanced significantly in the last two decades, with the repertoire of PROTAC targets increased tremendously. Herein, we describe recent developments of PROTAC technology, focusing on mechanistic and kinetic studies, pharmacokinetic study, spatiotemporal control of PROTACs, covalent PROTACs, resistance to PROTACs, and new E3 ligands.

         <title>Experimental Perspectives on Direct Visualization of Endosomal Rupture</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endosomal/lysosomal disruption can be directly visualized via lysosome size or genetically engineered cell lines.







Abstract
Endosomal escape continues to be a limiting factor in the therapeutic use of nanomaterials. Assays to visualize endosomal escape often do not decouple the endosomal/lysosomal disruption from the release of payload into the cytosol. Here, we discuss three approaches to directly probe endosomal/lysosomal rupture: calcein dye dilution, lysosome size quantification and endosome/lysosome membrane integrity visualized with a genetically engineered cell line. We apply the three assays to endosomes/lysosomes ruptured via osmotic pressure and photochemical internalization.

         <title>Non&#8208;canonical Amino Acid Substrates of E. coli Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising diversity: The aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases from E. coli have been extensively explored, and a surprising number of amino acid substrates have been described. This comprehensive review catalogues all known substrates for these enzymes and highlights trends and novel applications.







Abstract
In this comprehensive review, I focus on the twenty E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases and their ability to charge non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) onto tRNAs. The promiscuity of these enzymes has been harnessed for diverse applications including understanding and engineering of protein function, creation of organisms with an expanded genetic code, and the synthesis of diverse peptide libraries for drug discovery. The review catalogues the structures of all known ncAA substrates for each of the 20 E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including ncAA substrates for engineered versions of these enzymes. Drawing from the structures in the list, I highlight trends and novel opportunities for further exploitation of these ncAAs in the engineering of protein function, synthetic biology, and in drug discovery.

         <title>What is the Sugar Code?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Information coding by sugars: Letting symbols convey information comes in many forms such as the QR code. We explain that sugars are an ideal alphabet of life. They form an unsurpassed size of bio&#8208;vocabulary. It is read and translated by a matching diversity of sugar receptors (lectins) so that establishing a dictionary for the glyco&#8208;vocabulary is now in progress. The given QR code directs you to our review on the sugar code.







Abstract
A code is defined by the nature of the symbols, which are used to generate information&#8208;storing combinations (e.&#8201;g. oligo&#8208; and polymers). Like nucleic acids and proteins, oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides are ubiquitous, and they are a biochemical platform for establishing molecular messages. Of note, the letters of the sugar code system (third alphabet of life) excel in coding capacity by making an unsurpassed versatility for isomer (code word) formation possible by variability in anomery and linkage position of the glycosidic bond, ring size and branching. The enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis (writers) realizes this enormous potential for building a large vocabulary. It includes possibilities for dynamic editing/erasing as known from nucleic acids and proteins. Matching the glycome diversity, a large panel of sugar receptors (lectins) has developed based on more than a dozen folds. Lectins &#8216;read&#8217; the glycan&#8208;encoded information. Hydrogen/coordination bonding and ionic pairing together with stacking and C&#8722;H/&#960;&#8208;interactions as well as modes of spatial glycan presentation underlie the selectivity and specificity of glycan&#8208;lectin recognition. Modular design of lectins together with glycan display and the nature of the cognate glycoconjugate account for the large number of post&#8208;binding events. They give an entry to the glycan vocabulary its functional, often context&#8208;dependent meaning(s), hereby building the dictionary of the sugar code.

         <title>Modular Design of Supramolecular Ionic Peptides with Cell&#8208;Selective Membrane Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly designed cationic peptides having low membrane activity undergo cell&#8208;specific enzyme triggered chemical transformation and self&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular cationic clusters with enhanced membrane activity. The cell&#8208;selective membrane activity by in&#8197;situ formed peptide assembly is a highly desirable feature for targeted molecular imaging and therapy.







Abstract
The rational design of materials with cell&#8208;selective membrane activity is an effective strategy for the development of targeted molecular imaging and therapy. Here we report a new class of cationic multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated molecular transformation followed by supramolecular assembly to form nanofibers in which cationic clusters are presented on a rigid &#946;&#8208;sheet backbone. This structural transformation, which is induced by cells overexpressing the specific enzymes, led to a shift in the membrane perturbation potential of the MDPs, and consequently enhanced cell uptake and drug delivery efficacy. We envision the directed self&#8208;assembly based on modularly designed MDPs as a highly promising approach to generate dynamic supramolecular nanomaterials with emerging membrane activity for a range of disease targeted molecular imaging and therapy applications.

         <title>The Chemistry behind ThiC Rearrangement</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ThiC rearrangement is one of the most significant and sophisticated processes of pyrimidine biosynthesis, which has triggered the interest of numerous scientists from both chemistry and biology. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize most of the current processes in the elucidation of the chemistry behind this fascinating transformation, including the responsible enzyme and its structural details.







Abstract
Thiamine (vitamin&#8197;B1) is crucial for life and plays a central role in metabolism. It contains thiazole and pyrimidine moieties that are constructed independently and then assembled together to generate thiamine phosphate. The study of the thiazole moiety is relatively clear, but deciphering the mechanistic enzymology of thiamine pyrimidine is more difficult. This review aims to summarize the recent research progress on ThiC rearrangement, mainly including the mechanism, related enzymes, and genes involved in the rearrangement.

         <title>Design of a full&#8208;consensus glutamate decarboxylase and its application to GABA biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of L&#8208;glutamate to GABA. Improvement of the enzymatic properties of GAD is important for the low&#8208;cost synthesis of GABA. In this study, utilizing sequences of enzymes homologous with GAD from lactic acid bacteria, highly mutated GADs were designed using sequence&#8208;based protein design methods. Two mutated GADs, FcGAD and AncGAD, generated by full&#8208;consensus design and ancestral sequence reconstruction, had more desirable properties than native GADs. With respect to thermal stability, the half&#8208;life of the designed GADs was about 10&#176;C higher than that of native GAD. The productivity of FcGAD was considerably higher than those of known GADs; more than 250 mg/L of purified enzyme could be produced in the  E. coli  expression system. In a production test using 26.4 g of L&#8208;glutamate and 3.0 g of resting cells, 17.2 g of GABA could be prepared within one hour, without purification, in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;3&#8208;Glycerol Phosphate Synthase From Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Potential New Drug Target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) catalyzes the indole&#8208;forming step in bacterial tryptophan biosynthesis. This minireview summarizes the data on expression, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition of IGPS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Crystal structures are also analyzed and compared to reveal structure&#8208;function relationships of value for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.







Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, affects millions of people worldwide. Several TB drugs have lost efficacy due to emerging drug resistance and new anti&#8208;TB targets are needed. Recent research suggests that indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) in M. tuberculosis (MtIGPS) could be such a target. IGPS is a (&#946;/&#945;)8&#8208;barrel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1&#8208;(o&#8208;carboxyphenylamino)&#8208;1&#8208;deoxyribulose 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (CdRP) into indole&#8208;glycerol&#8208;phosphate (IGP) in the bacterial tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. M. tuberculosis over expresses the tryptophan pathway genes during an immune response and inhibition of MtIGPS allows CD4 T&#8208;cells to more effectively fight against M. tuberculosis. Here we review the published data on MtIGPS expression, kinetics, mechanism, and inhibition. We also discuss MtIGPS crystal structures and compare them to other IGPS structures to reveal potential structure&#8208;function relationships of interest for the purposes of drug design and biocatalyst engineering.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2&#8208;(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Early steps in the biosynthesis of the organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin are revealed, including a rare example of oxidative cyclization of an alcohol to form an epoxide.







Abstract
The fungal metabolite Fosfonochlorin features a chloroacetyl moiety that is unusual within known phosphonate natural product biochemistry. Putative biosynthetic genes encoding Fosfonochlorin in Fusarium and Talaromyces spp. were investigated through reactions of encoded enzymes with synthetic substrates and isotope labelling studies. We show that the early biosynthetic steps for Fosfonochlorin involve the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to form 2&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, followed by oxidative intramolecular cyclization of the resulting alcohol to form (S)&#8208;epoxyethylphosphonic acid. The latter reaction is catalyzed by FfnD, a rare example of a non&#8208;heme iron/2&#8208;(oxo)glutarate dependent oxacyclase. In contrast, FfnD behaves as a more typical oxygenase with ethylphosphonic acid, producing (S)&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxyethylphosphonic acid. FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.

         <title>Reactivity Analysis of New Multivalent Electrophilic Probes for Affinity Labeling of Carbohydrate Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of gold nanoparticle&#8208;based affinity labeling probes multivalently presenting different electrophilic groups and a carbohydrate ligand was synthesized to evaluate their reactivity against lectins. The p&#8208; and m&#8208;isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together are promising alternatives to photoreactive groups as protein&#8208;reactive affinity labels for target identification studies.







Abstract
We have designed and synthesized six different multivalent electrophiles as carbohydrate affinity labeling probes. Evaluation of the reactivity of the electrophiles against peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) showed that p&#8208; and m&#8208;aryl sulfonyl fluoride are effective protein reactive groups that label carbohydrate binding lectins in a ligand&#8208;dependent fashion at a nanomolar probe concentration. Analysis of the selectivity of affinity labeling in the presence of excess BSA as a nonspecific protein indicated that m&#8208;arylsulfonyl fluoride is a more selective protein&#8208;reactive group, albeit with attenuated reactivity. Further analysis showed that the labeling efficiency of the multivalent electrophilic probes can be improved by employing reaction conditions involving 25&#8201;&#176;C instead of typically employed 4&#8201;&#176;C. Both isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together represent promising affinity labels for target identification studies that could serve as more efficient alternatives to photoreactive groups.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Mesophilic CTP&#8208;Dependent Riboflavin Kinase and Rational Engineering to Create Its Thermostable Homologues**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinases typically use ATP to phosphorylate their substrates. But not this one! Archaeal riboflavin kinases (RibK), characterized by a unique structural fold, select CTP over all other nucleotides for phosphorylating riboflavin (Vitamin B2) to produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we report the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal RibK from Methanococcus maripaludis. Further, using structural bioinformatics and computational studies, we determined the molecular determinants that confer thermostability to MmpRibK, making this class of enzymes amenable to bioengineering applications.







Abstract
Flavins play a central role in metabolism as molecules that catalyze a wide range of redox reactions in living organisms. Several variations in flavin biosynthesis exist among the domains of life, and their analysis has revealed many new structural and mechanistic insights till date. The cytidine triphosphate (CTP)&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase in archaea is one such example. Unlike most kinases that use adenosine triphosphate, archaeal riboflavin kinases utilize CTP to phosphorylate riboflavin and produce flavin mononucleotide. In this study, we present the characterization of a new mesophilic archaeal CTP&#8208;utilizing riboflavin kinase homologue from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmpRibK), which is linked closely in sequence to the previously characterized thermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii homologue. We reconstitute the activity of MmpRibK, determine its kinetic parameters and molecular factors that contribute to its unique properties, and finally establish the residues that improve its thermostability using computation and a series of experiments. Our work advances the molecular understanding of flavin biosynthesis in archaea by the characterization of the first mesophilic CTP&#8208;dependent riboflavin kinase. Finally, it validates the role of salt bridges and rigidifying amino acid residues in imparting thermostability to this unique structural fold that characterizes archaeal riboflavin kinase enzymes, with implications in enzyme engineering and biotechnological applications.

Inclusion in cells: Supramolecular porphyrin/per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin complexation is highly specific. Per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin bearing cell&#8208;penetrating peptide and BODIPY is efficiently taken up by cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways and delivers porphyrin into the cells. The supramolecular complexation in cells was directly detected by FRET between porphyrin and BODIPY.







Abstract
Artificial supramolecular systems capable of self&#8208;assembly and that precisely function in biological media are in high demand. Herein, we demonstrate a highly specific host&#8208;guest&#8208;pair system that functions in living cells. A per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative (R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe) bearing both an octaarginine peptide chain and a BODIPY dye was synthesized as a fluorescent intracellular delivery tool. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe was efficiently taken up by HeLa cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways. R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) as a guest molecule in water, from which fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe to TPPS was observed. The FRET phenomenon was clearly detected in living cells using confocal microscopy techniques, which revealed that the formed supramolecular R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe/TPPS complex was maintained within the cells. The R8&#8208;B&#8208;CDMe cytotoxicity assay revealed that the addition of TPPS counteracts the strong cytotoxicity (IC50=16&#8197;&#956;M) of the CD cavity due to complexation within the cells. A series of experiments demonstrated the bio&#8208;orthogonality of the supramolecular per&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD/tetraarylporphyrin host&#8208;guest pair in living cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inclusion in cells&lt;/b&gt;: Supramolecular porphyrin/per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin complexation is highly specific. Per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin bearing cell-penetrating peptide and BODIPY is efficiently taken up by cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways and delivers porphyrin into the cells. The supramolecular complexation in cells was directly detected by FRET between porphyrin and BODIPY.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial supramolecular systems capable of self-assembly and that precisely function in biological media are in high demand. Herein, we demonstrate a highly specific host-guest-pair system that functions in living cells. A per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin derivative (R8-B-CD&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;) bearing both an octaarginine peptide chain and a BODIPY dye was synthesized as a fluorescent intracellular delivery tool. R8-B-CD&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt; was efficiently taken up by HeLa cells through both endocytosis and direct transmembrane pathways. R8-B-CD&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt; formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) as a guest molecule in water, from which fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from R8-B-CD&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt; to TPPS was observed. The FRET phenomenon was clearly detected in living cells using confocal microscopy techniques, which revealed that the formed supramolecular R8-B-CD&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;/TPPS complex was maintained within the cells. The R8-B-CD&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxicity assay revealed that the addition of TPPS counteracts the strong cytotoxicity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=16&#8197;&#956;M) of the CD cavity due to complexation within the cells. A series of experiments demonstrated the bio-orthogonality of the supramolecular per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&#946;-CD/tetraarylporphyrin host-guest pair in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Red&#8208;Blood&#8208;Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Metal&#8208;Drug Nanoparticles for Enhanced Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) were designed and synthesized that self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. The obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell membranes to improve their stability and dispersity.







Abstract
To overcome high toxicity, low bioavailability and poor water solubility of chemotherapeutics, a variety of drug carriers have been designed. However, most carriers are severely limited by low drug loading capacity and adverse side e&#64256;ects. Here, a new type of metal&#8208;drug nanoparticles (MDNs) was designed and synthesized. The MDNs self&#8208;assembled with Fe(III) ions and drug molecules through coordination, resulting in nanoparticles with high drug loading. To assist systemic delivery and prolong circulation time, the obtained MDNs were camouflaged with red blood cell (RBCs) membranes (RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs) to improve their stability and dispersity. The RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs presented pH&#8208;responsive release functionalities, resulting in drug release accelerated in acidic tumor microenvironments. The outstanding in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor therapeutic outcome was realized by RBCs@Fe&#8208;DOX MDNs. This study provides an innovative design guideline for chemotherapy and demonstrates the great capacity of nanomaterials in anticancer treatments.

         <title>Structural Basis for The Recognition of Deaminated Nucleobases by An Archaeal DNA Polymerase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their life in hot environments, archaea are increasingly affected by deamination of the bases cytosine and adenine. To prevent mutations, archaeal DNA polymerases seem to recognize these base changes by a so&#8208;called &#8220;read&#8208;ahead&#8221; mechanism and react accordingly. Here we show by means of crystal structures how Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase binds uracil and hypoxanthine in a special binding pocket and thus can recognize these bases on the single stranded template overhang already six nucleotides before the active site.







Abstract
With increasing temperature, nucleobases in DNA become increasingly damaged by hydrolysis of exocyclic amines. The most prominent damage includes the conversion of cytosine to uracil and adenine to hypoxanthine. These damages are mutagenic and put the integrity of the genome at risk if not repaired appropriately. Several archaea live at elevated temperatures and thus, are exposed to a higher risk of deamination. Earlier studies have shown that DNA polymerases of archaea have the property of sensing deaminated nucleobases in the DNA template and thereby stalling the DNA synthesis during DNA replication providing another layer of DNA damage recognition and repair. However, the structural basis of uracil and hypoxanthine sensing by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases is sparse. Here we report on three new crystal structures of the archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD) DNA polymerase in complex with primer and template strands that have extended single stranded DNA template 5&#8217;&#8208;overhangs. These overhangs contain either the canonical nucleobases as well as uracil or hypoxanthine, respectively, and provide unprecedented structural insights into their recognition by archaeal B&#8208;family DNA polymerases.

         <title>B4GALNT2 Controls Sda and SLex Antigen Biosynthesis in Healthy and Cancer Human Colon</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the progress made in understanding the various regulatory mechanisms underpinning Sda and SLex expression in the human gastrointestinal tract.







Abstract
The Sda carbohydrate antigen and the corresponding biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 are primarily expressed in human normal colonic mucosa and are down&#8208;regulated to variable degrees in colon cancer. On the other hand, the tumor associated antigen SLex is not detected in the healthy colon and is upregulated in colon cancer. High level of B4GALNT2 gene expression appears to be a good marker of prognosis in colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating these carbohydrate antigens&#8217; expression are still poorly understood. We review here the most recent progress made towards understanding this balanced expression of blood group carbohydrate epitopes Sda and SLex. In particular in recent years, we have attained a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of the B4GALNT2 gene and of the subcellular fate of B4GALNT2 isoforms.

         <title>Engineering Nanorobots for Tumor&#8208;Targeting Drug Delivery: From Dynamic Control to Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanorobots are considered an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming option for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. We classified nanorobots into two types: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. One is equipped with self&#8208;propulsion and dynamic control ability while the other can detect the biological signal and perform controlled drug release. Moreover, prospects and challenges of nanorobots are discussed, intending to promote their clinical translation.







Abstract
Nanotechnology has been widely applied to the fabrication of drug delivery systems in the past decades. Recently, with the progress made in microfabrication approaches, nanorobots are steadily becoming a promising means for tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery. In general, nanorobots can be divided into two categories: nanomotors and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots. Nanomotors are nanoscale systems with the ability to convert surrounding energies into mechanical motion, whereas stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are featured with activatable capacity in response to various endogenous and exogenous stimulations. In this minireview, the dynamic control of nanomotors and the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanorobots are overviewed, with particular emphasis on their contribution to tumor&#8208;targeting therapy. Moreover, challenges and perspectives associated with the future development of nanorobots are presented.

         <title>Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) recapitulate key features of the developing brain and can model complex neurological disorders. Integrating the PylRS/PylT pair into the genome of hiPSCs allows efficient site&#8208;directed incorporation of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) and allows derivatization of neurons and brain organoids with an expanded genetic code. The method will make existing ncAA&#8208;based strategies to probe and manipulate proteins in live cells accessible in hiPSC&#8208;derived complex human disease models.







Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized studies on human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac&#8208;mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to an amber stop codon. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA&#8208;bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site&#8208;directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC&#8208;derived cell types and complex tissue models.

         <title>Xylose&#8208;Configured Cyclophellitols as Selective Inhibitors for Glucocerebrosidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New selective GBA inhibitor: We show that the &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylose configured epoxide and aziridine are potent selective inhibitors towards GBA in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and their selectivity and inhibitory effect towards GBA are superior to the widely used GBA inhibitor Conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE).







Abstract
Glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidase, has recently been shown to hydrolyze &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides and to transxylosylate cholesterol. Genetic defects in GBA cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD), and also constitute a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. GBA and other retaining glycosidases can be selectively visualized by activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) using fluorescent probes composed of a cyclophellitol scaffold having a configuration tailored to the targeted glycosidase family. GBA processes &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylosides in addition to &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosides, this in contrast to the other two mammalian cellular retaining &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosidases, GBA2 and GBA3. Here we show that the xylopyranose preference also holds up for covalent inhibitors: xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridines selectively react with GBA over GBA2 and GBA3 in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and that the xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol is more potent and more selective for GBA than the classical GBA inhibitor, conduritol B&#8208;epoxide (CBE). Both xylose&#8208;configured cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridine cause accumulation of glucosylsphingosine in zebrafish embryo, a characteristic hallmark of GD, and we conclude that these compounds are well suited for creating such chemically induced GD models.

         <title>S&#8208;Denitrosylase&#8208;Like Activity of Cyclic Diselenides Conjugated with Xaa&#8208;His Dipeptide: Role of Proline Spacer as a Key Activity Booster</title>

         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine conjugated with Pro&#8208;His dipeptide, a novel S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic, effectively promoted the cysteinyl S&#8208;denitrosylation and prevented protein misfolding caused by the S&#8208;nitrosylation. Structural analyses of the compound suggested that the diselenol form, which is produced as a key reactive species during the catalytic reaction, is thermodynamically stabilized by forming a &#947;&#8208;turn, dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity.







Abstract
This study developed dipeptide&#8208;conjugated 1,2&#8208;diselenan&#8208;4&#8208;amine (1), i.&#8201;e., 1&#8208;Xaa&#8208;His, as a new class of S&#8208;denitrosylase mimic. The synthesized compounds, especially 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His, remarkably promoted S&#8208;denitrosylation of nitrosothiols (RSNO) via a catalytic cycle involving the reversible redox reaction between the diselenide and its corresponding diselenol ([SeH,SeH]) form with coexisting reductant thiols (R&#8242;SH), during which the [SeH,SeH] form as a key reactive species reduces RSNO to the corresponding thiol (RSH). Structural analyses of 1&#8208;Pro&#8208;His suggested that the peptide backbone of [SeH,SeH] is rigidly bent to form a &#947;&#8208;turn, possibly including an NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se hydrogen bond between the imidazole ring of His and selenol group, thus stabilizing the [SeH,SeH] form thermodynamically, and dramatically enhancing the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the synthetic compounds were found to prohibit S&#8208;nitrosylation&#8208;induced protein misfolding in the presence of RSNO, eventually implying their potential as a drug seed for misfolding diseases caused by the dysregulation of the S&#8208;denitrosylation system.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Enzymology for Diagnostics: Profiling Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule enzymology can be used to profile heterogeneous enzyme activity in clinical samples. A diluted sample is mixed with a substrate, and the mixture is loaded to a microwell array. The change in fluorescence over time in wells containing an enzyme is used to quantify the enzyme activity, resulting in a distinct fingerprint for the target enzyme. This fingerprint is used for the quantification of multiple enzyme isotypes in the sample.







Abstract
Enzymes can be used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, profiling enzyme activity in clinical samples is challenging due to the heterogeneity in enzyme activity, and the low abundance of the target enzyme in biofluids. Single&#8208;molecule methods can overcome these challenges by providing information on the distribution of enzyme activities in a sample. Here, we describe the concept of using the single&#8208;molecule enzymology (SME) method to analyze enzymatic activity in clinical samples. We present recent work focused on measuring alkaline phosphatase isotypes in serum samples using SME. Future work will involve improving and simplifying this technology, and applying it to other enzymes for diagnostics.

         <title>Identification of the Catalytic Residues in the Cyclase Domain of the Class IV Lanthipeptide Synthetase SgbL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL were identified and validated in this study. It was demonstrated how each of these residues is crucial for the formation of the methyllanthionine &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks from Cys thiols and dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine residues in the modified globisporin precursor peptide SgbA(S20T).







Abstract
Lanthipeptides belong to the family of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and are subdivided into different classes based on their processing enzymes. The three&#8208;domain class IV lanthipeptide synthetases (LanL enzymes) consist of N&#8208;terminal lyase, central kinase, and C&#8208;terminal cyclase domains. While the catalytic residues of the kinase domains (mediating ATP&#8208;dependent Ser/Thr phosphorylations) and the lyase domains (carrying out subsequent phosphoserine/phosphothreonine (pSer/pThr) eliminations to yield dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine (Dha/Dhb) residues) have been characterized previously, such studies are missing for LanL cyclase domains. To close this gap of knowledge, this study reports on the identification and validation of the catalytic residues in the cyclase domain of the class IV lanthipeptide synthetase SgbL, which facilitate the nucleophilic attacks by Cys thiols on Dha/Dhb residues for the formation of &#946;&#8208;thioether crosslinks.

         <title>Potent Tau Aggregation Inhibitor D&#8208;Peptides Selected against Tau&#8208;Repeat 2 Using Mirror Image Phage Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. We employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify Tau binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides prevent the formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich Tau fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. They might be interesting for AD therapy.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau protein, as well as toxic Tau oligomers. Therefore, inhibitors of pathological Tau aggregation are potentially useful candidates for future therapies targeting Tauopathies. Two hexapeptides within Tau, designated PHF6* (275&#8208;VQIINK&#8208;280) and PHF6 (306&#8208;VQIVYK&#8208;311), are known to promote Tau aggregation. Recently, the PHF6* segment has been described as the more potent driver of Tau aggregation. We therefore employed mirror&#8208;image phage display with a large peptide library to identify PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids. The suitability of D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides for in&#8197;vivo applications, which are protease stable and less immunogenic than L&#8208;peptides, has already been demonstrated. The identified D&#8208;enantiomeric peptide MMD3 and its retro&#8208;inverso form, designated MMD3rev, inhibited in&#8197;vitro fibrillization of the PHF6* peptide, the repeat domain of Tau as well as full&#8208;length Tau. Dynamic light scattering, pelleting assays and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that MMD3 prevents the formation of tau &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich fibrils by diverting Tau into large amorphous aggregates. NMR data suggest that the D&#8208;enantiomeric peptides bound to Tau monomers with rather low affinity, but ELISA (enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) data demonstrated binding to PHF6* and full length Tau fibrils. In addition, molecular insight into the binding mode of MMD3 to PHF6* fibrils were gained by in silico modelling. The identified PHF6*&#8208;targeting peptides were able to penetrate cells. The study establishes PHF6* fibril binding peptides consisting of D&#8208;enantiomeric amino acids as potential molecules for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in AD research.

         <title>Exosomes as Targeted Delivery Platform of CRISPR/Cas9 for Therapeutic Genome Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Granting CRISPR/Cas9 molecules a protecting shield and a guiding &#8220;GPS&#8221;, engineered exosomes enable genome editing selectively in targeted cells or tissues. These natural vehicles also encompass rich functional molecules which their synthetic counterparts do not have, making them an appealing tool for both basic research and translational medicine.







Abstract
Therapeutic genome editing harnesses the power of genome editing tools to correct erroneous genes associated with disease pathology. To bring the CRISPR/Cas9 tool from the bench to the bedside, a critical hurdle is the safe and efficient delivery of this nucleic acid tool to the desired type of cells in patients. This review discusses the use of natural carriers, extracellular vesicles (EVs), in particular exosomes, to fill the gap. Exosomes are lipid&#8208;containing nanovesicle released by various types of cells to mediate cell&#8208;cell communications. Their inherent long&#8208;distance transportation capability, biocompatibility, and engineerability have made EVs potential vehicles for delivering therapeutic drugs. We summarize the recent progress of harnessing exosomes as delivery vehicles for the CRISPR/Cas system to achieve therapeutic gene editing for disease treatment, with a focus on various strategies to achieve selective delivery to a particular type of cell and efficient packaging of the genome editing tools in the vesicles. Critical issues and possible solutions in the design and engineering of the targeting vehicles are highlighted. Taken together, we demonstrate EV/exosome&#8208;mediated packaging of the nucleic acid/protein tools and the cell/tissue&#8208;targeted delivery to be a viable way towards the clinical translation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

         <title>Development of Tyrphostin Analogues to Study Inhibition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pup Proteasome System**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like (pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development. In this study a screen was performed identifying Tyrphostins as low micromolar inhibitors of the Mtb protease Dop. To gain insight in the important functional aspects of these inhibitors, 25 new analogues were prepared and validated, in&#8197;vitro. Several new compounds were able to inhibit both the depupylating activity of Dop as well as the pupylating activity of de pup ligase PafA.







Abstract
Tuberculosis is a global health problem caused by infection with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacteria. Although antibiotic treatment has dramatically reduced the impact of tuberculosis on the population, the existence and spreading of drug resistant strains urgently demands the development of new drugs that target Mtb in a different manner than currently used antibiotics. The prokaryotic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (Pup) proteasome system is an attractive target for new drug development as it is unique to Mtb and related bacterial genera. Using a Pup&#8208;based fluorogenic substrate, we screened for inhibitors of Dop, the Mtb depupylating protease, and identified I&#8208;OMe&#8208;Tyrphostin AG538 (1) and Tyrphostin AG538 (2). The hits were validated and determined to be fast&#8208;reversible, non&#8208;ATP competitive inhibitors. We synthesized &gt;25 analogs of 1 and 2 and show that several of the synthesized compounds also inhibit the depupylation actions of Dop on native substrate, FabD&#8208;Pup. Importantly, the pupylation activity of PafA, the sole Pup ligase in Mtb, was also inhibited by some of these compounds.

         <title>Chimeric Flaviviral RNA&#8722;siRNA Molecules Resist Degradation by The Exoribonuclease Xrn1 and Trigger Gene Silencing in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules comprising an Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA motif (xrRNA) and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex were engineered. The molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in mammalian cells. This work sets the stage for further investigations into using xrRNA motifs as building blocks in RNA&#8208;based nanotechnology.







Abstract
RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery, but the susceptibility of RNA to nuclease degradation remains a major barrier to its implementation in&#8197;vivo. Here, we engineered flaviviral Xrn1&#8208;resistant RNA (xrRNA) motifs to host small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. The xrRNA&#8208;siRNA molecules self&#8208;assemble in&#8197;vitro, resist degradation by the conserved eukaryotic 5&#8217; to 3&#8217; exoribonuclease Xrn1, and trigger gene silencing in 293T cells. The resistance of the molecules to Xrn1 does not translate to stability in blood serum. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that flavivirus&#8208;derived xrRNA motifs can confer Xrn1 resistance on a model therapeutic payload and set the stage for further investigations into using the motifs as building blocks in RNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP): A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate (DAP) is a dinitrogenous derivative of orthophosphate with demonstrated prebiotic phosphorylation capabilities in aqueous medium. The ability of DAP to facilitate phosphorylation&#8208;mediated transformation of a range of abiotic and biotic molecules warrants a deeper scrutiny of: (a)&#8197;its plausible geochemical provenance on the early Earth, (b)&#8197;its prospects for synthetic and bioorganic chemistry applications, and (c)&#8197;its potential role in transforming various classes of molecules leading to systems with emergent properties capable of exhibiting life&#8208;like behavior (synthetic biology). The graphic was designed by Dr. Eddy&#8197;I. Jim&#233;nez (Scripps Research). More information can be found in the Review by A. Osumah and R. Krishnamurthy.

         <title>X&#8208;rays Actuate Anticancer Drugs: Opening New Vistas in Prodrug Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prodrug approach has emerged as a promising strategy for alleviating important limitations of small&#8208;molecule blockbuster chemotherapeutic drugs. Efficient and precise activation of a prodrug is the key for achieving the full potential of this strategy. Herein, we highlight the potential of X&#8208;rays for activating a prodrug locally in deep&#8208;seated tumors and point out its advantage over other activation triggers such as light.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality employed in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. Despite proven clinical success, adverse side effects are one of the drawbacks of this approach. The prodrug strategy has emerged as an alternative approach with the aim of alleviating these drawbacks. Prodrug activation is typically achieved by either endogenous or exogenous triggers. Exogenous triggers like light are appealing as they are independent of inherent patient and/or cancer&#8208;type variations. However, tissue penetration depth remains the Achilles&#8217; heel of this approach. In this context, usage of X&#8208;rays as the external trigger with infinite tissue penetration depth opens up exciting prospects in prodrug activation strategies.

         <title>Differential Effect of Azetidine Substitution in Firefly Luciferin Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assemble the puzzle: Replacing the N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in classical fluorophores with a four membered azetidine ring provides improved quantum yields. This strategy was extended to four types of bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and its differential effect was evaluated. Among them, the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from azetidine substitution and showed improvements of in fluorescence and bioluminescence emission.







Abstract
Replacing an N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group in a classical fluorophore with a four membered azetidine ring provides an improved luminescence quantum yield. Herein, we extended this strategy to bioluminescent firefly luciferin analogues and evaluated its general validity. For this purpose, four types of luciferin cores were employed, and a total of eight analogues were evaluated. Among these analogues, unexpectedly, only the benzothiazole core analogue benefited from an azetidine substitution and showed enhanced bioluminescence. In addition, fluorescence measurements revealed that an azetidine substitution improved the fluorescence quantum yield by 2.3&#8208;times compared to a N,N&#8208;dimethylamino group. These findings clarify the differential effects of azetidine substituents in luciferins and present one possible strategy for enhancing photon output in benzothiazole type luciferins through a synthetic approach.
