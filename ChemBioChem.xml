         <title>Porphyrin in prebiotic catalysis: Ascertaining a route for the emergence of early metalloporphyrins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal ions are known to catalyze certain prebiotic reactions. However, the transition from metal ions to extant metalloenzymes remains unclear. Porphyrins are found ubiquitously in the catalytic core of many ancient metalloenzymes. In this study, we evaluated the influence of porphyrin&#8208;based organic scaffold, on the catalysis, emergence and putative molecular evolution of prebiotic metalloporphyrins. We studied the effect of porphyrins on the transition metal ion&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ). We report a change in the catalytic activity of the metal ions in the presence of porphyrin. This was observed to be facilitated by the coordination between metal ions and porphyrins or by the formation of non&#8208;coordinated complexes. The metal&#8208;porphyrin complexes also oxidized NADH, underscoring its versatility at oxidizing more than one substrate. Our study highlights the selective advantage that some of the metal ions would have had in the presence of porphyrin, underscoring their role in shaping the evolution of protometalloenzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A major shell protein of 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilization microcompartment conserves the activity of its signature enzyme at higher temperatures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A classic example of an all&#8208;protein natural nano&#8208;bioreactor, the bacterial microcompartment is a special kind of prokaryotic organelle that confine enzymes within a small volume enveloped by an outer protein shell. These protein compartments metabolize specific organic molecules, allowing bacteria to survive in restricted nutrient environments. In this work, 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilization microcompartment (PduMCP)&#160; is used as a model to study the effect of molecular confinement on the stability and catalytic activity of native enzymes in microcompartment. A combination of enzyme assays, spectroscopic techniques, binding assays, and computational analysis are used to evaluate the impact of the major shell protein PduBB' on the stability and activity of PduMCP's signature enzyme, diol dehydratase PduCDE. While free PduCDE shows ~45% reduction in its optimum activity (activity at 37  o  C) when exposed to a temperature of 45&#176;C, it retains similar activity up to 50&#176;C when encapsulated within PduMCP. PduBB', a major component of the outer shell of PduMCP, preserves the catalytic efficiency of PduCDE under thermal stress and prevents temperature&#8208;induced unfolding and aggregation of PduCDE  in vitro  . We observe that while both PduB and PduB' interact with the enzyme with micromolar affinity, only the PduBB' combination influences its activity and stability, highlighting the importance of the unique PduBB' combination in the functioning of PduMCP.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;assisted delivery of a model drug to genomic DNA: Key information from ultrafast spectroscopy and in silico study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intended drug delivery to a target without adverse effect is one of the major criteria for its acceptance in real use. Herein, we have made an attempt to explore the delivery efficacy of SDS surfactant in a monomer and micellar stage during the delivery of model drug, Toluidine Blue (TB) from micellar cavity to DNA. Molecular recognition of pre&#8208;micellar SDS encapsulated TB with DNA occurs at a rate constant (k1~652 s&#8208;1). On the contrary, no significant release of encapsulated TB at micellar concentration was observed within the experimental time frame. This originated from the higher binding affinity of TB towards the nano cavity of SDS at micellar concentration which doesn&#8217;t allow the delivery of TB from the nano cavity of SDS micelle to DNA. Thus, molecular recognition controls the extent of DNA recognition by TB which in turn modulates the rate of delivery of TB from SDS in a concentration dependent morphology</dc:description>

         <title>Phenyl Selenide&#8208;Based Precursors as Hydrogen Peroxide Inducible DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic DNA lesions, and induce cell death by blocking DNA strands separation. Most developed ICL agents, aiming to kill cancer cells, also generate adverse side effects to normal cells. H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA ICL agents are highly selective to target cancer cells, as the concentration of H2O2 is higher in cancer cells than normal cells. Previous studies focus on arylboronate&#8208;based precursors, reacting with H2O2 to generate reactive quinone methides (QMs) crosslinking DNA. Here we explore phenyl selenide&#8208;based precursors 1&#8208;3 as H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA ICL agents. The precursors 1&#8208;3 can be activated by H2O2 to generate the good benzylic leaving group and promote production of reactive QMs to crosslink DNA. Moreover, the DNA cross&#8208;linking ability is enhanced by the introduction of substituents in the para position of the phenolic hydroxyl group. From the substituents explored (H, OMe, F), the introduction of electron donating group (OMe) shows a pronounced elevating effect. Further mechanistic studies at the molecular and DNA levels confirm alkylation sites located mainly at dAs, dCs and dGs in DNA. Additionally, cellular experiments reveal that agents 1&#8208;3 exhibit higher cytotoxicity toward H1299 human lung cancer cells compared to clinically used drugs, by inducing cellular DNA damage, apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. This study provides a strategy to develop H2O2&#8208;inducible DNA interstrand cross&#8208;linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Fermentative production of halogenated tryptophan derivatives with Corynebacterium glutamicum overexpressing tryptophanase or decarboxylase genes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aromatic amino acid tryptophan serves as a precursor for many valuable compounds such as neuromodulators, indoleamines and indole alkaloids. In this work, tryptophan biosynthesis was extended by halogenation followed by decarboxylation to the respective tryptamines or cleavage to the respective indoles. Either the tryptophanase genes tnaAs from E.&#160;coli and Proteus vulgaris or the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase genes AADCs from Bacillus atrophaeus, Clostridium sporogenes, and Ruminococcus gnavus were expressed in C. glutamicum strains producing (halogenated) tryptophan. Regarding indoles, final titers of 16 mg L&#8208;1 7&#8208;Cl&#8208;indole and 23 mg L&#8208;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;indole were attained. Tryptamine production led to a much higher titer of 2.26 g L&#8208;1 upon expression of AADC from B. atrophaeus. AADCs were shown to be active with halogenated tryptophan in vitro and in vivo and supported production of 0.36 g L&#8208;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;tryptamine with a volumetric productivity of 8.3 mg L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in a fed&#8208;batch fermentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of bPNA Backbone Structural Constraints and Composition on Triplex Hybridization with DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone constraints and amino acid composition of bPNAs exert subtle effects on triplex hybridization with DNA. Design elements that limit backbone conformation favor hybridization, but conservative amino acid mutations can also have a significant effect on hybrid stability.







Abstract
We report herein a study on the impact of bifacial peptide nucleic acid (bPNA) amino acid composition and backbone modification on DNA binding. A series of bPNA backbone variants with identical net charge were synthesized to display either 4 or 6 melamine (M) bases. These bases form thymine&#8208;melamine&#8208;thymine (TMT) base&#8208;triples, resulting in triplex hybrid stem structures with T&#8208;rich DNAs. Analyses of 6&#8197;M bPNA&#8208;DNA hybrids suggested that hybrid stability was linked to amino acid secondary structure propensities, prompting a more detailed study in shorter 4&#8197;M bPNAs. We synthesized 4&#8197;M bPNAs predisposed to adopt helical secondary structure via helix&#8208;turn nucleation in 7&#8208;residue bPNAs using double&#8208;click covalent stapling. Generally, hybrid stability improved upon stapling, but amino acid composition had a more significant effect. We also pursued an alternative strategy for bPNA structural preorganization by incorporation of residues with strong backbone amide conformational preferences such as 4R&#8208; and 4S&#8208;fluoroprolines. Notably, these derivatives exhibited an additional improvement in hybrid stability beyond both unsubstituted proline bPNA analogues and the helically patterned bPNAs. Overall, these findings demonstrate the tunability of bPNA&#8208;DNA hybrid stability through bPNA backbone structural propensities and amino acid composition.

     alt="Impact of bPNA Backbone Structural Constraints and Composition on Triplex Hybridization with DNA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Backbone constraints&lt;/b&gt; and amino acid composition of bPNAs exert subtle effects on triplex hybridization with DNA. Design elements that limit backbone conformation favor hybridization, but conservative amino acid mutations can also have a significant effect on hybrid stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein a study on the impact of bifacial peptide nucleic acid (bPNA) amino acid composition and backbone modification on DNA binding. A series of bPNA backbone variants with identical net charge were synthesized to display either 4 or 6 melamine (M) bases. These bases form thymine-melamine-thymine (TMT) base-triples, resulting in triplex hybrid stem structures with T-rich DNAs. Analyses of 6&#8197;M bPNA-DNA hybrids suggested that hybrid stability was linked to amino acid secondary structure propensities, prompting a more detailed study in shorter 4&#8197;M bPNAs. We synthesized 4&#8197;M bPNAs predisposed to adopt helical secondary structure via helix-turn nucleation in 7-residue bPNAs using double-click covalent stapling. Generally, hybrid stability improved upon stapling, but amino acid composition had a more significant effect. We also pursued an alternative strategy for bPNA structural preorganization by incorporation of residues with strong backbone amide conformational preferences such as 4&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;- and 4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-fluoroprolines. Notably, these derivatives exhibited an additional improvement in hybrid stability beyond both unsubstituted proline bPNA analogues and the helically patterned bPNAs. Overall, these findings demonstrate the tunability of bPNA-DNA hybrid stability through bPNA backbone structural propensities and amino acid composition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Gold Nanorattles in Ultrasensitive H2O2 Sensing and Antioxidant Screening</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxidase&#8208;like activity of gold nanorattles was evaluated and was found to have better efficiency compared to that of solid gold nanocubes and nanospheres. Thus, they were able to sense hydrogen peroxide down to a few micromolar concentrations. These nanorattles were further used to screen antioxidants or determine antioxidant potential.







Abstract
Nanozymes are artificial enzyme systems which are easy to produce, highly stable and cost&#8208;effective in comparison to natural enzymes. Herein, we evaluated the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of gold nanorattles (Au NRTs) having a solid gold octahedron core and thin, porous cubic gold shell. We also prepared solid gold nanocubes and nanospheres of similar sizes and surface charge as that of Au NRTs and compared their activity with standard horse radish peroxidase (HRP). All the prepared nanostructures followed Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics as observed from their substrate concentration vs. initial reaction velocity plot using 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate. The kinetic parameters and the catalytic efficiency for the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the nanostructures and HRP were calculated, and it was observed that Au NRTs possess the best nanozymatic activity with lowest KM and highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). The better activity of Au NRTs compared with other nanostructures and HRP could be attributed to the hollow porous structure with a solid core where different surfaces are available for reaction. Au NRTs, being the best amongst the tested nanozymes were further used for the sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and were found to sense H2O2 down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M. Further, two naturally occurring antioxidants, tannic acid and ascorbic acid showed inhibitory effect on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Au NRTs in a concentration dependent manner which can be further used for screening of antioxidants or for determining the antioxidant potential.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Step Enzymatic Cascade for Efficient Production of L&#8208;Phenylglycine from Biobased L&#8208;Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise four&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for L&#8208;phenylglycine synthesis from biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine was devised. Forty millimolar L&#8208;phenylalanine afforded the synthesis of 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L&#8208;phenylglycine, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion.







Abstract
Enantiopure amino acids are of particular interest in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for efficient production of L&#8208;phenylglycine (L&#8208;Phg) from biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine (L&#8208;Phe). We first attempted to engineer Escherichia coli for expressing L&#8208;amino acid deaminase (LAAD) from Proteus mirabilis, hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from Amycolatopsis orientalis, (S)&#8208;mandelate dehydrogenase (SMDH) from Pseudomonas putida, the endogenous aminotransferase (AT) encoded by ilvE and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) from E. coli. However, 10&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phe only afforded the synthesis of 7.21&#177;0.15&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phg. The accumulation of benzoylformic acid suggested that the transamination step might be rate&#8208;limiting. We next used leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) from Bacillus cereus to bypass the use of L&#8208;glutamate as amine donor, and 40&#8197;mM L&#8208;Phe gave 39.97&#177;3.84&#8197;mM (6.04&#177;0.58&#8197;g/L) L&#8208;Phg, reaching 99.9&#8201;% conversion. In summary, this work demonstrates a concise four&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for L&#8208;Phg synthesis from biobased L&#8208;Phe, with a potential for future industrial applications.

         <title>Characterization of Competitive Inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;Dependent Protein Kinase**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed to combat malaria. Isoxazole&#8208;based compounds were found to be potent, selective, and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is an enticing antimalarial drug target. Novel chemotypes are needed because existing inhibitors have safety issues that may prevent further development. This work demonstrates isoxazole&#8208;based compounds are potent ATP competitive inhibitors of PfPKG and discloses a new analogue in this series. Isoxazoles 3 and 5 had Ki values that are comparable to a known standard, 4&#8208;[2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(1&#8208;methylpiperidine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H pyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;yl] pyridine. They also exhibited excellent selectivity for PfPKG over the human orthologue and the gatekeeper mutant T618Q PfPKG, which mimics the less accessible binding site of the human orthologue. The human orthologue's larger binding site volume is predicted to explain the selectivity of the inhibitors for the P. falciparum enzyme.

A pro&#8208;drug approach delivered sulfonated and phosphonated fluorescent coumarin dyes to live cells without labeling internal membranes. The new dyes exhibited homogeneous cell distribution. In addition, the use of azide groups followed by click chemistry provided fluorogenicity.







Abstract
The delivery of small molecule fluorophores with minimal compartmentalization is currently one of the most critical technical problems in intracellular labelling. Here we introduce sulfonated and phosphonated coumarin dyes, demonstrate rapid cell entry via a prodrug approach, and show a lack of interaction with membranes, organelles, or other compartments. The dyes show no specific localization and are evenly distributed in the cells. Our fluorogenic, clickable phosphonate derivatives successfully tagged model targets in intact cells and the increase in brightness upon click reaction was around 60&#8208;fold.

         <title>Selective Display of a Chemoattractant Agonist on Cancer Cells Activates the Formyl Peptide Receptor 1 on Immune Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current immunotherapeutics often work by directing components of the immune system to recognize biomarkers on the surface of cancer cells to generate an immune response. However, variable changes in biomarker distribution and expression can result in uneven patient response. The development of a more universal tumor&#8208;homing strategy has the potential to improve selectivity and extend therapy to cancers with decreased expression or absence of specific biomarkers. Here, we designed a bifunctional agent that exploits the inherent acidic microenvironment of most solid tumors to selectively graft the surface of cancer cells with a formyl peptide receptor ligand (FPRL). Our approach is based on the pH(Low) Insertion Peptide (pHLIP), a unique peptide that selectively targets tumors  in vivo  by anchoring onto cancer cells in a pH&#8208;dependent manner. We establish that selectively remodeling cancer cells with a pHLIP&#8208;based FPRL activates formyl peptide receptors on recruited immune cells, potentially initiating an immune response towards tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>An Engineered Cholesterol Oxidase Catalyses Enantioselective Oxidation of Non&#8208;steroidal Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Libraries of cholesterol oxidase variants were screened for activity towards secondary alcohols. The active variants oxidised a range of secondary alcohols including unactivated alcohols, and allylic and benzylic alcohols. In conjunction with a non&#8208;selective reducing agent, they effected the deracemisation of racemic alcohols to yield (R)&#8208;alcohols in high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
The enantioselective oxidation of 2&#176; alcohols to ketones is an important reaction in synthetic chemistry, especially if it can be achieved using O2&#8208;driven alcohol oxidases under mild reaction conditions. However to date, oxidation of secondary alcohols using alcohol oxidases has focused on activated benzylic or allylic substrates, with unactivated secondary alcohols showing poor activity. Here we show that cholesterol oxidase (EC&#8197;1.1.3.6) could be engineered for activity towards a range of aliphatic, cyclic, acyclic, allylic and benzylic secondary alcohols. Additionally, since the variants demonstrated high (S)&#8208;selectivity, deracemisation reactions were performed in the presence of ammonia borane to obtain enantiopure (R)&#8208;alcohols.

         <title>Principles of Amino Acid and Nucleotide Revealed by Binding Affinities between Homogeneous Oligopeptides and Single&#8208;stranded DNA Molecule s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have determined the binding strengths between nucleotides of adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine in homogeneous single stranded DNAs and homo&#8208;octapeptides consisting of 20 common amino acids. We use a bead&#8208;based fluorescence assay for these measurements in which octapeptides are immobilized on the bead surface and ssDNAs are in solutions. The results provide a molecular basis for analyzing selectivity, specificity and polymorphisms of amino&#8208;acid&#8208;nucleotide interactions. Comparative analyses of the distribution of the binding energies reveal unique binding strengths patterns assignable to each pair of DNA nucleotide and amino acid originating from the chemical structures. Pronounced favorable (such as Arg&#8208;G  , etc.) and unfavorable (such as Ile&#8208;T  , etc.) binding interactions can be identified in selected groups of amino acid and nucleotide pairs that could provide basis to elucidate energetics of amino&#8208;acid&#8208;nucleotide interactions. Such interaction selectivity, specificity and polymorphism manifest the contributions from DNA backbone, DNA bases, as well as main chain and side chain of the amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;Branched Primer Assembled Gene Nanovector and Its Potential Applications in Genome Editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;branched primer, branch&#8208;PCR provided a size&#8208;tunable method to construct gene nanovectors, which could carry the full CRISPR/Cas9 components but retain a biocompatible size (100&#8211;200&#8197;nm) with high serum stability. This size tunability of branch&#8208;PCR constructed gene nanovectors expands their application in genome editing.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used as an efficient genome editing toolkit for gene therapy. The delivery of vectors encoding the full CRISPR/Cas9 components including Cas9 gene and gRNA expression element into cells is the crucial step to effective genome editing. However, the cargo gene sequence for genome editing is usually large, which reduces the cargo encapsulation efficiency and affects the vector size. To obtain a nanovector with high cargo gene loading capacity and biocompatible size, we report the construction of a gene nanovector from branch&#8208;PCR with a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;branched primer and establish the correlation mapping between gene length and nanovector size. The results show that the size of nanovectors can be tuned according to the gene length. According to the findings, we constructed nanovectors carrying the full CRISPR/Cas9 components in 100&#8211;200&#8197;nm and validated their application in genome editing. The results show that this kind of nanovector exhibits higher serum stability than plasmids and can reach comparable genome editing efficiency with plasmids. Hence, this type of gene nanovector obtained through branch&#8208;PCR can carry large gene cargos and maintain a biocompatible nanoscale size, which we envisage will expand its medical applications in gene therapy.

         <title>The &#945;/&#946; Hydrolase AzpM Catalyzes Dipeptide Synthesis in Alazopeptin Biosynthesis Using Two Molecules of Carrier Protein&#8208;Tethered Amino Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alazopeptin biosynthesis includes a characteristic peptide&#8208;formation machinery that uses a hydrolase (AzpM) to synthesize a dipeptide composed of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine (DON). Detailed analyses using a DON analogue, azaserine, show that AzpM catalyzes the condensation of two DON molecules tethered to a carrier protein and the subsequent hydrolysis. Enzymatic synthesis of alazopeptin analogues composed of azaserine was also established.







Abstract
During the biosynthesis of alazopeptin, a tripeptide composed of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;L&#8208;norleucine (DON) and one of alanine, the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase AzpM synthesizes the DON&#8208;DON dipeptide using DON tethered to the carrier protein AzpF (DON&#8208;AzpF). However, whether AzpM catalyzes the condensation of DON&#8208;AzpF with DON or DON&#8208;AzpF remains unclear. Here, to distinguish between these two condensation possibilities, the reaction catalyzed by AzpM was examined in&#8197;vitro using a DON analogue, azaserine (AZS). We found that AzpM catalyzed the condensation between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON&#8208;AzpF, but not between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON. Possible reaction intermediates, DON&#8208;DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AZS&#8208;AzpF, were also detected during AzpM&#8208;catalyzed dipeptide formation from DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AzpF, respectively. From these results, we concluded that AzpM catalyzed the condensation of the two molecules of DON&#8208;AzpF and subsequent hydrolysis to produce DON&#8208;DON. Thus, AzpM is an unprecedented &#945;/&#946; hydrolase that catalyzes dipeptide synthesis from two molecules of a carrier protein&#8208;tethered amino acid.

         <title>Glyco&#8208;Steroidal Amphiphiles (GSAs) for Membrane Protein Structural Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthetically accessible glyco&#8208;diosgenin (GDN) variants were developed. Some of these agents confer enhanced membrane protein stability compared to DDM (n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;maltoside) and the original GDN.







Abstract
Integral membrane proteins pose considerable challenges to high resolution structural analysis. Maintaining membrane proteins in their native state during protein isolation is essential for structural study of these bio&#8208;macromolecules. Detergents are the most commonly used amphiphilic compounds for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution outside a lipid bilayer. We previously introduced a glyco&#8208;diosgenin (GDN) detergent that was shown to be highly effective at stabilizing a wide range of membrane proteins. This steroidal detergent has additionally gained attention due to its compatibility with membrane protein structure study via cryo&#8208;EM. However, synthetic inconvenience limits widespread use of GDN in membrane protein study. To improve its synthetic accessibility and to further enhance detergent efficacy for protein stabilization, we designed a new class of glyco&#8208;steroid&#8208;based detergents using three steroid units: cholestanol, cholesterol and diosgenin. These new detergents were efficiently prepared and showed marked efficacy for protein stabilization in evaluation with a few model membrane proteins including two G protein&#8208;coupled receptors. Some new agents were not only superior to a gold standard detergent, DDM (n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;maltoside), but were also more effective than the original GDN at preserving protein integrity long term. These agents represent valuable alternatives to GDN, and are likely to facilitate structural determination of challenging membrane proteins.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application of a Clickable Version of Epoxomicin for Proteasome Activity Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epoxomicin&#8208;alkyne probe described can be clicked to a variety of fluorophores. It can then be used in gel&#8208;based assays, microscopy, and flow cytometry to determine proteasome activity. It is sensitive enough to be able to detect both proteasome inhibition and stimulation by small molecules.







Abstract
Degradation of proteins by the proteasome is an essential cellular process and one that many wish to study in a variety of disease types. There are commercially available probes that can monitor proteasome activity in cells, but they typically contain common fluorophores that limit their simultaneous use with other activity&#8208;based probes. In order to exchange the fluorophore or incorporate an enrichment tag, the proteasome probe likely has to be synthesized which can be cumbersome. Here, we describe a simple synthetic procedure that only requires one purification step to generate epoxomicin, a selective proteasome inhibitor, with a terminal alkyne. Through a copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition, any moiety containing an azide can be incorporated into the probe. Many fluorophores are commercially available that contain an azide that can be &#8220;clicked&#8221;, allowing this proteasome activity probe to be included into already established assays to monitor both proteasome activity and other cellular activities of interest.

         <title>Immobilization of the Aspartate Ammonia&#8208;Lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 on Magnetic Nanoparticles: Characterization and Kinetics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aspartate ammonia&#8208;lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 (PfAAL) was isolated, expressed and characterized in this study. PfAAL was covalently immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles. Both the native and immobilized PfAAL were efficient biocatalysts in the ammonia elimination of aspartate. The effect of the viscosity of the reaction medium was investigated with the free and immobilized enzyme.







Abstract
Aspartate ammonia&#8208;lyases (AALs) catalyze the non&#8208;oxidative elimination of ammonia from l&#8208;aspartate to give fumarate and ammonia. In this work the AAL coding gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 was identified, isolated, and cloned into the pET&#8208;15b expression vector and expressed in E.&#8197;coli. The purified enzyme (PfAAL) showed optimal activity at pH&#8197;8.8, Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics in the ammonia elimination from l&#8208;aspartate, and no strong dependence on divalent metal ions for its activity. The purified PfAAL was covalently immobilized on epoxy&#8208;functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), and effective kinetics of the immobilized PfAAL&#8208;MNP was compared to the native solution form. Glycerol addition significantly enhanced the storability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP. Inhibiting effect of the growing viscosity (modulated by addition of glycerol or glucose) on the enzymatic activity was observed for the native and immobilized form of PfAAL, as previously described for other free enzymes. The storage stability and recyclability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP is promising for further biocatalytic applications.

         <title>NMR Data&#8208;Driven Docking of HDM2&#8208;Inhibitor Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HDM2 lead optimization was guided by the rapid generation of protein&#8208;ligand structures using an NMR&#8208;data driven docking protocol. This work underscores an &#8220;integrative&#8221; approach where strengths from modeling, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy can be leveraged to deliver more information on ligand&#8208;protein interactions than is available from any one technique.







Abstract
We present an automated NMR&#8208;guided docking workflow that can be used to generate models of protein&#8208;ligand complexes based on data from NOE NMR experiments. The first step is to generate a number of intermolecular distance constraints from experimental NOE data. Then, the ligand is docked on an ensemble of receptor structures to account for protein flexibility, and multiple poses are generated. Finally, we use the NOE&#8208;based constraints to filter and score docking poses based on the percentage of NOE constraints that are consistent with protein&#8208;ligand interatomic distances. This workflow was successfully used during a lead optimization project to generate models of synthetic protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors bound to the HDM2 protein.

         <title>Inhibiting erastin&#8208;induced ferroptotic cell death by purine&#8208;based chelators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis is a novel cell death event caused by increased lipid peroxidation leading to iron&#8208;dependent oxidative stress and associated with a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, ferroptosis inhibition has been emerging as a novel strategy to target the different pathologies. Here, we report the synthesis of two purine derivatives, 1 and 2, on iron chelation strategy and evaluate their potency to inhibit erastin induced ferroptosis. Both compounds showed efficient iron chelation in solution state as well as in the cellular environment. Crystal structure of purine derivative with iron demonstrated 2:1 (ligand to metal center) stoichiometry for iron and purine derivative complexation. The synthesized compounds also decrease the reactive oxygen species concentration in vitro cell culture. Compound 2 showed better potency towards the prevention of ferroptotic cell death as compared to commercially available iron chelator in erastin induced ferroptosis cell culture model. Such purine analogs are potential functional scaffolds for the development of a few target molecules for ferroptosis inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Biocatalyzed Reductions of Ginger Active Principles Recovered from Industrial Wastes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ginger is among the traditional medicinal plants most diffused and widely consumed around the world. Its beneficial effects, which comprise e.g. anticancer and antiinflammatory activities as well as gastrointestinal regulatory effects, are generally addressed to a family of non&#8208;volatile compounds characterized by an arylalkyl long&#8208;chained alcohol, diol or ketone moiety. In this work, ginger active principles have been successfully recovered from industrial waste biomasses of fermented ginger. Moreover, their recovery has been combined with the first systematic study of the stereoselective reduction of gingerol&#8208;like compounds by isolated alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), obtaining the enantioenriched sec &#8208;alcohol derivatives via a sustainable biocatalytic path in up to &gt;99% conversions and &gt;99% enantiomeric/diastereomeric excesses.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereo&#8208;divergent enzyme cascades to convert racemic 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol into either (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208; corresponding chiral amine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of enantiopure chiral amines from racemic alcohols is a key transformation in the chemical industry, e.g., in the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, this reaction remains challenging. In this work, we propose a one&#8208;pot enzymatic cascade for the direct conversion of a racemic alcohol into either (S) &#8208; or (R) &#8208;enantiomers of the corresponding amine, with in&#8208;situ cofactor recycling. This enzymatic cascade consists of two enantio&#8208;complementary alcohol dehydrogenases, both NADH and NADPH oxidase for in&#8208;situ recycling of NAD(P) + cofactors, and either (S) &#8208; or (R) &#8208;enantioselective transaminase. This cell&#8208;free biocatalytic system has been successfully applied to the conversion of racemic 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol into the high value (S) &#8208; or (R) &#8208;enantiomers of the amine reaching good (73% (S) ) and excellent (&gt;99% (R) ) enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical synthesis of the fluorescent, cyclic dinucleotides cthGAMP</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is known for its role in sensing cytosolic DNA introduced by a viral infection, bacterial invasion or tumorigenesis. Free DNA is recognized by cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP Synthase (cGAS) catalyzing the production of 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP) in mammalians. This cyclic dinucleotide acts as a second messenger, activating the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) that finally triggers the transcription of interferon genes and inflammatory cytokines. Due to the therapeutic potential of this pathway, both the production and the detection of cGAMP via fluorescent moieties for assay development is of great importance. Here, we introduce the paralleled synthetic access to the intrinsically fluorescent, cyclic dinucleotides 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c  th  GAMP and 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c  th  GAMP based on phosphoramidite and phosphate chemistry, adaptable for large scale synthesis. We examine their binding properties to murine and human STING and confirm biological activity including the interferon induction by 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c  th  GAMP in THP&#8208;1 monocytes. Two&#8208;photon imaging reveals a successful cellular uptake of 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c  th  GAMP in THP&#8208;1 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Formaldehyde Dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida to Favor Nicotinamide Cytosine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NAD&#8208;dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) was engineered and the mutant enzyme FalDH* was obtained with over 150&#8208;fold higher preference for the non&#8208;natural cofactor NCD.







Abstract
The enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) from Pseudomonas putida is of particular interest for biotechnological applications as it catalyzes the oxidation of formaldehyde independent of glutathione. However, the consumption of a stoichiometric amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) can be challenging at the metabolic level as this may affect many other NAD&#8208;linked processes. A potential solution is to engineer FalDH to utilize non&#8208;natural cofactors. Here we devised FalDH variants to favor nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) by structure&#8208;guided modification of the binding pocket for the adenine moiety of NAD. Several mutants were obtained and the best one FalDH 9B2 had over 150&#8208;fold higher preference for NCD than NAD. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the cofactor binding pocket shrunk to better fit NCD, a smaller&#8208;sized cofactor. FalDH 9B2 together with other NCD&#8208;linked enzymes offer opportunities to assemble orthogonal pathways for biological conversion of C1 molecules.

         <title>Opportunities for Expanding Encoded Chemical Diversification and Improving Hit Enrichment in mRNA&#8208;Displayed Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA&#8208;displayed libraries of peptides and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries of small molecules are compared and contrasted in this review with a focus on diversification reactions and selection approaches where the former can learn from developments in the latter. We conclude by outlining a path towards approaches that may offer discovery of hybrid small&#8208;molecule peptidomimetics.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded small&#8208;molecule libraries and mRNA displayed peptide libraries both use numerically large pools of oligonucleotide&#8208;tagged molecules to identify potential hits for protein targets. They differ dramatically, however, in the &#8216;drug&#8208;likeness&#8217; of the molecules that each can be used to discover. We give here an overview of the two techniques, comparing some advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest areas where particularly mRNA display can benefit from adopting advances developed with DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We outline cases where chemical modification of the peptide library has already been used in mRNA display, and survey opportunities to expand this using examples from DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We also propose potential opportunities for encoding such reactions within the mRNA/cDNA tag of an mRNA&#8208;displayed peptide library to allow a more diversity&#8208;oriented approach to library modification. Finally, we outline alternate approaches for enriching target&#8208;binding hits from a pooled and tagged library, and close by detailing several examples of how an adjusted mRNA&#8208;display based approach could be used to discover new &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; modified small peptides.

         <title>Rational Design of Self&#8208;Assembling Artificial Proteins Utilizing a Micelle&#8208;Assisted Protein Labeling Technology (MAPLabTech): Testing the Scope**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancement of micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling technology (MAPLabTech 3.0): In this work, we have demonstrated the synthesis of self&#8208;assembling artificial proteins by site&#8208;specific labeling of a single cysteine residue of globular proteins. This methodology should be broadly applicable to a wide range of natural and recombinant proteins containing an engineered cysteine residue.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling artificial proteins (SAPs) have gained enormous interest in recent years due to their applications in different fields. Synthesis of well&#8208;defined monodisperse SAPs is accomplished predominantly through genetic methods. However, the last decade has witnessed the use of a few chemical technologies for this purpose. In particular, micelle&#8208;assisted protein labeling technology (MAPLabTech) has made huge progress in this area. The first generation MAPLabTech focused on site&#8208;specific labeling of the active&#8208;site residue of serine proteases to make SAPs. Further, this methodology was exploited for labeling of N&#8208;terminal residue of a globular protein to make functional SAPs. In this study, we describe the synthesis of novel SAPs by developing a chemical method for site&#8208;specific labeling of a surface&#8208;exposed cysteine residue of globular proteins. In addition, we disclose the synthesis of redox&#8208;sensitive SAPs and their systematic self&#8208;assembly and disassembly studies using size&#8208;exclusion chromatography. Altogether these studies further expand the scope of MAPLabTech in different fields such as vaccine design, targeted drug delivery, diagnostic imaging, biomaterials, and tissue engineering.

In this study, we describe the synthesis of novel SAPs by developing a chemical method for site-specific labeling of a surface-exposed cysteine residue of globular proteins. In addition, we disclose the synthesis of redox-sensitive SAPs and their systematic self-assembly and disassembly studies using size-exclusion chromatography. Altogether these studies further expand the scope of MAPLabTech in different fields such as vaccine design, targeted drug delivery, diagnostic imaging, biomaterials, and tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Engineered Biosynthesis of Drugs in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of programming human cells to produce antibiotics in&#8197;situ by transfecting cells with a heterologous biosynthetic gene packaged in a viral vector, is demonstrated. The cytochrome P450 gene fma&#8208;P450 from the antimicrobial fumagillin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus fumigatus was introduced to HeLa cells to enable these human cells to biosynthesize a cytotoxic natural product from a nontoxic precursor.







Abstract
Biosynthetic genes are not only responsible for the formation of bioactive substances but also suited for other applications including gene therapy. To test the feasibility of human cells producing antibiotics in&#8197;situ when provided with a heterologous biosynthetic gene, we focused on cytochrome P450, the class of enzymes important in conferring bioactivity to natural product precursors. We selected Fma&#8208;P450 that plays a central role in the fumagillin antimicrobial biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus to examine fungal metabolite production by HeLa cells that express fma&#8208;P450 heterologously. Here we show that HeLa cells harboring fma&#8208;P450 can biosynthesize 5&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamoten and cytotoxic 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demethoxyfumagillol when supplemented with the nontoxic precursor &#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamotene. While the production level was insufficient to effect cell death, we demonstrate that programming human cells to autogenerate antibiotics by introducing a heterologous biosynthetic gene is feasible.

         <title>A Conformationally Stable Acyclic &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Scaffold Tolerating the Incorporation of Poorly &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Prone Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>

Open but tight: Combining the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn motif with cross&#8208;strand Trp/Lys(Arg) interactions leads to a conformationally and thermally highly stable &#946;&#8208;hairpin that is not sensitive to the type of residues occupying the upper face. This &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is suited to accommodate a variety of amino acids, including poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone ones, and it does not require backbone cyclization







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hairpin is a structural element of native proteins, but it is also a useful artificial scaffold for finding lead compounds to convert into peptidomimetics or non&#8208;peptide structures for drug discovery. Since linear peptides are synthetically more easily accessible than cyclic ones, but are structurally less well&#8208;defined, we propose XWXWXpPXK(/R)X(R) as an acyclic but still rigid &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold that is robust enough to accommodate different types of side chains, regardless of the secondary&#8208;structure propensity of the X residues. The high conformational stability of the scaffold results from tight contacts between cross&#8208;strand cationic and aromatic side chains, combined with the strong tendency of the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro dipeptide to induce a type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn. To demonstrate the robustness of the scaffold, we elucidated the NMR structures and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of peptides displaying mainly non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;branched, poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone residues at the X positions. Both the NMR and MD data confirm that our acyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is highly versatile as regards the amino&#8208;acid composition of the &#946;&#8208;sheet face opposite to the cationic&#8722;aromatic one.

         <title>Asymmetrically Substituted m&#8208;Terphenyl Phosphates Inhibit the Transcription Factor STAT5a</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry is overrated: Stafia&#8208;1, the first selective inhibitor of the transcription factor STAT5a, is a symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate that binds to an unsymmetrical protein binding pocket. We present synthetic methodology for generating asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate&#8208;based STAT5a inhibitors, which give insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships.







Abstract
We recently presented Stafia&#8208;1 as the first chemical entity that inhibits the transcription factor STAT5a with selectivity over the highly homologous STAT5b. Stafia&#8208;1, which was identified from a series of symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, binds to the interface between the SH2 domain and the linker domain of STAT5a. Here, we outline a synthetic strategy for the synthesis of asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, which can be tailored to address their asymmetric STAT5a binding site in a more specific manner. The asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate with the highest activity against STAT5a was converted to a phosphatase&#8208;stable monofluoromethylene phosphonate. The synthetic methodology and activity analysis described here provide first insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships of m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates for use as selective STAT5a inhibitors.

         <title>Creation of an Engineered Amide Synthetase Biocatalyst by the Rational Separation of a Two&#8208;Step Nitrile Synthetase</title>

Rational engineering of the ATP&#8208;dependent biocatalyst QueC converts a nitrile synthetase to an amide synthetase.







Abstract
The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitrile synthetase (NS) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The Bacillus subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is an NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom-inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitrile synthetase (NS) enzymes are a small family of ATP-dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; QueC (BsQueC) is an NS involved in the synthesis of 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent-free, amide-forming biocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substrate Profiling of Anion Methyltransferases for Promiscuous Synthesis of S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine Analogs from Haloalkanes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;natural analogs of the ubiquitous co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) are difficult to access, but useful for the enzymatic functionalization of various molecules with high selectivity. We investigated the promiscuous synthesis of SAM analogs in the anion methyltransferase enzyme family. Several promiscuous enzymes have been identified that synthesize non&#8208;natural co&#8208;substrates from cheap and readily available haloalkanes. This opens new avenues for selective alkylation chemistry.







Abstract
Biocatalytic alkylation reactions can be performed with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) and SAM analogs. Currently, however, this methodology is limited in application due to the rather laborious protocols to access SAM analogs. It has recently been shown that halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable synthesis and recycling of SAM analogs with readily available haloalkanes as starting material. Here we expand this work by using substrate profiling of the anion MT enzyme family to explore promiscuous SAM analog synthesis. Our study shows that anion MTs are in general very promiscuous with respect to the alkyl chain as well as the halide leaving group. Substrate profiling further suggests that promiscuous anion MTs cluster in sequence space. Next to iodoalkanes, cheaper, less toxic, and more available bromoalkanes have been converted and several haloalkanes bearing short alkyl groups, alkyl rings, and functional groups such as alkene, alkyne and aromatic moieties are accepted as substrates. Further, we applied the SAM analogs as electrophiles in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective pyrazole allylation with 3&#8208;bromopropene as starting material.

         <title>Fatty Acyl Sulfonyl Fluoride as an Activity&#8208;Based Probe for Profiling Fatty Acid&#8208;Associated Proteins in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride chemical probe was developed for covalent targeting, activity profiling, proteomic identification, and inhibitor evaluation of diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.







Abstract
Fatty acids play fundamental structural, metabolic, functional, and signaling roles in all biological systems. Altered fatty acid levels and metabolism have been associated with many pathological conditions. Chemical probes have greatly facilitated biological studies on fatty acids. Herein, we report the development and characterization of an alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride probe for covalent labelling, enrichment, and identification of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells. Our quantitative chemical proteomics show that this sulfonyl fluoride probe targets diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins including many metabolic serine hydrolases that are known to be involved in fatty acid metabolism and modification. We further validate that the probe covalently modifies the catalytically or functionally essential serine or tyrosine residues of its target proteins and enables evaluation of their inhibitors. The sulfonyl fluoride&#8208;based chemical probe thus represents a new tool for profiling the expression and activity of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.

         <title>Semi&#8208;rational Engineering of a Promiscuous Fatty Acid Hydratase for Alteration of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;rational mutant library of a promiscuous fatty acid hydrtatase (FA&#8208;HY1) revealed several mutants, which exhibited an impressive shift of regioselectivity towards eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) substrate. While the wild&#8208;type enzyme produces a mixture of two hydroxy fatty acid regioisomers at a ratio of 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH), six mutants were able to form exclusively a single hydroxy fatty acid regioisomer (15&#8208;OH).







Abstract
Fatty acid hydratases (FAHs) catalyze regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydration of unsaturated fatty acids to produce hydroxy fatty acids. Fatty acid hydratase&#8208;1 (FA&#8208;HY1) from Lactobacillus Acidophilus is the most promiscuous and regiodiverse FAH identified so far. Here, we engineered binding site residues of FA&#8208;HY1 (S393, S395, S218 and P380) by semi&#8208;rational protein engineering to alter regioselectivity. Although it was not possible to obtain a completely new type of regioselectivity with our mutant libraries, a significant shift of regioselectivity was observed towards cis&#8208;5, cis&#8208;8, cis&#8208;11, cis&#8208;14, cis&#8208;17&#8208;eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We identified mutants (S393/S395 mutants) with excellent regioselectivity, generating a single hydroxy fatty acid product from EPA (15&#8208;OH product), which is advantageous from application perspective. This result is impressive given that wild&#8208;type FA&#8208;HY1 produces a mixture of 12&#8208;OH and 15&#8208;OH products at 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 ratio (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH). Moreover, our results indicate that native FA&#8208;HY1 is at its limit in terms of promiscuity and regiospecificity, thus it may not be possible to diversify its product portfolio with active site engineering. This behavior of FA&#8208;HY1 is unlike its orthologue, fatty acid hydratase&#8208;2 (FA&#8208;HY2; 58&#8201;% sequence identity to FA&#8208;HY1), which has been shown earlier to exhibit significant promiscuity and regioselectivity changes by a few active site mutations. Our reverse engineering from FA&#8208;HY1 to FA&#8208;HY2 further demonstrates this conclusion.

Abstract
The synthesis, structural analysis, and evaluation of the photophysical properties of twelve novel 2&#8208;aryl(heteroaryl)&#8208;6&#8208;(4&#8208;alkyl(aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (6&#8208;8), where aryl(heteroaryl)=Ph, 4&#8208;Me&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;F&#8208;C6H4 and 2&#8208; furyl; 4&#8208;alkyl(aryl)=&#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;(CH2)5CH3 and Ph, are reported. Hybrid scaffolds 6&#8211;8 were synthesized at 77&#8211;95&#8201;% yields by regioselective copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of unpublished 6&#8208;azido&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (2) with selected terminal alkynes (3&#8211;5). Azido intermediates 2 were obtained from the reaction of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (1) and sodium azide at good yields (78&#8211;87&#8201;%). Compounds 6&#8211;8 were structurally fully characterized by 1H&#8722;, 13C&#8722; and 19F&#8722; and 1H&#8722;13C 2D&#8208;NMR (HSQC, HMBC) spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) and HRMS analysis. Moreover, the photophysical properties, DNA&#8208; and HSA&#8208;binding experiments (bio&#8208;interactions), and molecular docking studies for compounds 6&#8211;8 were performed.

         <title>Enzymatic Beacons for Specific Sensing of Dilute Nucleic Acid**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, have been prepared by hedgehog catalyzed bioconjugation and shown to function as turn&#8208;on biosensors with single&#8208;base pair mismatch specificity using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a sample target.







Abstract
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, are 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 bioconjugates of the nanoluciferase enzyme linked covalently at its C&#8208;terminus to hairpin forming ssDNA equipped with a dark quencher. We prepared E&#8208;beacons biocatalytically using HhC, the promiscuous Hedgehog C&#8208;terminal protein&#8208;cholesterol ligase. HhC attached nanoluciferase site&#8208;specifically to mono&#8208;sterylated hairpin oligonucleotides, called steramers. Three E&#8208;beacon dark quenchers were evaluated: Iowa Black, Onyx&#8208;A, and dabcyl. Each quencher enabled sensitive, sequence&#8208;specific nucleic acid detection through enhanced E&#8208;beacon bioluminescence upon target hybridization. We assembled prototype dabcyl&#8208;quenched E&#8208;beacons specific for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Targeting the E484 codon of the virus Spike protein, E&#8208;beacons (80&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;M) reported wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleic acid at &#8805;1&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;M by increased bioluminescence of 8&#8208;fold. E&#8208;beacon prepared for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 E484K variant functioned with similar sensitivity. Both E&#8208;beacons could discriminate their target from the E484Q mutation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Kappa variant. Along with mismatch specificity, E&#8208;beacons are two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than synthetic molecular beacons.

         <title>Enhanced Immunostimulatory Activity of Covalent DNA Dendrons</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) have been developed. The DNA dendrons were more resistant to nuclease degradation than linear ODNs, and they enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from RAW264.7 cells as the number of immunostimulatory branches increased, suggesting that they could induce immune response through the activation of TLR9.







Abstract
The present study focused on the design and synthesis of covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) that can stimulate the immune system through the activation of TLR9. These dendrons were synthesized using branching trebler phosphoramidite containing three identical protecting groups that enabled the simultaneous synthesis of multiple strands on a single molecule. Compared with linear ODNs, covalent DNA dendrons were found to be more resistant to nuclease degradation and were more efficiently taken up by macrophage&#8208;like RAW264.7 cells. Cellular uptake was suggested to be mediated by macrophage scavenger receptors. The covalent DNA dendrons composed of multivalent immunostimulatory branches enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945; and IL&#8208;6 from RAW264.7 cells, and 9&#8208;branched DNA dendrons showed the highest enhancement. Given their enhanced efficacy, we expect covalent DNA dendrons to be useful structures of oligonucleotide medicines.

         <title>Monitoring the Response of Multiple Signal Network Components to Acute Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Perturbations in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical perturbation method is presented that allows parallel readout of multiple fluorescence&#8208;based response kinetics in individual, living cells. The method is used to uncover control mechanisms in cell contraction and their misregulation in disease.







Abstract
Cells process information via signal networks that typically involve multiple components which are interconnected by feedback loops. The combination of acute optogenetic perturbations and microscopy&#8208;based fluorescent response readouts enables the direct investigation of causal links in such networks. However, due to overlaps in spectra of photosensitive and fluorescent proteins, current approaches that combine these methods are limited. Here, we present an improved chemo&#8208;optogenetic approach that is based on switch&#8208;like perturbations induced by a single, local pulse of UV light. We show that this approach can be combined with parallel monitoring of multiple fluorescent readouts to directly uncover relations between signal network components. We present the application of this technique to directly investigate feedback&#8208;controlled regulation in the cell contraction signal network that includes GEF&#8208;H1, Rho and Myosin, and functional interactions of this network with tumor relevant RhoA G17 mutants.

         <title>Selective Immobilization of His&#8208;Tagged Phosphomannose Isomerase on Ni Chelated Nanoparticles with Good Reusability and Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>

Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) with His&#8208;tag was successfully immobilized on Ni2+ charged pyridine&#8208;derived particles. The immobilized enzymes effectively maintained their activity. Excellent reusability and stability was observed after immobilization.







Abstract
Self&#8208;stable precipitation polymerization was used to prepare an enzyme&#8208;immobilized microsphere composite. Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) with His&#8208;tag was successfully immobilized on Ni2+ charged pyridine&#8208;derived particles. The maximum amount of PMI immobilized on such particles was &#8764;184&#8197;mg/g. Compared with free enzyme, the activity of the immobilized enzymes was significantly improved. In addition, the immobilized enzymes showed a much better thermostability than free enzymes. At the same time, the immobilized enzymes can be reused for multiple reaction cycles. We observed that the enzyme activity did not decrease significantly after six cycles. We conclude that the pyridine&#8208;derived particles can be used to selectively immobilize His&#8208;tagged enzymes, which can couple the enzyme purification and catalysis steps and improve the efficiency of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed industrial processes.

         <title>Titration of Apparent In&#8208;Cellula Affinities of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using fluorescent probes, we estimate at the cellular level the fraction of Bait molecules bound by Prey molecules in a quantitative yeast&#8208;two hybrid assay. A titration&#8208;like analysis of flow cytometer data permits the extraction of the apparent in&#8208;cellula dissociation constant.







Abstract
A genetic assay permits simultaneous quantification of two interacting proteins and their bound fraction at the single&#8208;cell level using flow cytometry. Apparent in&#8208;cellula affinities of protein&#8208;protein interactions can be extracted from the acquired data through a titration&#8208;like analysis. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated on a diverse set of interactions with proteins from different families and organisms and with in&#8208;vitro dissociation constants ranging from picomolar to micromolar.

         <title>Rational Design of a Cu Chelator That Mitigates Cu&#8208;Induced ROS Production by Amyloid Beta</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed mixed Cu chelator mitigates Cu&#8722;A&#946; induced reactive oxygen species formation by redox silencing and radical scavenging. The presence of oxidized amino acids in A&#946; correlates to their role in the entatic state.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease severely perturbs transition metal homeostasis in the brain leading to the accumulation of excess metals in extracellular and intraneuronal locations. The amyloid beta protein binds these transition metals, ultimately causing severe oxidative stress in the brain. Metal chelation therapy is an approach to sequester metals from amyloid beta and relieve the oxidative stress. Here we have designed a mixed N/O donor Cu chelator inspired by the proposed ligand set of Cu in amyloid beta. We demonstrate that the chelator effectively removes Cu from amyloid beta and suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by redox silencing and radical scavenging both in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. The impact of ROS on the extent of oxidation of the different aggregated forms of the peptide is studied by mass spectrometry, which, along with other ROS assays, shows that the oligomers are pro&#8208;oxidants in nature. The aliphatic Leu34, which was previously unobserved, has been identified as a new oxidation site.

         <title>Toward an Orthogonal Protein Lysine Acylation and Deacylation System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells, was rationally designed through genetically encoding artificially designed acylated lysine analogues and reshaping the substrate specificity of a bacterial protein deacetylase.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is one of the most basic molecular mechanisms to mediate protein functions in living organisms, and its abnormal regulation has been linked to many diseases. The drug development associated to this process is of great significance but severely hindered by the complex interplay of lysine acetylation and deacetylation in thousands of proteins, and we reasoned that targeting a specific protein acetylation or deacetylation event instead of the related enzymes should be a feasible solution to this issue. Toward this goal, we devised an orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells. The system includes a genetically encoded acylated lysine (PhOAcK) that is not a substrate of endogenous deacetylases, and an evolved sirtuin (CobB2/CobB3) that displays PhOAcK deacylase activities as well as reduced deacetylase activities. We believe the strategy introduced here holds potential for future in&#8208;depth biological applications.

         <dc:description>
Dynamic balance between the resting and active states of the immune response is essential for the host defense against invasion. Photocontrol of the innate immunity receptor TLR8 achieved precise regulation and dynamics programming. By genetic encoding of unnatural, photocaged tyrosine into TLR8, the receptor can be regulated by UV light with high spatiotemporal resolution, making it a suitable tool for TLR8 biological studies.

         <title>Novel Antibacterial Targets in Protein Biogenesis Pathways</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial protein biogenesis pathways are attractive antibacterial targets since many of them, or their substrates, are essential for bacterial survival. We review the various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis that show promise as potential antibacterial targets. This information will facilitate rational antibiotic design to help combat antibacterial resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat due to the ability of bacteria to quickly evolve in response to the selection pressure induced by anti&#8208;infective drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against resistant bacteria. In this review, we discuss pathways involving bacterial protein biogenesis as attractive antibacterial targets since many of them are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. We discuss the structural understanding of various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis, which in turn can be utilized for rational antibiotic design. We highlight efforts made towards developing inhibitors of these pathways with insights into future possibilities and challenges. We also briefly discuss other potential targets related to protein biogenesis.

         <title>Chemical Biology Toolbox to Visualize Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>

Chemical biology methods to visualize protein aggregation in live cells are presented in this review. The methods discussed include fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small molecule probes.







Abstract
Protein misfolding and aggregation is a complex biochemical process and has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. Developing novel chemical and biological tools and approaches to visualize aggregated proteins in live cells is in high demand for mechanistic studies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the recent developments in the chemical biology toolbox applied to protein aggregation studies in live cells. These methods exploited fluorescent protein tags, fluorescent chemical tags, and small&#8208;molecule probes to visualize the protein&#8208;aggregation process, detect proteome stresses, and quantify the protein homeostasis network capacity. Inspired by these seminal works, we have generalized design principles for the development of new detection methods and probes in the future that will illuminate this important biological process.

         <title>Progress on the Physiological Function of Mitochondrial DNA and Its Specific Detection and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and status quo of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) imaging and detection are highlighted in this minireview, and insights for designing excellent mtDNA probes are provided. New treatments for mtDNA&#8208;related diseases are also discussed.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the genetic information of mitochondrion, and its structure is circular double&#8208;stranded. Despite the diminutive size of the mitochondrial genome, mtDNA mutations are an important cause of mitochondrial diseases which are characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial diseases are involved in multiple systems, particularly in the organs that are highly dependent on aerobic metabolism. The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is more complicated since mtDNA mutations can cause various clinical symptoms. To realize more accurate diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial diseases, the detection of mtDNA and the design of drugs acting on it are extremely important. Over the past few years, many probes and therapeutic drugs targeting mtDNA have been developed, making significant contributions to fundamental research including elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases at the genetic level. In this review, we summarize the structure, function, and detection approaches for mtDNA. The most current topics in this field, such as mechanistic exploration and treatment of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related disorders, are also reviewed. Specific attention is given to discussing the design and development of these probes and drugs for mtDNA. We hope that this review will provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the importance of mtDNA, and promote the development of effective molecules for theragnosis of mtDNA mutation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Photoactivation of Innate Immunity Receptor TLR8 in Live Mammalian Cells by Genetic Encoding of Photocaged Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;controllable TLR8 system was developed by site&#8208;specific genetic encoding of photocaged tyrosine to ensure spatiotemporal control of receptor function. The activity of TLR8 is masked in caged forms but can be restored upon decaging by exposure to UV light, making it a suitable tool for TLR8 function and regulatory mechanism studies.







Abstract
The effectiveness of innate immune responses relies on an intricate balance between activation and regulation. TLR8, a member of the Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) family, plays a fundamental role in host defense by sensing viral single&#8208;stranded RNAs (ssRNAs). However, the molecular recognition and regulatory mechanism of TLR8 is not fully understood, especially in a whole&#8208;cell environment. Here, we engineer the first light&#8208;controllable TLR8 model by genetically encoding a photocaged tyrosine, NBY, into specific sites of TLR8. In the caged forms, the activity of TLR8 is masked but can be restored upon decaging by exposure to UV light. To explain the mechanism clearly, we divide the sites with light responsiveness into three groups. They can separately block the ligands that bind to the pockets of TLR8, change the interaction modes between two TLR8 protomers, and interfere with the interactions between TLR8 cytosolic domains with its downstream adaptor. Specifically, we use this chemical caging strategy to probe and evaluate the function of several tyrosine sites located at the interface of TLR8 homodimers with a previously unknown regulatory mode, which may provide a new strategy for TLR8 modulator development. Effects on downstream signaling pathways are monitored at the transcriptional and translational levels in various cell lines. By photoactivating specific cells within a larger population, this powerful tool can provide novel mechanistic insights, with potential in biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>Reactivity Analysis of New Multivalent Electrophilic Probes for Affinity Labeling of Carbohydrate Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 4, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of gold nanoparticle&#8208;based affinity labeling probes multivalently presenting different electrophilic groups and a carbohydrate ligand was synthesized to evaluate their reactivity against lectins. The p&#8208; and m&#8208;isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together are promising alternatives to photoreactive groups as protein&#8208;reactive affinity labels for target identification studies.







Abstract
We have designed and synthesized six different multivalent electrophiles as carbohydrate affinity labeling probes. Evaluation of the reactivity of the electrophiles against peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) showed that p&#8208; and m&#8208;aryl sulfonyl fluoride are effective protein reactive groups that label carbohydrate binding lectins in a ligand&#8208;dependent fashion at a nanomolar probe concentration. Analysis of the selectivity of affinity labeling in the presence of excess BSA as a nonspecific protein indicated that m&#8208;arylsulfonyl fluoride is a more selective protein&#8208;reactive group, albeit with attenuated reactivity. Further analysis showed that the labeling efficiency of the multivalent electrophilic probes can be improved by employing reaction conditions involving 25&#8201;&#176;C instead of typically employed 4&#8201;&#176;C. Both isomers of arylsulfonyl fluoride groups together represent promising affinity labels for target identification studies that could serve as more efficient alternatives to photoreactive groups.

         <title>Spectroscopic and in&#8197;vitro Investigations of Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Nucleic Acid Repair and Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinorganic perspective on the AlkB as well as the TET enzyme families, Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases involved in nucleic acid repair and processing, and epigenetic gene regulation is presented in this review. Important spectroscopic techniques which can be useful for in&#8197;vitro examination of the structure and formation of those proteins and their active site, of the interaction with their substrates, as well as of mechanistic details are discussed together with their advantages and limitations.







Abstract
The activation of molecular oxygen for the highly selective functionalization and repair of DNA and RNA nucleobases is achieved by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/iron&#8208;dependent dioxygenases. Of special interest are the human homologues AlkBH of Escherichia coli EcAlkB and ten&#8208;eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in demethylation or dealkylation of DNA and RNA, although additional physiological functions are continuously being found. Given their importance, studying enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions, turnover and kinetic parameters is pivotal for the understanding of the mode of action of these enzymes. Diverse analytical methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been employed to study the changes in the active site and the overall enzyme structure upon substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor addition. Several methods are now available to assess the activity of these enzymes. By discussing limitations and possibilities of these techniques for EcAlkB, AlkBH and TET we aim to give a comprehensive synopsis from a bioinorganic point&#8208;of&#8208;view, addressing researchers from different disciplines working in the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field of epigenetic processes and DNA/RNA repair and modification.

These enzymes are involved in demethylation or dealkylation of DNA and RNA, although additional physiological functions are continuously being found. Given their importance, studying enzyme-substrate interactions, turnover and kinetic parameters is pivotal for the understanding of the mode of action of these enzymes. Diverse analytical methods, including X-ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been employed to study the changes in the active site and the overall enzyme structure upon substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor addition. Several methods are now available to assess the activity of these enzymes. By discussing limitations and possibilities of these techniques for EcAlkB, AlkBH and TET we aim to give a comprehensive synopsis from a bioinorganic point-of-view, addressing researchers from different disciplines working in the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field of epigenetic processes and DNA/RNA repair and modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mapping the Conformational Landscape of the Neutral Network of RNA Sequences That Connect Two Functional Distinctly Different Ribozymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diversity of secondary structures of different ribozymes connected through several mutational steps were investigated. We mapped the mutational landscape in order to understand changes in secondary structure and their link to particular functions. This work further highlights the necessity for the utilization of different complementary techniques for the analysis of RNA secondary structures.







Abstract
During evolution of an RNA world, the development of enzymatic function was essential. Such enzymatic function was linked to RNA sequences capable of adopting specific RNA folds that possess catalytic pockets to promote catalysis. Within this primordial RNA world, initially evolved self&#8208;replicating ribozymes presumably mutated to ribozymes with new functions. Schultes and Bartel (Science 2000, 289, 448&#8211;452) investigated such conversion from one ribozyme to a new ribozyme with distinctly different catalytic functions. Within a neutral network that linked these two prototype ribozymes, a single RNA chain could be identified that exhibited both enzymatic functions. As commented by Schultes and Bartel, this system possessing one sequence with two enzymatic functions serves as a paradigm for an evolutionary system that allows neutral drifts by stepwise mutation from one ribozyme into a different ribozyme without loss of intermittent function. Here, we investigated this complex functional diversification of ancestral ribozymes by analyzing several RNA sequences within this neutral network between two ribozymes with class III ligase activity and with self&#8208;cleavage reactivity. We utilized rapid RNA sample preparation for NMR spectroscopic studies together with SHAPE analysis and in&#8208;line probing to characterize secondary structure changes within the neutral network. Our investigations allowed delineation of the secondary structure space and by comparison with the previously determined catalytic function allowed correlation of the structure&#8208;function relation of ribozyme function in this neutral network.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs): Promising Biocatalysts for the Environmentally Friendly Production of Aroma Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are promising biocatalysts that catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids to produce (one carbon&#8208;shortened) fatty aldehydes, which are used as flavors and fragrances. This comprehensive review summarizes the recent advances in the biotechnological utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with focus on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs together with analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity.







Abstract
Fatty aldehydes (FALs) can be derived from fatty acids (FAs) and related compounds and are frequently used as flavors and fragrances. Although chemical methods have been conventionally used, their selective biotechnological production aiming at more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly synthetic routes is in demand. &#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are heme&#8208;dependent oxidative enzymes biologically involved in the initial step of plant FA &#945;&#8208;oxidation during which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the C&#945;&#8208;position of a FA (Cn) to generate the intermediate FA hydroperoxide, which is subsequently converted into the shortened corresponding FAL (Cn&#8208;1). &#945;&#8208;DOXs are promising biocatalysts for the flavor and fragrance industries, they do not require NAD(P)H as cofactors or redox partner proteins, and they have a broad substrate scope. Here, we highlight recent advances in the biocatalytic utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with emphasis on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs as well as analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Structure optimization of the toxic conformation model of amyloid &#946;42 by intramolecular disulfide bond formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers play a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Recently, we reported that a conformation&#8208;restricted A&#946;42 with an intramolecular disulfide bond through cysteine residues at positions 17/28 formed stable oligomers with potent cytotoxicity. To further optimize this compound as a toxic conformer model, we synthesized three analogs with a combination of cysteine&#160; and homocysteine at positions 17/28.&#160; The analogs with Cys&#8208;Cys, Cys&#8208;homoCys, or homoCys&#8208;Cys, but not the homoCys&#8208;homoCys analog, exhibited potent cytotoxicity against SH&#8208;SY5Y and THP&#8208;1 cells even &#160;at 10 nM. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of conformation&#8208;restricted analogs at positions 16/29 or 18/27 was significantly weaker than that of wild&#8208;type A&#946;42. Furthermore, a thioflavin&#8208;T assay, non&#8208;denaturing gel electrophoresis, and morphological study suggested that the majority of these conformation&#8208;restricted analogs existed in an oligomeric state in cell culture medium, indicating that the toxic conformation of A&#946;42, rather than the oligomeric state, is essential to induce cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking between BrU and Pyrene Residues in an RNA/DNA Hybrid</title>

         <dc:description>
The photoreaction of BrU in a pyrene&#8208;labeled DNA duplex, RNA duplex, and DNA/RNA hybrids was investigated. We found that the photoreactivity of BrU changed dramatically from hydrogen abstraction to cross&#8208;linking by changing the conformation of the duplex from the B&#8208;form to the A&#8208;form.







Abstract
In this study, we investigated the photoreaction of BrU in a pyrene&#8208;labeled DNA duplex, RNA duplex, and DNA/RNA hybrids. We found that the photoreactivity of BrU changed dramatically from hydrogen abstraction to cross&#8208;linking by changing the conformation of the duplex from the B&#8208;form to the A&#8208;form. Among three A&#8208;form structures, the largest amount of cross&#8208;linked products was observed when BrU was incorporated into the RNA strand and the pyrene was conjugated to the 5&#8242; end of the DNA. These results indicate that the contact manner of pyrene was different between A&#8208; and B&#8208;form duplexes. This is a rare example of the use of the reactivity of bromouracil to analyze the contact between a small molecule with a weak binding affinity and a nucleic acid.

         <title>Synthetic Neoglycoconjugates of Hepta&#8208; and Nonamannoside Ligands for Eliciting Oligomannose&#8208;Specific HIV&#8208;1&#8208;Neutralizing Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannoside 3&#8208;aminopropyl derivatives were prepared in good overall yields using a block&#8208;wise assembly followed by conversion into neoglycoconjugates. CRM197 conjugates of the &#946;&#8208;variants showed comparable binding to Fabs of HIV&#8208;1 neutralizing PGT antibodies, but stronger binding of the heptamannosides by the corresponding IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Oligomannose&#8208;type glycans on the spike protein of HIV&#8208;1 constitute relevant epitopes to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Herein we describe an improved synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;linked hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl ligands that were subsequently converted into BSA and CRM197 neoglycoconjugates. We assembled the ligands from anomeric 3&#8208;azidopropyl spacer glycosides from select 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected thiocresyl mannoside donors. Chain extensions were achieved using [4+3] or [4+5] block synthesis of thiocresyl and trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors. Subsequent global deprotection generated the 3&#8208;aminopropyl oligosaccharide ligands. ELISA binding data obtained with the &#946;&#8208;anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl conjugates with a selection of HIV&#8208;1 bnAbs showed comparable binding of both mannosyl ligands by Fab fragments yet lesser binding of the nonasaccharide conjugate by the corresponding IgG antibodies. These results support previous observations that a complete Man9 structure might not be the preferred antigenic binding motif for some oligomannose&#8208;specific antibodies, and have implications for glycoside designs to elicit oligomannose&#8208;targeted HIV&#8208;1&#8208;neutralizing antibodies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anomeric hepta- and nonamannoside&lt;/b&gt; 3-aminopropyl derivatives were prepared in good overall yields using a block-wise assembly followed by conversion into neoglycoconjugates. CRM&lt;sub&gt;197&lt;/sub&gt; conjugates of the &#946;-variants showed comparable binding to Fabs of HIV-1 neutralizing PGT antibodies, but stronger binding of the heptamannosides by the corresponding IgG antibodies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligomannose-type glycans on the spike protein of HIV-1 constitute relevant epitopes to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Herein we describe an improved synthesis of &#945;- and &#946;-linked hepta- and nonamannosyl ligands that were subsequently converted into BSA and CRM&lt;sub&gt;197&lt;/sub&gt; neoglycoconjugates. We assembled the ligands from anomeric 3-azidopropyl spacer glycosides from select 3-O-protected thiocresyl mannoside donors. Chain extensions were achieved using [4+3] or [4+5] block synthesis of thiocresyl and trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors. Subsequent global deprotection generated the 3-aminopropyl oligosaccharide ligands. ELISA binding data obtained with the &#946;-anomeric hepta- and nonamannosyl conjugates with a selection of HIV-1 bnAbs showed comparable binding of both mannosyl ligands by Fab fragments yet lesser binding of the nonasaccharide conjugate by the corresponding IgG antibodies. These results support previous observations that a complete Man&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; structure might not be the preferred antigenic binding motif for some oligomannose-specific antibodies, and have implications for glycoside designs to elicit oligomannose-targeted HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The pH&#8208;Dependence of the Hydration of 5&#8208;Formylcytosine: an Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has been identified and quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. We report a free energy of hydration for the hydration reactions of 5&#8201;fC and 5&#8201;fU. In case of 5&#8201;fC, acidification leads to an increased hydrate content of up to 0.5&#8201;% in aqueous solution.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formylcytosine is an important nucleobase in epigenetic regulation, whose hydrate form has been implicated in the formation of 5&#8208;carboxycytosine as well as oligonucleotide binding events. The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has now been quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. Small amounts of hydrate can be identified for the protonated form of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and for neutral 5&#8208;formyluracil. For neutral 5&#8208;formylcytosine, however, direct detection of the hydrate was not possible due to its very low abundance. This is in full agreement with theoretical estimates.

         <title>Improving Biocatalytic Properties of an Azoreductase via the N&#8208;Terminal Fusion of Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fusion protein comprised of formate dehydrogenase and azoreductase was constructed to allow the simultaneous activity of dye reduction and NAD+ regeneration. The fusion protein showed improved substrate scope, but it only showed partial degradation for the bulkier azo dyes.







Abstract
Azoreductases require NAD(P)H to reduce azo dyes but the high cost of NAD(P)H limits its application. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) allows NAD(P)+ recycling and therefore, the fusion of these two biocatalysts seems promising. This study investigated the changes to the fusion protein involving azoreductase (AzoRo) of Rhodococcus opacus 1CP and FDH (FDHC23S and FDHC23SD195QY196H) of Candida boidinii in different positions with His&#8208;tag as the linker. The position affected enzyme activities as AzoRo activity decreased by 20&#8208;fold when it is in the N&#8208;terminus of the fusion protein. FDHC23S+AzoRo was the most active construct and was further characterized. Enzymatic activities of FDHC23S+AzoRo decreased compared to parental enzymes but showed improved substrate scope &#8211; accepting bulkier dyes. Moreover, pH has an influence on the stability and activity of the fusion protein because at pH&#8197;6 (pH that is suboptimal for FDH), the dye reduction decreased to more than 50&#8201;% and this could be attributed to the impaired NADH supply for the AzoRo part.

         <title>A Hexameric Ribozyme Nanostructure Formed by Double&#8208;Decker Assembly of a Pair of Triangular Ribozyme Trimers</title>

The modular architecture of naturally occurring ribozymes makes them a promising class of structural platform for the design and assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) RNA nanostructures. We dimerized ribozyme trimers with a triangular shape by introducing three pillar units. The double&#8208;decker hexamers exhibited higher catalytic activity than the parent ribozyme trimers.







Abstract
The modular architecture of naturally occurring ribozymes makes them a promising class of structural platform for the design and assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) RNA nanostructures, into which the catalytic ability of the platform ribozyme can be installed. We have constructed and analyzed RNA nanostructures with polygonal&#8208;shaped (closed) ribozyme oligomers by assembling unit RNAs derived from the Tetrahymena group I intron with a typical modular architecture. In this study, we dimerized ribozyme trimers with a triangular shape by introducing three pillar units. The resulting double&#8208;decker nanostructures containing six ribozyme units were characterized biochemically and their structures were observed by atomic force microscopy. The double&#8208;decker hexamers exhibited higher catalytic activity than the parent ribozyme trimers.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenases for the Regiospecific Hydroxylation of Polycyclic Phenols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to perform regiospecific hydroxylations of sterically challenging monophenols was engineered into a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase. Its variants are valuable tools for production of the corresponding catechols for in&#8197;vitro or live whole&#8208;cell conversions.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylacetate 3&#8208;hydroxylase (4HPA3H), a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase from E. coli that catalyzes the hydroxylation of monophenols to catechols, was modified by rational redesign to convert also more bulky substrates, especially phenolic natural products like phenylpropanoids, flavones or coumarins. Selected amino acid positions in the binding pocket of 4HPA3H were exchanged with residues from the homologous protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yielding variants with improved conversion of spacious substrates such as the flavonoid naringenin or the alkaloid mimetic 2&#8208;hydroxycarbazole. Reactions were followed by an adapted Fe(III)&#8208;catechol chromogenic assay selective for the products. Especially substitution of the residue Y301 facilitated modulation of substrate specificity: introduction of nonaromatic but hydrophobic (iso)leucine resulted in the preference of the substrate ferulic acid (having a guaiacyl (guajacyl) moiety, part of the vanilloid motif) over unsubstituted monophenols. The in&#8197;vivo (whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts) and in&#8197;vitro (three&#8208;enzyme cascade) transformations of substrates by 4HPA3H and its optimized variants was strictly regiospecific and proceeded without generation of byproducts.

         <title>Dual Activities of Oxidation and Oxidative Decarboxylation by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual functions by a single active site are found in flavoenzyme oxidases. This is the first review to discuss and compare the reaction mechanisms of flavoenzymes catalyzing both oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation of l&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid. Recurrent features and factor controlling oxidative decarboxylation are proposed.







Abstract
Specific flavoenzyme oxidases catalyze oxidative decarboxylation in addition to their classical oxidation reactions in the same active sites. The mechanisms underlying oxidative decarboxylation by these enzymes and how they control their two activities are not clearly known. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of four enzymes from the l&#8208;amino acid oxidase and l&#8208;hydroxy acid oxidase families, including l&#8208;tryptophan 2&#8208;monooxygenase, l&#8208;phenylalanine 2&#8208;oxidase and l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase and lactate monooxygenase which catalyze substrate oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation. Apart from specific interactions to allow substrate oxidation by the flavin cofactor, specific binding of oxidized product in the active sites appears to be important for enabling subsequent decarboxylation by these enzymes. Based on recent findings of l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase, we propose that nucleophilic attack of H2O2 on the imino acid product is the mechanism enabling oxidative decarboxylation.

     alt="Dual Activities of Oxidation and Oxidative Decarboxylation by Flavoenzymes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual functions&lt;/b&gt; by a single active site are found in flavoenzyme oxidases. This is the first review to discuss and compare the reaction mechanisms of flavoenzymes catalyzing both oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-amino acids and &#945;-hydroxy acid. Recurrent features and factor controlling oxidative decarboxylation are proposed.

         <title>Optimized Hemolysin Type 1 Secretion System in Escherichia coli by Directed Evolution of the Hly Enhancer Fragment and Including a Terminator Region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretion efficiency of the Hly secretion system was optimized through directed evolution of the Hly enhancer fragment using KnowVolution strategy. The structural analysis of wildtype and the developed enhancer fragment suggested that the improved secretion is due to a different affinity of the novel enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein. This was further supported by a RNA pulldown assay.







Abstract
Type 1 secretion systems (T1SS) have a relatively simple architecture compared to other classes of secretion systems and therefore, are attractive to be optimized by protein engineering. Here, we report a KnowVolution campaign for the hemolysin (Hly) enhancer fragment, an untranslated region upstream of the hlyA gene, of the hemolysin T1SS of Escherichia coli to enhance its secretion efficiency. The best performing variant of the Hly enhancer fragment contained five nucleotide mutations at five positions (A30U, A36U, A54G, A81U, and A116U) resulted in a 2&#8208;fold increase in the secretion level of a model lipase fused to the secretion carrier HlyA1. Computational analysis suggested that altered affinity to the generated enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein contributes to the enhanced secretion levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that involving a native terminator region along with the generated Hly enhancer fragment increased the secretion levels of the Hly system up to 5&#8208;fold.

         <title>Chemical Regulation of the Protein Quality Control E3 Ubiquitin Ligase C&#8208;Terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein (CHIP)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identification of a CHIP inhibitor: CHIP is a protein quality control E3 ubiquitin&#8208;ligase that has been implicated in numerous diseases. Here we identified an inhibitor of CHIP and revealed that allosteric regulation of CHIP may be one way to regulate its activity.







Abstract
The ubiquitin ligase C&#8208;terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) is an important regulator of proteostasis. Despite playing an important role in maintaining proteostasis, little progress has been made in developing small molecules that regulate ubiquitin transfer by CHIP. Here we used differential scanning fluorimetry to identify compounds that bound CHIP. Compounds that bound CHIP were then analyzed by quantitative ubiquitination assays to identify those that altered CHIP function. One compound, MS.001, inhibited both the chaperone binding and ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP at low micromolar concentrations. Interestingly, we found that MS.001 did not have activity against isolated U&#8208;box or tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains, but instead only inhibited full&#8208;length CHIP. Using in silico docking we identified a potential MS.001 binding site on the linker domain of CHIP and mutation of this site rendered CHIP resistant to MS.001. Together our data identify an inhibitor of the E3 ligase CHIP and provides insight into the development of compounds that regulate CHIP activity.

         <title>Strategies for Interference of Insulin Fibrillogenesis: Challenges and Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite of the fact that the world is celebrating the 100th year of the discovery of insulin, advancement in the domain of insulin stabilization remains unsaturated. An efficient, simpler, and an economically favorable solution is always welcome. This review will be useful for a broad range of researchers working in the development of aggregation&#8208;free insulin formulations or insulin analogues.







Abstract
The discovery of insulin came with very high hopes for diabetic patients. In 2021, the world celebrated the 100th anniversary of the discovery of this vital hormone. However, external use of insulin is highly affected by its aggregating tendency that occurs during its manufacturing, transportation, and improper handling which ultimately leads to its pharmaceutically and biologically ineffective form. In this review, we aim to discuss the various approaches used for decelerating insulin aggregation which results in the enhancement of its overall structural stability and usage. The approaches that are discussed are broadly classified as either a measure through excipient additions or by intrinsic modifications in the insulin native structure.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of Site&#8208;Specifically Mono&#8208;Ubiquitylated p53</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ubiquitin (Ub) system (E1, E2, E3) ubiquitylates the tumor suppressor p53 thereby affecting different p53 properties including interaction with DNA and other proteins. However, as p53 is ubiquitylated at several lysine residues, it remains unclear, if and how distinct p53 properties are affected by site&#8208;specific ubiquitylation. To address this pertinent question, oxime ligation was employed to generate site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated p53.







Abstract
The tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by various posttranslational modifications including different types of ubiquitylation, which exert distinct effects on p53. While modification by ubiquitin chains targets p53 for degradation, attachment of single ubiquitin moieties (mono&#8208;ubiquitylation) affects the intracellular location of p53 and/or its interaction with chromatin. However, how this is achieved at the molecular level remains largely unknown. Similarly, since p53 can be ubiquitylated at different lysine residues, it remains unclear if the eventual effect depends on the position of the lysine modified. Here, we combined genetic code expansion with oxime ligation to generate p53 site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated at position 120. We found that mono&#8208;ubiquitylation at this position neither interferes with p53 ubiquitylation by the E3 ligases HDM2 and E6AP in complex with the viral E6 oncoprotein nor affects p53 binding to a cognate DNA sequence. Thus, ubiquitylation per se does not affect physiologically relevant properties of p53.

         <title>Charge Matters: Mutations in Omicron Variant Favor Binding to Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the mutations present in the Omicron variant, the surface of the spike protein is highly positively charged. For binding of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to host cells, electrostatic interactions with heparan sulfate polyglycerols covering the cell surface play an essential role. Molecular dynamic simulation reveals that the interaction of the Omicron spike with polysulfates is much stronger than that of the wild type. We surmise that this enhanced interaction favors binding of Omicron and therefore subsequent cell entry and infection.







Abstract
Evidence is strengthening to suggest that the novel SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mutant Omicron, with its more than 60 mutations, will spread and dominate worldwide. Although the mutations in the spike protein are known, the molecular basis for why the additional mutations in the spike protein that have not previously occurred account for Omicron's higher infection potential, is not understood. We propose, based on chemical rational and molecular dynamics simulations, that the elevated occurrence of positively charged amino acids in certain domains of the spike protein (Delta: +4; Omicron: +5 vs. wild type) increases binding to cellular polyanionic receptors, such as heparan sulfate due to multivalent charge&#8208;charge interactions.

     alt="Charge Matters: Mutations in Omicron Variant Favor Binding to Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because of the mutations&lt;/b&gt; present in the Omicron variant, the surface of the spike protein is highly positively charged. For binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells, electrostatic interactions with heparan sulfate polyglycerols covering the cell surface play an essential role. Molecular dynamic simulation reveals that the interaction of the Omicron spike with polysulfates is much stronger than that of the wild type. We surmise that this enhanced interaction favors binding of Omicron and therefore subsequent cell entry and infection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence is strengthening to suggest that the novel SARS-CoV-2 mutant Omicron, with its more than 60 mutations, will spread and dominate worldwide. Although the mutations in the spike protein are known, the molecular basis for why the additional mutations in the spike protein that have not previously occurred account for Omicron's higher infection potential, is not understood. We propose, based on chemical rational and molecular dynamics simulations, that the elevated occurrence of positively charged amino acids in certain domains of the spike protein (Delta: +4; Omicron: +5 vs. wild type) increases binding to cellular polyanionic receptors, such as heparan sulfate due to multivalent charge-charge interactions. This observation is a starting point for targeted drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Michael Additions of Acetaldehyde to Aliphatic Nitroalkenes Catalyzed by Proline&#8208;Based Carboligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiocomplementary Michael additions: The application of two tailor&#8208;made enantiocomplementary carboligases allow for the stereodivergent synthesis of aliphatic &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes, which are useful precursors for pharmaceutically active analogues of the blockbuster drug, Pregabalin. Good isolated product yields and excellent enantiopurity (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.) were achieved.







Abstract
The blockbuster drug Pregabalin is widely prescribed for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Given the continuous epidemic growth of diabetes, the development of sustainable synthesis routes for Pregabalin and structurally related pharmaceutically active &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives is of high interest. Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes are versatile synthons for the production of GABA derivatives, which can be prepared through a Michael&#8208;type addition of acetaldehyde to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes. Here we report that tailored variants of the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) can accept diverse aliphatic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes as substrates for acetaldehyde addition. Highly enantioenriched aliphatic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes were obtained in good yields using two enantiocomplementary 4&#8208;OT variants. Our results underscore the synthetic potential of 4&#8208;OT for the preparation of structurally diverse synthons for bioactive analogues of Pregabalin.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Recognition&#8208;Initiated Exponential Amplification Reaction (PRIEAR) and Its Application in Clinical Diagnosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce DNA assembly is reported. This technology converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combines two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification. Diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations by using PRIEAR.







Abstract
Isothermal exponential amplification technology has rarely been fabricated as a universal sensing platform for the detection of proteins. To broaden their application, we have developed a strategy, named protein&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce DNA assembly, which converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combines two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification. Taking advantage of this principle, diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations in a homogenous manner, making PRIEAR suitable for clinical settings. Therefore, this strategy can expand the powerful isothermal exponential amplification technology to protein targets and thus provide a new toolbox in clinical and biomedical applications.

         <title>Rippled Sheets: The Early Polyglycine Days and Recent Developments in Nylons</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief historical account of rippled sheets is presented. The simplest rippled sheet is that of the achiral polyglycine I. It may also exist as a metastable structure of some nylons.







Abstract
The rippled sheet structure is a remarkable insight due to Pauling and Corey, that supplements the pleated sheet structure of homochiral proteins introduced in 1951. Whereas the pleated sheet was immediately adopted by the scientific community, the rippled sheet has remained more confidential since it applies only to blends of poly(L&#8208;peptides) and poly(D&#8208;peptides). The present account tells the intimate but patchy relationship developed by the author with the rippled sheet. In the 1970s, twenty years after Pauling and Corey's proposal, the rippled sheet was recognized as a valid model for the sheet structure of the achiral polyglycine, polyglycine I, which helped improve the structure of Bombyx mori silk fibroin. Very recently, pleated and rippled sheets were found to account for unsolved crystal structures of a variety of nylons. These structures help to explain a mysterious high temperature &#8220;Brill transition&#8221; first reported in nylon 6&#8211;6 by Brill in 1942.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic description of Pdx2 catalytic mechanism is provided by QM/MM methodologies. Pdx2, the glutaminase subunit of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) synthase, is characterized by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad used to deaminate glutamine to glutamate. While being absent in humans, Pdx2 is essential for the development and replication of the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogens, which are responsible for two deadly diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, respectively. Pdx2 is thus a promising drug target for fighting these diseases. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;F. Pina et&#8197;al.

         <title>Improving Structural Stability and Anticoagulant Activity of a Thrombin Binding Aptamer by Aromatic Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer (TBA) forms a chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex that shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with thrombin. Modification of TBA with aromatic chromophores is shown to improve the quadruplex stability and thrombin binding affinity. The best results were obtained for the addition of a single PDI unit, which increases the thermal stability (&#916;Tm=+18.2&#8201;&#176;C) and anticoagulant ability of the aptamer.







Abstract
The thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) is a 15&#8208;mer DNA oligonucleotide (5&#8242;&#8208;GGT TGG TGT GGT TGG&#8208;3&#8242;), that can form a stable intramolecular antiparallel chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex structure. This aptamer shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with one of the two anion binding sites of thrombin, namely the fibrinogen&#8208;recognition exosite. Here, we demonstrate that terminal modification of TBA with aromatic fragments such as coumarin, pyrene and perylene diimide (PDI), improves the G&#8208;quadruplex stability. The large aromatic surface of these dyes can &#960;&#8208;&#960; stack to the G&#8208;quadruplex or to each other, thereby stabilizing the aptamer. With respect to the original TBA, monoPDI&#8208;functionalized TBA exhibited the most remarkable improvement in melting temperature (&#916;Tm&#8776;+18&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed enhanced anticoagulant activity.

         <title>Oxidative Stress in Cancer Therapy: Friend or Enemy?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative stress and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells is described in this review, followed by discussion of the therapeutic strategies focused on ROS levels for cancer therapy. Clinically approved drugs with oxidative stress anticancer mechanisms of action are described and examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates with such mechanisms of action are highlighted.







Abstract
Excessive cellular oxidative stress is widely perceived as a key factor in pathophysiological conditions and cancer development. Healthy cells use several mechanisms to maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overall redox homeostasis to avoid damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Cancer cells, in contrast, exhibit elevated ROS levels and upregulated protective antioxidant pathways. Counterintuitively, such elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defence mechanisms in cancer cells provide a therapeutic opportunity for the development of drugs with different anticancer mechanisms of action (MoA). In this review, oxidative stress and the role of ROS in cells are described. The tumour&#8208;suppressive and tumour&#8208;promotive functions of ROS are discussed, and these two different therapeutic strategies (increasing or decreasing ROS to fight cancer) are compared. Clinically approved drugs with demonstrated oxidative stress anticancer MoAs are highlighted followed by description of examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates causing oxidative stress in cancer cells via novel MoAs.

         <title>Biocatalytic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Promising Materials for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous networks and attractive functions have been intelligently employed as supports to encase enzymes and protect them against harsh environments. More importantly, customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative guideline for constructing robust enzyme mimics. This review will introduce the concept of these biocatalytic MOFs, with special emphasis on how the biocatalytic processes operate in these materials can reverse the plight of native enzyme&#8208;based biosensing.

The highly efficient and specific catalysis of enzymes allows them to recognize a myriad of substrates, which enables biosensing. However, the fragility of natural enzymes severely restricts their practical applications.

         <title>A Peroxygenase&#8208;Alcohol Dehydrogenase Cascade Reaction to Transform Ethylbenzene Derivatives into Enantioenriched Phenylethanols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bienzymatic cascade to access complementary chiral phenylethanols from simple ethylbenzene derivatives is presented, combining peroxygenase&#8208;catalysed oxyfunctionalisation to the corresponding acetophenone with alcohol dehydrogenase&#8208;catalysed enantioselective reduction.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a new bienzymatic reaction to produce enantioenriched phenylethanols. In a first step, the recombinant, unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO) was used to oxidise ethylbenzene and its derivatives to the corresponding ketones (prochiral intermediates) followed by enantioselective reduction into the desired (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;phenylethanols using the (R)&#8208;selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH) or the (S)&#8208;selective ADH from Rhodococcus ruber (ADH&#8208;A). In a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade, 11 ethylbenzene derivatives were converted into the corresponding chiral alcohols at acceptable yields and often excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Serum Compatible Spermine&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids with Nonidentical Hydrocarbon Tails Mediate High Transfection Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with nonidentical hydrophobic chains showed excellent transfection efficiency under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions when compared with the commercially available transfection agent, Lipofectamine3000.







Abstract
Cationic lipids are widely used as nonviral synthetic vectors for gene delivery as a safer alternative to viral vectors. In this work, a library of L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with identical and nonidentical hydrophobic chains having variable carbon lengths (from C10 to C18) was designed and synthesized. These lipids were characterized and the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds were determined for DNA binding and transfection ability when formulated as cationic liposomes. The liposomes were then used successfully for the transfection of HEK293T, HeLa, PC3, H460, HepG2, SH&#8208;SY5Y and Calu&#8217;3&#8197;cell lines. The transfection efficiency of lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon chains was greater than the identical analogue. These reagents exhibited superior efficiency to the commercial reagent, Lipofectamine3000, under both serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions in HEK293T, HeLa and H460&#8197;cell lines. The lipids were not toxic to the tested cell line. The results suggest that L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon tails could serve as efficient and safe nonviral vector gene carriers in further in&#8197;vivo studies.

Readily available N6&#8208;(N&#8208;Boc&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;adenosines were used in Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to hydantoin&#8208;modified units. This convenient one&#8208;step procedure facilitates and extends access to the native ct6A and ms2ct6A tRNA nucleosides.







Abstract
A novel and efficient way for the synthesis of N6&#8208;hydantoin&#8208;modified adenosines, which utilizes readily available N6&#8208;(N&#8208;Boc&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;adenosine derivatives, was developed. The procedure is based on the epimerization&#8208;free, Tf2O&#8208;mediated conversion of the Boc group into an isocyanate moiety, followed by intramolecular cyclization. Using this method two recently discovered hydantoin modified tRNA adenosines, that is, cyclic N6&#8208;threonylcarbamoyl&#8208;adenosine (ct6A) and 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;threonylcarbamoyladenosine (ms2ct6A) were prepared in good yields.

         <title>Modern Strategies for the Diversification of the Supply of Natural Compounds: The Case of Alkaloid Painkillers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaloid pharmaceuticals supply&#8208;chain is highly dependent on opium poppy harvest. The biosynthesis of alkaloid painkillers encounters its first bottleneck in the enzymatic Pictet&#8208;Spengler stereoselective condensation of 4&#8208;HPAA and dopamine, to synthesize S&#8208;norcoclaurine. The enzyme mechanisms and possible methodology for the improvement of their efficiency are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived natural compounds have been used for treating diseases since prehistorical times. The supply of many plant&#8208;derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is primarily dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency adds an extra risk factor to ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Emerging technologies, such as biocatalysis, might help to solve this problem by diversifying the sources of supply of these compounds. Here we review the first committed step in the production of alkaloid painkillers, the production of S&#8208;norcoclaurine, and the enzymes involved. The improvement of these enzymes can be carried out experimentally by directed evolution and rational design strategies, supported by computational methods, to create variants that produce the S&#8208;norcoclaurine precursor for alkaloid painkillers in heterologous organisms, meeting the pharmaceutical industry standards and needs without depending on opium poppy crops.

         <title>Molecular Determinants of Carbocation Cyclisation in Bacterial Monoterpene Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active site residues in terpene synthases each have a unique and precise function in guiding the reactive carbocation intermediates to the final product. Here we used a combined experimental and computational approach to unravel the role of several active site residues in bacterial monoterpene synthases. These residues are often not conserved even in closely related enzymes demonstrating the importance of a tailored active site for each terpene product.







Abstract
Monoterpene synthases are often promiscuous enzymes, yielding product mixtures rather than pure compounds due to the nature of the branched reaction mechanism involving reactive carbocations. Two previously identified bacterial monoterpene synthases, a linalool synthase (bLinS) and a cineole synthase (bCinS), produce nearly pure linalool and cineole from geranyl diphosphate, respectively. We used a combined experimental and computational approach to identify critical residues involved in bacterial monoterpenoid synthesis. Phe77 is essential for bCinS activity, guiding the linear carbocation intermediate towards the formation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;terpinyl intermediate; removal of the aromatic ring results in variants that produce acyclic products only. Computational chemistry confirmed the importance of Phe77 in carbocation stabilisation. Phe74, Phe78 and Phe179 are involved in maintaining the active site shape in bCinS without a specific role for the aromatic ring. Phe295 in bLinS, and the equivalent Ala301 in bCinS, are essential for linalool and cineole formation, respectively. Where Phe295 places steric constraints on the carbocation intermediates, Ala301 is essential for bCinS initial cyclisation and activity. Our multidisciplinary approach gives unique insights into how carefully placed amino acid residues in the active site can direct carbocations down specific paths, by placing steric constraints or offering stabilisation via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Engineering the Ligand Specificity of the Human Galectin&#8208;1 by Incorporation of Tryptophan Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tryptophan analogues tailor lectin specificity: Atomic mutations introduced at the single tryptophan residue in the galectin&#8208;1 carbohydrate binding site reduce the affinity for selected, sulfated ligands without substantially affecting the interaction with other sugars. Molecular modeling traces this change in affinity back to altered solvation patterns, modulated CH&#8208;&#960; interactions, and electrostatic repulsion between the sulfated ligands and the introduced fluorine as well as nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Galectin&#8208;1 is a &#946;&#8208;galactoside&#8208;binding lectin with manifold biological functions. A single tryptophan residue (W68) in its carbohydrate binding site plays a major role in ligand binding and is highly conserved among galectins. To fine tune galectin&#8208;1 specificity, we introduced several non&#8208;canonical tryptophan analogues at this position of human galectin&#8208;1 and analyzed the resulting variants using glycan microarrays. Two variants containing 7&#8208;azatryptophan and 7&#8208;fluorotryptophan showed a reduced affinity for 3&#8217;&#8208;sulfated oligosaccharides. Their interaction with different ligands was further analyzed by fluorescence polarization competition assay. Using molecular modeling we provide structural clues that the change in affinities comes from modulated interactions and solvation patterns. Thus, we show that the introduction of subtle atomic mutations in the ligand binding site of galectin&#8208;1 is an attractive approach for fine&#8208;tuning its interactions with different ligands.

         <title>Controlling Protein Enrichment in Lipid Sponge Phase Droplets using SNAP&#8208;Tag Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step SNAP&#8208;tag bioconjugation strategy for controlling protein capture in lipid sponge phase droplets is described. The approach provides a stable covalent bond between the protein of interest and the lipid bilayer of sponge droplets, enabling protein sequestration even in the presence of the complex biochemical machinery required for cell&#8208;free protein expression.







Abstract
All cells use organized lipid compartments to facilitate specific biological functions. Membrane&#8208;bound organelles create defined spatial environments that favor unique chemical reactions while isolating incompatible biological processes. Despite the fundamental role of cellular organelles, there is a scarcity of methods for preparing functional artificial lipid&#8208;based compartments. Here, we demonstrate a robust bioconjugation system for sequestering proteins into zwitterionic lipid sponge phase droplets. Incorporation of benzylguanine (BG)&#8208;modified phospholipids that form stable covalent linkages with an O6&#8208;methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (SNAP&#8208;tag) fusion protein enables programmable control of protein capture. We show that this methodology can be used to anchor hydrophilic proteins at the lipid&#8208;aqueous interface, concentrating them within an accessible but protected chemical environment. SNAP&#8208;tag technology enables the integration of proteins that regulate complex biological functions in lipid sponge phase droplets, and should facilitate the development of advanced lipid&#8208;based artificial organelles.

         <title>Selection of M2+&#8208;Independent RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzymes with Side&#8208;Chains Mimicking Arginine and Lysine</title>

Take your chances: select the aces, lose the imidazole: Selection of self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates modified with ammonium and guanidinium cations in the absence of an imidazole&#8208;modified nucleoside yielded DNAzymes that are surprisingly M2+&#8208;independent despite the presence of Mg2+ during selection. This work tests the value of leaving out an imidazole and in favor of cationic amines and guanidines to discovery RNA cleaving DNAzymes.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of RNA by nucleic acid catalysts in the absence of a divalent metal cation (M2+) has remained an important goal in biomimicry with potential therapeutic applications. Given the lack of functional group diversity in canonical nucleotides, modified nucleotides with amino acid&#8208;like side chains were used to enhance self&#8208;cleavage rates at a single embedded ribonucleoside site. Previous works relied on three functional groups: an amine, a guanidine and an imidazole ensconced on three different nucleosides. However, to date, few studies have systematically addressed the necessity of all three modifications, as the value of any single modified nucleoside is contextualized at the outset of selection. Herein, we report on the use of only two modified dNTPs, excluding an imidazole, i.&#8201;e. 5&#8208;(3&#8208;guanidinoallyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;dUTP (dUgaTP) and 5&#8208;aminoallyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;dCTP (dCaaTP), to select in&#8208;vitro self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes that cleave in the absence of M2+ in a pH&#8208;independent fashion. Cleavage shows biphasic kinetics with rate constants that are significantly higher than in unmodified DNAzymes and compare favorably to certain DNAzymes involving an imidazole.

         <title>Quantitative Standards of 4&#8208;O&#8208;Acetyl&#8208; and 9&#8208;O&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylneuraminic Acid for the Analysis of Plasma and Serum</title>

         <dc:description>
Synthesised acetylated derivatives of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu4,5Ac2, alongside commercially available Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were utilised as standards for the quantitative analysis of these derivatives in plasma and serum samples. Multiple derivatives could be detected in one assay, which exhibited high specificity and low limits of detection and quantitation.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid, Neu5Ac) is one of a large, diverse family of nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharides that play roles in many biological functions such as immune response. Neu5Ac has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for the presence and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer. More recent research has highlighted acetylated sialic acid derivatives, specifically Neu5,9Ac2, as biomarkers for oral and breast cancers, but advances in analysis have been hampered due to a lack of commercially available quantitative standards. We report here the synthesis of 9&#8208;O&#8208; and 4&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu4,5Ac2) with optimisation of previously reported synthetic routes. Neu5,9Ac2 was synthesised in 1 step in 68&#8201;% yield. Neu4,5Ac2 was synthesised in 4 steps in 39&#8201;% overall yield. Synthesis was followed by analysis of these standards via quantitative NMR (qNMR) spectroscopy. Their utilisation for the identification and quantification of specific acetylated sialic acid derivatives in biological samples is also demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Disruption of Survivin's Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach Based on Guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole (GCP) ligands LNES and LHIS target key regions of the cancer relevant protein Survivin and are both capable of reducing cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Targeting specific protein binding sites to interfere with protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for the rational modulation of biologically relevant processes. Survivin, which is highly overexpressed in most cancer cells and considered to be a key player of carcinogenesis, features two functionally relevant binding sites. Here, we demonstrate selective disruption of the Survivin/Histone H3 or the Survivin/Crm1 interaction using a supramolecular approach. By rational design we identified two structurally related ligands (LNES and LHIS), capable of selectively inhibiting these PPIs, leading to a reduction in cancer cell proliferation.

         <title>Catalytic and Spectroscopic Properties of the Halotolerant Soluble Methane Monooxygenase Reductase from Methylomonas methanica MC09</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductase module of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylomonas methanica MC09 is catalytically active for NADH oxidation even at high salt concentrations. Spectroscopic analyses revealed one FeS cluster and FAD. During uncoupled turnover reactions, moderate levels of hydrogen peroxide were released. The characterization of this reductase is an important step for future biotechnological applications of a halotolerant sMMO.







Abstract
The soluble methane monooxygenase receives electrons from NADH via its reductase MmoC for oxidation of methane, which is itself an attractive C1 building block for a future bioeconomy. Herein, we present biochemical and spectroscopic insights into the reductase from the marine methanotroph Methylomonas methanica MC09. The presence of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and [2Fe2S] cluster as its prosthetic group were revealed by reconstitution experiments, iron determination and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. As a true halotolerant enzyme, MmoC still showed 50&#8201;% of its specific activity at 2&#8197;M NaCl. We show that MmoC produces only trace amounts of superoxide, but mainly hydrogen peroxide during uncoupled turnover reactions. The characterization of a highly active reductase is an important step for future biotechnological applications of a halotolerant sMMO.

         <title>Effect of Amino Acid Substitutions on 70S Ribosomal Binding, Cellular Uptake, and Antimicrobial Activity of Oncocin Onc112</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antibacterial activity of substituted oncocin Onc112 peptides varied widely among different bacterial species, which could be partially explained by ribosome binding and cellular uptake. Onc112 analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better suggesting a complex mode of action.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are promising candidates for the treatment of infections caused by high&#8208;priority human pathogens. Their mode of action consists of (I) passive diffusion across the outer membrane, (II) active transport through the inner membrane, and (III) inhibition of protein biosynthesis by blocking the exit tunnel of the 70S ribosome. We tested whether in vitro data on ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake could predict the antibacterial activity of PrAMPs against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake rates were measured for 47 derivatives of PrAMP Onc112 and compared to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each peptide. Ribosomal binding was evaluated for ribosome extracts from four Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Bacterial uptake was assessed by quantifying each peptide in the supernatants of bacterial cultures. Oncocin analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better than for Onc112. The data suggest a complex mode of action influenced by further factors improving or reducing the antibacterial activity, including diffusion through membranes, transport mechanism, secondary targets, off&#8208;target binding, intracellular distribution, and membrane effects.

     alt="Effect of Amino Acid Substitutions on 70S Ribosomal Binding, Cellular Uptake, and Antimicrobial Activity of Oncocin Onc112"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The antibacterial activity&lt;/b&gt; of substituted oncocin Onc112 peptides varied widely among different bacterial species, which could be partially explained by ribosome binding and cellular uptake. Onc112 analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better suggesting a complex mode of action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are promising candidates for the treatment of infections caused by high-priority human pathogens. Their mode of action consists of (I) passive diffusion across the outer membrane, (II) active transport through the inner membrane, and (III) inhibition of protein biosynthesis by blocking the exit tunnel of the 70S ribosome. We tested whether &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data on ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake could predict the antibacterial activity of PrAMPs against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake rates were measured for 47 derivatives of PrAMP Onc112 and compared to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each peptide. Ribosomal binding was evaluated for ribosome extracts from four Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial uptake was assessed by quantifying each peptide in the supernatants of bacterial cultures. Oncocin analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better than for Onc112. The data suggest a complex mode of action influenced by further factors improving or reducing the antibacterial activity, including diffusion through membranes, transport mechanism, secondary targets, off-target binding, intracellular distribution, and membrane effects. Relying only on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding and uptake data may not be sufficient for the rational development of more active analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Protein Manipulation Systems: From Function Regulation to Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami creates an ideal operation panel for positioning and manipulating individual proteins with nanoscale precision. This review provides an overview of the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems for protein function regulation and biological applications.







Abstract
Proteins directly participate in tremendous physiological processes and mediate a variety of cellular functions. However, precise manipulation of proteins with predefined relative position and stoichiometry for understanding protein&#8208;protein interactions and guiding cellular behaviors is still challenging. With superior programmability of DNA molecules, DNA origami technology is able to construct arbitrary nanostructures that can accurately control the arrangement of proteins with various functionalities to solve these problems. Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami&#8208;based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.

         <dc:description>
Rational engineering of the carbonyl reductase PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity toward the reduction of 3&#8208;cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile 1&#8201;a from 85&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%, as well as a 6&#8208;fold improvement in the specific activity. (S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;b) was prepared at 200&#8197;g/L (1.5&#8197;M) substrate concentration.







Abstract
(S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile is the key precursor for the synthesis of ruxolitinib. The bioreduction of 3&#8208;cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (1&#8201;a) offers an attractive method to access this important compound. A carbonyl reductase (PhADH) from Paraburkholderia hospita catalyzed the reduction of 1&#8201;a giving the (S)&#8208;alcohol (1&#8201;b) with 85&#8201;% ee. Rational engineering of PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity from 85&#8201;% to &gt;98&#8201;%, as well as a 6.3&#8208;fold improvement in the specific activity. The bioreduction of 1&#8201;a was performed at 200&#8197;g/L (1.5&#8197;M) substrate concentration, leading to isolation of (S)&#8208;1&#8201;b in 91&#8201;% yield. Similarly, using this mutant enzyme, 3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (2&#8201;a) and 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (3&#8201;a) were reduced at high concentration affording the corresponding alcohols in &gt;99&#8201;% ee, and 90&#8201;% and 92&#8201;% yield, respectively. The results showed that the variant H93C/A139L was a powerful biocatalyst for reduction of &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketonitriles.

         <title>Extension of the Terpene Chemical Space: the Very First Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to a unique biosynthetic scheme, the diversification of terpene structure could be envisioned through the structural modification of the two universal common terpene precursors IPP and DMAPP. This minireview covers the synthesis, the use as prenyl transferase substrates, and the synthetic application of IPP and DMAPP homologues developed for diversifying the terpene chemical space.







Abstract
The structural diversity of terpenes is particularly notable and many studies are carried out to increase it further. In the terpene biosynthetic pathway this diversity is accessible from only two common precursors, i.&#8201;e. isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Methods recently developed (e.&#8201;g. the Terpene Mini Path) have allowed DMAPP and IPP to be obtained from a two&#8208;step enzymatic conversion of industrially available isopentenol (IOH) and dimethylallyl alcohol (DMAOH) into their corresponding diphosphates. Easily available IOH and DMAOH analogues then offer quick access to modified terpenoids thus avoiding the tedious chemical synthesis of unnatural diphosphates. The aim of this minireview is to cover the literature devoted to the use of these analogues for widening the accessible terpene chemical space.

         <title>Bioinorganic Chemistry of Zinc in Relation to the Immune System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc's role in human immunity has been extensively covered from a biological perspective. The structural, thermodynamic, and inorganic chemistry of zinc in relation to proteins and pathways of the immune system has received less attention and is the topic of the present review.







Abstract
Zinc is well&#8208;known to have a central role in human inflammation and immunity and is itself an anti&#8208;inflammatory and antiviral agent. Despite its massively documented role in such processes, the underlying chemistry of zinc in relation to specific proteins and pathways of the immune system has not received much focus. This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc&#8208;based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hydrogel Nanoparticles: Synthetic Antibodies for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles have great potential as materials of the future in nanomedicine. We show that these synthetic antibodies can compete seriously with their biological counterparts for immunostaining of cell glycans and protein biomarkers, for targeted drug delivery, and as therapeutic agents for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) accounted for 10 million deaths in 2020. Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, etc.), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells. In this review, we describe an emerging class of targeting ligands, molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles for their application in the early detection of disease, with the aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) accounted for 10 million deaths in 2020. Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli-responsiveness, etc.), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells.

The three nitrogenase isoenzymes: The molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase, the vanadium (V) nitrogenase and the iron (Fe)&#8208;only nitrogenase, here depicted as superheroes, have a unique spectrum of activities for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The cover feature (created by Ehmad Chehrghani Bozcheloe) summarizes this minireview: the Mo nitrogenase has the highest activity for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), the V nitrogenase for the reduction of CO and the Fe&#8208;only nitrogenase for the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right tool can do the trick: A novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis was identified using the computer&#8208;assisted prediction tool Tome, and two variants with altered active sites were constructed based on homology models. All new enzyme variants showed significantly increased thermostability compared with the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens to date. The enzyme variants showed different substrate specificities and different activities in the presence of a range of co&#8208;solvents. The most stable variant was then immobilized and used for continuous production of enantiopure benzoin. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;S. Rabe et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. The results show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages. These results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia &#8211; the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens that rely on this mechanism to obtain PLP. For this reason, Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases. The results obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i)&#8197;activation of Cys87, (ii)&#8197;deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii)&#8197;hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv)&#8197;enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature (19.1&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) agree very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step (18.2&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;11), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site. This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)&#8197;it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)&#8197;the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii) Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process. Together, these results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.
